# Basic Configuration and Permissions

Welcome to the essential configuration guide for uBO Scope. This page walks you through the required permissions, initial setup, and verification steps necessary to ensure uBO Scope operates seamlessly. By understanding and verifying permissions, you enable the extension to accurately monitor network connections and provide transparent reporting.

---

## 1. Understanding uBO Scope Permissions

uBO Scope relies on specific browser permissions to capture network request outcomes effectively. These permissions must be granted for the extension to function as designed:

- **ActiveTab**: Allows the extension to access details about the active browser tab.
- **Storage**: Enables storing session data locally for tracking network events.
- **WebRequest**: Grants access to monitor and analyze network requests made by web pages.
- **Host Permissions**: Permits network monitoring on all HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket URLs.

### Permissions Defined in Browser Manifests

The following is a summary of the key permissions requested in uBO Scope's browser manifests:

| Permission     | Purpose                                |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| `activeTab`     | Access current tab info                |
| `storage`       | Save and load session and setup data  |
| `webRequest`    | Listen to network request events      |
| `host_permissions` | Monitor network requests across all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs |

> Note: These permissions are consistent across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari versions, with slight differences in host permission scopes reflecting browser support.

## 2. How to Verify Installed Permissions

After installing uBO Scope, confirm that the extension has the expected permissions enabled:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Browser's Extension Page">
Navigate to your browser's extensions management page:

- **Chrome**: `chrome://extensions/`
- **Firefox**: `about:addons`
- **Safari**: Safari menu > Preferences > Extensions
</Step>
<Step title="Locate uBO Scope">
Find uBO Scope in the list of installed extensions and click on it to view details.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Permissions">
Ensure the following permissions are listed and enabled:
- Access to active tab
- Access to storage
- WebRequest access
- Host permissions covering all URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`)

If permissions are missing or disabled, re-install the extension or adjust settings.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Insufficient permissions will prevent uBO Scope from capturing network requests accurately. The badge counts and popup data will be incomplete or incorrect.
</Warning>

## 3. Initial Configuration

uBO Scope requires no manual configuration beyond permission approvals. Once installed with the appropriate permissions, the extension automatically:

- Loads the browser's Public Suffix List to interpret domains correctly.
- Initializes session data to track active tabs and related network connections.
- Begins monitoring network requests immediately.

> The extension handles everything transparently with no additional setup needed.

## 4. Testing Permissions and Configuration

To confirm that uBO Scope is fully operational after installation and permissions verification, perform the following steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Web Page">
Browse to any website known to connect to external servers (e.g., a news site or popular service).
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Toolbar Badge">
Look at the uBO Scope extension icon in the toolbar:

- The badge number indicates the count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted.
- A non-zero count confirms active network monitoring.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup window.

- Review the listed domains under categories: "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked".
- Confirm that domains appear reflecting the page's network connections.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If no badge appears or the popup shows 'NO DATA', re-check permissions and try refreshing the page or restarting your browser.
</Tip>

## 5. Permissions Impact on Features

uBO Scope’s core features rely on having these permissions enabled:

| Feature                          | Required Permission(s)             |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Monitoring web requests          | `webRequest`, `host_permissions` |
| Showing active tab data          | `activeTab`                       |
| Saving session connection data  | `storage`                        |

Each permission acts as a gateway enabling detailed, real-time network insights.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Avoid disabling permissions after installation:** Doing so disrupts accurate data reporting.
- **Keep browser updated:** Minimum browser versions ensure proper API support (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- **Manage host permissions carefully:** For constrained environments, confirm that the extension has broad host permissions, which are crucial for comprehensive monitoring.

## 7. Summary

With successful permission verification and no manual configuration needed, uBO Scope activates automatically upon installation. It immediately starts reporting your browsing session's network footprint using granted permissions — an essential step to leveraging all value from the extension.
