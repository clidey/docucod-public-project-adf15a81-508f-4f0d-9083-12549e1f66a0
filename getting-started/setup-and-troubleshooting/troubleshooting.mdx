# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide addresses frequent setup problems encountered when installing and using uBO Scope. It offers practical, browser-specific solutions for installation hiccups, extension permission errors, badge or count inconsistencies, and missing data in the popup interface.

---

## 1. Installation Problems

If you experience issues installing uBO Scope, follow these steps:

### 1.1 Confirm Browser Compatibility

- **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave):** Must be version 122 or newer.
- **Firefox:** Must be version 128 or newer.
- **Safari:** Must be version 18.5 or newer.

Check your browser version via its "About" or "Settings" menu.

### 1.2 Installation Source

Always install uBO Scope from the official stores:

| Browser      | Installation Link                                             |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chrome       | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox      | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |
| Safari       | Available through the App Store or Apple Extensions Gallery  |

If offline or manual installation is needed, follow instructions in the [Installation on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari](/getting-started/essentials/installation) guide.

### 1.3 Verify Installation Success

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
- Click the icon to verify the popup loads without errors.
- The badge count should show either a number or be empty on a new tab.

If the icon is missing or grayed out:
- Restart your browser.
- Check browser extension management (`chrome://extensions`, `about:addons`, or Safari Extensions settings).
- Reinstall if needed.

<Tip>
Some browsers may disable extensions after updates or due to policy changes. Verify that uBO Scope is enabled and not blocked by enterprise settings or antivirus.
</Tip>

## 2. Permission and Access Issues

uBO Scope requires certain permissions to function correctly. Missing permissions lead to inaccurate data or no activity tracking.

### 2.1 Required Permissions

- **ActiveTab:** Allows the extension to access the currently active tab's details.
- **Storage:** Enables saving session data.
- **WebRequest & Host Permissions:** Essential for monitoring network requests to remote servers.

Permissions are requested automatically during installation.

### 2.2 Verify and Grant Permissions

- Go to your browser’s Extensions/Add-ons settings.
- Find uBO Scope and review the permissions section.
- Ensure the extension has access to the websites you browse—especially HTTP(s) and WebSocket URLs.

<Tip>
In some browsers, you may need to explicitly enable site access or toggle 'Allow access to file URLs' for advanced diagnostics.
</Tip>

### 2.3 Common Pitfall: Incognito/Private Mode

uBO Scope does not monitor network requests in private or incognito sessions by default. To enable:

- Enable uBO Scope permission for incognito mode in extension settings.

<Tip>
Enabling incognito permissions may have privacy implications. Use it only if necessary.
</Tip>

## 3. Badge Count and Popup Data Discrepancies

Users may notice inconsistencies between the toolbar badge count and data shown in the popup.

### 3.1 Understanding the Badge Count

The badge number represents the count of distinct third-party remote servers **allowed** (connections succeeded). Lower numbers are better, indicating fewer third-party connections.

### 3.2 Why the Popup May Show Different Data

- The popup categorizes domains into **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
- The badge only counts **allowed third parties**.
- Domains may appear in multiple categories based on connection outcomes.

### 3.3 What to Do If the Badge Is Stuck or Blank

- Reload the current tab.
- Open a new tab and load a page with known external connections.
- Restart the browser.
- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled and has necessary permissions.

### 3.4 Empty Popup or “NO DATA” Message

This typically means the extension has no network data for the active tab.

- Ensure you have active network connections on the tab (try visiting a well-known site).
- Verify permission settings.
- Refresh the tab to trigger new data collection.
- Check that no other content blockers or privacy settings prevent network requests reporting.

## 4. Browser-Specific Troubleshooting

Different browsers impose varying limitations that may affect uBO Scope behavior.

### 4.1 Chromium-Based Browsers

- **Service Worker Lifecycle:** The background service worker can be suspended.
  - Clicking the extension icon reloads the service worker.
  - If data seems missing, try to reload the tab or restart the browser.
- **Network Permissions:** Ensure host permissions include all URL schemes (http, https, ws, wss).

### 4.2 Firefox

- **Background Scripts:** Runs as background module scripts.
- **Network Monitoring:** Supports the webRequest API for HTTP and WebSocket.
- Enable uBO Scope permissions fully and restart Firefox after installation.

### 4.3 Safari

- **Minimum Version Requirement:** Safari 18.5+ is required.
- Extension runs in a background script module.
- Confirm that permissions are accepted during installation.
- Safari’s tighter security may prevent network request monitoring in some cases.

<Tip>
If on Safari you encounter issues, verify that system updates are applied and the extension is allowed in Safari > Preferences > Extensions.
</Tip>

## 5. Additional Troubleshooting Tips

- **Clear Extension Data:** Resetting storage may resolve stale data issues. (Note: No direct UI, removing and reinstalling can reset data.)
- **Disable Conflicting Extensions:** Other content blockers or privacy extensions might interfere. Test uBO Scope alone.
- **Check Developer Console:** Open the browser’s extension debugging console to monitor errors.
- **Reload or Restart:** Simple but effective for many transient issues.
