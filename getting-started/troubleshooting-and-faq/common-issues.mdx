# Troubleshooting Common Installation & Setup Issues

When installing and setting up uBO Scope, some users encounter common obstacles that can prevent the extension from functioning correctly or displaying data as expected. This guide addresses those issues with clear identification steps and actionable solutions to help you get up and running swiftly.

---

## 1. Permissions and Access Issues

### Symptoms
- The uBO Scope popup shows 'NO DATA' or remains blank.
- The badge count on the toolbar icon does not update or remains empty.
- The extension does not capture any network requests.

### Causes & Solutions
**Cause:** uBO Scope requires specific permissions to observe network connections. Insufficient permissions or denied access blocks its operation.

**Action Steps:**
1. **Verify Extension Permissions:**
   - Open your browser's extensions page:
     - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
     - Firefox: `about:addons`
     - Safari: Safari > Preferences > Extensions
   - Ensure uBO Scope has:
     - Permissions for `activeTab`, `webRequest`, and `storage`.
     - Host access granted for `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` URLs.
2. **Re-grant Permissions if Necessary:**
   - Click on the extension’s details.
   - Look for options such as “Allow access to file URLs” or “Allow on all sites” and enable them.
3. **Reload the Extension:**
   - Use the reload or toggle action to reset permissions.
4. **Restart Your Browser:**
   - Close and reopen your browser to ensure permission changes take effect.

<Tip>
If you recently updated your browser or installed content blockers, they may prompt permission changes or interfere with uBO Scope’s capabilities. Re-verify your extension permissions after such events.
</Tip>

## 2. Browser Compatibility and Version Requirements

### Symptoms
- Unable to find uBO Scope in the store or install it.
- Extension installs but does not run or crashes.

### Causes & Solutions
uBO Scope requires **minimum browser versions** to support the necessary APIs:

| Browser  | Minimum Version |
| -------- | --------------- |
| Chrome   | 122+            |
| Firefox  | 128+            |
| Safari   | 18.5+           |

**Action Steps:**
1. Check your browser version:
    - Chrome/Edge: `chrome://settings/help`
    - Firefox: `about:support`
    - Safari: Safari > About Safari
2. If your browser is older than the minimum version:
    - Update to the latest stable version.
3. Confirm installation from the official sources:
    - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
    - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
4. If using Safari, ensure you use the latest macOS supporting Safari 18.5 or above.

<Note>
Older browsers do not support the Manifest V3 and webRequest API functionality used by uBO Scope, so upgrading is mandatory.
</Note>

## 3. Popup Does Not Display or Updates Slowly

### Symptoms
- Clicking the uBO Scope icon does not open the popup or it opens but shows stale data.
- The displayed data updates infrequently or only after browser restart.

### Causes & Solutions
**Cause:** The extension's background service worker or scripts might have been suspended or not fully loaded.

**Action Steps:**
1. **Wait a Few Moments:** The extension processes network data asynchronously and updates every second.
2. **Reload the Extension:**
   - Use your browser's extensions page to reload uBO Scope.
3. **Open uBO Scope on Active Tab:**
   - Ensure you open the popup on a tab with active network activity.
   - The badge count reflects distinct remote servers seen for each tab.
4. **Check Console for Errors:**
   - Open the extensions debugging console for uBO Scope:
     - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/` > Toggle Developer Mode > Inspect views > background
     - Firefox: `about:debugging` > This Firefox > Inspect
   - Look for errors related to permissions or resource loading.
5. **Ensure Network Requests Are Supported:**
   - Some browser privacy settings or other blockers may limit network request visibility.

<Tip>
Avoid opening the popup immediately on a new tab or blank page; uBO Scope needs network requests to observe.
</Tip>

## 4. Missing Remote Connection Data

### Symptoms
- The extension badge remains empty though browsing external sites.
- No domains listed in the popup.

### Causes & Solutions
**Cause:** uBO Scope depends on the browser's `webRequest` API to log connections. Some network requests, such as WebSocket or requests from extensions, may not be reported.

**Action Steps:**
1. Confirm that you are browsing standard web pages (HTTP/HTTPS).
2. Disable or configure other content blockers that may stealth-block connections preventing uBO Scope from observing them.
3. Check if your browser or network environment has privacy settings that restrict network observation (e.g., strict tracking prevention).
4. Restart the browser if network requests seem completely missing.

<Warning>
Network activity outside the browser (e.g., native apps) is not visible to uBO Scope.
</Warning>

## 5. Popup Content and Badge Count Discrepancies

### Symptoms
- Badge count does not match number of domains shown in popup.
- Some domains appear under "stealth-blocked" or "blocked" unexpectedly.

### Explanation & Guidance
- The badge number shows distinct **allowed** remote server domains only.
- 'Stealth-blocked' and 'blocked' category domains are logged separately but are **not** counted in the badge.
- This reflects connections **actually made** and provides transparency beyond visible blocking results.

If the badge doesn't update as expected, see the previous sections regarding popup lag and permissions.

## 6. Popup Not Showing Despite Extension Being Installed

### Symptoms
- Extension icon appears but clicking it does nothing.
- Popup does not appear or is blank.

### Causes & Solutions
**Cause:** Browser popup HTML resource may fail to load or manifest configuration might be incomplete.

**Action Steps:**
1. Verify that the browser is not blocking extension popups due to security settings.
2. Ensure the extension is installed correctly:
   - Remove and reinstall uBO Scope from official sources.
3. Check for conflicts with other installed extensions that override browser UI.
4. For Safari:
   - Confirm your macOS version meets minimum requirements.
   - Check Safari Extension settings and permissions.

## 7. Best Practices to Avoid Issues

- Always keep your browser updated to the latest stable version.
- Install uBO Scope from official browser extension stores only.
- Regularly verify your extension permissions, especially after browser updates.
- Avoid running conflicting content blockers or restrictive privacy settings simultaneously without checking their impact on uBO Scope.
- Restart your browser occasionally to clear temporary glitches.
