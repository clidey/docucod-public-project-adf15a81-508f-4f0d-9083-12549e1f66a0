## 4. Troubleshooting Tips Before Seeking Help

Before contacting support or filing an issue, verify these common points to save time and effort:

- **Browser Compatibility:** Ensure your browser version meets the minimum requirements (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- **Extension Permissions:** Confirm that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions for `webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab` features.
- **Popup Functionality:** Try refreshing the browser or reinstalling the extension if the popup does not load or display data.
- **Badge Count Behavior:** Understand that the badge reflects distinct third-party servers connected; a zero or low count can be expected depending on browsing.

Refer to the Troubleshooting documentation for detailed guidance.
