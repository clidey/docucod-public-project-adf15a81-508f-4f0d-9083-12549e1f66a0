# Quick Validation: Is uBO Scope Working?

This guide helps you quickly verify that uBO Scope is properly installed and actively detecting third-party network connections made by your browser. By following a simple test browsing session and observing the extension’s popup and badge behavior, you ensure you’re ready to gain real-time insights into your browser's network activity.

---

## 1. Confirm Installation and Permissions

Before performing the verification, make sure:

- uBO Scope is installed on your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- The extension has permission to access web requests as prompted during installation.
- The toolbar icon for uBO Scope is visible.

If you haven't installed the extension yet, see the respective installation guides:

- [Installing on Chromium-based Browsers](../installation-and-setup/install-on-chromium)
- [Installing on Firefox](../installation-and-setup/install-on-firefox)
- [Installing on Safari](../installation-and-setup/install-on-safari)

## 2. Navigate to a Popular News Website

To trigger network activity for uBO Scope to detect, visit a well-known news site with multiple third-party connections (e.g., `https://www.nytimes.com` or `https://www.bbc.com`).

This real-world scenario exposes the browser’s network requests and allows the extension to report on the domains contacted during page load.

---

## 3. Observe the Toolbar Icon Badge

- Look at the uBO Scope toolbar icon while the page loads.
- The badge number updates dynamically, showing **the count of distinct third-party domains** your browser connected to during that session.

> ✅ **Tip:** A badge count greater than zero indicates the extension is actively monitoring connections.

> ❗ **Note:** A lower badge count generally means fewer third-party connections were made, which is commonly better for privacy.

---

## 4. Open the uBO Scope Popup

Click the uBO Scope icon to open its popup panel.

The popup provides a detailed summary of the network activity observed for the current tab:

- **Domains connected:** The total number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- Sections breaking down connections into:
  - **Not blocked (allowed)**
  - **Stealth-blocked** (i.e., connections redirected but not outright blocked)
  - **Blocked**

### What to Expect

- The popup displays a list of domains under each category.
- Domains are shown along with the number of network requests made to each.
- You should see multiple third-party domains appearing in the popup if the page has loaded resources from external servers.

> ✅ **Best Practice:** Review the popup details to understand which third parties your browser contacts, helping you audit privacy implications immediately.

---

## 5. Verify Behavior for Different Pages

Repeat the above browsing and inspection steps for:

- A simple website expected to have minimal or no third-party connections (e.g., a personal blog), which should show zero or very low badge count.
- A complex webpage with rich media and advertisements to observe higher badge counts and multiple categories.

This helps confirm the extension dynamically reports accurate connection activity per tab.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### The Badge Does Not Update or Remains Blank

- **Verify permissions:** Confirm the extension has the required webRequest permission.
- **Browser version:** Ensure your browser meets the minimum supported version.
- **Reload the tab:** Sometimes refreshing the page helps the extension detect live connections.
- **Conflict with other extensions:** Disable other content blockers momentarily to test if they interfere.

### No Domains Listed in Popup

- Confirm you are actively viewing a tab with network activity that triggers web requests.
- Wait a few seconds as some requests may occur after the initial page load.
- Check if the extension popup shows 'NO DATA' or is stuck loading and restart the browser if needed.

## 7. Understanding Successful Validation

You’ve successfully validated uBO Scope if:

- The toolbar badge updates with a positive count on active tabs.
- The popup correctly lists domains contacted categorized into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- Behavior changes correctly when switching tabs with different network profiles.

This confirms that uBO Scope is actively and correctly monitoring third-party connections in your browser environment.

## 8. Next Steps

- Familiarize yourself with [Navigating the uBO Scope Popup](../group-getting-started/page-navigating-popup-ui) to understand domain categorization and connection outcomes.
- Explore [Core Concepts & Terminology](../../overview/product-intro-and-basics/core-concepts-and-terminology) for deeper insight into connection classifications.
- For ongoing monitoring, check the real-time badge counts and popup while browsing different sites.
