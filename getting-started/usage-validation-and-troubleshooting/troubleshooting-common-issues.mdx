# Troubleshooting Installation & Setup

This guide addresses common problems you may encounter during the installation and initial setup of uBO Scope. It provides focused solutions and diagnostic checks for issues such as missing toolbar badge counts, the popup panel not displaying, and unexpected permissions requests. Follow these steps to quickly identify and resolve problems so you can start monitoring your browser’s network connections without delay.

---

## 1. Toolbar Badge Count Not Appearing or Always Empty

The toolbar badge count shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected during page loads. If you don’t see this number or it always remains empty, proceed with the following checks:

### Step 1: Confirm uBO Scope Is Properly Installed

- Verify that the extension appears in your browser’s extension manager.
- Make sure you have installed the correct version for your browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).

### Step 2: Confirm Browser Version Compatibility

- uBO Scope requires a minimum browser version; older browsers will prevent network monitoring.
- Check your browser's version and upgrade if below the required minimum.

### Step 3: Check Permissions Granted

- uBO Scope requires permissions to access webRequest and activeTab to monitor network requests.
- Go to the extension’s details page and verify permissions include:
  - Storage
  - WebRequest
  - ActiveTab
- On some browsers, permission prompts appear on first usage—ensure you accept them.

### Step 4: Look for Conflicting Extensions or Settings

- Other privacy or security extensions may affect webRequest API reporting.
- Disable other extensions temporarily to see if the badge appears.
- Some browser settings or group policies may restrict extension permissions—verify your browser settings.

### Step 5: Test with Regular Browsing

- Visit a popular, content-rich website (such as a news site).
- Observe the badge; it should dynamically update to show distinct third-party domains.

<Check>
If the badge remains empty after these steps, try restarting the browser or reinstalling uBO Scope.
</Check>

## 2. Popup Panel Fails to Display or Shows "NO DATA"

The popup panel provides details on connected domains categorized by outcome. If it won’t open or only shows "NO DATA", use these diagnostics:

### Step 1: Ensure You Click the Correct Toolbar Icon

- The popup is triggered by clicking the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
- If the icon is hidden, ensure it is pinned or visible.

### Step 2: Confirm Network Data Logging Has Started

- The popup displays data only after browsing activity is detected.
- Visit several websites to generate network requests.

### Step 3: Verify Extension State

- Reload the browser and try clicking the popup again.
- Check your browser extension page for any errors or warnings related to uBO Scope.

### Step 4: Check Console Logs for Errors

- Open the browser’s extension debugging console (browser developer tools for extensions) to look for runtime errors.
- Errors here can indicate permission issues, script failures, or conflicts.

### Step 5: Reload or Reinstall the Extension

- Reloading the extension might clear transient errors.
- As a last resort, uninstall and then reinstall uBO Scope.

<Warning>
The popup depends on background data stored during the browsing session. Opening the popup immediately after installation, before browsing, will show no data.
</Warning>

## 3. Unexpected Permissions Requests or Alerts

uBO Scope requires a limited set of permissions but might trigger alerts during installation or usage.

### Step 1: Understand Needed Permissions

- **webRequest**: Essential to monitor all HTTP/S and websocket connections.
- **storage**: Needed to save session data and settings.
- **activeTab**: Allows extension to interact with the current tab.

### Step 2: Verify Permissions in Manifest

On your browser’s extension details page, confirm the permissions match these exact ones:

```json
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*", "wss://*/*", "ws://*/*"]
}
```

### Step 3: Check if Other Extensions Increase Prompts

- Some browsers alert users more aggressively when multiple extensions request network access.
- Temporarily disable other extensions that use wide permissions.

### Step 4: Confirm No Conflicts with Browser Policies

- Organizational or managed devices may enforce policies restricting extension permissions.
- Check with your system administrator if you see unexpected warnings.

## 4. Diagnostic Commands and Manual Checks

If issues persist, try these manual checks:

### A. Confirm Browser Version

- In Chrome/Edge: `chrome://version/`
- In Firefox: `about:support`

### B. Check uBO Scope Version and Status

- Visit your browser’s extension page (e.g., chrome://extensions) and locate uBO Scope.
- Confirm version is 1.0.1 or later.

### C. Review Network Requests

- With developer tools open (F12), watch network tab while visiting sites.
- Confirm that sites do attempt external connections, indicating uBO Scope should detect requests.

## 5. When All Else Fails: Getting Help

- Include detailed descriptions of your environment: browser version, operating system, installed extensions, and steps to reproduce the issue.
- Refer to the [Quick Validation Guide](./quick-validation) for a simplified workflow to check extension operation.
