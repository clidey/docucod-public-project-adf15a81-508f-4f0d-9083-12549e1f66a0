# Validating Setup: Ensuring Accurate Measurement

Welcome to the crucial step of confirming that uBO Scope is properly measuring and displaying network connections on your browser. This guide walks you through a quick, real-world validation test by reloading a website and examining status indicators. Successful completion assures that uBO Scope is accurately collecting connection data, empowering you to confidently analyze and understand your browsing exposure.

---

## 1. Purpose of Validation

Validation ensures that uBO Scope is actively monitoring and categorizing all remote connection attempts made by your browser tabs. By verifying data collection and rendering accuracy, you prevent misinterpretation and gain trust in the extension's reliability for your privacy or research needs.

### What You Will Achieve

- Confirm that network requests are properly tracked per tab.
- See accurate counts of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Experience live updates represented in the popup UI and toolbar badge.

---

## 2. Preparing for Validation

Before testing, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Extension Installed and Enabled**: uBO Scope must be installed in your browser and have its permissions granted (refer to the [First Launch & Basic Configuration](https://your-docs-url/getting-started/setup-installation/first-run) guide).
- **Supported Browser**: Chromium, Firefox, or Safari are required (see [System Requirements](https://your-docs-url/getting-started/setup-installation/requirements)).
- **Network Connectivity**: Active internet access is needed for uBO Scope to monitor real-time traffic.
- **Access uBO Scope Popup**: You should be able to open the popup from the browser toolbar icon.

## 3. Validation Workflow: Reloading and Observing

Follow these actionable steps to validate uBO Scope:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Known Website">
Navigate to any website you frequently visit or a trusted site known to load multiple resources (e.g., https://example.com).
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click on the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser's toolbar to open the popup interface.
Make sure you see the popup window displaying domain data relevant to the current tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload the Website">
Reload the active tab (using your browser's refresh control or pressing F5).
This triggers new network connections that uBO Scope will capture.
</Step>
<Step title="Watch for Live Data Refresh">
Observe the popup UI as it updates:
- The header shows the current tab's hostname.
- The summary section updates with the count of connected domains.
- Outcome sections list domains grouped by **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
Look for meaningful counts and domain entries appearing promptly.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Toolbar Badge Count">
Look at the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar:
- The badge number should reflect the count of allowed connections for the tab.
- No badge or zero count means no connections recorded currently.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Connection Outcomes">
Review the popup categories:
- **not blocked**: connections permitted by the browser.
- **stealth-blocked**: connections redirected silently to enforce privacy.
- **blocked**: connections denied outright.
Verify if the data aligns with your expectations of the site's behavior.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Understanding Indicators and Success Criteria

### Popup Interface
- **Hostname Header**: Should update to show the domain of the active tab.
- **Domains Connected Count**: Numeric value indicating total connected domains.
- **Outcome Sections**: Each section populated as applicable; empty outcomes remain hidden.

### Toolbar Badge
- Reflects the number of allowed domains detected.
- Badge text updates with each reload or tab change.

### Successful Validation Means
- You see the popup data refresh dynamically after reloading.
- The counts and domain lists update as connections complete.
- The badge number matches the allowed domains count shown.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues During Validation">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Blank">
- Ensure the popup is opened _after_ the page has loaded or after reloading.
- Reload the tab and wait a few seconds for data to populate.
- Confirm that uBO Scope has permissions enabled.
- Check browser console for errors affecting extension operations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Does Not Update">
- Reload the tab and verify if connections occur.
- Ensure the browser version supports required webRequest APIs.
- Look for any content blockers that may interfere with data collection.
- Restart the browser to clear stale extension state.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Counts or Domain Lists Seem Inaccurate">
- Some sites may load resources from very few or no third parties; try another site.
- Verify network connectivity to ensure requests can proceed.
- Clear browsing data and reload.
- Confirm you are running the latest version of uBO Scope.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension Icon or Popup Missing">
- Verify the extension is installed properly.
- Check browser extension management page.

## 6. Next Steps After Validation

- If validation succeeds, start exploring detailed connection information and status outcomes to analyze third-party trackers or resource blocks.
- Refer to [Quick Walkthrough: Viewing Connections](https://your-docs-url/getting-started/getting-using/quick-usage) for deeper usage insights.
- Consult [Interpreting Toolbar Badge Counts and Metrics](https://your-docs-url/guides/getting-started-workflows/interpreting-badge-counts) to understand metrics in context.
- For any issues during usage, see [Troubleshooting Installation & Usage Issues](https://your-docs-url/getting-started/getting-using/troubleshooting).

---

## Additional Tips

- Reload tabs several times to see if measurements stabilize.
- Test with different websites, including those known for many third-party calls.
- Remember the browser's session management can affect real-time data.

<Note>
Reliable measurement validation is key to trusting uBO Scope's insights. Take time to observe consistent behavior before relying on data for privacy decisions or filter list tuning.
</Note>
