# Exploring the Popup Interface

Discover how to navigate and understand the uBO Scope popup interface, which provides a clear view into the network activity for the current browser tab. This guide walks you through the key elements you will encounter in the popup, including how the interface categorizes third-party domains as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked, and how to interpret the badge count on the browser toolbar.

---

## 1. Understanding the Popup Interface

When you click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar, the popup panel opens, displaying summarized information about the current tab's network connections.

### 1.1 Tab Hostname and Domain

- **Tabbed Hostname Display:** At the top of the popup, you'll see the hostname of the current tabâ€™s webpage.
- **Domain Portion Highlighted:** The interface visually separates the registered domain (root domain) portion from any subdomains.

### 1.2 Badge Count Meaning

- The badge count on the toolbar icon represents the **number of distinct third-party domains** for which there was a network connection (allowed).
- A **lower badge count** suggests fewer third-party connections, which typically enhances privacy.

<Tip>
The badge count only includes allowed third-party domains; it does not count blocked or stealth-blocked connections.
</Tip>

### 1.3 Categories of Domains in the Popup

The popup organizes third-party connections into three distinct sections:

| Section        | Description                                                                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**     | Domains to which connections were allowed, meaning the browser fetched resources successfully. |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains that were redirected or otherwise stealth-blocked, indicating attempts to mask blocking behavior. |
| **Blocked**         | Domains that were directly blocked, with network requests failing or denied.                   |

Each section lists the domains with associated counts indicating the number of network requests involving them.

## 2. Reading the Domains List

Each domain row in the categories provides:

- **Domain Name:** The public suffix domain part that identifies the third-party source.
- **Request Count Badge:** A badge showing how many network requests to that domain were recorded.

The lists are sorted for easy scanning.

## 3. User Flow: Exploring Connections on a Webpage

Follow these steps to get quick insights into third-party connections:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup interface.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the Current Tab Hostname">
At the top, verify the hostname listed matches the webpage you are currently browsing.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Badge Count">
Note the badge count on the extension icon. This number represents the distinct allowed third-party domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Scan Allowed Domains">
Look under the **not blocked** section to see third-party domains you are connecting to without restrictions.
</Step>
<Step title="Scan Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Review stealth-blocked domains to identify connections that were redirected or obscured.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Blocked Domains">
Check the blocked section to see which domains' connections were denied.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Hover over or click domains in the popup to understand request volumes and detect unexpected third-party connections.
</Tip>

## 4. Practical Examples

- Suppose the badge shows **3**, indicating three distinct allowed third-party domains.
- The popup lists:
  - **CDN domains** under "not blocked" such as `cdn.example.com` serving common assets.
  - Possibly a few stealth-blocked domains if redirect techniques were detected.
  - Blocked domains, which might indicate ad servers or trackers prevented from loading.

This breakdown helps you quickly spot unexpected or suspicious connections.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting & FAQs">
<Accordion title="Why is the badge count sometimes zero even though the page loads content?">
The badge count reflects distinct third-party domains allowed for the current tab, excluding first-party domains. Also, some network requests might be made outside the extension's monitoring scope due to browser limitations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What does 'stealth-blocked' actually mean?">
Stealth-blocked domains are those where network requests were redirected or masked to look successful while effectively blocking content, often to evade detection by webpages.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can legitimate third parties increase the badge count?">
Yes, content delivery networks (CDNs) and essential services are often counted but typically remain a low number, representing normal operations.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Additional Tips

- Regularly check the popup after visiting new or suspicious websites to monitor third-party activity.
- Use the badge count combined with domain details to assess your browsing privacy at a glance.
- Remember that a lower badge count generally indicates fewer third-party connections.
