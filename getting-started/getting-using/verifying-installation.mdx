# Validating Successful Installation

Confirming that uBO Scope is running properly immediately after installation is crucial to ensure you receive accurate insights about your browser's remote server connections. This guide walks you through simple, practical steps to verify the extension is active, interacting with network requests, and displaying initial results.

---

## 1. Verify Extension Presence

### Step 1: Check Toolbar Icon

- After installing uBO Scope from your browser's extension store or manual load, locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar. 
  - It appears as the uBO Scope logo provided in the extension's icon set.
  - If you don’t see the icon, confirm the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions or add-ons manager.

<Tip>
If the icon is missing, try restarting your browser. On some browsers, you may also need to pin the extension icon to the toolbar manually.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Confirm Permissions

- Ensure uBO Scope has the required permissions granted during installation:
  - ActiveTab: allows the extension to access the active browser tab.
  - Storage: enables saving session data.
  - WebRequest: allows monitoring of network requests.

- In your browser's extensions page, check that these permissions are granted under the extension details.

<Warning>
Without proper permissions, uBO Scope cannot monitor network connections effectively. If permissions were denied, consider reinstalling the extension and granting all requested permissions.
</Warning>

## 2. Observe Toolbar Badge Behavior

The toolbar badge number indicates how many distinct third-party remote domains have successfully connected on the active tab. A visible badge count signifies the extension is recording network requests.

### Step 1: Open Any Webpage

- Navigate to any typical webpage (for example, https://example.com).

- Observe the badge on the uBO Scope toolbar icon.

### Step 2: Interpret the Badge

- A numeric badge (e.g., '0', '1', '3') confirms uBO Scope is tracking connections.

- No badge or an empty badge means no connections detected yet.

<Note>
A lower badge count is generally better, indicating fewer distinct third-party connections. uBO Scope reports distinct third-party domains.
</Note>

<Warning>
If the badge never updates or remains blank despite browsing, verify that the extension is enabled and the browser supports the webRequest API with required permissions.
</Warning>

## 3. Open and Explore the Popup Interface

The popup interface provides detailed categorized reports covering allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked remote domains.

### Step 1: Open the Popup

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.

### Step 2: Review the Popup Content

- At the top, you should see the hostname of the current tab along with a summary count of connected domains.

- The popup displays three sections:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which network requests succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where redirects or stealth blocking occurred.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed or were blocked.

### Step 3: Validate Content Populates

- You should see domain names and occurrence counts under each category, reflecting network request outcomes for the active tab.

<Check>
If the popup shows “NO DATA” or no domains after loading a webpage, wait a few moments for data processing or refresh the active tab.
</Check>

## 4. Confirm Initial Network Request Logging

uBO Scope automatically tracks network requests after installation without additional setup.

### Step 1: Browse Regular Webpages

- Visit several different websites to generate network traffic.

- Observe the badge update and the popup detail refresh.

### Step 2: Look for Domain Diversity

- The badge count and popup domain lists should update dynamically reflecting distinct third-party connections.

- A single-domain page should show a low count; complex pages usually show several.

<Note>
uBO Scope differentiates main page domains from third-party domains and categorizes request outcomes for clear visibility.
</Note>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Verification Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Verification Issues">
<Accordion title="Toolbar Icon Missing or Inactive">
- Ensure the extension is enabled in the Extensions/Add-ons manager.
- Pin the extension icon explicitly if your browser hides inactive extensions.
- Restart the browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Badge Count Appears">
- Refresh the active tab to trigger network request logging.
- Verify permissions include `webRequest` and `activeTab`.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions that might block network events.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or NO DATA">
- Confirm you have an active tab with loaded network requests.
- Wait a moment, as data processing is batched.
- Reload the webpage and reopen the popup.
- Clear browser cache or try a different website.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Not Granted or Revoked">
- Remove and reinstall uBO Scope, carefully accepting permissions.
- Consult your browser’s recent updates or policy changes that may affect extension permissions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
