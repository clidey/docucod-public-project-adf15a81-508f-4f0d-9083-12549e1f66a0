# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

When starting with uBO Scope, some users may encounter setup challenges that prevent the extension from working as expected. This guide covers frequent first-use problems such as missing the toolbar icon, failure to display network requests, or using unsupported browser versions. By following these clear, practical solutions, you can quickly resolve blockers and get uBO Scope running smoothly.

---

## 1. Toolbar Icon Missing or Not Visible

The uBO Scope toolbar icon is your gateway to monitoring third-party connections. If you cannot see it, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Confirm Installation
- **Chrome/Chromium-based Browsers:** Go to `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`.
- **Firefox:** Navigate to `about:addons` and select Extensions.
- **Safari:** Open Safari’s Extensions preferences.

Verify uBO Scope is installed and enabled.

### Step 2: Pin the Icon (Chromium & Firefox)
Icons can be hidden by default. To pin:

- Click the puzzle-piece (Extensions) icon in the toolbar.
- Find uBO Scope in the list.
- Click the pin icon to make the toolbar icon permanently visible.

### Step 3: Check Browser Compatibility
uBO Scope requires a **supported browser version**:

| Browser      | Minimum Version          |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Chromium     | 122.0+                  |
| Firefox      | 128.0+                  |
| Safari       | 18.5+                   |

Older versions may not support the APIs uBO Scope needs.

### Step 4: Restart Browser
If the icon remains missing after pinning, restart your browser fully to reload extensions.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- If you installed uBO Scope manually, ensure the extension was loaded correctly without errors.
- Check your browser’s extension management page for any warnings or permissions issues.

<Warning>
If your browser does not meet the minimum version requirements, update it before continuing. Using unsupported versions can cause unpredictable failures.
</Warning>

## 2. uBO Scope Not Displaying Network Requests

After confirming the icon is visible and the popup panel opens, you might still see "NO DATA" or no network connections listed. This issue can stem from several causes.

### Step 1: Verify Permissions
uBO Scope needs specific permissions to observe network requests:

- Access to active tabs
- Storage permission
- The `webRequest` API permission

Check that this list of permissions is granted in your browser’s extension settings.

### Step 2: Confirm Host Permissions
uBO Scope must have host permissions for HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS protocols.

- In Chromium and Firefox, these are `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, and `wss://*/*`.
- Safari only supports `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` currently.

If host permissions are missing, uBO Scope cannot monitor network requests made on those sites.

### Step 3: Check for Conflicts with Other Extensions
While uBO Scope can coexist with other content blockers, some interference may occur with extensions that heavily modify or restrict `webRequest` usage. Temporarily disable other content blockers and see if data appears.

### Step 4: Open the Popup on an Active Tab
uBO Scope reports connections observed on the current active tab. Ensure you have loaded or reloaded a webpage with network activity before opening the popup panel.

### Step 5: Reload the Tab
If the data does not populate, refresh the webpage. uBO Scope updates its records based on network activity since the tab was opened or refreshed.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- If you see persistent "NO DATA," try restarting your browser or reinstalling the extension.
- Use your browser developer tools to check for extension errors or warnings that might indicate blocked scripts or permission issues.

## 3. Unsupported Browser Versions or Platforms

uBO Scope requires modern browser versions that implement the necessary WebExtensions APIs.

- Using versions lower than those specified can cause failures at install or runtime.
- Some API behavior differs between Chromium, Firefox, and Safari, so ensure you are running on a supported platform:

| Browser      | Minimum Version          | Notes                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Chromium     | 122.0+                  | Uses service_worker background scripts. |
| Firefox      | 128.0+                  | WebExtension APIs supported fully.      |
| Safari       | 18.5+                   | Extension must meet Safari’s strict policies.

Check your browser version:

- **Chromium-based:** `chrome://settings/help`
- **Firefox:** `about:support`
- **Safari:** Safari menu > About Safari

### Upgrade Instructions
If your version is outdated, update via your browser’s native update mechanism.
