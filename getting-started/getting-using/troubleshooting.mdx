# Troubleshooting Installation & Usage Issues

This page helps you quickly diagnose and resolve common problems that may arise during the installation or initial use of uBO Scope. Whether you cannot find the extension's icon, experience unexpected badge behavior, face browser permission prompts, or receive compatibility messages, the following step-by-step troubleshooting guide will help you regain full functionality.

---

## 1. Extension Icon Missing or Not Visible

If uBO Scope’s toolbar icon does not appear after installation, follow these checks:

1. **Verify Installation Success**
    - Confirm that uBO Scope is installed by visiting your browser’s extension management page.
    - In Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
    - In Firefox: `about:addons`
    - In Safari: Preferences > Extensions

2. **Check Toolbar Customization**
    - The icon may be hidden in the overflow menu or disabled.
    - Customize your toolbar to add the uBO Scope icon:
      - **Chrome/Chromium**: Right-click the toolbar, choose 'Customize toolbar', then drag uBO Scope to visible area.
      - **Firefox**: Open 'Customize Toolbar' and drag the icon out of overflow.
      - **Safari**: Enable uBO Scope in Extensions preferences and check if it appears.

3. **Restart Browser**
    - Sometimes a browser restart is required after installing new extensions.

4. **Confirm Minimum Browser Version Compatibility**
    - Check that your browser version meets the minimum required:
      - Chromium-based: version 122 or higher
      - Firefox: version 128 or higher
      - Safari: version 18.5 or higher

<Tip>
If you still can't find the icon after these steps, uninstall and reinstall uBO Scope from the official store to ensure a trusted, complete installation.
</Tip>

## 2. Browser Permission Prompts

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network connections.

Common permission prompts and resolutions:

- **Request for Active Tab Access**
  - Prompted to allow uBO Scope to access the current tab.
  - **Action:** Approve the permission to enable monitoring.

- **Web Request Permissions**
  - Permissions to observe network requests are required.
  - These are granted automatically on installation from the official store.
  - For manual installations, verify permissions manually in the extensions page.

- **Storage Access Permissions**
  - Used internally for storing session and suffix list data.
  - Usually granted by default.

<Warning>
Denying required permissions will prevent uBO Scope from operating correctly.
</Warning>

**If prompted repeatedly, check:**
- Your browser’s security settings or extension settings might block permissions.
- Conflicting extensions or privacy settings may interfere.

## 3. Toolbar Badge Displays Unexpected Counts

The badge on uBO Scope's toolbar icon shows the count of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to for the active tab.

### Possible Causes and Checks:

- **Higher than expected count:** Some webpages legitimately connect to multiple third-party servers (e.g., CDNs, analytics). This is normal.

- **Zero or no badge despite connections:**
  - Verify extension is active.
  - Reload the tab to allow fresh data collection.
  - Confirm that the extension has permission to access the active tab.

- **Count not updating:**
  - Try closing and reopening the tab.
  - Restart the browser.

- **Network requests outside browser webRequest API scope:**
  - Some non-browser-originated network use cases (e.g., WebRTC data channels, external apps) won't be tracked.

<Tip>
Use the popup UI (click the toolbar icon) to cross-check domain data per tab and verify badge content meanings.
</Tip>

## 4. Incompatibility or Error Messages During Installation or Use

uBO Scope requires modern browsers with specific minimum versions and permissions.

### How to Resolve:

- **Update browser** to the latest stable version to meet minimum requirements.

- **Check for browser restrictions:** Some corporate or private builds might restrict required APIs.

- **Use official stores:** Always install uBO Scope from the official browser extension stores to avoid issues.

- **Inspect browser console:** Open the browser developer console on the extensions page to spot errors related to uBO Scope.

## 5. Extension Not Capturing Network Connections

If uBO Scope appears installed but shows 'NO DATA' or does not report network connections:

1. **Reload the active tab:** Network monitoring starts fresh with tab reload.

2. **Verify extension active state:** It must not be disabled or suspended by the browser.

3. **Clear extension storage:**
   - Go to extension settings and clear cached session data if option available.
   - Alternatively, restart the browser.

4. **Confirm session data loaded:**
   - The extension uses a public suffix list and session storage internally.
   - Delays after restart are normal while loading this data.

5. **Confirm no restrictive content blockers or privacy settings prevent `webRequest` API access:**
   - Some security tools or profiles may disable webRequest API events.
