# Quick Walkthrough: Viewing Connections with uBO Scope

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with uBO Scope’s popup interface. This guide will walk you through opening the uBO Scope popup for your active browser tab and instantly viewing the privacy-relevant details of all domain connections made during page load. You’ll learn how to interpret each section, understand the badge indicators, and gain clarity on what constitutes a "connection" for accurate privacy assessment.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Extension Icon

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It usually appears near the address bar.
- The icon displays a badge number indicating the count of distinct third-party domains connected from the current active tab.

### Step 2: Click the Icon to Open the Popup

- Click the icon once to open the uBO Scope popup window.
- The popup automatically fetches and displays connection details related to the active tab.

<Check>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or is empty, try refreshing the active page and then re-opening the popup. This ensures connections are being monitored.
</Check>

## 2. Understanding the Popup UI

The uBO Scope popup breaks down all observed domain connections into three distinct categories, each with its own section:

### 2.1 The Tab Hostname Header

- At the top of the popup, you'll see the hostname of the current active tab.
- The hostname appears partly separated from its registered domain, clarifying subdomain structures.
- For example, for "news.example.com", "news." will be separated from "example.com".

### 2.2 Summary Section

- Displays the total number of unique domains contacted (allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked combined).
- This number reflects the diversity of remote domains your active tab attempted to connect to.

### 2.3 Outcomes Sections

These are three visually distinguished sections listing domains by their connection outcomes:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which network requests were successfully completed without interference.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were silently redirected or manipulated but not fully blocked.
- **Blocked:** Domains where network requests were explicitly blocked and failed.

Each domain entry includes:
- The domain name, shown in user-friendly Unicode format.
- A badge showing the number of connection attempts made to that domain.

<Info>
The exact counts represent network requests and may include attempts initiated by the main frame or subresources.
</Info>

## 3. What Counts as a Connection?

uBO Scope counts connections based on requests made to remote servers over HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and secure WebSocket protocols. The extension tracks outcomes as follows:

- **Allowed:** Requests completed successfully.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed due to content blocking or network errors.
- **Stealth:** Requests that were redirected or altered before completion, indicating stealth-blocking.

These are automatically collected by monitoring the browser’s network events for your active tab, including main page loads and all embedded resources.

---

## 4. Badge Indicators on the Extension Icon

- The badge displays the count of distinct third-party domains for which connections were **allowed** in the current tab.
- A higher badge count indicates more third-party servers were contacted.
- Privacy-conscious users typically prefer a lower badge count, implying fewer external connections.

<Note>
The badge count updates dynamically as you browse different tabs or reload pages.
</Note>

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Refresh your Page:** After installing uBO Scope, refresh your webpage to allow the extension to monitor new requests.
- **Use with Content Blockers:** uBO Scope works alongside your content blockers, showing actual connection outcomes regardless of blocking strategy.
- **Interpret Counts Accurately:** While the badge count is important, reviewing the popup’s domain lists gives deeper insight into where connections are allowed or blocked.
- **Stealth Blocking Insight:** Domains listed under stealth-blocked indicate possible invisible redirections, a subtle privacy risk.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Popup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Display Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup shows NO DATA or remains empty after opening">
- Ensure you have granted necessary permissions during installation.
- Refresh the active browser tab, then re-open the popup.
- Confirm that the extension icon badge count is not zero.
- Verify your browser supports the webRequest API accurately.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No badge count appearing on icon">
- Make sure the active tab is a regular web page (not internal browser pages).
- Refresh the page to trigger network monitoring.
- Restart your browser to reset extension background processes.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

- Explore the [Interpreting Toolbar Badge Counts and Metrics](../../../guides/getting-started-workflows/interpreting-badge-counts) guide to better understand badge meaning.
- Consult the [Core Concepts & Terminology](../../../overview/architecture-concepts/core-terminology) page for foundational knowledge.
- For installation issues or first-run questions, see [Installing uBO Scope](../../../getting-started/setup-installation/installing) and [First Launch & Basic Configuration](../../../getting-started/setup-installation/first-run).

## Appendix: Quick Example Walkthrough

1. Open your browser and navigate to your favorite website.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
3. Observe the badge on the icon showing a number like "5".
4. The popup lists domains allowed (e.g., cdn.examplecdn.com), stealth-blocked, and blocked.
5. The summary tells you how many distinct domains were contacted in total.
6. Use this information to judge the privacy footprint of the webpage you're visiting.
