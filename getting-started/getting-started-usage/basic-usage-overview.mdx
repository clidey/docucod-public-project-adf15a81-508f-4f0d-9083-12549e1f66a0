# Your First Time Using uBO Scope

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with uBO Scope! This guide leads you through opening the uBO Scope popup, interpreting its key information, and verifying that it is actively monitoring network connections for the current browser tab. By the end of this walkthrough, you'll confidently understand what the badge count means and how the popup's interface reflects real-time network activity.

---

## 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup

**Goal:** Access the extension's popup interface to view connection insights for the active browser tab.

### Steps:
1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
   - This looks like a small shield or the uBO logo, depending on your browser.
2. Click the icon to open the popup panel.

<Tip>
If you don't see the icon, ensure the extension is installed and enabled. You may need to pin it to the toolbar in your browser’s extensions menu.
</Tip>

## 2. Understand the Badge Count on the Toolbar Icon

**Goal:** Comprehend what the number on the toolbar icon represents and why it matters.

- The badge displays the **number of distinct third-party remote domains** your current tab has connected to without being blocked.
- A **lower badge count means fewer third-party connections**, which generally implies better privacy.
- The count updates dynamically as network requests happen on the page.

<Note>
The badge does *not* count blocked connections, stealth blocks, or request errors — it shows only successfully connected unique domains.
</Note>

## 3. Explore the Popup Interface Layout

**Goal:** Familiarize yourself with each section in the popup and what information it conveys.

### Popup Breakdown:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Hostname Header** | Shows the domain of the active tab in full Punycode-decoded format, with subdomain highlighted if present. |
| **Domains Connected: Summary** | Displays the total count of distinct third-party domains connected during the tab session. |
| **Not Blocked** | Lists domains successfully contacted (allowed connections). |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Shows domains where requests were indirectly or quietly blocked (e.g., redirected). |
| **Blocked** | Lists domains where requests explicitly failed or were blocked by the browser or extensions. |

### Visual Example:
```html
<h2 id="tabHostname"><span></span><span>NO DATA</span></h2>
<section id="summary">
  domains connected: <span>?</span>
</section>
<section class="outcome allowed">
  <h3>not blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
<section class="outcome stealth">
  <h3>stealth-blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
<section class="outcome blocked">
  <h3>blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
```

## 4. Verify Active Monitoring on an Opened Page

**Goal:** Confirm uBO Scope is collecting and displaying network data accurately for your current tab.

### Steps:
1. With the popup open, navigate to a website with typical third-party content (e.g., news site, social media).
2. Watch the badge count increase as the page loads resources.
3. Inspect each section in the popup:
   - Verify that the **Not Blocked** list contains domains you expect (CDNs, analytics, ads, etc.).
   - Check if there are any entries under **Stealth-Blocked** or **Blocked**, which indicate blocked or redirected requests.

### Expected Outcome:
- The badge count should be a non-empty number reflecting distinct contacted domains.
- The popup should show meaningful domain names and counts.

<Tip>
If the counts remain empty or show "NO DATA," refresh the tab or try another webpage to allow the extension to detect network activity.
</Tip>

<Callout>
If your browser blocks or restricts permissions for the extension, you may need to review permissions or reinstall. See the [First Launch & Permission Setup](getting-started/installation-and-setup/first-launch-and-permissions) guide for assistance.
</Callout>

## 5. Practical Tips for Your First Use

- **Focus on unique third-party connections:** These represent your true exposure to external servers.
- **Use the badge and popup together:** Quickly assess privacy exposure and drill down into details.
- **Remember stealth-blocked domains:** They may not appear in all blockers but represent subtly prevented connections.
- **Refresh the page or navigate to new tabs:** To observe fresh network activity and validate uBO Scope performance.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common First-Use Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting First-Time Usage">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA or Empty Lists">
Ensure the extension has all necessary permissions and is enabled.
Try refreshing the active tab to trigger new network requests.
Verify you are on a webpage that actually makes network requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
Check that the browser supports the required APIs and your uBO Scope version meets minimum requirements.
Restart the browser and try again.
Ensure the extension is not being blocked or disabled by other software.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains Not Matching Expectations">
Some domains may appear in Punycode; uBO Scope converts them back for readability.
Third-party requests can include CDNs, analytics, or widgets you might have overlooked.
Review your content blocker settings as they affect what is blocked or allowed.
</Accordion>
