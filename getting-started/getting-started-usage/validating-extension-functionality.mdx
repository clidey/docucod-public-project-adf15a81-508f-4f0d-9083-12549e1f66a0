# Validating Extension Functionality

Quickly verify that uBO Scope is accurately tracking and counting third-party network requests in real time. This guide provides actionable methods and test scenarios to confirm the extension is properly monitoring network activity and reporting data through its badge and popup interface.

---

## 1. Why Validate uBO Scope's Functionality?

Before relying on uBO Scope’s insights about your browser's network connections, you need to confirm that it is correctly capturing and categorizing requests. Validation ensures:

- Network requests from third-party domains are detected.
- Outcomes (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked) are correctly counted.
- The toolbar badge and popup data reflect these outcomes instantly.

Successful validation builds confidence in the extension’s reporting accuracy on your system.

---

## 2. Prerequisites & Preparation

Ensure you have the following before proceeding:

- **uBO Scope installed and active** on your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). See [Install uBO Scope on Your Browser](../installation-and-setup/browser-installation).
- Browser **version meets minimum requirements** (e.g., Chrome >= 122). See [System Requirements](../installation-and-setup/system-requirements).
- Extension **permissions granted** for `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`. Refer to [First Launch & Permission Setup](../installation-and-setup/first-launch-and-permissions).
- The uBO Scope **toolbar icon visible** in your browser interface.

<Tip>
If the extension icon or popup data do not appear as expected, confirm permissions and installation steps first. See [Troubleshooting Installation](../installation-and-setup/troubleshooting-installation).
</Tip>

## 3. Validating Through Real-Time Monitoring

Validation centers on verifying that actual network traffic is correctly captured and displayed. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup for the Active Tab

1. Navigate to any website in your browser (try a popular site with known third-party content, e.g., https://www.nytimes.com).
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
3. Verify that the popup displays the current tab's domain and lists of domains under the categories:
   - **Not Blocked** (allowed connections)
   - **Stealth-Blocked**
   - **Blocked**
4. Confirm the summary count reflects the number of distinct third-party domains connected.

### Step 2: Perform Network Activity by Navigation or Interaction

- Reload the page or navigate to a different site with distinct network connections.
- Observe the badge count on the extension icon update to reflect new third-party connections.
- Re-open the popup and verify the domain lists refresh accordingly.

### Step 3: Use Known Test Sites to Confirm Network Outcomes

While uBO Scope monitors all network requests, using test webpages known for triggering multiple third-party connections is helpful.

Some suggestions:

- [https://webbkoll.dataskydd.net/en/](https://webbkoll.dataskydd.net/en/) — analyzes tracking and third-party connections.
- E-commerce or news sites with ad networks and CDN resources.

Watch for the badge count and popup domain lists to dynamically reflect these connections.

<Tip>
Wait a few seconds after reloads or navigation, as uBO Scope batches network events and updates asynchronously (within about one second) to ensure performance.
</Tip>

## 4. Understanding What You're Seeing

The popup categorizes domains contacted by the page:

- **Not Blocked:** Third-party servers allowed and successfully connected.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests redirected or silently filtered to avoid detection.
- **Blocked:** Requests actively blocked (requests failed or error events).

The badge count shows the total number of unique allowed third-party domains on the active tab.

**Key Points:**
- A lower badge count usually reflects better privacy protection by limiting third-party connections.
- The popup provides detailed counts and breakdowns to help you assess your browser’s network exposure.

## 5. Troubleshooting Validation Issues

If your validation attempts don’t yield expected results, here are common issues and fixes:

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="No Data Appears in Popup or Badge Is Blank">
- Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions manager.
- Confirm permissions for `webRequest` and `storage` were granted during installation.
- Reload the browser or restart it, then retry.
- Try visiting a site known for third-party connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update After Navigation">
- Wait a few seconds; requests are processed in batches.
- Verify you are actively on the tab where you expect monitoring.
- Close and re-open the popup to force refresh.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows Only the Main Domain, No Third-Party Domains">
- Try visiting sites with richer content and more third-party requests.
- Check browser compatibility; ensure the version supports `webRequest` events fully.
- Reload the extension or browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Requests Are Missing or Under-Counted">
- Note that requests outside the browser's `webRequest` API scope cannot be monitored (e.g., DNS-level blocks).
- Verify your installed content blockers do not interfere with extension messaging.
- Confirm no conflicting extensions block `webRequest` events before uBO Scope.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Practical Test Workflow Example

Try this scenario for a quick validation:

1. Open your browser and navigate to https://www.cnn.com
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon.
3. Note the badge count and allowed domains in the popup.
4. Reload the page and observe badge updates reflecting ongoing network connections.
5. Open the popup to review detailed domain counts and categories.

If the counts and domain lists update as expected, your installation is functioning.

## 7. Next Steps After Validation

Once validated, you can confidently use uBO Scope to:

- Monitor and analyze third-party connections on sites you visit.
- Assess filter lists or content blockers by comparing allowed and blocked domain counts.
- Incorporate findings into your privacy or filter list maintenance workflow.
