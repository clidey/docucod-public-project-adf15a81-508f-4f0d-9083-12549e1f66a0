# Understanding the Badge Count

## Introduction

The toolbar badge in uBO Scope provides a concise, powerful insight into your browser's network activity on a per-tab basis. It shows the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** that the active webpage has connected to during the current browsing session. Understanding how to interpret this badge count correctly is vital to making informed privacy assessments and debunking common misconceptions about content blockers and network requests.

---

## What the Badge Count Represents

- **Count meaning:** The badge displays the distinct count of third-party remote servers contacted by the current tab.
- **Third-party definition:** These are servers that do not belong to the same domain as the webpage you visit (i.e., domains other than the first party).
- **Lower counts are better:** A lower number indicates fewer distinct external servers contacted, improving your privacy by reducing exposure.

### Key Points

- The badge does **not** count total network requests, but unique domains.
- It only includes third-party connections, so same-domain resources do not increase the badge.
- The count updates dynamically as your browser loads or blocks connections.

<Tip>
Do not confuse the badge count with the number of blocked requests — the badge counts unique servers _allowed_ or _attempted to connect_.
</Tip>

## Why Lower Numbers Are Desirable

Each distinct third-party connection can potentially expose your browsing behavior or data to external services. For example:

- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are typically essential and legitimate.
- Numerous distinct connections often indicate tracking, advertising, or unnecessary data leakage.

A concise badge count helps reveal overreaching third-party networks that your browser loads silently.

<Note>
Keep in mind that some content blockers may have a higher block count but still allow more distinct third-party connections, making the badge count a more reliable privacy indicator.
</Note>

## Interpreting the Badge in Different Browsing Contexts

### 1. Simple Websites

- Expect the badge to show a low number, typically 1 or 2, usually CDNs or analytics providers.
- A sudden rise in badge count may indicate embedded ads, trackers, or social media widgets.

### 2. Content-Rich Websites

- High badge counts are common when multiple third-party services deliver resources.
- Use the popup panel to inspect the domains and investigate unexpected connections.

### 3. Stealth or Blocked Connections

- Some connections might be stealth-blocked or blocked; these do not increase the badge count.
- The badge only counts distinct third-party domains that made **any** connection attempt.

---

## Common Misconceptions Clarified

### Misconception: "Higher block counts mean better privacy"

- Block counts reflect the total number of blocked requests, many of which may be redundant or to the same domain.
- A higher block count can paradoxically mean the blocker allows connections to more distinct third-party servers.
- The badge count reveals the true network exposure in terms of unique external endpoints.

### Misconception: "Ad blocker test sites provide reliable results"

- These test sites generate artificial requests that do not reflect real-world browsing.
- Many content blockers operate stealthily and cannot be fairly evaluated by such tests.

<u>uBO Scope helps debunk these myths by directly showing what your browser is connecting to in practice.</u>

## How the Badge Count Works Under the Hood (Conceptual Overview)

1. uBO Scope listens to network requests via the browser’s `webRequest` API.
2. It detects the hostname of each remote server involved.
3. It filters out first-party hosts related to the active tab.
4. It maintains a set of distinct third-party domains contacted.
5. The badge text updates with the size of this set.

This real-time tracking ensures the badge reflects what actually happens during page loads, regardless of other content blockers or DNS-level blocking.

---

## Practical Tips for Using the Badge Effectively

- Use the badge as a quick privacy snapshot for each tab.
- When you see unexpectedly high numbers, open the popup panel for detailed domain breakdown.
- Consider whether all third-party domains are necessary for your browsing experience.
- Use this information to fine-tune your content blockers or privacy settings.

<Tip>
Remember, not all third-party domains are bad; some provide legitimate services like fonts, images, or APIs.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Badge Count Discrepancies

If the badge count seems incorrect or does not update:

1. **Verify permissions:** Ensure uBO Scope has the required permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).
2. **Confirm extension is active:** Check that the extension icon is visible and the popup loads data.
3. **Reload the tab:** Sometimes the count resets or updates after a tab refresh.
4. **Browser support:** The badge depends on the `webRequest` API; some browsers or versions may limit coverage.
5. **Conflicts:** Other extensions or security software might interfere with network requests.

For persistent issues, consult the troubleshooting guides or re-install the extension.

## Summary

The uBO Scope toolbar badge is a reliable metric that distills your browser’s exposure to distinct third-party servers per tab. Lower badge counts mean fewer unique external connections, which supports stronger privacy. Using the badge count alongside the popup details arms you with actionable insights for better browsing control.
