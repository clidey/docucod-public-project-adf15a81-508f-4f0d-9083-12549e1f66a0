# Validating Extension Activity

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with **uBO Scope**! This guide walks you through how to confirm that the extension is working properly by performing simple connectivity tests. You'll learn to interpret the toolbar badge count and explore the popup interface to see a detailed report of network connections your browser makes while browsing.

---

## 1. Understanding What You’re Checking

Before diving into tests, it's important to grasp what uBO Scope reports:

- **Badge Count**: Shown on the browser toolbar icon, this number represents how many distinct third-party remote servers were connected to by the current tab's web page. A lower number means fewer third-party connections — a signal of good privacy hygiene.

- **Popup Interface**: This UI opens by clicking the toolbar icon and displays detailed connection info, categorizing connections into:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Connections the browser allowed.
  - **Stealth Blocked**: Connections intercepted silently (e.g., via stealth techniques).
  - **Blocked**: Connections explicitly blocked by other blockers or network errors.

Your goal is to confirm that these components are functioning and reporting realistically.

## 2. Step-by-Step Validation

### Step 1: Open a Web Page

- Open a website you frequently visit or a well-known site like https://example.com in a new browser tab.

### Step 2: Observe the Toolbar Badge

- Look at the uBO Scope icon on your browser's toolbar.
- The badge number shows how many **distinct third-party domains** were connected during the page load.
- If it shows zero or a low number, this likely means your page has limited third-party connections, which is expected for simple sites.

### Step 3: Open the Popup Interface

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
- You will see:
  - The hostname of the tab's main frame (top-level domain)
  - A summary of `domains connected`
  - Sections categorizing connections into **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

### Step 4: Review Domains and Counts

- Within each category, observe the list of domains and the count of their requests.
- Domains in **Not Blocked** means requests succeeded.
- **Stealth Blocked** domains are connections that were silently redirected or intercepted.
- **Blocked** domains are requests that failed or were explicitly blocked.

### Step 5: Interpret the Data

- Real-world browsing typically shows a handful of third-party connections (e.g., CDN domains like `cdn.example.com`).
- If the badge count increases realistically after loading complex pages (news sites, social media), that confirms proper tracking.
- Seeing domains consistently appear in the **not blocked** list means the extension is capturing connection data properly.

## 3. Practical Tips

- **Reload the page** and watch the badge count update — it should reflect new or repeated network connections.
- Try visiting a well-known site with ads and trackers, and observe if the badge count is higher — this means the extension is detecting multiple third parties.
- Use private/incognito mode to compare counts, noting persistence differences.
- If you use other content blockers, cross-check blocked connection counts with what uBO Scope reports for a fuller picture.

## 4. Common Pitfalls and What to Avoid

- **Expecting zero badge count on complex sites**: Legitimate third-party services (content delivery networks, fonts, analytics) often cause multiple connections.
- **Relying on adblocker block counts alone**: uBO Scope focuses on distinct third-party domains, which is a stronger privacy metric.
- **Using 'ad-blocker test' webpages**: These produce artificial network requests and do not reflect real-world behavior.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Quick Checks

If you suspect uBO Scope is not working correctly:

- Confirm the extension is installed and enabled in your browser.
- Verify you have granted necessary permissions (`webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab`).
- Check that the toolbar icon badge appears and updates when you navigate pages.
- Open the popup on several different sites to verify it displays connection data.
- Disable other extensions temporarily to check for conflicts.

## 6. What Comes Next?

Once you have validated your extension is active and tracking connections:

- Explore **Monitoring Network Connections** for tracking detailed request attributes.
- Read **Interpreting Domain Data and Counts** to contextualize connection data.
- Dive into **Validating Content Blocker Effectiveness** to compare behaviors.

Keep your browser and uBO Scope extension updated for the latest compatibility and features.

<Check>
Make sure you are viewing the active browser tab corresponding to the uBO Scope badge count.
</Check>

<Info>
If you see unexpected zero counts or no connection details in the popup, try reloading the tab and ensure the extension isn’t blocked by browser settings or privacy restrictions.
</Info>

<Warning>
Do not rely on synthetic ad-block tests to validate the extension’s effectiveness; use real browsing scenarios instead.
</Warning>
