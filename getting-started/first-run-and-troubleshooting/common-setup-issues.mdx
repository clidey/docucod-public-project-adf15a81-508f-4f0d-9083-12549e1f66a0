# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide addresses the most frequent problems users encounter when installing or using uBO Scope for the first time. By following the practical steps and tips below, you will ensure a smooth onboarding experience and get the most out of the extension.

---

## 1. Missing Permissions

### Symptoms
- The extension’s badge does not update after browsing.
- No data appears in the popup interface.
- Errors indicating denied permissions in browser console or extension page.

### Causes & Solutions
- **uBO Scope requires the following permissions:**
  - `<code>activeTab</code>` — Needed to access the active browser tab and gather data.
  - `<code>storage</code>` — Enables saving session data and preferences.
  - `<code>webRequest</code>` — Required to monitor network requests for connection reporting.

- **How to Fix:**
  1. Verify that you granted these permissions during installation.
  2. For manual installs or developer mode, ensure the manifest includes these permissions.
  3. Some browsers require the extension to be reloaded after permission changes; try restarting the browser.
  4. Check your browser’s extension settings to confirm permissions are active.

<Tip>
If any permissions are missing or revoked, uBO Scope cannot correctly monitor your network connections. Always approve requested permissions for full functionality.
</Tip>

## 2. Unsupported Browser or Version

### Symptoms
- Extension fails to install or enable.
- Error messages about compatibility.
- No badge or popup activation.

### Supported Browsers & Version Requirements
- **Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge):** Minimum version 122.0
- **Firefox:** Minimum version 128.0
- **Safari:** Minimum version 18.5

All browsers must support Manifest Version 3 extensions.

### How to Verify & Resolve
1. Check your browser version in the "About" section.
2. Update your browser to meet or exceed the minimum version.
3. Ensure your browser supports Manifest V3; older versions do not.

<Warning>
Using unsupported browsers or versions will prevent uBO Scope from installing or functioning properly.
</Warning>

## 3. Unexpected Extension Behavior

### Issue: Badge Count Does Not Update
- The badge icon on the toolbar remains blank or stuck.

**Steps to Troubleshoot:**
1. Confirm you are actively on a webpage that makes network connections.
2. Reload the tab to trigger fresh data collection.
3. Open the popup interface and verify if domains are listed.
4. Restart your browser and try again.

### Issue: Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Remains Empty
- Indicates inability to fetch or render connection data.

**Steps to Troubleshoot:**
1. Ensure the tab is active and fully loaded.
2. Disable other content blockers or privacy tools temporarily to rule out conflicts.
3. Verify that the extension is enabled and has required permissions.
4. Try on different websites known to have network activity.

<Tip>
The extension depends on the browser’s <code>webRequest</code> API. Some privacy modes or browser configurations may restrict this API and reduce uBO Scope’s visibility.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Conflicts with Other Extensions or Settings

### Symptoms
- uBO Scope fails intermittently.
- Data does not reflect expected network requests.

### Recommendations
- Temporarily disable other browser extensions, especially other content blockers or privacy tools, to check for conflicts.
- Verify browser settings related to privacy and security do not block extension APIs.

---

## 5. Cache or Data Persistence Issues

### Symptoms
- Extension data does not refresh after navigation.
- Previous session data seems stuck or incorrect.

### Steps to Resolve
1. Clear browser cache and extension data through browser settings.
2. Restart the browser.
3. uBO Scope automatically manages session data but may retain stale data if browser storage is corrupted.

---

## 6. Extension Not Visible After Installation

### Causes
- The extension icon is hidden in the toolbar.
- The extension failed to install or enable.

### How to Fix
1. Check the browser’s extensions page to confirm installation and enable the extension.
2. Pin the extension icon to the toolbar if it is hidden.
3. Restart the browser to complete the installation process.

---

## 7. Browser-Specific Considerations

### Safari
- Minimum version 18.5 required.
- Safari’s stricter security model may require explicit permission confirmation.

### Firefox
- Minimum version 128.0.
- Extension ID is fixed to “uBO-Scope@raymondhill.net”.

### Chromium
- Minimum version 122.0.
- Ensure <code>webRequest</code> API permission is granted.

<Tip>
Consult the Supported Browsers & Integration Points page for detailed platform-specific instructions and requirements.
