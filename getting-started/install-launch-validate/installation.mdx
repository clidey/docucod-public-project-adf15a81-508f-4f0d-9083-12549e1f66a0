## Installing uBO Scope via Official Browser Stores

2. Click **Add to Chrome**.
3. Confirm by clicking **Add Extension** in the popup dialog.
4. Wait for the extension to install and appear as an icon next to the address bar.

### Mozilla Firefox

2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Approve permissions by clicking **Add** on the prompt.
4. After installation, the extension icon appears near the address bar.

### Safari (Future Support)

- Safari supports manifest version 3 extensions starting version 18.5, but uBO Scope’s Safari package is not yet officially published in the App Store.
- When available, installation will follow the standard Safari Extensions workflow via the App Store.
- For advanced users, manual sideloading may be possible (see below).

<Tip>
Browser extensions like uBO Scope require specific permissions to monitor network requests. Always install directly from official browser stores when possible to ensure security and automatic updates.

## Manual Installation for Advanced Users

If you prefer to install the extension manually or want to use it on unsupported Chromium-based browsers, here is the process.

### Requirements

- Linux environment or any OS supporting shell scripts and browser developer modes.
- Latest source code of uBO Scope from the repository.
- Basic command-line proficiency.

### Steps

1. **Clone or Download uBO Scope repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
   cd uBO-Scope
   ```

2. **Build the extension for your platform**

   The `make-package.sh` script prepares a ready-to-load extension.

   - For Chromium (Chrome, Edge, etc.):

     ```bash
     ./tools/make-package.sh chromium
     ```

   - For Firefox:

     ```bash
     ./tools/make-package.sh firefox
     ```

   - For Safari (experimental):

     ```bash
     ./tools/make-package.sh safari
     ```

3. **Locate the packaged folder**

   After running the script, you will find your extension under `build/uBO-Scope.<platform>`.

4. **Load the extension into your browser**

   - **Google Chrome / Chromium**:
     - Open `chrome://extensions/`.
     - Enable `Developer mode` (toggle on top right).
     - Click `Load unpacked`.
     - Select the `build/uBO-Scope.chromium` directory.

   - **Firefox**:
     - Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
     - Click `Load Temporary Add-on`.
     - Choose the `manifest.json` in the `build/uBO-Scope.firefox` folder.

   - **Safari (manual sideload)**:
     - Currently, manual loading requires Xcode and development profiles.
     - Follow Safari's extension developer documentation to load the `build/uBO-Scope.safari`.

<Warning>
Manual installation loads a temporary extension. It will be disabled on browser restart unless packed and signed appropriately.
</Warning>

## Verifying a Successful Installation

1. Look for the **uBO Scope** icon (uBO Scope’s logo) near your browser’s address bar.
2. Click the icon to open the popup window.
3. You should see the extension interface with sections: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** domains, and a summary of connected domains.
4. The badge count on the icon will display **the number of distinct third-party domains connected** when browsing.

<Tip>
