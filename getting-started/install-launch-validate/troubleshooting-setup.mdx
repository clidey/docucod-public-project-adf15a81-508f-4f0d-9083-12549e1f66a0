# Troubleshooting Setup Issues

This guide provides quick, practical solutions for common installation and configuration problems that may prevent uBO Scope from functioning correctly. Whether you're missing toolbar icons, badge counts aren’t updating, or the popup isn’t displaying data, this page helps you resolve these blockers with clear, actionable steps so you can start using uBO Scope confidently.

---

## 1. Toolbar Icon Does Not Appear

If you installed uBO Scope but do not see its icon in your browser’s toolbar, follow these steps:

1. **Confirm Installation**
   - Open your browser’s extensions or add-ons page.
   - Verify that the extension named **uBO Scope** or **uBlock Origin Scope** is listed and enabled.

2. **Enable Toolbar Icon**
   - In some browsers like Chrome or Firefox, extensions can be hidden.
   - Locate the extensions menu (`puzzle` icon in Chrome, the hamburger menu on Firefox).
   - Pin or show the uBO Scope icon to the toolbar.

3. **Restart Browser**
   - Quit and restart your browser to refresh extension loading.

4. **Check Browser Version and Compatibility**
   - Ensure your browser version meets the minimum requirements:
     - **Chrome** 122+
     - **Firefox** 128+
     - **Safari** 18.5+ (future support)
   - Older versions may not support manifest version 3 or necessary APIs.

<Tip>
Extension icons are sometimes hidden by default after installation. Always check your browser’s extension management UI to reveal or pin the icon.
</Tip>

## 2. Badge Count Doesn't Update or Shows Blank

The toolbar badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains contacted. If it remains blank or does not update as expected:

1. **Ensure You Are on a Webpage with Network Activity**
   - The badge count only appears when the active tab makes network requests to third-party servers.

2. **Reload the Webpage**
   - Navigate to or refresh the page; uBO Scope processes requests as pages load.

3. **Verify Permissions for Network Access**
   - The extension uses the `webRequest` permission.
   - Check that permissions are granted and the extension is not disabled or restricted.

4. **Avoid Private/Incognito Modes If Not Allowed**
   - Some browsers disable extensions or limit APIs in private/incognito windows unless explicitly allowed.
   - Enable uBO Scope in incognito mode manually if needed.

5. **Check for Conflicting Extensions**
   - Some extensions might interfere with network request monitoring.
   - Temporarily disable other extensions and test.

<Tip>
Badge counts reflect distinct third-party remote servers connected — fewer is better. A blank badge means no detected third-party connections on the active tab.
</Tip>

## 3. Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Is Empty

If clicking the toolbar icon opens the popup but displays 'NO DATA' or no domain information:

1. **Confirm Active Tab Contains Loadable Content**
   - The extension tracks network requests per active tab.
   - On pages like `about:blank` or browser internal pages, no data is shown.

2. **Reload the Active Page**
   - Ensure the page completes loading so network requests are captured.

3. **Wait a Few Moments**
   - Data collection uses a short delay to batch network events.
   - If the popup was opened immediately after navigation, wait a second and reopen.

4. **Verify Background Script Is Running**
   - The background service worker/process must be active for data tracking.
   - Restarting the browser or extension can reload this.

5. **Clear Browser Session Storage**
   - Corrupted session data may cause issues.
   - Go to your browser’s extension storage settings and clear session or local storage for uBO Scope.

6. **Check Browser Support and Version**
   - Older browsers or those with limited `webRequest` API support may not populate data.

<Warning>
Some browser security or privacy settings can restrict extension API access, leading to missing popup data.
</Warning>

## 4. Network Requests Not Being Captured or Reported

If you suspect uBO Scope is not observing network requests properly:

1. **Check the `webRequest` Permission**
   - Verify your extension version has the required permissions in the manifest.
   - Only versions from approved sources should be used to ensure correct permissions.

2. **Confirm Host Permissions**
   - The extension requests access to all HTTP and WebSocket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
   - Some browsers require explicit user confirmation for such wide access.

3. **Disable Other Network Monitoring Extensions**
   - They might conflict or cause rate-limiting.

4. **Note Limitations of `webRequest` API in MV3**
   - Some network requests generated outside the browser’s network stack (e.g., other apps) cannot be observed.

5. **Check Browser Updates and Extensions Errors**
   - Use browser extension debugging tools to identify errors in the background script.

## 5. Browser Permissions or Settings Blocking uBO Scope

Sometimes browser settings or security policies prevent proper function:

- **Content Security Policies (CSP)**
  - Certain websites may restrict extension scripts.
- **Private Browsing Restrictions**
  - Enable uBO Scope explicitly if required.
- **Enterprise or Admin Policies**
  - Managed environments might block extension network or storage permissions.

You can reconcile these by:

1. Checking your browser’s extension permission settings.
2. Adjusting privacy/security configurations.
3. Consulting organizational IT if managed browsing is enforced.

## 6. General Troubleshooting Steps

If you still experience issues:

- **Restart Your Browser**
- **Reinstall uBO Scope**
- **Clear Browser Cache and Extension Data**
- **Try a Different Supported Browser**
- **Update Your Browser to the Latest Version**
- **Review the Extension’s Console Logs:**
  - Use Developer Tools > Extensions to inspect background or popup logs.

<Tip>
Keeping your browser and extensions updated resolves many intermittent or unexpected issues.
