# Checking Your First Page

Welcome to the critical step of confirming that uBO Scope is active and working as intended on your browser. This guide walks you through how to recognize and validate the extension’s operation by interacting with the toolbar icon, interpreting the badge count, and reviewing the detailed connection data in the popup panel on the active tab.

By following these steps, you will gain confidence that uBO Scope is monitoring network requests correctly and understand the key visual indicators it provides.

---

## 1. Open the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

After installing uBO Scope and completing any necessary first-time setup, locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.

### Steps:

- Look for the uBO Scope icon near your address bar (it usually displays the uBO logo).
- If not visible, check your browser’s extension overflow menu or pin the icon for easy access.
- Click the **uBO Scope** icon once to open its popup panel.

### Outcome:

- The popup panel should appear showing live data about the current active tab’s third-party connections.
- The icon's badge—if present—displays a number indicating the **count of distinct third-party domains** successfully connected to by the page.

<Tip>
If clicking the icon opens no popup or shows "NO DATA," verify that you are on a web page (not a browser internal page). uBO Scope only reports on network requests made within web content tabs.
</Tip>

## 2. Understand the Toolbar Badge Count

The badge count on the toolbar icon represents the number of distinct third-party domains that the active tab has successfully connected to.

### What This Means:

- **Lower badge counts are better**, indicating fewer third-party connections.
- The count excludes blocked domains and highlights connections that were allowed despite any content blocking.

### How to Interpret the Badge:

- A badge number of **0 or no badge** means either no third-party connections were detected or they were all blocked.
- A number greater than zero shows how many distinct third parties loaded content or resources on the page.

<Note>
Not all third-party domains are malicious; many are legitimate CDNs or service providers. The badge helps you be aware, not necessarily alarmed.
</Note>

## 3. Review the Popup Panel Details

Clicking the toolbar icon opens the popup panel, which gives a detailed breakdown of all third-party connections observed on the active tab. Here’s how to interpret the data:

### Sections Explained:

- **domains connected:** Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains detected.
- **not blocked:** Lists domains with connections that were allowed.
- **stealth-blocked:** Lists domains where connection attempts were stealth-blocked, i.e., requests were redirected or hidden by the content blocker.
- **blocked:** Lists domains where connection attempts were explicitly blocked.

### How to Explore:

1. Look at the **domains connected** total at the top — this number should generally match or be close to the badge count.
2. Expand each category to see domain names and counts of how many requests were made.
3. Recognize familiar legitimate domains (like common CDNs) versus unexpected or suspicious third parties.

<Tip>
Hover over the popup or scroll if many domains are listed. The counts next to each domain show request frequency, assisting you in spotting the most active third parties.
</Tip>

## 4. Validate on an Active Tab

To thoroughly verify uBO Scope’s correct operation, perform this simple test:

### Steps:

- Open any webpage with known multiple third-party resources loaded (e.g., news sites, social networks).
- Click the uBO Scope icon.
- Observe the badge count and popup data updating to show third-party connections.

### Success Criteria:

- The badge count reflects a positive integer indicating detected connections.
- The popup panel lists domain names consistent with the known third-party content on the page.
- Blocked and stealth-blocked sections reflect any active content blocking on your browser.

<Warning>
If you observe no badge count, an empty popup, or "NO DATA" on a page you know has third-party content, confirm that uBO Scope has appropriate permissions enabled and is not restricted by your browser or other extensions.
</Warning>

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' On Webpage">
- Confirm you are testing on a non-private, real web page (not browser internals like about:, chrome:, edge:, etc.)
- Reload the active tab to trigger fresh network requests.
- Ensure the extension permissions include activeTab and webRequest.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
- Switch tabs to force badge update.
- Reload the current tab.
- Check conflicts with other privacy extensions; temporarily disable them to rule out interference.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Blocked or Stealth Sections Are Empty">
- This may mean your content blocker did not block any third parties on this page.
- Test with a site known for ad or tracker domains to validate this section.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps

- Proceed to explore deeper guides such as [Understanding the Popup Interface](/guides/core-usage/understanding-the-popup) and [Interpreting the Toolbar Badge Count](/guides/core-usage/interpreting-badge-count) to maximize your insight.
- Use uBO Scope to audit sites you frequently visit and observe privacy-related third-party connections.
- Refer to [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](/getting-started/install-launch-validate/troubleshooting-setup) if problems persist.

<Tip>
Regularly check uBO Scope’s popup data to maintain awareness of third-party activity, especially if you change content blocker settings or use new browsers.
</Tip>
