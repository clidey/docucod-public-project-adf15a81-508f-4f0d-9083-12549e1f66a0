# System Requirements for uBO Scope

Ensure your environment meets the following requirements to run uBO Scope smoothly. This page covers supported browsers, version requirements, and capabilities necessary for a seamless uBO Scope experience.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with the major web browsers. To guarantee reliability and full feature support, your browser must meet the minimum version requirements below:

| Browser       | Minimum Version    |
|---------------|--------------------|
| Chrome        | 122.0 and later     |
| Firefox       | 128.0 and later     |
| Safari        | 18.5 and later      |

These versions ensure that the browsers provide the necessary APIs and security features that uBO Scope depends on.

### Why are these minimum versions required?

- **WebRequest API Support**: uBO Scope relies heavily on the `webRequest` API to monitor network connections in real-time.
- **Manifest Version 3**: The extension uses Manifest Version 3 features such as service workers, which are supported starting from these versions.
- **Security and Permissions**: These versions enforce permission models and security policies compatible with uBO Scope's design.


## 2. Required Browser Permissions

During installation, uBO Scope will request the following permissions:

- `activeTab` — to access the active browser tab for context-sensitive monitoring.
- `storage` — for saving session data such as network request history and public suffix lists.
- `webRequest` — to observe, analyze, and report network requests initiated by webpages.

Furthermore, uBO Scope requires host permissions to monitor network requests on web protocols:

- HTTP/HTTPS (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`)
- WebSocket (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) [Supported only in Chromium and Firefox]

<Note>
Ensure you are comfortable granting these permissions because uBO Scope needs them to perform accurate network connection analysis.
</Note>

## 3. System Capabilities

To get the most accurate and reliable data from uBO Scope, the following capabilities are essential:

- **Network Accessibility**: Your browser must not restrict or hide network details from extensions, especially for WebSocket requests.
- **Storage Availability**: Local and session storage APIs must be available and operational to store session information and the public suffix list.


## 4. Preparing Your Environment

Before installing uBO Scope:

<Steps>
<Step title="Update Your Browser">
Confirm you are running a browser version that meets the minimum requirements listed above.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Permissions Settings">
Ensure your browser allows extensions to request the necessary permissions.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Network Accessibility">
Avoid using browser configurations or proxy/VPN tools that block or obscure standard network request reporting.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Upgrading to the latest stable browser version not only ensures compatibility but also enhances security and performance for uBO Scope and other extensions.
</Tip>

## 5. Verifying Compatibility

Once installed, uBO Scope indicates its functionality through badge counts and real-time reports of network requests. To verify compatibility:

1. Open a new browser tab.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. Observe if the popup loads without errors and displays domains connected on the active page.

If the popup does not load or shows an empty state, verify your browser version and permissions.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **Unsupported Browser Version**: Using a version older than the minimum will cause uBO Scope to malfunction or fail installation.

- **Restricted Permissions**: Denying critical permissions (especially `webRequest`) disables uBO Scope’s core functionality.

- **Network API Limitations**: Some browsers or configurations limit the visibility of network requests to extensions, resulting in incomplete reporting.

- **Storage Quotas Exceeded**: If your browser’s extension storage quota is exceeded, uBO Scope might not save session data reliably.

## Additional Notes

- uBO Scope is designed to operate independently of other content blockers and report network connections even in complex blocker scenarios.
- The extension uses the public suffix list to correctly identify base domains, improving the accuracy of domain-level monitoring.
- Support for WebSocket (`ws://` and `wss://`) is present in Chromium and Firefox but not Safari due to platform limitations.
