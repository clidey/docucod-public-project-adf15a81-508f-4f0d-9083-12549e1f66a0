# First-Time Setup

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide takes you through activating uBO Scope right after installation and explains what your initial experience looks like.

## 1. Confirm Extension Activation

**Outcome:** See uBO Scope icon appear in your browser toolbar, indicating the extension is active and ready.

### Steps:

1. After installing uBO Scope from your browser’s extension/add-on store, look for the uBO Scope icon:

   - Depending on your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), it appears near the address bar or extension toolbar.

2. If you don’t see the icon immediately:

</Tip>

## 2. Understanding Initial Indicators — Popups and Badges

Once active, uBO Scope begins monitoring connections. Here’s what to expect:

### User Interface Elements:

- **Popup Panel:** Clicking the icon will open the uBO Scope popup.
  - Shows domain connection statistics for the current active tab.
  - Displays sections for domains that are **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

- **Badge Count:** The icon may show a badge number.
  - This number reports the **count of distinct third-party remote servers successfully connected** for the active tab.
  - A blank or missing badge means no such connections have been observed yet.

### How This Looks in Practice:

- Upon first launch and visiting a site:
  - The badge updates dynamically reflecting connections.
  - The popup shows detailed domain grouping, helping you understand network activity.

## 3. No Initial Configuration Required

uBO Scope is designed for immediate usefulness without manual setup:

- **Automatic Activation:** After installation, uBO Scope starts passively monitoring network requests.
- **No Settings Adjustment Needed:** The extension handles domain classification and displays data with default settings.

<Tip>
If you want to customize browsers or permissions, refer to specific browser extension guides, but this is optional and not required for initial use.
</Tip>

## 4. How to Access the Popup Interface

**Step-by-Step:**

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup will open, showing details for the active tab.
3. The display contains:
   - The tab’s hostname and domain, shown in Unicode form.
   - Sections categorizing connections: **Allowed**, **Stealth-Blocked**, and **Blocked** domains.
   - Each domain shows a count of connections.

### Interpreting the Display:
- **Allowed:** Domains from which network requests succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with redirected requests silently blocked.
- **Blocked:** Domains with explicit failed requests.

<Tip>
This immediate visibility empowers you to quickly understand what servers your browser connects to, without additional setup.
</Tip>

## 5. What to Expect Upon First Launch

- The icon shows up instantly after installation.
- No popups or banners will interrupt your browsing.
- The badge updates in real-time as you browse pages.
- On a new tab with no network activity, the popup shows 'NO DATA' until the extension gathers connection information.

<Tip>
If you open the popup on a freshly loaded webpage, you might see zero or very few domains listed if the page has not initiated remote server connections yet.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common First-Time Setup Issues

### Problem: Extension Icon Does Not Appear

- **Cause:** Browser may not have enabled it or requires pinning.
- **Solution:**
  - Check your browser’s extension or add-on settings.
  - Pin the uBO Scope icon to your toolbar.
  - Restart your browser if necessary.

### Problem: Badge Count or Popup Shows No Data

- **Cause:** No remote server connections observed yet on the current tab.
- **Solution:**
  - Visit a website that loads external resources.
  - Wait a moment for the extension to detect connections.
  - Refresh the tab to force new connections.

### Problem: Extension Not Responding After Installation

- **Cause:** Possible permissions issues or temporary glitches.
- **Solution:**
  - Ensure the extension has permissions to access the sites you visit.
  - Verify browser version compatibility: [System Requirements](./system-requirements).
  - Remove and reinstall the extension if issues persist.

<Warning>
Do not disable uBO Scope’s required permissions (storage, webRequest, activeTab) as this will prevent it from monitoring connections effectively.
</Warning>
