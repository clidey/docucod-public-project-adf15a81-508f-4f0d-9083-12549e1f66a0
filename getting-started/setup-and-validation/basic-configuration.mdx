# Basic Configuration of uBO Scope

uBO Scope is designed to work right out of the box with **minimal setup required**. Its plug-and-play architecture ensures that you start monitoring third-party network connections with no complex configurations needed. This page guides you through the essentials of the basic setup, what the extension configures automatically, and how to adjust optional settings if you want a more tailored experience.

---

## 1. Understanding Minimal Setup

When you install uBO Scope, it immediately begins tracking remote connections your browser attempts without requiring manual configuration. The extension relies on the browser's native permissions and APIs to provide real-time reporting on allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked network requests.

Key points of the minimal setup:

- **No configuration steps needed post-installation**
- Automatically collects and presents data per active tab
- No user input required to start seeing results

<u>Benefit:</u> You get immediate transparency about third-party server connections with zero friction.

---

## 2. Permissions and Automatic Setup

uBO Scope requests certain permissions necessary for its operation during installation:

- Access to active tabs
- Ability to observe network requests (`webRequest` API)
- Local browser storage for session data

These permissions are handled during installation based on your browser and do not require manual enabling.

<u>Important:</u> If you experience missing data, ensure permissions were granted fully during installation (see Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues).

---

## 3. What Happens Behind the Scenes

Without any user configuration, uBO Scope:

- Monitors all network requests made by active tabs to third-party domains
- Classifies these requests as **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked**
- Maintains a detailed count of unique remote domains contacted
- Updates the browser toolbar badge with the number of distinct third-party domains allowed
- Presents detailed domain lists in the popup interface

This mechanism requires no user intervention or specialized setup.

---

## 4. Optional Adjustments for Power Users

Although no configuration is strictly required, users with advanced needs may consider customizing certain aspects manually. Note that the extension currently does not expose direct configuration options in the UI.

### Advanced Considerations:

- **Data Persistence:** By default, session data persists using the browser's local storage for accurate tracking across browser sessions.
- **Public Suffix List:** uBO Scope downloads and caches the Public Suffix List automatically to correctly identify domain boundaries.

<p>Currently, explicit configuration settings are not exposed, preserving simplicity and reliability.</p>

---

## 5. Best Practices

- Always keep your extension updated to the latest version for improved accuracy and features.
- Verify permissions granted during installation to avoid missing network data.
- Use the popup interface to monitor connections regularly and identify unusual third-party domains.

## 6. Common Configuration-Related Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Configuration FAQs">
<Accordion title="Do I need to whitelist any domains for uBO Scope to work?">
No. uBO Scope works independently of filtering rules and does not require whitelisting or whitelisting exceptions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I change which network events uBO Scope monitors?">
No. The extension globally listens to network events relevant to all active tabs to provide comprehensive visibility.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is it possible to change how long session data is kept?">
Currently, session data retention follows browser storage defaults and cannot be altered through the UI.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Troubleshooting Configuration Issues

If you notice the popup does not display data or badge counts remain empty despite expected network activity:

- Confirm that uBO Scope has the required permissions (`activeTab`, `webRequest`, and `storage`).
- Reload or restart your browser to refresh background processes.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions that might interfere with network monitoring.
- Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues](../setup-and-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues) guide for detailed assistance.

---

## 8. Next Steps

Once you understand the minimal setup, you are ready to:

- Open the popup to see your first connection data.
- Start interpreting allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains using the detailed popup UI (see [Understanding the Popup UI and Badge](../../guides/getting-started/understanding-the-popup)).
- Explore core use cases such as auditing third-party requests with uBO Scope.

---

<u>By design, uBO Scope simplifies user onboarding and immediately delivers actionable insights without cumbersome setup. When configuration is needed for specialized workflows, it will be documented explicitly in advanced user guides.</u>
