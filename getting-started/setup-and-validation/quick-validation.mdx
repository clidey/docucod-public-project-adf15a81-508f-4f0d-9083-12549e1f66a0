# Quick Validation: Is It Working?

Confirming uBO Scope is properly installed and operational is straightforward. This page guides you through simple, immediate checks to verify that the extension is actively monitoring network requests and presenting data as expected.

---

## 1. Check the Toolbar Badge

After installing uBO Scope in your browser, the extension icon appears in the toolbar. This badge provides a quick, at-a-glance indication of active third-party connections on your current browser tab.

### Steps

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon** in your browser's toolbar. It uses the uBO Scope logo.
2. Observe the **badge number** on the icon:
   - A non-empty number indicates the count of third-party domains connected to by the page.
   - An empty badge means no domain connections are registered yet for the page.

### What it means

- A number on the badge confirms that uBO Scope is tracking requests.
- If the badge stays permanently empty on pages where network requests are expected, uBO Scope may not be working correctly.

<Check>
If you don’t see the uBO Scope icon:
- Ensure the extension is installed and enabled.
- Check your browser’s extension overflow menu.
- Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues](../setup-and-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues) page.
</Check>

## 2. Open the Popup UI

The uBO Scope popup provides a detailed visualization of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked requests per third-party domain on the current tab.

### Steps

1. Click the **uBO Scope toolbar icon**.
2. Wait a moment as the popup loads data.
3. Review the **page hostname** shown prominently at the top.
4. Look at the **'domains connected' count** near the center.
5. Examine each of the three sections:
   - **Not blocked** (allowed connections)
   - **Stealth-blocked** (requests invisible to content blockers)
   - **Blocked** (requests explicitly blocked by the content blocker)

### Visual Cues

- Each section lists domains and how often each was connected.
- Domains appear with colored badges for quick recognition: green for allowed, red for stealth or blocked.

### Successful Outcome

- The popup shows the current tab’s domain and lists domains under the correct categories.
- Numbers and domains dynamically update as you browse.

<Note>
Empty sections means no requests in that category for the current page.
</Note>

## 3. Interpret the Data

Understanding the popup output helps confirm that uBO Scope is properly processing network data.

| Outcome Category  | Description                                              | What to Expect                         |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked       | Requests allowed through by your content blocker          | Domains actively contacted           |
| Stealth-Blocked   | Requests unseen or redirected stealthily by a blocker     | Possible domains hidden by stealth   |
| Blocked           | Requests explicitly blocked by filters                    | Domains blocked or failed requests   |

If you see domains listed in any category, uBO Scope is gathering and categorizing network requests accurately.

---

## 4. Practical Example

Imagine you visit `https://example.com`:

- The toolbar badge shows `5`.
- Opening the popup, you see:
  - **Not Blocked** with `google-analytics.com` (3 connections)
  - **Blocked** with `tracking.example.net` (1 connection)
  - **Stealth-Blocked** empty.

This confirms:
- uBO Scope is tracking and categorizing connections.
- Your content blocker is actively blocking some third parties.
- The badge count matches the domains reported.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Validation Steps">
<Accordion title="No Toolbar Badge Visible">
- Verify extension is installed and enabled.
- Check toolbar overflow or hidden icons.
- Restart browser if necessary.
- Consult [Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues](../setup-and-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Always Empty">
- Confirm the page actually makes network requests (try popular sites).
- Clear browser cache and reload the page.
- Check permissions granted to the extension.
- See [Prerequisites & System Requirements](../quick-setup/prerequisites-system-requirements) for permission details.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Empty">
- Wait a few seconds after opening; data collection is asynchronous.
- Reload the page and then open the popup.
- Ensure your content blocker is active and configured to intercept requests.
- Review related docs on [Basic Configuration](../setup-and-validation/basic-configuration).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps

Once validation is complete and you confirm uBO Scope is working:

- Explore [Basic Configuration](../setup-and-validation/basic-configuration) to understand minimal setup.
- See [Understanding the Popup UI and Badge](../../guides/getting-started/understanding-the-popup) for detailed UI insights.
- Continue with [Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues](../setup-and-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues) for unexpected problems.

---

## Additional Tips

- Open the popup on various websites to see real-time updates.
- Pay attention to stealth-blocked connections, which indicate hidden requests.
- Badge counts update automatically after request processing finishes.
