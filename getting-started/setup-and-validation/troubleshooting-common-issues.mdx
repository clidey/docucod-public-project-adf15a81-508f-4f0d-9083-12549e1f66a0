## 1. Extension Icon Does Not Appear in Toolbar

### Why It Happens

- The extension might be installed but not pinned to the browser toolbar.
- Browser might not support the extension version installed.
- Installation was incomplete or corrupted.

### How to Fix

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Extension Installation in Browser">
Open your browser’s extensions page:

- **Chrome**: Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
- **Firefox**: Navigate to `about:addons`
- **Safari**: Go to Safari > Preferences > Extensions

Confirm that the uBO Scope extension is listed and enabled.
</Step>
<Step title="Pin the Extension to Toolbar">
In browsers like Chrome and Firefox, install icons may not automatically appear in the toolbar:

- Click the extensions icon (puzzle piece) in the toolbar.
- Find 'uBO Scope'.
- Click the pin icon next to it to add it to the toolbar.

In Safari, enable the extension via Preferences.
</Step>
<Step title="Restart Your Browser">
Sometimes a simple restart resolves display issues for newly installed extensions.

Close all browser windows and reopen.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Browser Version Compatibility">

- **Chrome**: Minimum version 122.0 is required.
- **Firefox**: Minimum version 128.0 is required.
- **Safari**: Minimum version 18.5 is required.

Update your browser to meet these requirements.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If the icon is still missing after these steps, try uninstalling and reinstalling the extension from the official store:

- Chrome Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp
- Firefox Add-ons: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/
</Note>

## 2. Permissions Questions and Warnings

### Common Scenarios

- Your browser asks for network or host permissions on installation.
- You receive warnings about the extension requiring access to all websites.

### Explanation

uBO Scope requires permissions to observe network requests on all websites to provide accurate reporting of remote connections. This includes permission for `webRequest` access to all URLs (`https://*/*`, `http://*/*`), necessary for its core function.

### Recommendations

- Grant the permissions during installation for uBO Scope to function correctly.
- Review permissions via the browser’s extension management page.
- If uncomfortable with these permissions, consider whether uBO Scope suits your privacy and security preferences.

<Tip>
This extension does not block content but reports all remote connections, regardless of your content blockers. It uses granted permissions purely for monitoring purposes.
</Tip>

## 3. Unsupported Browser or Version Warning

### Cause

- Attempting to use uBO Scope on unsupported browsers or versions below minimum requirements.

### Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

| Browser | Minimum Version |
|---------|-----------------|
| Chrome  | 122.0           |
| Firefox | 128.0           |
| Safari  | 18.5            |

### How to Resolve

- Update your browser to the latest stable release.
- Use one of the supported browsers listed above.
- If the problem persists despite updated versions, reinstall uBO Scope from the official sources.

## 4. Extension Badge Count Not Updating

### Possible Causes

- Browser service worker or background script has been evicted or crashed.
- Permissions or API usage limitation.
- Tab details reset due to browser settings or updates.

### Solutions

- Reload the page where uBO Scope is observing third-party connections.
- Restart your browser to reload service workers.
- Ensure no other extension is conflicting or disabling network monitoring.

<Warning>
Browsers may evict extension background processes to save memory. This is normal and does not indicate malfunction. uBO Scope recovers on usage automatically.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Extension Does Not Show Data in Popup

### Diagnosis

- The extension icon is present but clicking it shows “NO DATA” or empty sections.

### How to Fix

- Make sure the page you are browsing has loaded and made network connections.
- Refresh the active tab where you want to observe connections.
- Verify the page is making HTTP/HTTPS or WebSocket requests; uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API to detect requests.

---

## 6. Browser-Specific Notes

### Chrome

- The extension uses a service worker background script; ensure your Chrome version supports Manifest V3 extensions.
- Install from Chrome Web Store only.

### Firefox

- Manifest V3 with background scripts is supported from Firefox 128.
- Install from Firefox Add-ons.

### Safari

- Requires Safari 18.5 or later.
- Permissions limited to HTTP(s) URLs; WebSocket monitoring is limited.

## Additional Tips and Best Practices

- Always install extensions from official stores to avoid tampered versions.
- Confirm browser updates before reporting critical issues; many fixes happen through updating.
- If problems persist, try disabling other extensions that might interfere with `webRequest` API.
