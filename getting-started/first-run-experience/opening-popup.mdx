# Opening the uBO Scope Popup

Get your first glimpse of the uBO Scope interface and learn how to access its popup panel directly from your browser toolbar. This guide explains the visual elements you'll encounter, helping you start monitoring network connections on the webpage you're currently visiting.

---

## 1. Accessing the uBO Scope Popup

- **Locate the uBO Scope Icon**: After installing the uBO Scope extension, you will see its icon displayed on your browser's toolbar alongside other extensions. Its default icon resembles the uBO logo.

- **Opening the Popup Panel**: Click the uBO Scope icon on the toolbar to open the popup panel. This action instantly reveals a summary view of network connections related to the active browser tab.

  <Tip>
  If the icon is not visible, check your browser's extension menu or customize toolbar settings to ensure the uBO Scope icon is enabled and visible.
  </Tip>

- **Popup Behavior**: The popup reflects data for the current active tab and updates automatically when you navigate to different web pages or reload the tab.

## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface

The uBO Scope popup provides a clear, categorized view of domains that your browser connected to while loading the current active tab.

### Key Interface Elements

- **Hostname Header**
  - Located prominently at the top, it displays the current active tab's hostname.
  - For subdomains, it splits the hostname (first part) and the registered domain (last part) for clarity.

- **Summary Section**
  - Directly beneath the hostname, you see a count labeled "domains connected:" indicating the total number of distinct domains contacted.
  - This count corresponds to the third-party domains involved during page load.

- **Categorized Domain Lists**
  The popup divides observed domains into three sections:

  1. **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
     - Domains where network requests were allowed and completed successfully.
     - This section lists each allowed domain with the request count as badges next to them.

  2. **Stealth-Blocked**
     - Domains for which requests were stealth-blocked by uBO or other filters.
     - It represents network requests hidden from webpages to avoid detection.

  3. **Blocked**
     - Domains where requests were outright blocked and prevented from loading.
     - This section shows each blocked domain with its request frequency.

  <Info>
  Sections with no data remain hidden to keep the interface clean and focused.
  </Info>

- **Domain Rows**
  - Each domain entry shows the domain name (converted to Unicode for internationalized domains) and the number of requests made or blocked.
  
### Visual Appearance and Responsiveness

- The popup uses a compact layout optimized for readability within typical extension popup sizes (320-380px width).
- The color scheme adapts to your system’s light or dark mode for comfortable viewing.

## 3. Initiating Monitoring for a Webpage

- The uBO Scope popup automatically begins reporting network connections for the active tab as soon as you open the panel.

- There is no manual start button; monitoring is continuous in the background and synchronizes data upon popup activation.

- As network requests complete, the popup dynamically displays updated domain lists and counts.

- If you do not see data immediately, wait a moment or reload the page; network requests must be captured and aggregated before display.

</Step>
<Step title="Review the domain connection summary">
See the total number of connected domains listed under "domains connected:"
</Step>
<Step title="Explore allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains">
Check the categorized sections for detailed domain lists with their associated request counts.

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Interpreting Domain Counts**: A lower number in the "domains connected" summary generally reflects fewer third-party domains loaded, which usually aligns with greater privacy.

- **Unicode Domain Display**: Internationalized domain names (IDNs) are displayed in human-readable Unicode form rather than punycode, making it easier to identify sites.

- **Refreshing Data**: If data appears stale or missing, reload the active tab and reopen the popup to force a fresh capture.

- **Popup Width Adaptation**: The popup adapts layout if its width is constrained by the browser, ensuring text and sections remain legible.
