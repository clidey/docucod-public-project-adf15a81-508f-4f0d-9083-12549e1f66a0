# Launching and Accessing uBO Scope

This guide helps you get started by opening the uBO Scope extension after installation, understanding the toolbar icon and badge, and verifying that the extension is active and working correctly.

---

## 1. Opening uBO Scope for the First Time

Once uBO Scope is installed in your browser, you can access it easily from the toolbar.

### Steps to Access:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. The icon uses the uBO Scope logo.
2. Click the icon to open the extension's popup panel.

<Tip>
If you do not see the icon immediately after installation, check your browser’s extension overflow menu or pin it to the toolbar for quick access.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Icon and Badge

The toolbar icon provides visual feedback about uBO Scope’s monitoring:

- **Icon**: Clicking opens the popup showing detailed connection information.
- **Badge Count**: Displays the number of distinct third-party remote domains for which a connection was attempted or succeeded on the active tab.

### What the Badge Means:

- **A number displayed**: Indicates how many unique third-party domains were contacted by the webpage.
- **No number (badge hidden)**: Means zero or no connections detected.

<Tip>
A lower badge number typically reflects fewer third-party connections and a potentially higher privacy level.
</Tip>

## 3. What to Expect in the Popup Panel

After opening the popup:

- The domain of the current active tab is prominently shown.
- Lists are displayed under categories: **Not Blocked**, **Stealth-Blocked**, and **Blocked** third-party domains.
- Each domain row shows the domain name and a count of requests.

This layout helps you quickly identify which third-party servers your current website is connecting to and how the requests are handled.

## 4. Verifying Successful Activation

Follow these simple steps to confirm uBO Scope is working:

</Step>
<Step title="View Popup Data">
