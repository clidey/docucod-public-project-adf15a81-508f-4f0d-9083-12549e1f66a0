# Quick Validation & Troubleshooting

This guide helps you quickly confirm that uBO Scope is functioning correctly by observing live updates to the toolbar badge and popup. It also provides concrete solutions for common issues such as missing permissions, badge discrepancies, or unexpected popup behavior.

## 1. Validating uBO Scope’s Operation

Ensuring uBO Scope is working right after installation safeguards your ability to monitor remote server connections accurately.

### Step 1: Observe the Toolbar Badge

- **What to expect:**
  - When you visit a webpage, the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar displays a numeric badge showing the count of distinct third-party domains connected.
  - This number updates live as network connections occur.

- **How to check:**
  1. Open a new tab and navigate to a trusted website.
  2. Watch the badge on the uBO Scope icon.
  3. Confirm the badge count changes from blank/zero to a positive number representing distinct domains.

<Tip>
If the badge stays blank or frozen, it may indicate the extension is not capturing any network data.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Open the Popup and Inspect Domain Lists

- **What to expect:**
  - Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup interface.
  - The popup shows the hostname of the active tab, the total count of domains connected, and three lists labeled **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
  - Domains under each category appear alongside the number of connections observed.

- **How to check:**
  1. Click the uBO Scope icon.
  2. Verify the hostname shown matches the active webpage.
  3. Confirm domain lists populate with real entries, not empty or just showing "NO DATA".
  4. Compare the summary count with the numeric badge; they should be consistent.

<Note>
Domain names are displayed in human-readable Unicode. Punycode-encoded domains convert automatically.
</Note>

## 2. Troubleshooting Common Issues

If uBO Scope does not behave as expected, use the following checks and fixes.

### Problem: Badge Count Not Updating or Always Blank

- **Cause:** The extension may lack necessary permissions or the browser is not reporting network requests.

- **Actions:**
  1. Ensure uBO Scope has the required permissions:
     - Open your browser’s extension/manage page.
     - Verify permissions include `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
     - Confirm host permissions cover `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and WebSocket protocols (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) if applicable.
  2. Reload the webpage or browser, then revisit the site to see if the badge updates.
  3. Disable conflicting extensions or browser settings that might block `webRequest` API.

<Tip>
Browsers like Firefox and Chrome have different minimum version requirements (e.g., Firefox 128+, Chrome 122+) that support all necessary APIs reliably. Ensure your browser version is up to date.
</Tip>

### Problem: Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Empty Lists

- **Cause:** The extension has not yet captured any network connection data for the active tab, or the site is not generating network requests.

- **Actions:**
  1. Visit an actively loading website that makes network requests.
  2. Ensure the uBO Scope icon badge reflects active domain connections.
  3. If still empty, refresh the tab to trigger new network events.

### Problem: Permissions Prompt Not Appearing or Extension Not Functioning After Installation

- **Cause:** The extension may not be fully enabled or pinned.

- **Actions:**
  1. Pin uBO Scope to your browser toolbar for easier access and confirmation.
  2. Open extension settings and confirm all prompts for permissions have been accepted.
  3. Restart the browser if permissions changes were recently applied.

### Problem: Unexpected or Incorrect Domain Counts

- **Cause:** Network requests may be blocked or filtered externally by other blockers, or the extension's session data may be stale.

- **Actions:**
  1. Disable other filtering extensions temporarily to check for interference.
  2. Close and reopen the tab or open a new tab to reset session data.
  3. Restart the browser if results remain inconsistent.

## 3. Best Practices for Early Success

- Always start by testing on webpages known to generate external resource requests (for example, popular news sites or content-heavy portals).
- Pin the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to have persistent, easy access.
- Regularly update your browser to the latest stable version to ensure compatibility with uBO Scope APIs.
- If you run into issues, try disabling other extensions that might conflict with network request tracking.

## 4. Verification Checklist

After performing the above steps, confirm the following:

- The toolbar badge updates dynamically when navigating to active webpages.
- The popup interface presents the hostname and domain lists with count data.
- Permissions for `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` are granted and active.
- No persistent error messages or unusual behavior in the popup.

<Tip>
If everything checks out, uBO Scope is ready for use to measure and analyze remote server connections on webpages reliably.
