# Understanding the Badge and Popup

Discover what the uBO Scope toolbar badge count represents and learn how to interpret the extension's popup interface, which categorizes remote server connections into allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked. This guide helps you quickly assess if uBO Scope is actively monitoring your network connections and capturing data effectively.

---

## 1. What the Toolbar Badge Represents

The toolbar badge count is a key, at-a-glance indicator of uBO Scope's monitoring activity:

- **Badge Count Meaning**: The number displayed on the toolbar icon represents the total **number of distinct third-party remote servers** your browser has connected to or attempted to connect to on the current tab.
- **Why Third-Party Servers?** These are domains different from the site you are visiting. Monitoring these helps you understand what external services your browser contacts.
- **Lower is Better**: A lower badge count generally indicates fewer third-party connections, which is usually desirable for privacy and performance.

<Tip>
The badge does **not** show blocked requests count, but counts distinct connected domains. This helps you focus on connections allowed through your content blocker.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding Connection Categories in the Popup

Opening the uBO Scope popup reveals detailed information about these third-party connections, separated into three categories:

| Category       | Description                                                                                 | Visual Clue in Popup         |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Allowed**    | Connections that succeeded, meaning your browser was able to fetch resources from these domains. | Green-highlighted section    |
| **Blocked**    | Connections that were explicitly blocked by your content blocker or network filters.         | Red-highlighted section      |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Connections that were silently redirected or prevented in a way that the request was never fully made or visible. | Also red-highlighted section |

Each category lists the remote domains and the number of requests made to each, helping you quickly analyze your tab’s network activity.

## 3. How to Open and Interpret the Popup

Follow these steps to view and interpret the data:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. This action opens the popup window displaying connection data for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="View Domain Information">
The top header shows the current tab's hostname and domain name, separated for clarity.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Summary Section">
Below the header, see the total count of distinct domains connected to from the current tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Categories">
The popup displays three sections: Not Blocked, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked.
- Each section lists domains contacted and the count of requests.
- Sections with no data are automatically hidden.
</Step>
<Step title="Assess Connection Outcomes">
Use the sections to understand which external domains loaded resources, which were blocked outright, and which were stealth-blocked.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the popup is empty or shows "NO DATA", uBO Scope may not have captured network events yet for the active tab; try refreshing the page or navigating to a new site.
</Tip>

## 4. Quick Validation of uBO Scope Functionality

To confirm everything is working:

- Verify the badge number updates as you navigate webpages. It should reflect distinct third-party domains.
- Open the popup and check for domain entries under the categories.
- Confirm the allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked lists display relevant domains with request counts.

If no information appears:

- Check your browser permissions and ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
- Reload the active tab and reopen the popup.

## 5. Real-World Use Case Example

Imagine visiting a news site:

- The badge shows "5", indicating five distinct third-party domains were connected to.
- In the popup, the "not blocked" section lists domains like `cdn.news.com` with multiple requests, showing legitimate content delivery.
- The "blocked" section lists known trackers you blocked, such as `ads.example.com`.
- The "stealth-blocked" section may show domains that were redirected or prevented more quietly.

This gives precise insight into what your browser communicates with, empowering better privacy awareness.

## 6. Best Practices and Tips

- **Regularly monitor badge changes** as you browse different tabs to understand your browsing footprint.
- **Use the popup details** to spot unexpected third-party connections that might warrant adjusting your content blocker settings.
- **Remember** stealth blocking indicates silent blocking or redirection, which can be less obvious but important to notice.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope Badge and Popup">
<Accordion title="Badge Not Updating or Always Zero">
- Ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your browser extensions.
- Verify browser version meets minimum requirements (see Installation documentation).
- Reload the active tab to trigger new monitoring.
- Check browser permissions: activeTab, storage, and webRequest must be granted.
- Confirm no conflicting extensions are interfering.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA or Empty Sections">
- This can happen if the tab hasn’t generated network traffic yet.
- Try navigating to a new website or refreshing the tab.
- Confirm the webpage actually makes network requests (static pages may not).
- Ensure the extension’s background service worker or script is running.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected or Missing Domains in Lists">
- Not all connections are blocked or visible depending on your content blocker.
- Some connections might be stealth-blocked and only collected silently.
- The badge counts distinct domains, not total requests; multiple requests to the same domain count as one.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
