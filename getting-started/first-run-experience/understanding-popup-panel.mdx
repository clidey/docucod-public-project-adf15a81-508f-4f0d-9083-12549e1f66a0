# Understanding the Popup Panel

Welcome to your first step exploring the uBO Scope extension's main user interface: the popup panel. This panel is your direct window into the network activity and the connections your browser is making as you surf the web. Here, you'll learn exactly how domains are presented, how to interpret the key categories of connections (`allowed`, `stealth-blocked`, `blocked`), and perform immediate validation that the extension is actively monitoring your browser traffic.

---

## 1. What is the Popup Panel?

The popup panel is the main UI triggered when you click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It provides a categorized summary of all remote server connections detected on the active browser tab.

- **Domains connected:** Total unique remote domains contacted by the page.
- **Categories presented:**
  - **Not blocked:** Connections allowed by the content blocker.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Connections that are silently blocked (often redirects or hidden attempts).
  - **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked.

This concise categorization helps you immediately assess your current page’s network requests and understand content blocking behavior.

## 2. Understanding Domain Display

The popup panel displays domains under each category in a list format with two main pieces of information per domain:

- **Domain name:** The exact remote domain involved in the connection.
- **Count:** The number of times this domain was encountered during connections from the page.

### Unicode and IDN Domains

Domain names are presented in their Unicode form, ensuring internationalized domain names (IDNs) show in their native script for clarity. For example, a punycode-encoded domain like `xn--d1acpjx3f.xn--p1ai` will appear as `пример.рф`.

## 3. Key Categories Explained

Each domain detected by uBO Scope is classified into one of the following categories:

| Category         | Description                                             | What it means for you                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked      | Connections allowed by your content blocker or browser. | Resources were successfully fetched.   |
| Stealth-Blocked  | Connections silently intercepted or redirected.         | May be hidden blocking to prevent detection or page breakage. |
| Blocked          | Connections explicitly prevented from completing.       | Network requests blocked, not completed. |

This triage makes it straightforward to spot which servers your browser is freely connecting to, which ones are being quietly filtered, and which are outright denied.

## 4. Step-by-Step: Validate Your Popup Panel Is Working

After installing and launching uBO Scope (see [Launching and Accessing uBO Scope](../first-run-experience/launching-extension)), performing a quick check here ensures you are getting live, accurate data.

### Steps to Validate:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel">
Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar. The popup panel will open and display data related to your current active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Tab Hostname Header">
At the top, confirm the hostname of the current tab is displayed clearly. This confirms the extension knows which site you are viewing.

If you see 'NO DATA', it indicates the extension has not yet collected network data for this tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domains Connected Summary">
Look at the ‘domains connected’ count displayed beneath the hostname. It shows the total number of unique remote domains involved.

If this count is zero or unusually low after browsing a content-rich page, the extension might not be capturing data correctly.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Each Category List">
Scroll through the `not blocked`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked` sections.
- Each should list domains and associated counts.
- Domains should appear as readable URLs, including IDN domains converted to Unicode.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify Expected Network Activity">
Visit a website that you know connects to external resources (e.g., cdnjs, fonts.googleapis.com).

You should see these known domains under the `not blocked` or `blocked` sections, confirming data collection.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the panel remains empty or ‘NO DATA’ persists, try reloading the tab or disabling/enabling the extension to reset data capture.
</Tip>

## 5. Best Practices & Tips

- The domain counts help prioritize which servers are most active and worthy of investigation.
- The `stealth-blocked` category often represents subtle blocking tactics — these domains are blocked but without explicit error feedback.
- Use the domain list to cross-check that known, legitimate domains are properly allowed, and suspicious ones are blocked.

## 6. Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Popup Panel Confusions">
<Accordion title="Why does the hostname sometimes have two parts?">
The hostname display splits the subdomain and main domain if they differ. This helps you quickly identify the base domain involved, especially with complex hostnames or multiple subdomains.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No domains are showing despite browsing sites">
This can happen if the extension hasn’t finished loading data or if the current tab has restricted its network activity (e.g., blank tabs, some internal browser pages).
Reloading the page or switching tabs can help.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does 'stealth-blocked' mean exactly?">
Stealth-blocked domains represent connections intercepted or redirected silently by content blockers. These do not trigger user-visible errors but prevented certain network requests.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. How the Popup Fits into Your Workflow

Understanding the popup panel equips you with the foundational knowledge needed to explore deeper network request outcomes and validate your content blocking settings.

Once comfortable, proceed to the [Verifying Functionality](../first-run-experience/quick-validation-steps) page to learn how to verify the extension’s real-time operation or visit [Resolving Common Installation & Activation Issues](../troubleshooting/common-issues) if you experience problems.

## Appendix: Technical Overview Behind the Popup Panel (Optional)

For users interested in how uBO Scope powers this display:

- The popup fetches detailed tab network data by messaging the background process.
- Domains are grouped by outcome and sorted to improve readability.
- Punycode conversion facilitates correct display of internationalized domains.
- The summary count tallies unique third-party domains connected across categories.

This design ensures you get an instantly digestible snapshot of your page's network dynamics.
