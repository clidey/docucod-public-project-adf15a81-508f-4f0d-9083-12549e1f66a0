# Your First Run: What to Expect

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through **activating uBO Scope**, visiting a test webpage, and confirming its operation by observing the toolbar badge and popup. By the end of this tutorial, you'll confidently verify that the extension is properly monitoring network connections on webpages.

---

## 1. Activate uBO Scope in Your Browser

If you have just installed uBO Scope, it will be ready to use immediately. To ensure it is active:

- Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It shows the uBO Scope logo.
- If you don’t see it, check your browser’s extensions menu and pin uBO Scope for quick access.
- **No special configuration is needed to start using uBO Scope.**

<Tip>
The extension operates in the background and automatically monitors all network connections made by webpages you visit.
</Tip>

## 2. Visit a Test Webpage

To see uBO Scope in action:

1. Open a new browser tab.
2. Visit a typical, content-rich website (for example, https://news.ycombinator.com or https://example.com).
3. Allow the page to fully load all resources.

<u>Why this matters:</u> uBO Scope uses the browser’s webRequest API to track all network connections as pages load and update the information continuously.

<Note>
Choosing a normal webpage with multiple resource requests helps uBO Scope detect and display a meaningful count of connected domains.
</Note>

## 3. Check the Toolbar Badge

Once the test page has loaded:

- Look at the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- You should see a **badge with a number** displayed on or near the icon.
- This number represents the **count of distinct third-party remote domains contacted** by the current webpage.

<Check>

- If the badge shows a number greater than zero, uBO Scope is actively monitoring network requests.
- If there is no badge or the number is zero, try refreshing the page or visiting another website to confirm.

</Check>

<Tip>
The badge count excludes first-party domains (the site you are visiting) and focuses on third-party connections, revealing external servers the page contacted.
</Tip>

## 4. Open and Explore the Popup Interface

To dive deeper into the connection data:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
2. This opens the extension popup displaying three sections:
   - **Not Blocked:** Domains that were allowed through.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains blocked covertly (often by network-level or stealth mechanisms).
   - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked.

3. At the top, you will see the count of all connected domains.
4. Each section lists the domains, with a count badge showing the number of connections per domain.

### What you should see

- The popup header shows the current page’s hostname and domain.
- Domains are grouped by their connection outcome.
- Counts update dynamically as you browse.

<Info>
The popup is your window into how network requests are categorized and recorded by uBO Scope, providing transparent, real-time insights.
</Info>

## 5. Verify Expected Behavior

To confirm everything is functioning:

- Reload the test webpage and watch the badge number update.
- Open the popup again to see updated domain lists.
- Switch to another tab or website and verify the badge count reflects that tab’s connections.

If the badge updates and popup shows domain counts as expected, uBO Scope is working correctly.

<Warning>
If you do not see any updates or the popup shows "NO DATA," verify you have granted necessary permissions during installation and that your browser supports the webRequest API fully. Refer to the troubleshooting guides if problems persist.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Your First Run">
<Accordion title="No Badge or Count Showing">
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and not disabled by the browser or another extension.
- Refresh the webpage to trigger network request tracking.
- Confirm you are visiting a page that makes network requests over HTTP or HTTPS.
- Restart the browser if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA">
- Wait a few seconds after opening the popup; data loads asynchronously.
- Make sure the active tab is a webpage (not a browser internal page).
- Check browser console for errors by inspecting the popup (advanced).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Number Does Not Change When Navigating">
- Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements noted in the system requirements.
- Check that no policies or blockers disable webRequest API access.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Additional Tips

- **Frequent use**: Regularly check the badge count to understand your browsing’s external network connections.
- **Correlate with content blockers**: Combine uBO Scope with blockers like uBlock Origin to compare allowed/blocked connections.
- **Privacy awareness**: Use uBO Scope insights to identify unexpected third-party connections.
