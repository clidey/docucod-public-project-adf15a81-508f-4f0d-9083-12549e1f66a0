# Validating uBO Scope Is Working

This guide walks you through straightforward steps to ensure that uBO Scope is correctly monitoring your network requests and providing accurate connection reports. By browsing websites, verifying the toolbar badge, and inspecting connection details in the popup, you will confirm that the extension operates as intended.

---

## 1. Verify uBO Scope Extension is Installed and Enabled

Before validating functionality, make sure uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled in your browser.

1. Open your browser's extension or add-on manager.
2. Locate `uBO Scope` in the list.
3. Check that the extension is enabled and the version is 1.0.1 or later.

If not installed, refer to the [Installing uBO Scope](../../installation-and-setup/installing-extension) guide for step-by-step instructions.

<Check>
Ensure uBO Scope is active in your browser before proceeding to validation.
</Check>

## 2. Confirm Toolbar Badge Reflects Network Activity

The toolbar badge on the uBO Scope icon reports the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected by the current webpage. Here's how to check it:

1. Navigate to a popular website known to connect to multiple third-party domains, such as https://www.wikipedia.org or https://www.nytimes.com.
2. Observe the uBO Scope toolbar icon:
   - A numeric badge appears, representing the current count of connected distinct third-party domains.
   - If the badge is empty (no number), no third-party connections were detected.

### Tips:
- A higher number indicates more third-party server connections.
- If you visit a minimal site (e.g., a basic text page), expect a low or zero count.

<Note>
The badge does not count blocked or stealth-blocked domains; it only reports allowed connections.
</Note>

## 3. Review Connection Details in the Popup

To gain in-depth insight into what uBO Scope is tracking, open the popup window.

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup will display the following sections:
   - **not blocked**: Domains that had successful connections
   - **stealth-blocked**: Domains that were blocked stealthily
   - **blocked**: Domains with explicitly blocked connections
3. Check the **domains connected** summary at the top, which matches the badge count.
4. Review domain lists and the connection counts next to each domain.

### What to Expect:
- The domain list reflects third-party resource connections made by the active webpage.
- The counts next to domains correspond to the number of connections established to that domain.

<Warning>
If "NO DATA" appears or the popup is empty, uBO Scope may not have permission or the webpage did not initiate network requests.
</Warning>

## 4. Perform a Quick Test Walkthrough

Follow these steps to validate live monitoring:

1. Open a new tab and navigate to https://www.wikipedia.org.
2. Watch the toolbar badge update as the page loads; it should show a number indicating detected third-party domains.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup and verify:
   - The page's hostname and domain are displayed.
   - The list of allowed domains includes multiple entries.
4. Visit a very simple webpage (one that does not load third-party content).
5. Confirm the toolbar badge clears or shows zero.
6. Reload the page and see the badge update accurately.

<Check>
Successful dynamic updating of the badge and detailed popup information confirms uBO Scope is monitoring network requests correctly.
</Check>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Badge Does Not Update or Remains Blank">
- Confirm uBO Scope has all browser permissions, especially `webRequest` and `activeTab`.
- Reload the webpage or restart your browser.
- Verify the webpage you are browsing actually makes network requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Empty">
- Ensure the popup finishes loading (no spinner).
- Refresh the page and try again.
- Disable any conflicting extensions that might interfere with uBO Scope.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Counts Seem Incorrect or Outdated">
- Reload the webpage to reset session data tracking.
- Clear browser cache or restart the browser.
- Check for extension updates.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Confirming Successful Validation

Once:
- The toolbar badge shows a numeric count on web pages with third-party content,
- The popup displays detailed domain connections split by their outcomes (not blocked, stealth-blocked, blocked),
- The summary count matches the badge number,

You can be confident that uBO Scope is functioning as designed.
