# Understanding the Badge and Popup

uBO Scope empowers you with transparent insight into the network activity of the web pages you visit. This guide explains how to interpret the toolbar icon badge and the popup window, so you can assess third-party connections effectively and protect your privacy.

---

## 1. What the Toolbar Badge Represents

- The badge on uBO Scope's toolbar icon shows a **count of distinct third-party remote servers connected to by the current page**.
- This number reflects the total **unique third-party domains** for which the browser made network connections — regardless of the content blocking extensions or filters applied.
- A **lower badge count is preferable**, indicating fewer third-party connections, hence better privacy.

### Why Focus on Third-Party Domains?

Third-party remote servers generally represent external entities that web pages contact. Monitoring these helps you understand your exposure to tracking and data sharing. Keep in mind that not all third-parties are problematic; common ones include Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for legitimate resources.

> **Tip:** A high badge count might indicate excessive third-party requests, which could affect privacy and page load times.

## 2. Breakdown of Connection Categories in the Popup

Click the toolbar icon to open the uBO Scope popup. It reveals detailed counts and categorizations of connection outcomes:

### a. Allowed (Not Blocked)
- **Definition:** Third-party domains for which network connections were successfully established.
- **Significance:** These connections represent data fetched from third parties, potentially allowing resource loading or tracking.
- The badge number corresponds directly to the count of these allowed domains.

### b. Stealth-Blocked
- **Definition:** Requests that were redirected or suppressed stealthily by the browser or content blockers, without explicit block notifications.
- **Use case:** This category reveals connections silently blocked to reduce webpage breakage or detection by scripts.

### c. Blocked
- **Definition:** Requests that failed or were explicitly blocked, such as those denied by content blockers or network errors.
- **Significance:** Though blocked, the popup shows these to provide a full picture of attempted connections.

Each category section lists involved domains with the number of requests made.

> **Best Practice:** Review all categories to understand your full third-party exposure during browsing.

## 3. How to Read the Popup Layout

The popup window is divided into three distinct sections:

- **Summary:** Displays the total count of connected domains at the top.
- **Outcome Sections:** Separate blocks titled "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked" list domains grouped by their status.
- **Domain Rows:** Each row shows a domain name and a badge count of how many requests were made to it.

Domains are sorted alphabetically within each section for easy scanning.

### Visual cues:

- Green highlights emphasize allowed connections.
- Red highlights appear on stealth-blocked and blocked sections indicating potential privacy-sensitive activity.

## 4. Practical Example

Imagine navigating to a news website:

1. The toolbar badge shows **12**, meaning 12 distinct third-party domains had successful connections.
2. Opening the popup, you see:
   - **Not Blocked:** 12 domains listed including known CDNs or ad networks.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** 3 domains silently blocked.
   - **Blocked:** 5 domains explicitly blocked.

This layout helps you understand what third parties successfully loaded content, which were silently blocked, and which were entirely stopped.

> **Insight:** If you notice unexpected or suspicious third-party domains under "not blocked," consider tightening your content blocker settings.

## 5. Common User Scenarios and Guidance

### Scenario: Large Badge Count
- Investigate domains listed under the popup's allowed section.
- Identify if legitimate CDNs or analytics services are inflating the count.
- Use stealth-blocked and blocked lists to verify if your blockers are effectively reducing exposure.

### Scenario: No Data or Empty Popup
- This typically means the current tab has no recorded third-party connections yet.
- Refresh the page or navigate to an active website.
- Ensure uBO Scope has been granted the required permissions (see the first launch guide).

### Scenario: Frequent Changes in Counts
- Page navigation or AJAX-driven content loading may dynamically change connections.
- The badge updates in real time, reflecting the current network state.

## 6. Tips for Effective Use

- **Regularly monitor the badge:** Frequent spikes can hint at increased third-party tracking.
- **Use the popup as a privacy audit:** Understand which domains your browser contacts and adjust your blocker rules accordingly.
- **Remember context:** Some third parties are essential (like CDN providers). Identify normal versus suspicious domains.

## 7. Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting the Badge and Popup">
<Accordion title="Badge Count is Blank or Missing">
- Ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Check that your browser supports the required permissions (`webRequest`).
- Refresh the active page to trigger connection logging.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or No Domains">
- This means no network requests have been recorded for the active tab.
- Try reloading the page or ensuring it’s a website that makes remote connections.
- Verify uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (see First Launch and Permissions).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Count Does Not Seem to Update">
- Badge updates occur after network requests complete; wait a few seconds.
- Disable conflicting extensions that might interfere with `webRequest` API.
- Restart your browser if persistent issues occur.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
