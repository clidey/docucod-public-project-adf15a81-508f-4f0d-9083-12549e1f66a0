# Troubleshooting and Validation

When starting your journey with uBO Scope, ensuring the extension runs properly and provides accurate data is fundamental. This page equips you with practical troubleshooting steps and validation techniques to quickly identify and resolve common installation or usage issues. Following these instructions will help you confirm that uBO Scope is capturing network connection data correctly and reporting it as intended.

---

## 1. Verifying uBO Scope is Running

Before diving into troubleshooting, confirm that the extension is active and functioning.

### Step 1: Check Extension Installation
- **Browser Toolbar**: Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It should display the extension’s recognizable badge symbol.
- **Popup Access**: Click the icon. The popup panel should open displaying connection data for the current tab.

### Step 2: Confirm Permissions
- uBO Scope requires these permissions to operate:
  - `webRequest` to monitor network activity
  - `storage` to keep session data
  - `activeTab` to access the current tab data
- Verify via your browser’s extensions page that uBO Scope has these permissions granted.

### Step 3: Confirm Background Process is Active
- Depending on your browser:
  - In Chromium-based browsers, check the service worker for the extension is running.
  - In Firefox and Safari, ensure the background script or module is loaded.

### Step 4: Verify Manifest Settings
- The extension manifest includes required host permissions (e.g., `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`). These enable uBO Scope to track network requests broadly.

<Tip>
If uBO Scope does not appear in your toolbar, confirm it is enabled in the browser’s extension management page and that it is compatible with your browser version.

## 2. Diagnosing Common Installation Issues

### Issue: Badge Does Not Update or Shows No Data

**Solution:**
1. Reload the browser or restart to refresh the extension.
2. Open the popup on an active browsing tab and verify that the domains list populates.
3. Check if the webRequest API is supported by your browser and enabled.

### Issue: No Network Connections Reported

**Solution:**
- Ensure you are visiting sites that generate third-party network requests.
- Disable conflicting extensions that may block or interfere with webRequest listeners.
- Confirm the extension is not blocked by browser policies or antivirus software.

### Issue: Extension Does Not Appear in Browser

**Solution:**
- Verify installation completed successfully (see Installation Instructions).
- Make sure your browser is at or above the minimum supported version.
- Check that the manifest file configuration corresponds to your browser (e.g., service worker for Chromium).

## 3. Using the Popup for Validation

The popup interface is your window into uBO Scope’s gathered data.

### Validation Steps:

1. **Open the uBO Scope Popup** by clicking its toolbar icon.
2. **Review the Top Hostname** — the heading shows the current tab’s hostname and domain.
3. **Check Domains Connected Count** — the summary displays how many distinct third-party domains were contacted.
4. **Inspect Categorized Domains:**
   - **Not Blocked:** Domains where network requests succeeded.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were hidden or blocked stealthily.
   - **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked domains by the content blocker or other means.

<Note>
A higher count of connected third-party domains indicates more external servers contacted, which may raise privacy considerations.
</Note>

## 4. Practical Troubleshooting Tips

### Tip 1: Reload the Current Tab for Fresh Data
Network activity is monitored live; refreshing the page ensures uBO Scope captures a complete session.

### Tip 2: Observe the Toolbar Badge
The badge number reflects the count of distinct third-party domains contacted in the active tab. If this number never changes, it may indicate no data collection.

### Tip 3: Test with Known Websites
Visit well-known sites that load multiple resources (e.g., news sites, social platforms) to confirm domain counts increase accordingly.

### Tip 4: Check Browser Console Logs
Access developer tools console to look for any error messages related to uBO Scope, such as message passing failures or permission issues.

### Tip 5: Disable Other Content Blockers Temporarily
Interference from other extensions can prevent uBO Scope from receiving accurate network request data.

<Tip>
If you suspect an issue with your browser's webRequest API support, consult browser-specific documentation or try an alternate supported browser.
</Tip>

## 5. Verifying Data Persistence and Session Handling

uBO Scope maintains a session store mapping tab IDs to observed network outcomes.

- Closing a tab automatically clears its session data.
- Session data persists during browser runtime but is cleared on restart.

To test session persistence:

1. Open multiple tabs and observe different badge counts.
2. Close a tab and reopen the popup; the data for that tab should be cleared.

## Summary
By following these actionable validation and troubleshooting steps, you will ensure that uBO Scope is correctly installed, configured, and functioning as intended. Confirming its presence, permissions, popup data, and session management will provide confidence that you are receiving accurate insight into your browser’s network connections.
