# Using the Extension for the First Time

Get ready to unlock immediate insights about third-party connections with uBO Scope. This guide walks you through your initial experience—opening the extension popup, observing real-time connection counts, and understanding what these reveal about network requests to remote servers. By following these actionable steps, you'll quickly grasp how uBO Scope sheds light on your browser's connectivity landscape.

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

Your journey begins with accessing the uBO Scope interface to start monitoring connections.

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the Extension Icon">
Find the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It typically displays as a small shield or badge labeled 'uBO Scope'.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Icon to Open Popup">
Click the icon once. This action opens the uBO Scope popup window—a dashboard summarizing third-party domain connections for your active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Popup Loading State">
Initially, you will see a loading indicator. This means uBO Scope is gathering connection data for the current tab. Be patient; data typically appears within a few seconds.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If the popup does not open or appears blank, verify that the extension is properly installed and enabled in your browser's extensions page.
</Note>

## 2. Understanding the Connection Counts Displayed

Once the popup loads, you'll see a clean summary of connection outcomes grouped into three categories:

### Key Sections in the Popup Interface

- **Tab Hostname:** Displays the domain of the active browser tab in Unicode format, providing clarity about the website you are inspecting.

- **Domains Connected:** The total number of distinct third-party domains contacted during page load or interaction.

- **Not Blocked:** Lists third-party domains your browser connected to successfully.

- **Stealth-Blocked:** Shows domains where connections were stealthily blocked, indicating hidden blocking attempts by content blockers or filters.

- **Blocked:** Lists domains for which connections were actively blocked, typically by your content blocker or network filter.

Each domain row shows the domain name and the number of connections attempted or succeeded.

<Steps>
<Step title="Read the Total Domain Count">
Check the "domains connected" summary section at the top. This number represents distinct third-party domains contacted; lower counts generally indicate stronger privacy protection.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Categorized Domains">
Scroll through each category (not blocked, stealth-blocked, blocked) to see which third parties fall under each outcome.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Domain Counts">
Numbers next to each domain show how many times your browser connected or attempted to connect to that domain in the current tab session.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Pay special attention to the "stealth-blocked" list—it reveals connections that might bypass typical blocking logs, providing deeper insight into network activity that some blockers might mask.
</Tip>

## 3. What uBO Scope Reveals About Third-Party Servers

By using uBO Scope for the first time, you gain immediate visibility into the web ecosystem behind the scenes. Here's what the extension reveals:

- **Real connection activity** independent of your content blocker, showing what servers your browser actually reaches.

- **Outcome distinctions** between successful, stealth-blocked, and actively blocked connections.

- **Badge count importance:** The toolbar icon's badge number reflects the count of unique third-party domains contacted, helping you quickly assess third-party exposure.

<Note>
Remember: A higher badge count means more third-party domains contacted, which may indicate greater privacy exposure. Conversely, a lower count suggests fewer external connections.
</Note>

## 4. Step-by-Step First Use Scenario

Follow this example to see uBO Scope in action:

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to a website">
Open your browser and load a website you wish to inspect (e.g., a news site or social media platform).
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar to open the popup panel.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine the domain summary">
View the number of domains connected and the categorization in allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked sections.
</Step>
<Step title="Investigate suspicious domains">
What domains surprise you? Domains you don’t recognize could be trackers or ad servers.
</Step>
<Step title="Close the popup and switch tabs">
Browse to another tab; uBO Scope updates its data per active tab, so opening the popup again will show fresh connection information.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Refreshing the page or navigating within the tab updates connection data automatically. Reopen the popup anytime to see the latest connection counts.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common First-Time Issues

If you encounter difficulties during first use, try the following:

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting"
>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Remains Blank">
- Ensure the extension has permission to access the active tab.
- Refresh the active tab's webpage to trigger data collection.
- Verify your browser is compatible (See Prerequisites and System Requirements).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Badge Count Appears on Toolbar Icon">
- Check that uBO Scope is enabled in your extension manager.
- Confirm your browser supports the required APIs (primarily webRequest API).
- Try restarting your browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Counts Seem Frozen or Don't Update">
- Close and reopen the popup.
- Switch to another tab and back.
- Refresh the current tab’s page.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Sometimes firewalls or network policies can interfere with the extension’s ability to monitor requests. Ensure your environment allows the browser to use the webRequest API.
</Warning>
