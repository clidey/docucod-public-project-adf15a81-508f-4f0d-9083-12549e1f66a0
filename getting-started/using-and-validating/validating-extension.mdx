# Quick Validation: Is uBO Scope Working?

Ensure uBO Scope is correctly monitoring your browser's network connections by following these simple validation steps. This guide helps you confirm that the toolbar badge counts third-party domains accurately and that network requests are tracked regardless of your content blocker or DNS configuration.

---

## 1. Initial Setup Verification

Before you proceed, ensure uBO Scope is installed and has the necessary permissions granted. If not already done, review the [Installing uBO Scope](../installation-and-setup/installing-extension) and [Initial Configuration & Permissions](../installation-and-setup/initial-configuration) guides.


## 2. Validate Network Request Tracking

### Step 1: Visit Known Test Websites

Start by visiting websites that are known to connect to multiple third-party domains.

- Example test sites include press pages, news outlets, or privacy-focused sites known for third-party content.
- For instance, open sites such as `https://www.nytimes.com/` or `https://www.bbc.com/` in a new browser tab.

### Step 2: Observe the Toolbar Badge

- After the page fully loads, observe the uBO Scope extension toolbar icon.
- The badge number indicates the count of distinct third-party remote servers with connections allowed.

### Expected Outcome:

- The badge displays a number greater than zero when third-party connections occur.
- A badge with no number (empty) means no distinct third-party connections were detected.

### Step 3: Compare with the Popup Panel

Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.

- Verify that the popup lists third-party domains categorized as **Allowed**, **Stealth**, or **Blocked**.
- The total count of allowed third-party domains matches the badge number.


## 3. Validate Independent Tracking from Other Content Blockers

This extension reports on network requests regardless of how your other content blockers or DNS services operate.

### Step 1: Enable or Disable Other Content Blockers

- Temporarily enable or disable your primary content blocker (e.g., uBlock Origin, AdGuard).
- Refresh the test website.

### Step 2: Observe uBO Scope Badge and Popup

- Confirm that uBO Scope still tracks network requests and updates connectivity counts accordingly.

### Expected Outcome:

- uBO Scope reports network requests independent of other blockers.
- Badge and popup details update in line with actual network connection outcomes.


## 4. Validate Functionality Across Different Browsers

uBO Scope supports Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers.

- Perform the same validation steps in the browser where the extension is installed.
- Confirm that badge counts and popup details behave consistently.

Refer to the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](../installation-and-setup/prerequisites-requirements) for supported browser versions.


## 5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Badge Not Updating:** If the badge does not update, confirm the extension is enabled and has required permissions.
- **Zero Count on Known Sites:** If visiting popular sites yields zero badge count, try disabling VPNs, proxies, or restrictive network settings.
- **Popup Empty or Not Opening:** Refresh the page or restart the browser; ensure uBO Scope is running.


## 6. Troubleshooting Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Stuck or Not Updating">
- Reload the tab.
- Restart the browser.
- Check permissions for storage and webRequest.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data">
- Ensure you are viewing the popup for an active browser tab.
- Try closing and reopening the popup.
- Reinstall the extension if issues persist.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension Not Tracking Requests">
- Verify that uBO Scope has host permissions for all URLs (http, https, ws, wss).
- Check for conflicts with other extensions blocking webRequest API access.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 7. Verification Summary

- Badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers with allowed connections for the current tab.
- Popup panel displays allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains separated by outcome.
- Network tracking works regardless of other extensions or DNS-based blocking.


## 8. Next Steps

- Explore [Using the Popup Panel](../using-and-validating/using-popup) to learn how to interpret detailed network data.
- If issues persist, consult [Troubleshooting Installation & First Run](../using-and-validating/troubleshooting-setup).
- Review [Core Concepts and Terminology](../../overview/key-concepts-architecture/core-terms-model) for deeper understanding of request outcomes.
