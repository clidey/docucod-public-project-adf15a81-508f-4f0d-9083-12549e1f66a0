# Troubleshooting Installation & First Run

This guide helps you resolve the most common issues encountered during the installation and initial operation of uBO Scope. Whether you are facing permission problems, missing interface elements like the popup panel or badge, or browser-specific restrictions, this page provides clear, actionable steps to get you back on track quickly.

---

## 1. Common Installation & Permission Issues

### Verify Required Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network traffic and operate correctly:

- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to access data from the current browser tab.
- **storage**: Enables saving and reading session data to remember tracked connections.
- **webRequest**: Critical to intercept and analyze network requests.
- **host permissions**: Full access to URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`) and WebSocket URLs where applicable.

#### How to Check:

1. Open your browser's extension management page.
2. Locate uBO Scope and view its permissions.
3. Ensure all the above permissions are granted.

<Tip>
If any permission is missing, particularly `webRequest` or host access, the extension might fail silently or not show expected data.
</Tip>

### Permission Granting Steps

- After installation, some browsers prompt to grant permissions explicitly. Accept these to enable full functionality.
- In browsers like Firefox or Chrome, you can manually configure host permissions under the extension details.

<Warning>
Denial of any required permission will cause the extension to malfunction or display no results.
</Warning>

### Troubleshooting Permission Errors

- **Extension not requesting permissions automatically?**
  - Remove and reinstall the extension.
  - On reinstallation, promptly accept permission requests.

- **Manifest or version issues:**
  - Confirm you are using a supported browser version (e.g., Chrome ≥ 122, Firefox ≥ 128, Safari ≥ 18.5).
  - Refer to [Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/prerequisites-requirements) for details.

## 2. Missing Popup Panel or Toolbar Badge

### Confirm Extension Icon Visibility

- Make sure the uBO Scope icon is visible in the browser toolbar.
- If hidden, manually pin it:
  - In Chrome or Edge: Use the extensions toggle to "pin" the icon.
  - In Firefox: Manage toolbar icons by drag-and-drop.

### Popup Panel Not Opening or Empty

- Try clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- If the popup does not display or shows "NO DATA":
  1. Reload the current tab.
  2. Open the popup again.

<Tip>
The popup shows data per active tab. Switching tabs or opening new tabs without network activity will not display detailed results.
</Tip>

### Badge Not Displaying Counts

- The badge indicates the number of distinct third-party remote servers allowed on a given tab.
- If badge is blank:
  - Confirm the current tab is actively loading or has loaded network content.
  - Other browser extensions or strict privacy settings may block `webRequest` access.

### Conflicts with Other Extensions

- uBO Scope is designed to integrate side-by-side with content blockers like uBlock Origin.
- Some extensions or privacy settings may block uBO Scope's monitoring by restricting permissions.

<Warning>
Conflicting or security-centric privacy extensions might prevent uBO Scope from monitoring requests, causing missing badge or popup data.
</Warning>

## 3. Browser-Related Limitations & Solutions

### Supported Browsers & Minimal Versions

- **Chrome**: Version 122 and later
- **Firefox**: Version 128 and later
- **Safari**: Version 18.5 and later

Older browser versions lack support for required APIs (such as Manifest V3 capabilities and full `webRequest` access) and will not work.

### Safari-Specific Notes

- uBO Scope runs as a Safari Web Extension.
- Ensure you have enabled the extension explicitly in Safari preferences.

### WebRequest API Restrictions

- Some browsers may limit access to network requests initiated by certain pages or protocols.
- uBO Scope relies on the browser's webRequest API, so limitations or restrictions here affect data completeness.

<Tip>
If network events are missing, try running uBO Scope alongside minimal other extensions to isolate conflicts.
</Tip>

## 4. Restarting or Resetting the Extension

If issues persist, restarting or resetting uBO Scope often resolves temporary problems related to state or stale data.

### Restart uBO Scope

1. Disable the extension in your browser's extension manager.
2. Close the popup panel if open.
3. Re-enable the extension.
4. Reload the active tabs under observation.

### Reset Session Data

To clear internal session data that tracks tab network activity:

1. Open the browser console for the extension (if supported).
2. Alternatively, uninstall and reinstall uBO Scope to reset all stored states.

<Note>
There is no dedicated UI for reset; reinstalling guarantees a fresh state.
</Note>

### Refresh Tabs

After restart or reset, refresh all web pages to gather fresh network data.

## 5. Additional Troubleshooting Tips

### Check Console for Errors

- Open Developer Tools (F12 or equivalent).
- Switch to the Console tab.
- Review any errors related to uBO Scope, especially warnings about permissions or missing resources.

### Confirm Manifest Permissions Match Expected

- Manifest files for the browser you use include explicit host permissions and APIs:
  - Chrome manifest includes `host_permissions` for HTTP, HTTPS, and WS URLs.
  - Firefox manifest similarly defines required permissions.
  - Check the manifest to verify no permissions are missing.

<Tip>
Refer to the [Installing uBO Scope](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/installing-extension) and [Initial Configuration & Permissions](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/initial-configuration) pages for detailed setup context.
</Tip>
