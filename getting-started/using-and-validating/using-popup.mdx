# Using the Popup Panel

Explore the main interface of uBO Scope by opening the extension popup. This guide walks you through accessing the popup panel, interpreting the domain connection data it presents, and understanding the summarized statuses of network requests such as allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.

---

## 1. Opening the Popup Panel

The Popup Panel is your gateway to live insights about the network connections your browser makes for the active tab.

### Steps to Open the Popup Panel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Icon">
    After installing uBO Scope, look for its icon in your browser's toolbar. It typically shows a badge count indicating the current number of unique third-party domains connected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the Icon to Open the Popup">
    Click the uBO Scope icon once to open the popup panel. This action instantly displays detailed connection data for the active tab.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the popup panel shows 'NO DATA' or appears empty, refresh the active tab and try opening the popup again. Data is collected per tab and refreshed dynamically.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Panel Interface

The popup layout is clear and structured to provide quick insights into your active tab’s remote server connections.

### Key Components

- **Host Section (Top Header)**
  - Displays the exact hostname and domain of the active tab.
  - For internationalized domains, punycode is converted back to Unicode for readable display.

- **Summary Section**
  - Shows the total number of distinct domains connected to from the active tab.

- **Outcome Sections** (three distinct categories):
  1. **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
     - Lists third-party domains your browser successfully connected to.
     - Indicates resources that were allowed by content blockers or no-blockers.
  2. **Stealth-Blocked**
     - Shows domains for connections that were silently redirected or 'stealth-blocked' without explicit blocking errors.
     - This means connection attempts occurred but were suppressed discreetly.
  3. **Blocked**
     - Lists domains where connection requests explicitly failed or were blocked by your content blocker or network settings.

- **Domain Rows**
  - Each domain entry shows:
    - Domain name (Unicode for internationalized domains)
    - The count of connection attempts made to that domain in the active tab

### Visual Overview Example

```plaintext
+------------------------------------+
| active host: sub.example.com       |
| domain: example.com                 |
+------------------------------------+
| domains connected: 15              |
+------------------------------------+
| NOT BLOCKED                       |
| * cdn.examplecdn.com (12)          |
| * fonts.provider.net (3)           |
+------------------------------------+
| STEALTH-BLOCKED                   |
| * tracker.silentblocker.com (2)   |
+------------------------------------+
| BLOCKED                          |
| * ads.badserver.net (5)            |
+------------------------------------+
```

## 3. How to Interpret Domain Connection Data

### Allowed Connections (Not Blocked)

These domains represent third-party servers your browser fetched resources from successfully. A low count here typically suggests tighter content blocking or fewer third-party dependencies.

### Stealth-Blocked Domains

This section indicates domains where connection attempts were redirected or stealthily suppressed. Such stealth blocking means that requests were intercepted and quietly prevented, possibly to avoid page breakage or detection by webpages.

### Blocked Domains

Domains explicitly blocked by content blockers or network policies are listed here. Requests to these domains returned errors or failed to load.

### Domain Counts

Numbers next to each domain reflect how many times requests were made to that particular domain in the active tab. This helps gauge the activity and prevalence of specific third-party connections.

<Note>
Remember, the badge count on the toolbar icon corresponds to the number of distinct third-party domains in the "Allowed" category, not the total number of requests or blocked domains.
</Note>

## 4. Practical Tips for Using the Popup Panel

- **Use the popup to verify what third-party domains your browser reaches on any webpage** — especially useful for understanding privacy exposure.

- **Check stealth-blocked domains to uncover connections that content blockers suppress silently**; these could indicate trackers or scripts circumventing standard blocking.

- **Block counts help identify problematic or unwanted domains but always consider the allowed domains count to understand net exposure.**

- **Internationalized domains will display in readable Unicode instead of punycode encoding, improving clarity.**

- **Frequent refreshes of the page will update the popup data, reflecting new active connections dynamically.**

<Warning>
The popup only shows data for the currently active tab. If you switch tabs or windows, close and reopen the popup to load relevant information.
</Warning>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Popup Panel Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Empty">
If the popup displays 'NO DATA' or lacks any domain information:

- Ensure the active tab has finished loading.
- Reload the tab to trigger fresh network connection monitoring.
- Verify that uBO Scope has required permissions and that the extension is enabled.
- See the "Troubleshooting Installation & First Run" page for more support.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Numbers Don’t Match What You Expect">
If the domain counts or statuses seem off:

- Recall that the extension counts unique third-party domains, not all requests.
- Allowed domains relate only to domains with successful connections.
- Differences may arise due to how content blockers or other extensions handle requests.
- Refresh the tab and popup, and consult the "Quick Validation" page to confirm correct operation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Not Opening or Extension Is Unresponsive">
- Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Restart the browser.
- Reinstall the extension if issues persist.
- Confirm extension permissions (activeTab, storage, webRequest) are granted.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
