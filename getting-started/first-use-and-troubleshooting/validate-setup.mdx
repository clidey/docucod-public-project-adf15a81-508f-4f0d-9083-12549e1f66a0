# Quick Validation Steps for uBO Scope

This guide provides straightforward procedures to verify that uBO Scope is actively monitoring and reporting network connections correctly in your browser. By following these steps, you will gain confidence that the extension is functioning as intended, providing accurate insights into third-party server connections.

---

## 1. Check the Toolbar Icon Badge

The uBO Scope toolbar icon uses a badge to display the number of distinct third-party domains that have been contacted by the active tab.

### How to Validate:

- Look at the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser's toolbar.
- Confirm you see a badge number (a small overlay number).
- The number represents the count of unique third-party remote servers connected in the active tab.

### What It Means:

- A **non-empty badge** indicates the extension is capturing network requests.
- A **blank or missing badge** may mean no third-party connections have occurred or the extension is not active on the current tab.

<Tip>
If the badge shows zero (or is missing), try navigating to a website with known external content (e.g., a news site with ads or CDN-hosted scripts) to trigger third-party requests.
</Tip>

## 2. Review the Extension Popup Window

The uBO Scope popup provides detailed information about connections made by the active tab, categorized by outcome: "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked".

### Accessing the Popup:

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- The popup will open, showing the hostname of the current tab and a summary of domains connected.

### Key Validation Points:

- **Hostname and Domain:** Verify the hostname displayed corresponds to the active tab's website.
- **Domains Connected:** The summary count shows the number of distinct connected domains.
- **Connection Categories:** The 3 sections list domains categorized by their network request outcome:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains successfully contacted.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains stealthily blocked by content blocker mechanisms.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where network requests were explicitly blocked.

### Expected Behavior:

- You should see domain entries in these categories reflecting real network activity.
- If all categories are empty or the popup shows "NO DATA", the extension may not be actively monitoring the tab or there are no network connections.

<Warning>
Popup data refreshes only for the active tab. Switch tabs or reload the current page to trigger data updates.
</Warning>

## 3. Test on a Sample Site with Known Third-Party Connections

To be absolutely certain uBO Scope is working, perform a test visit on a site known to load external resources.

### Recommended Steps:

1. Open a new tab in your browser.
2. Navigate to a well-known site that loads third-party content, such as [https://example.com](https://example.com) (this is a basic placeholder site, so for better results try content-heavy news sites or popular social media platforms).
3. Observe the uBO Scope toolbar badge:
   - It should update to reflect the count of third-party servers contacted.
4. Open the uBO Scope popup and verify domain lists are populated accordingly.

### Why This Matters:

- Network activity on common sites guarantees uBO Scope's listeners are correctly intercepting web requests.
- It confirms the extension visibility and reporting are working across various network outcomes.

<Tip>
Reload the page if you see empty data after the initial visit. Extensions sometimes need the page to fully complete network activity to report.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **No badge number appears?**
  - Ensure uBO Scope extension is enabled.
  - Confirm you have navigated to an HTTP(S) or WebSocket page (the extension monitors only these protocols).
  - Try disabling other extensions that might interfere with webRequest APIs.

- **Popup shows "NO DATA" or empty sections?**
  - Reload the active page.
  - Confirm the tab is selected and active.
  - Try visiting a different website to generate traffic.

- **Badge count looks unexpectedly high or low?**
  - Remember the count is for distinct third-party domains contacted—not the number of blocked requests.
  - A lower number usually indicates fewer third-party connections, which is generally preferable.

## Summary

By following these quick validation steps, you ensure that uBO Scope is correctly monitoring the active tab's network requests and categorizing domains by their connection outcome. This verification assures you of the extension's operational status and accuracy.

Next, explore the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](./troubleshooting-common-issues) guide if you encounter persistent problems, or review the [Your First Run](./first-run-experience) walkthrough for a broader understanding of the extension's user interface and interpretation of its reports.
