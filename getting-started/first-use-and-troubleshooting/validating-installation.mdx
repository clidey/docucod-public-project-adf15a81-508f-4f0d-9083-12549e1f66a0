# Validating Your Installation

Ensure uBO Scope is correctly installed and actively monitoring network requests by verifying its behavior on a live webpage. This guide walks you through opening the extension interface, interpreting badge counts, and checking the connection summary to confirm functional monitoring from the start.

---

## 1. Open the uBO Scope Extension Popup

1. Navigate to any live webpage (e.g., https://example.com).
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser's extension area. This will open the popup interface showing network connection details for the current tab.

<Tip>
If you do not see the uBO Scope icon, ensure the extension is enabled and visible in your browser’s toolbar according to your browser's extension management guidelines.
</Tip>

## 2. Understand the Badge Count on the Toolbar Icon

- The badge count represents the number of distinct **third-party remote server domains** contacted from the current webpage.
- A **lower number indicates fewer unique third-party connections**, which often means a reduced privacy exposure.

<Info>
Remember, uBO Scope counts unique third-party domains connected to, not the total number of requests or blocked counts. This provides a clearer privacy measure.
</Info>

## 3. Interpret the Connection Summary in the Popup

Upon opening the popup, you will see:

### Hostname and Domain Header
- Displays the current page’s hostname and registered domain.

### Domains Connected Count
- Shows the number of distinct domains with successful connections.

### Outcome Sections
- **Not Blocked:** Domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were heuristically blocked or redirected stealthily.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.

Each section lists domains along with the count of requests attempted or allowed.

<Tip>
The popup dynamically updates as you load or reload pages, reflecting all network activity captured by the extension.
</Tip>

## 4. Perform Quick Functional Checks

### Step 1: Load a Known Website

- Open a popular website with third-party resources such as a news site or social media page.
- Open the uBO Scope popup.
- Confirm the **domains connected** count is a positive number (often you will see CDN providers and analytics domains).

### Step 2: Reload the Page

- Reload the current tab to generate new network requests.
- Watch the badge count update accordingly.
- Verify the popup reflects updated connection details accurately.

<Tip>
If the counts or lists do not update after a page reload, try closing and reopening the popup, or restarting the browser.
</Tip>

## 5. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Installation Validation Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="The uBO Scope icon badge shows no count">
- Ensure you are visiting a webpage with network requests outbound to third-party domains.
- Some internal or local pages (e.g., browser new tabs) may not generate network requests.
- Verify the extension has required permissions and is active for the site.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty lists">
- Confirm you have opened the popup on an active tab with network activity.
- Try reloading the tab or closing and reopening the popup.
- Check for browser restrictions or conflicting extensions that may interfere with webRequest API.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count never updates despite activity">
- Verify your browser version meets minimum requirements (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Restart your browser to clear any cached background service workers.
- Check browser console or extension logs for any permission errors.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Confirm Active Monitoring from the Start

By completing these validation steps, you verify that uBO Scope is:

- Successfully capturing network requests initiated by web pages.
- Correctly categorizing connection outcomes into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- Displaying accurate and up-to-date information in the popup interface.
- Reflecting distinct third-party domains through the badge count for quick privacy insight.

<Tip>
Continued use will build a reliable picture of your browsing's remote server connections; keep uBO Scope enabled on trusted sites to maintain transparency.
