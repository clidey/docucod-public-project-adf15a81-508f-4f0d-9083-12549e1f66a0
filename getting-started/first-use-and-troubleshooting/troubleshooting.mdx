# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve frequent problems encountered during the setup and use of **uBO Scope**. Whether you're seeing a missing badge, an empty popup, or installation errors, this page provides clear, actionable steps to restore reliable monitoring and reporting.

---

## 1. Badge Count Not Showing or Always Blank

### What It Means
The badge on the browser toolbar reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected. If it's missing or always blank, it means uBO Scope is not detecting or updating this data.

### Steps to Resolve
1. **Confirm uBO Scope is Installed and Enabled**
   - Open your browser's extension/add-ons page and ensure uBO Scope is both installed and enabled.
   - If recently installed, try disabling and re-enabling the extension.

2. **Verify Permissions**
   - Check that uBO Scope has all the required permissions (`activeTab`, `storage`, and especially `webRequest`).
   - Lack of permission can block network monitoring.

3. **Reload or Restart Browser**
   - Sometimes the browser needs to refresh the extension environment.
   - Restart your browser completely and revisit some active sites.

4. **Test on a Popular Website**
   - Visit a well-known website with multiple resources (e.g., `https://www.wikipedia.org`).
   - Watch if the badge updates after the page loads.

5. **Check for Conflicts**
   - Disable other extensions that may interfere with uBO Scope, especially other content blockers or privacy tools.
   - Then reload the test page.


<Warning>
If the badge remains missing or blank despite these steps, confirm your browser version supports uBO Scope as detailed in the [System Requirements](../getting-started/installation-and-setup/system-requirements) guide.
</Warning>

## 2. Popup Displays 'NO DATA' or Is Empty

### What It Means
The popup appears but shows 'NO DATA' instead of connection summaries, indicating uBO Scope isn't receiving or presenting network request details.

### Steps to Resolve
1. **Ensure You Open the Popup on an Active Tab**
   - uBO Scope reports only network data for the current active tab.
   - Switch to a tab with loaded webpage activity, then open the popup.

2. **Refresh the Page**
   - Reload the active webpage to trigger network requests and generate connection data.

3. **Confirm Background Script Is Running**
   - uBO Scope relies on its background service worker or scripts to collect data.
   - Restart your browser or disable/re-enable the extension to restart these processes.

4. **Check Network Request Monitoring is Supported**
   - Some private or incognito browsing modes block network event monitoring.
   - Make sure the browser is in a mode that allows webRequest API access, and enable extension activity in private windows if your browser supports that.

5. **Look for Errors in Browser Console**
   - Open the browser developer tools console.
   - Check for any error messages related to uBO Scope, such as issues loading resources or script errors.


<Note>
If the popup still shows no data, confirm that you have visited pages that actively connect to third-party servers. Some pages may not generate such network activity.
</Note>

## 3. Extension Fails to Install or Activate

### What It Means
Errors during installation or unresponsive extension often point to browser compatibility issues or permission restrictions.

### Steps to Resolve
1. **Check Browser Version Compatibility**
   - uBO Scope supports:
     - Chromium 122 and above
     - Firefox 128 and above
     - Safari 18.5 and above
   - Verify your browser matches these minimums.

2. **Follow Browser-Specific Installation Instructions**
   - Refer to the [Installation: Browser Guides](../getting-started/installation-and-setup/installing-on-your-browser) for detailed step-by-step install methods.

3. **Verify Manifest Permissions and Settings**
   - Confirm that the extension's manifest includes the correct permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`) and host permissions.

4. **Disable Conflicting Software**
   - Security software or system policies may block extensions.
   - Temporarily disable or whitelist uBO Scope during installation.

5. **Try Manual Installation (if applicable)**
   - Download the extension package from GitHub and load it as an unpacked extension to bypass store restrictions.


<Warning>
Do not attempt to install uBO Scope on unsupported or older browser versions; doing so can cause undefined behavior.
</Warning>

## 4. Badge Count Does Not Update After Navigation

### What It Means
The badge count should update as you navigate to different tabs or reload pages; if it doesn't, uBO Scope may not be tracking tab changes correctly.

### Steps to Resolve
1. **Reload the Browser or Extension**
   - Restart the browser to ensure the background service worker/script reloads properly.

2. **Test with Basic Browsing**
   - Open a new tab, navigate to a known site, and observe badge changes.

3. **Confirm Tab Closure Handling**
   - Extensions clear tab-specific data when tabs close.
   - Verify no browser restrictions prevent this process.

4. **Check for Browser Updates**
   - Some browser updates fix underlying webRequest or extension API issues.

## 5. No Domains Shown Under Outcomes in Popup

### What It Means
The popup sections for allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked domains are empty, indicating uBO Scope isn’t categorizing or displaying network outcomes.

### Steps to Resolve
1. **Verify Active Network Activity**
   - The current page may lack significant third-party connections.
   - Visit a complex website with multiple external resources.

2. **Reload the Page**
   - Ensure requests are recently captured.

3. **Check for Extension Script Errors**
   - Open developer console on popup or background script and watch for JavaScript errors.

4. **Clear Extension Storage**
   - Cached session data may be corrupted. Clearing the extension's storage can reset data.

```javascript
// To clear storage from the console
chrome.storage.local.clear(); // For Chromium
browser.storage.local.clear(); // For Firefox
```


<Note>
Always back up any data if necessary before clearing storage, though uBO Scope primarily deals with transient session data.
</Note>

## 6. General Tips for Reliable Usage

- Always keep your browser and uBO Scope updated to the latest supported versions.
- After installing or making changes, reload webpages to trigger fresh data collection.
- Use popular websites with diverse resources during initial testing to validate monitoring.
- If privacy or security extensions interfere, selectively disable them to isolate conflicts.
