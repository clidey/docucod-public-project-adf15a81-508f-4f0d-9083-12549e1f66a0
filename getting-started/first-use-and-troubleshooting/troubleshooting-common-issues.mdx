# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide helps you quickly resolve frequent issues you may encounter when using the uBO Scope extension. Whether you notice missing UI elements, no data shown in the popup, or unexpected permission prompts, this page will guide you through understanding and fixing these common roadblocks. Additionally, it explains why some network requests might not appear due to browser limitations.

---

## 1. Missing or Empty Popup Data

### Problem
When you open the uBO Scope popup, you see **'NO DATA'** or the domain name area is blank, and no network connections are displayed.

### Why This Happens
- The extension hasn’t yet captured any network requests for the current tab.
- The active tab has no network connections due to the nature of the page (e.g., a local file, blank page).
- Browser or extension permissions are not fully granted or enabled.

### How to Fix
<Steps>
<Step title="Reload the Webpage">
The extension displays data for the active tab only after it detects network connections. Reload the tab to trigger new requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Extension Permissions">
Ensure the extension has permission to access the current active tab and webRequest APIs. Most modern browsers will prompt for permissions upon installation. Reinstall the extension if necessary.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Supported Browsers and Versions">
Confirm you use a supported browser version (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+). Older browsers may not fully support required APIs.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The popup remains blank when viewing tabs with internal browser pages (e.g., `about:blank`, browser settings tabs) as they do not generate network requests accessible by uBO Scope.
</Note>

## 2. Toolbar Badge Shows No or Unexpected Counts

### Problem
The badge on the browser toolbar shows an empty or zero count, but you expect network activity, or the number seems unusually high or low.

### Causes
- No network connections have been registered for the current tab yet.
- The badge reflects distinct third-party domains *allowed* by content blockers, not total requests.
- Some network requests are made outside the reach of the browser's webRequest API.

### Resolution Steps
<Steps>
<Step title="Reload the Tab to Generate Requests">
Reload your webpage to ensure network requests are captured and the badge updates accordingly.
</Step>
<Step title="Understand Badge Meaning">
The badge counts only unique third-party remote servers contacted, focusing on allowed connections. It does not reflect blocked request counts.
</Step>
<Step title="Cross-check with the Popup">
Open the popup to verify the detailed breakdown of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Unexpected Permission Prompts

### Problem
You see unexpected browser permission requests after installing or updating the extension.

### Explanation
uBO Scope requires permissions like `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` to function correctly. Sometimes, after updates or reinstallations, browsers prompt users to accept or review permissions again.

### Recommended Actions
<Steps>
<Step title="Review Requested Permissions">
Ensure you accept all listed permissions; otherwise, uBO Scope cannot monitor network connections properly.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Browser Compatibility and Settings">
Some browsers may restrict background network monitoring on privacy grounds. Verify settings to allow extensions to access network activity.
</Step>
<Step title="Reinstall the Extension">
If issues persist, reinstall uBO Scope and confirm permissions during installation.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. No Network Requests Displayed Due to Browser Limitations

### Scenario
Certain network requests you expect are not visible in uBO Scope’s popup or reports.

### Reason
uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API to observe network connections. However:
- Some requests (e.g., made by the browser's internal mechanisms or extensions) may not be reported.
- The extension cannot see requests blocked at the DNS level or outside the browser’s process.

### What to Know
<Info>
This behavior is by design and relates to inherent browser API limitations, not an extension fault.
</Info>

### What You Can Do
<Steps>
<Step title="Use Supported Browsers">
Browsers like Chrome (122+), Firefox (128+), and Safari (18.5+) provide the best API support.
</Step>
<Step title="Cross-Reference with Other Tools">
For requests missing in uBO Scope, verify using browser developer tools' Network tab to understand what is seen or blocked at other layers.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Missing UI Elements or Layout Issues in the Popup

### Description
If areas of the popup UI appear blank, text or counts missing, or layout seems broken:

### Causes
- Extension popup CSS or JavaScript failed to load or execute.
- Browser rendering anomalies, especially with unusual display scaling.

### How to Recover
<Steps>
<Step title="Reload the Popup">
Close and reopen the popup by clicking the extension icon.
</Step>
<Step title="Restart the Browser">
A fresh browser start can clear temporary glitches affecting extension UI rendering.
</Step>
<Step title="Update Browser and Extension">
Ensure you’re running the latest browser version and uBO Scope release for best compatibility.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Console Errors">
If you are comfortable, open browser developer tools on the extension popup to check for errors.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Troubleshooting Tips at a Glance

- **Reload tabs regularly** after installation or changes to extension settings.
- **Verify extension permissions** via your browser’s extension management interface.
- Use the **popup’s detailed domain lists** (allowed, stealth, blocked) to interpret network activity.
- Confirm your **browser and extension versions meet minimum requirements.**
- When uncertain, **consult browser developer tools** for deeper network inspection.
