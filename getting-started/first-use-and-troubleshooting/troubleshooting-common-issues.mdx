# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This page helps you quickly identify and resolve frequent problems encountered when installing or using **uBO Scope** for the first time. Whether the extension badge isn’t updating, the popup interface fails to show data, or the extension icon is missing in your browser, this guide offers practical fixes and next steps.

---

## 1. Extension Icon Not Visible

If you don’t see the uBO Scope icon on your browser’s toolbar or extension area immediately after installation:

- **Check Browser’s Extension Toolbar:**
  - Some browsers hide new extensions behind a menu or overflow menu—click the puzzle piece icon (`Extensions` or similar) and pin uBO Scope for always-on visibility.
- **Restart Your Browser:**
  - After installation, restart your browser to ensure that the extension fully registers.
- **Confirm Installation Success:**
  - Visit your browser’s extension management page ([chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) for Chromium, `about:addons` for Firefox, or Safari Extensions preferences) to confirm uBO Scope is installed and enabled.

<Tip>
Pinning the extension icon in Chromium-based browsers keeps the uBO Scope badge visible, providing real-time connection counts.
</Tip>

## 2. Toolbar Badge Not Updating or Showing Data

The toolbar badge reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers the current tab has successfully connected to. If it remains blank or stagnant:

### Step-by-Step Checks

1. **Reload the Webpage:** The badge updates per active tab's connections. Refresh to trigger new network activity.
2. **Verify Permissions:**
   - uBO Scope requires access to webRequest and activeTab permissions:
     - Confirm these permissions in your extension management page.
3. **Supported Browsers and Versions:**
   - Ensure you are using a supported browser version as per the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](../setup-and-installation/prerequisites-system-requirements).
4. **Conflicting Extensions:**
   - Content blockers or privacy extensions may interfere; try disabling others temporarily.
5. **Network vs Non-Network Requests:**
   - The extension monitors HTTP(S) and WebSocket requests (`http`, `https`, `ws`, `wss`). Other protocols won’t show in the badge.
6. **Check for Extension Updates or Reinstall:**
   - Sometimes reinstalling the extension restores functionality.

<Warning>
Browser APIs limit visibility: some network requests initiated by web pages might not be accessible due to browser security and API constraints. A missing badge update does not always mean faulty extension operation.
</Warning>

## 3. Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists

When you click the uBO Scope icon, the popup displays network details for the active tab. If it shows “NO DATA” or empty sections for allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains:

### How to Resolve

1. **Activate the Tab:** uBO Scope reports only when the tab is active.
2. **Refresh the Page:** The extension builds data based on ongoing activity; reload the webpage.
3. **Wait Momentarily:** Network requests may take a second to register — the popup updates after processing.
4. **Browser Compatibility:** Verify your browser meets minimum versions and API support.
5. **Profile Network Activity:** Check that the page actually makes network connections; static local content won't show results.

<Tip>
If the popup remains empty after steps above, temporarily disable other extensions particularly those that block or proxy requests to verify interference.
</Tip>

## 4. Missing or Insufficient Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions to observe network requests:

| Permission        | Purpose                             |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `webRequest`      | To listen to network request events |
| `activeTab`       | To access current tab context      |
| `storage`         | To save session and persisted data |

### How to Check & Fix

- Go to your browser's Extension Settings and check that uBO Scope has these permissions.
- If permissions were denied during installation, remove and reinstall the extension granting the permissions.

<Warning>
Without these permissions, uBO Scope cannot track network requests or update the badge.
</Warning>

## 5. Unsupported Browser or Version

uBO Scope supports recent versions of Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari with minimum versions detailed in the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](../setup-and-installation/prerequisites-system-requirements).

- **Update your Browser to Latest Stable Release.**
- **Safari:** Minimum version 18.5
- **Firefox:** Minimum version 128.0
- **Chromium:** Minimum version 122.0

Older browsers or unsupported ones will not run uBO Scope correctly.

<Note>
Using browsers older than the minimum supported versions will lead to failure in loading or updating network data.
</Note>

## 6. Badge Indicates High Number of Third-Party Connections Unexpectedly

Remember:

- The badge count reflects the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** contacted successfully by the page.
- A higher number indicates more third-party connections and potentially more privacy exposure.

If you suspect suspicious or excessive connections:

- Check your other privacy/name resolution settings.
- Review the domains listed in the popup to identify unexpected connections.
- Use uBO Scope in conjunction with filtering and blocking extensions for greater control.

## 7. Extension Not Functioning After Browser Update or System Restart

Occasionally, browser updates or restarts can disable extensions or reset permissions.

Steps to recover:

1. Verify the extension is enabled in extension manager.
2. Reapply any permission consents if requested.
3. Restart the browser.
4. Reinstall as a last resort.

## 8. Additional Tips for Success

- **Avoid Using Multiple Content Blockers With Overlapping Permissions:** They can interfere with uBO Scope’s network visibility.
- **Be Patient on New Tabs:** uBO Scope gathers data over time; newly opened pages start reporting once network activates.
- **Inspect the Popup Domain Lists:** The allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories provide visibility into connection outcomes.

## 9. Next Steps

After resolving issues:

- Visit the [Your First Run](../first-use-and-troubleshooting/first-run-experience) guide to understand how to interpret uBO Scope’s data.
- Use [Quick Validation Steps](../first-use-and-troubleshooting/validate-setup) to confirm correct operation.
- Consult [Prerequisites & System Requirements](../setup-and-installation/prerequisites-system-requirements) to verify your environment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge show a number even on 'new tab' pages?">
On some browsers, new tabs or blank pages may trigger network requests or inherit permissions causing non-zero counts. This is normal behavior.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope see all network connections?">
No. Due to browser API limitations, uBO Scope sees only HTTP(S) and WebSocket connections observable by the browser extension API.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is there no configuration after installation?">
uBO Scope is designed as zero-configuration; it works immediately after installation without setup.
