# Your First Run

Open the uBO Scope extension popup to instantly see the network connections a webpage establishes. This guide walks you through using the extension's user interface, helping you understand the badge counts and how the domain connection breakdown is presented.

---

## 1. Launching the uBO Scope Popup

When you click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar, a popup window appears. This popup displays detailed information about third-party domains your current active webpage communicates with.

### Steps:

1. **Navigate to any webpage of interest.**
2. **Click the uBO Scope extension icon** in your browser toolbar.
3. The popup will load and display connection data related to the active tab.

<Tip>
If the popup shows “NO DATA,” try refreshing the page or confirming the page is fully loaded. Connections are tracked live but might not appear immediately.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface

The popup is composed of several key sections representing the network connections from the active webpage:

### Breakdown of Interface Elements

- **Hostname Display:** Shows the active tab’s hostname and domain at the top, converting Punycode to Unicode for readability.

- **Summary Section:** Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains contacted by the page.

- **Outcome Sections:** Connections are categorized into three outcomes:
  - **Not blocked:** Domains where connections succeeded without interruption.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains related to redirect events; these requests are silently blocked or altered.
  - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked causing errors on the requests.

Each category lists domains with an associated connection count.

### Visual Example

```plaintext
example.com (site domain)
domains connected: 15

not blocked
 - cdn.example.net (12)
 - fonts.gstatic.com (3)

stealth-blocked
 - tracker.blocked.com (2)

blocked
 - ads.badexample.org (4)
```

### What the Badge Counts Mean
- The badge on the toolbar icon reports the number of **distinct third-party domains** that the current active tab connected to successfully (not blocked).
- A **lower badge count** indicates fewer distinct remote servers, typically correlating to fewer third-party elements loaded.

---

## 3. Interpreting Badge Counts and Domain Categories

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** These domains are those your browser successfully connected to. Usually, these include essential CDN hosts and legitimate third parties.

- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections intercepted during redirect events. These typically are hidden from direct blocking metrics but tracked here as specially marked.

- **Blocked:** Domains to which connections failed explicitly due to blocking (errors or DNS filtering).

<Tip>
Review these categories if you expect certain domains to be absent or blocked. It helps diagnose if connections are going through or being silently blocked.
</Tip>

## 4. Practical Tips for Your First Run

- **Refresh your webpage and open the popup again** to see updated counts as connections occur.
- **Compare badge counts across sites** to get a feel for normal levels of third-party connections.
- Remember that not all third-party connections are malicious or undesirable; many belong to important services like CDNs.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Interface Issues

### Issue: Popup shows "NO DATA" or empty counts
- Ensure you are on a valid webpage with network traffic.
- Refresh the webpage and open popup after full loading.
- Confirm the extension is properly installed and enabled.

### Issue: Counts seem too high or low
- Badge reflects distinct third-party domains only, not raw request counts.
- Third-party domains are derived from registered domain names, consolidating subdomains.
- Other content blockers or network filters could affect counts.

For in-depth troubleshooting, see the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../first-use-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting) page.

## 6. Next Steps

Once comfortable with the popup interface:

- Explore the [Configuring uBO Scope](../installation-and-setup/configuring-ubo-scope) page to adjust preferences and understand monitoring behaviors.
- Visit [Reading the Popup: Interpreting Connection Summaries](../../guides/getting-started-essentials/reading-popup) to deepen understanding of network reports.
- For validation, confirm installation and permissions with the [Quick Validation Checklist](../first-use-and-troubleshooting/quick-validation).


---

## Summary
- Open uBO Scope popup from the toolbar to see active webpage's third-party domain connections.
- Popup displays allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domain categories with connection counts.
- Badge count represents the number of distinct not-blocked third-party domains.
- Refresh pages and check popup to get up-to-date network insights.

<Tip>
Using this interface regularly helps you build intuition about your network footprint across sites and understand the origins of resources your browser loads.

## Technical Overview (Optional Reading)

For those interested, the popup gathers its data by querying the background script about the active tab’s network events. It displays data grouped by domain and connection result category.

The domains shown are converted from Punycode to Unicode to enhance readability.

This UI allows instantly detecting all unique third-party domains contacted by the current webpage, providing transparency beyond block counts of content blockers.
