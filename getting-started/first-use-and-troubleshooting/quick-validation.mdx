# Quick Validation Checklist

Ensure uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browser tabs and accurately reporting network connection data with this straightforward checklist. Validating your installation quickly helps confirm that the extension is functioning as intended and providing trustworthy third-party connection insights.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation and Activation

- Verify that the uBO Scope icon appears in your browser's toolbar.
- Ensure the icon is not grayed out or disabled.
- If the icon is missing, revisit the installation instructions for your browser:
  - [Installing on Your Browser](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope#installation)

## 2. Visit Commonly Used Websites

To validate data collection:

- Open a new browser tab.
- Navigate to well-known websites such as [https://example.com](https://example.com), [https://mozilla.org](https://mozilla.org), or any popular site you frequently visit.
- Wait for the page to fully load, allowing network requests to complete.

## 3. Observe the Toolbar Badge Count

- Look at the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge.
- The badge shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected by the active tab.
- A non-zero count indicates uBO Scope is detecting network activity.

> **Tip:** A lower badge count is preferable, indicating fewer unique third-party connections.

## 4. Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface

- Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar to open the popup.
- Confirm the top section displays the domain related to the active tab.
  - Example: For `https://mozilla.org`, the panel should show 'mozilla.org'.
- Review the connection summary:
  - **Domains connected:** Total count of distinct third-party domains.
  - Sections titled **'not blocked'**, **'stealth-blocked'**, and **'blocked'** list domains categorized by connection outcome.

## 5. Validate Domains and Counts

- Ensure that domains listed under _not blocked_ are expected third parties relevant to the visited site.
- _Blocked_ and _stealth-blocked_ domains should reflect filtered or failed connection attempts.

## 6. Refresh and Revalidate

- Reload the active tab to generate fresh network data.
- Observe how the badge count and popup update accordingly.

> **Note:** Network requests are captured via browser APIs; if some domains appear missing or incorrect, confirm that permissions and browser versions meet requirements.

## 7. Permissions and Compatibility Check

- Confirm your browser is supported:
  - **Chromium** 122+ (e.g., Chrome, Edge)
  - **Firefox** 128+
  - **Safari** 18.5+
- Check that required permissions are granted:
  - `activeTab`
  - `storage`
  - `webRequest`
  - Host permissions to access URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, optionally `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`)

If permissions are missing, revisit the installation process to grant necessary access.

## 8. Common Issues and Immediate Solutions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Quick Validation">
<Accordion title="No Badge or Empty Popup">
- Confirm the extension is enabled in browser extensions/settings.
- Refresh the active tab after installation.
- Close and reopen the browser.
- Ensure you visit HTTP or HTTPS sites where network requests occur.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Never Updates">
- Verify browser version meets minimum requirements.
- Check that the extension has the `webRequest` permission granted.
- Disable conflicting extensions that might interfere with network monitoring.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains Not Appearing as Expected">
- Remember some network requests might be made outside of webpage tabs or blocked before being tracked.
- Check for browser security settings or other system-level filters.
- Try visiting standard websites like https://example.com to generate baseline traffic.
</Accordion>
