## 1. Understand What to Expect

uBO Scope tracks and reports all third-party remote server connections initiated by websites you visit. It categorizes these connections as **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked** and displays a live count badge on the browser toolbar.

Open the site in a new browser tab to generate network traffic.
