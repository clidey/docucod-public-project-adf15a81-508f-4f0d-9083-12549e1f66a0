# Using the Extension

Gain clear insights into how to navigate and interpret uBO Scope's popup interface, understand the distinctions between reported domains, and leverage the toolbar badge for quick daily monitoring.

---

## 1. Understanding the Popup Interface

uBO Scope’s popup presents relevant information about third-party remote server connections related to the active browser tab. It categorizes domains into three distinct outcomes:

- **Not Blocked**: Domains for which connections were allowed successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where requests were redirected, indicating stealth blocking.
- **Blocked**: Domains whose network requests were outright blocked or failed.

These categories enable you to see at a glance the connection landscape of the current webpage.

### How to Access the Popup

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
2. The popup will display the hostname of the current page and connection details classified by outcome.

### Key Popup Sections

- **Hostname Display**: Shows the full hostname and domain of the active tab.
- **Summary**: Displays the count of distinct domains successfully connected under "not blocked".
- **Domain Lists**: Each category (‘not blocked’, ‘stealth-blocked’, ‘blocked’) lists third-party domains along with request counts.

<Tip>
Domains are reported based on the public suffix list to identify the effective registrable domain names, ensuring meaningful groupings.
</Tip>

## 2. Interpreting Domain Reporting

### Not Blocked Domains
These represent third-party remote servers the site connected to successfully. Each domain entry shows the number of times its connections occurred. A higher count may mean repeated resource loads, such as from CDNs or analytics providers.

### Stealth-Blocked Domains
These domains have connections redirected, which usually indicates stealth blocking happening behind the scenes (e.g., hidden redirections or alternative blocking techniques).

### Blocked Domains
Connections to these domains were explicitly blocked or failed, indicating that either uBO Scope or other content blockers prevented resource loads.

<Note>
The distinction between "stealth-blocked" and "blocked" helps you understand blocking mechanisms beyond simple failures.
</Note>

## 3. Reading the Toolbar Badge

The toolbar badge number reflects the count of distinct third-party domains for which connections were successfully established on the active tab.

- **Lower is better**: A low badge count usually means fewer third-party connections and potentially higher privacy.
- **Dynamic update**: The badge number updates dynamically as you browse, reflecting real-time network activity.

### Example Scenario

If you visit a website and the badge shows "5", it means 5 distinct third-party domains were contacted successfully on that tab.

<Info>
Remember: The badge does not count blocked or stealth-blocked domains. It strictly counts connected domains, providing an accurate privacy-related metric.

## 4. Tips for Daily Usage

- **Check the popup regularly** to understand which third-party domains your browser connects to for any given website.
- **Use the domain counts to identify heavy third-party usage**, which can indicate tracking or ads.
- **Monitor stealth-blocked domains** to spot subtle blocking effects that might affect site behavior.
- **Leverage the badge count** as a quick privacy health indicator while browsing.

<Tip>
Regularly opening the popup after loading new pages ensures you see current network connection states, especially on dynamic or resource-heavy sites.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup and Badge Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup shows NO DATA or is empty">
- Ensure you are on a fully loaded webpage; early page loads might not have recorded requests yet.
- Refresh the tab or navigate to another webpage and retry.
- Confirm the extension is enabled and has the necessary permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count does not update">
- The badge updates after network request processing, sometimes slightly delayed.
- Try reloading the tab.
- Check browser logs for errors related to uBO Scope.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain lists seem incomplete or incorrect">
- uBO Scope groups domains based on the public suffix list; some domains might appear higher-level.
- If you see odd domain names, it could be due to punycode conversions for internationalized domains (IDNs). These are displayed in Unicode for clarity.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

- The toolbar badge reflects the count of distinct connected third-party domains.
- Detailed domain counts provide insights into network activity per tab.
- Practical tips and troubleshooting guidance help ensure you get reliable, real-time data.

### Example Popup Visualization

```plaintext
+---------------------------------------------------+
| uBO Scope Popup for active tab                     |
| Hostname: subdomain.example.com                    |
| Domains connected: 12                              |
+---------------------------------------------------+
| Not Blocked       | stealth-blocked   | Blocked   |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| cdn.example.net x7 | tracker.example.org x2 | ads.example.com x5 |
| fonts.example.io x3|                   |           |
+---------------------------------------------------+
```

This shows how domains and counts are grouped by outcome to help your daily monitoring.
