# Quick Validation Steps

This guide helps you quickly verify that **uBO Scope** is correctly installed, actively monitoring network requests, and accurately displaying third-party connection data. By following these steps, you will confirm the extension’s presence on your browser toolbar, interpret the popup UI meaningfully, and understand the badge counts shown in real time.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation and Toolbar Presence

To start gaining insights from uBO Scope, you must first ensure it is correctly installed and visible in your browser.

### Steps:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser’s toolbar:**
   - The icon uses the uBO Scope logo.
   - On some browsers, it might be hidden in the extension overflow or menu—pin it to your toolbar for convenience.

2. **Verify the icon is active:**
   - The icon's badge will show a number if there are any third-party network connections detected.

3. **Open the popup:**
   - Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.

<Tip>
If the icon does not appear:
- Ensure you have completed the installation.
- Confirm extension permissions (especially `webRequest`) were granted.
- Verify your browser version meets the minimum requirements.
</Tip>

## 2. Understand the Badge Count on the Toolbar Icon

The badge count represents the number of **distinct third-party domains** to which your current active tab has connected without blocking.

### What the badge tells you:

- A **higher number** means your current tab connects to more third-party servers.
- A **zero or no badge** usually means no distinct third-party connections were allowed or detected.

<Info>
The badge count exclusively reports on third-party domains where connections were allowed, not blocked. This means a lower number indicates fewer external connections, typically enhancing privacy.
</Info>

## 3. Interpreting the Popup UI

When you open the popup, uBO Scope categorizes connection outcomes for the current active browser tab:

| Section          | What it Shows                             | Significance                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Domains connected:** | Total number of distinct third-party domains detected | Overview of third-party exposure on the current tab |
| **Not blocked**   | Domains for which connections were allowed | These third parties successfully loaded resources |
| **Stealth-blocked** | Domains detected during redirects or indirect loading but blocked stealthily | Connections prevented covertly by content blockers |
| **Blocked**       | Domains explicitly blocked from loading resources | Confirmed blocked third parties |

### How to read domain rows:
- Each row shows a domain and a count badge representing how many network requests involved that domain.
- Domains are rendered in Unicode for readability, including internationalized domain names.

### Step-by-step popup usage:

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
2. Observe the total domains connected.
3. Review each section:
    - **Not blocked:** Confirm which domains are allowed.
    - **Stealth-blocked:** Identify domains stealthily blocked (may still be contacted indirectly).
    - **Blocked:** See domains explicitly blocked.
4. Use this information to assess privacy exposure and content blocking effectiveness.

<Tip>
If the popup shows NO DATA, it means uBO Scope has not yet recorded connection data for the current tab. Try refreshing the page or visiting a different site with third-party content.
</Tip>

## 4. Perform a Live Test

Validate uBO Scope is actively capturing data:

1. Open a website known to load multiple third-party resources (news sites, video platforms).
2. Observe the uBO Scope badge count increase as the page loads.
3. Click the toolbar icon to open the popup.
4. Confirm the domains are categorized according to connection outcome.

If badge counts and popup data update as you navigate through different websites, uBO Scope is functioning properly.

<Warning>
Some network requests outside the browser's `webRequest` API coverage (like some WebSocket connections or DNS-level blocks) may not appear in uBO Scope.
</Warning>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Quick Validation Steps">
<Accordion title='No Icon or Badge on Toolbar'>
- Confirm the extension is installed and enabled in your browser's extensions manager.
- Check minimum browser version compatibility.
- Restart your browser to refresh extension state.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Popup Shows NO DATA or Empty Lists'>
- Refresh the active tab to trigger network activity.
- Visit sites with third-party content.
- Clear browser session data and retry.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Badge Count Does Not Update'>
- Ensure browser permissions for `webRequest` APIs are not revoked.
- Confirm no conflicting extensions interfere with network monitoring.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

Quick validation with uBO Scope confirms the extension provides real-time visibility into third-party network connections:

- Look for the toolbar icon and badge count
- Open the popup to interpret connection categories
- Refresh pages with known third-party resources to ensure active tracking

By mastering these simple validation steps, you confidently verify uBO Scope is monitoring network requests as intended.
