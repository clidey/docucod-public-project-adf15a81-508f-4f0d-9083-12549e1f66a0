# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide is dedicated to helping you quickly identify and resolve common problems you may encounter when installing or running uBO Scope for the first time. Whether you face permission errors, notice the badge not updating, or the extension icon does not appear, this page offers step-by-step actions that get you back on track to gain immediate visibility into your browser’s network connections.

---

## 1. Extension Icon Missing or Not Appearing

If after installation you do not see the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar or extension area, follow these steps:

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open your browser’s extensions or add-ons page.
   - Confirm that 'uBO Scope' is listed and enabled.

2. **Show Toolbar Icon:**
   - In Chromium-based browsers, click the puzzle piece icon to open the extensions menu.
   - Pin uBO Scope to the toolbar if it is not pinned.
   - In Firefox, right-click the toolbar area, select ‘Customize Toolbar’, and ensure uBO Scope’s icon is placed in the toolbar.

3. **Restart Browser:**
   - Completely close and reopen your browser.

4. **Reinstall if Needed:**
   - Remove the extension.
   - Install it again from the [official store](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) or relevant browser marketplace.

### Common Pitfalls

- Some browsers restrict showing icons if extensions lack the necessary permissions.
- Toolbar customization can hide icons unintentionally.

<Note>
If the icon is still missing, check your browser version meets the minimum required (Chromium 122, Firefox 128, Safari 18.5) as specified in the supported browsers documentation.
</Note>

## 2. Badge Not Updating or Showing Counts

The badge on the toolbar icon indicates how many distinct third-party domains were connected to. If the badge does not update or remains blank, take these actions:

### Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

1. **Check Permissions:**
   - Ensure the extension has these browser permissions enabled:
     - `activeTab`
     - `storage`
     - `webRequest`
   - Without these, uBO Scope cannot monitor network activity.

2. **Visit a Webpage with External Connections:**
   - The badge updates only after network activity is observed.
   - Try visiting popular websites with embedded third-party content to validate.

3. **Reload or Restart:**
   - Reload the current tab or restart the browser.

4. **Confirm Background Activity:**
   - The extension uses a background script or service worker to aggregate data.
   - Check your browser’s extension page for errors or if the background process has been suspended.

5. **Clear Extension Storage:**
   - Sometimes stale data causes issues. Clear storage using browser extension management tools if available.

6. **Check for Conflicting Extensions:**
   - Other content blockers or privacy extensions may interfere.
   - Temporarily disable other extensions and test again.

<Warning>
Browsers may throttle or suspend service workers/background scripts; this can delay badge updates temporarily.
</Warning>

## 3. Permission Denied or Errors During Installation

Encountering permission-related errors can block installation or runtime functionality.

### How to Resolve

1. **Browser Version Compatibility:**
   - Confirm you are running a supported browser version:
     - Chromium 122+
     - Firefox 128+
     - Safari 18.5+

2. **Verify Permissions Requested:**
   - The extension requests host permissions for full HTTP and WebSocket URLs:
     - `http://*/*`
     - `https://*/*`
     - `ws://*/*` (Chromium only)
     - `wss://*/*` (Chromium only)
   - Accept these permissions at install or enable them manually if your browser allows.

3. **Browser Policy or Group Restrictions:**
   - On managed devices or corporate environments, extensions might be blocked or permissions restricted.
   - Contact your administrator or install on a non-managed profile.

4. **Manually Enable Extensions:**
   - In some cases, disabled extensions need manual enabling after install.

5. **Check for Developer Mode Conflicts:**
   - If installing as a developer extension, ensure that you have enabled developer mode properly in your browser.

## 4. Extension Not Measuring Network Activity

If uBO Scope appears installed but never shows data or remains stuck on “NO DATA”, try this flow:

### Quick Fix Steps

1. **Confirm Tab is Active:**
   - uBO Scope reports activity per active tab.
   - Open the extension popup on an active window/tab.

2. **Visit Active Websites:**
   - Navigate to websites that load content from multiple third-party domains.

3. **Check Browser Console for Errors:**
   - Access developer console via browser extension debug pages.
   - Look for any script errors preventing popup updates.

4. **Reload Extension:**
   - Disable and then enable the extension.
   - In development mode, load unpacked extension afresh.

5. **Inspect Network Requests API Support:**
   - uBO Scope relies on browser `webRequest` API.
   - If your browser blocks or limits this API (e.g., certain Firefox settings), measurement may fail.

<Tip>
Opening the popup and seeing the hostname and domains update with live data confirms normal operation.
</Tip>

## 5. Specific Known Issues and Solutions

### a. Badge Count Stuck or Incorrect

- Cause: Some tabs may have cached data or the background script has lost context.
- Fix:
  1. Close and reopen the affected tab.
  2. Restart the browser to reset all context.
  3. Clear extension storage data.

### b. Extension Not Showing for WebSockets in Firefox or Safari

- Explanation: Firefox and Safari do not declare WebSocket (`ws://`, `wss://`) permissions in the manifest, so WebSocket activity may not be reported.
- Recommendation:
  - Use Chromium-based browsers for full WebSocket visibility.

### c. Extension Disabled by Browser After Update

- Sometimes security or policy updates disable extensions.
- Solution: Manually re-enable via browser extensions page.

## 6. How to Collect Diagnostic Information

If issues persist and you need to seek help or report bugs, gather the following:

- Browser name and version
- Operating system
- Extension version (`1.0.1` as per manifest)
- Description of the problem and steps leading to it
- Screenshots of the extension icon, popup, and any error messages
- Console log from browser extension debugging tools

Providing these details helps maintainers identify and fix issues faster.
