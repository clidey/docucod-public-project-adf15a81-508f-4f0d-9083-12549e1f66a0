# Troubleshooting Installation & Setup Issues

Ensure uBO Scope is fully operational by resolving common installation and initial-use problems such as missing toolbar badges, empty popup data, unsupported browsers, or conflicts with other extensions. This guide provides clear, actionable solutions and verification methods to restore the extension's full functionality quickly.

---

## 1. Understanding Common Setup Issues

### Missing Toolbar Badge
If the uBO Scope icon appears but does not show a badge count:

- Verify that the extension is enabled and active in your browser's extensions page.
- Confirm you have granted any required permissions during installation, especially for network access.
- Check that you have navigated to a web page with network requests; the badge count updates only upon observing third-party connections.

### Empty Popup or No Data Displayed
When clicking the extension icon, if the popup shows 'NO DATA' or does not list any connected domains:

- The current tab may not be properly tracked yet. Reload or navigate to a different webpage where network activity will be detected.
- The extension may need a moment after page load to collect data; wait a few seconds and reopen the popup.
- Verify your browser supports the extension APIs fully (see Supported Browsers below).

### Unsupported Browser or Version
uBO Scope requires specific browser versions:

- **Chrome / Chromium**: Version 122 or higher
- **Firefox**: Version 128 or higher
- **Safari**: Version 18.5 or higher

If your browser does not meet these requirements, upgrade to a compatible version.

### Conflicts with Other Extensions
Other content blockers or privacy extensions can interfere with uBO Scope's operation:

- Disable other extensions temporarily to verify if conflicts are causing issues.
- If disabling resolves the issue, selectively re-enable extensions to identify the culprit.

<Tip>
Running multiple network-monitoring or blocking extensions simultaneously can cause overlapping permissions or conflicts, preventing uBO Scope from accurately reporting connection data.
</Tip>

## 2. Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### Step 1: Verify Extension Installation and Enablement

1. Open your browser's extensions or add-ons management page.
2. Locate uBO Scope and ensure it is enabled.
3. Check that the extension's icon appears on the toolbar.

### Step 2: Confirm Required Permissions

1. Confirm that uBO Scope requests **webRequest**, **storage**, and **activeTab** permissions.
2. If prompted during installation, accept these permissions.
3. In case of doubts, remove and reinstall the extension from official sources:

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

### Step 3: Test on Supported Sites

1. Navigate to commonly visited websites that generate third-party requests (e.g., news sites, social media).
2. Observe the toolbar badge; it should show a non-empty number after page load.
3. Click the extension icon and verify the popup lists connected domains under the 'not blocked' category.

### Step 4: Reload or Restart Browser

- Sometimes, newly installed extensions require browser restart to function correctly.
- Restart your browser and repeat Steps 1 to 3.

### Step 5: Isolate Extension Conflicts

1. Disable all other extensions temporarily.
2. Revisit test websites to check if uBO Scope functions correctly.
3. Re-enable other extensions one-by-one to identify any conflicting extensions.

### Step 6: Clear Extension Storage Data (Advanced)

If the extension appears installed but data remains stale or missing:

1. Navigate to your browser's extension storage settings.
2. Clear the storage data for uBO Scope.
3. Reload a website to allow the extension to repopulate session data.

## 3. Verification: Confirming uBO Scope is Working

Use these indicators to validate success:

- The **toolbar badge** displays a numeric count of distinct third-party domains connected on the current tab.
- The **popup** shows the current tab’s hostname and domain, along with categorized lists under 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' domains.
- No error messages or empty data displays when interacting with the extension.

For detailed validation, see the [Quick Validation Steps](../usage-and-troubleshooting/quick-validation) guide.

## 4. Additional Considerations & Best Practices

- **Browser Compatibility:** Always use the latest supported browser versions to ensure optimal API support.
- **Extension Updates:** Keep uBO Scope updated through official distribution channels to receive important fixes.
- **Connection Privacy:** uBO Scope passively monitors network requests and does not modify content or blocking behavior.
- **Network Restrictions:** Firewalls or VPNs may alter network request visibility; ensure none interfere with browser network monitoring.

<Warning>
Using unsupported browsers or outdated versions can lead to incomplete or inaccurate reporting. Always verify your browser version.
</Warning>

## 5. Troubleshooting FAQ

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count sometimes disappear or not update?">
The badge updates only when network activity is detected for the current tab. Browsing static pages or browser-internal pages may result in no badge displayed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The popup shows 'NO DATA' even after refreshing the page. What should I do?">
Give the extension a moment to collect data after reload. If the problem persists, try restarting the browser. Ensure no conflicting extensions are blocking uBO Scope’s access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is the extension affected by private browsing or incognito mode?">
uBO Scope requires permissions to run in private modes. Configure your browser to allow the extension to run in incognito/private mode if desired.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Could firewall or privacy settings affect the extension?">
Yes. Network security software or browser privacy features can block or obscure network requests, affecting uBO Scope's ability to report connections.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I suspect extension conflicts but can't identify which one?">
Temporarily disable all extensions except uBO Scope and enable them back one-by-one while monitoring functionality to isolate conflicts.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
