# Troubleshooting Installation

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve common startup issues encountered when installing or launching uBO Scope. Whether the extension icon doesn't show, permissions appear missing, or the popup fails to display connection data, this documentation provides clear, actionable steps and relevant notes to get you back on track.

## 1. Extension Icon Not Appearing in Toolbar

If you cannot see the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar after installation, follow these steps:

1. **Verify Installation:**
   - Ensure uBO Scope is installed by visiting your browser's extensions page:
     - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
     - Firefox: `about:addons`
     - Safari: Safari > Preferences > Extensions

2. **Enable and Pin the Extension Icon:**
   - In Chrome and Edge, click the Extensions (puzzle piece) icon and pin uBO Scope for easy access.
   - In Firefox, ensure the extension is enabled and visible in the toolbar area.
   - In Safari, verify the extension checkbox is checked and toolbar button is enabled.

3. **Browser Compatibility Check:**
   - Confirm you are using a supported browser version. Minimum versions required:
     - Chromium-based: Chrome 122.0+
     - Firefox: 128.0+
     - Safari: 18.5+
   - Older browsers may not support Manifest Version 3 or required APIs.

4. **Restart the Browser:**
   - Sometimes a browser restart is necessary for icons to appear post-installation.

5. **Check for Conflicting Extensions:**
   - Disable other extensions temporarily to rule out interference with the toolbar UI.

<Callout type="info">
If the icon still doesn't appear after these steps, reinstall uBO Scope following the installing instructions in the [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) or official store links.
</Callout>

## 2. Permissions Are Not Granted or Network Data Not Visible

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network requests and display connection outcomes. Missing permissions lead to incomplete or empty data in the popup.

### Symptoms
- The popup shows 'NO DATA' or blank domains list.
- The badge count (on the icon) never updates.

### Resolution Steps

1. **Check Extension Permissions:**
   - Verify that uBO Scope has been granted the following permissions:
     - `activeTab`
     - `webRequest`
     - `storage`
   - These permissions are declared in the extension manifest and must be approved by the browser during installation.

2. **Verify Host Permissions:**
   - uBO Scope requires broad host permissions to observe all HTTP(S) and WebSocket connections.
   - Confirm `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, and `ws://*/*` are accepted.

3. **Re-enable Permissions if Needed:**
   - Sometimes browsers revoke or disable permissions inadvertently.
   - Disable and re-enable the extension or reinstall it to prompt permission re-approval.

4. **Browser Settings:**
   - Inspect your browser's privacy and security settings to ensure no global blocking rules prevent uBO Scope from accessing network data.

5. **Check for Other Network Monitoring Tools:**
   - VPNs or other security extensions may interfere with `webRequest` APIs.
   - Temporarily disable such tools to test uBO Scope functionality.

<Warning>
Browsers restrict network monitoring APIs in certain private/incognito modes or when extensions lack required permissions; uBO Scope needs explicit access to function correctly.
</Warning>

## 3. Popup Not Displaying Data or Freezing

If the extension popup loads but shows no or incomplete data, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Wait for Data to Load:**
   - The popup relies on background processing of recent network requests.
   - It may take a few seconds for data to populate after opening the popup.

2. **Check for Script Errors:**
   - Use the browserâ€™s developer tools console (right-click popup > Inspect) to check for errors.
   - Common issues may relate to messaging failures; try closing and reopening the popup.

3. **Clear Extension Storage:**
   - Corrupted or stale session data can cause display issues.
   - Clear storage by disabling and re-enabling the extension or use debug tools if available.

4. **Update Browser and Extension:**
   - Ensure you have the latest version of uBO Scope and your browser, as updates fix bugs.

5. **Network Activity Check:**
   - Confirm you are actively browsing sites with third-party connections for meaningful data to appear.

## 4. Network Requests Not Being Recorded or Badge Not Updating

If uBO Scope isn't recording requests or the badge count remains empty:

1. **Confirm Minimum Browser Version:**
   - Extensions using Manifest V3 require modern browsers capable of handling `service_worker` or `background.scripts` appropriately.

2. **Check Background Service Worker:**
   - Make sure background service worker (Chromium) or background scripts (Firefox/Safari) are running:
     - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/` > Details > Inspect views/background page
     - Firefox: Debug extension background scripts via `about:debugging`

3. **Verify Host Permissions Are Applied:**
   - Network monitoring only works on URLs within declared host permissions.
   - See manifest's `host_permissions` for the required URLs.

4. **Inspect Conflicts or Errors in Background Scripts:**
   - Background errors prevent updates; check console logs.

5. **Wait for Network Request Journal to Process:**
   - Network data is queued and processed every second; slight delays are normal.

6. **Open and Use the Popup to Trigger Data Fetch:**
   - Opening the popup triggers message request for tab-specific data.

## 5. Common Installation Pitfalls

- **Using Unsupported Browser Versions:** Using versions below the minimum leads to silent failures.
- **Ignoring Permission Prompts:** Always accept all requested permissions during installation.
- **Expecting Data Without Browsing Activity:** uBO Scope shows data only when active tabs make network connections.
- **Private/Incognito Mode Limitations:** Some browsers restrict APIs in private browsing; verify extension settings allow activity in incognito.

---

## 6. Final Validation Checklist

Make sure:

- Extension icon is visible and pinned.
- Permissions (activeTab, webRequest, storage) are granted in the browser settings.
- Host permissions cover HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS protocols.
- Browser version meets minimum requirements.
- Background service worker or scripts are running without errors.
- You are browsing active tabs that generate network traffic.
