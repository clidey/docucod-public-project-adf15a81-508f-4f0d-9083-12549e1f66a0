# Quick Validation: Using uBO Scope Immediately After Installation

Welcome to your first interaction with uBO Scope! This guide walks you through the essential steps to verify that uBO Scope is installed correctly, your browser toolbar badge updates as expected, and you understand the key popup interface elements showing connections to third-party servers.

---

## 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup

After installation, uBO Scope places an icon in your browser's toolbar. This icon shows a dynamic badge count representing the number of third-party remote servers your active tab has connected to.

### Steps to Open:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It looks like a small shield with the uBO logo.
2. Click the icon to open the popup panel.

<Tip>
If you do not see the icon immediately, check your browser's extensions menu and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar for easy access.
</Tip>

## 2. Understand the Popup Interface

The popup provides a snapshot of the third-party connections on the current active tab, segmented by their outcome:

- **Not blocked**: Servers your browser connected to successfully.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Connections that were silently redirected or interfered with.
- **Blocked**: Connections prevented from completing, typically by filters or network errors.

### Key Elements:

- **Hostname Header**: Shows the current tab’s hostname and domain.
- **Domains Connected Summary**: Displays how many distinct third-party domains are connected.
- **Domains by Outcome Sections**: Each section lists domains along with a count of their connections by category.

Example:

```text
[Hostname]

domains connected: 15

not blocked:
example-cdn.com   8
ad-service.net   2

stealth-blocked:
ad-tracker.xyz   1

blocked:
tracker.example.com 4
```

This breakdown aids in understanding which remote servers are active and their connection status.

## 3. Verify the Toolbar Badge Updates Dynamically

uBO Scope's toolbar badge number is not static; it updates as you navigate through different websites or reload pages.

### How to Confirm Badge Functionality:

1. Open a website you know has third-party content, such as a news site.
2. Observe the badge number updating to reflect the count of distinct third-party domains connected to.
3. Navigate to a different website; the badge count should adjust accordingly.

<Tip>
If the badge remains blank or does not update, please review your extension permissions and ensure the browser supports the required webRequest API.
</Tip>
