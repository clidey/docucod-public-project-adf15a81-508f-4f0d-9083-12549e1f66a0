# First Launch & Initial Configuration

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through what to expect when you open the extension for the first time, including locating the uBO Scope button in your browser, accessing the popup interface, understanding the default monitoring behavior, and the permissions the extension requests upon installation. By the end, you’ll know how uBO Scope starts working automatically to provide you with real-time network connection insights.

---

## 1. Locating the uBO Scope Button in Your Browser

After successfully installing uBO Scope, you'll find its toolbar icon appearing in your browser’s extension or add-on area. The icon is labeled **uBO Scope** and uses a distinctive logo designed for easy recognition.

### Finding the Button by Browser:

- **Chrome / Chromium**: Look for the "puzzle piece" icon near the upper right toolbar. Click it to see all extensions, then pin uBO Scope for quick access.
- **Firefox**: The uBO Scope icon is immediately visible in the toolbar once installed. If not, open the hamburger menu and drag the icon to your toolbar.
- **Safari**: Check the extension icon bar near the address field; uBO Scope meets the Safari minimum version 18.5 requirement and will appear here.

<Tip>
If you don’t immediately see the icon after installation, restart the browser or check the extensions settings to make sure uBO Scope is enabled.
</Tip>

## 2. Accessing the uBO Scope Popup Interface

Clicking the uBO Scope toolbar button opens its popup window, which displays the network connection data for the current active tab.

### What You’ll See in the Popup:

- **Hostname Display**: The domain name of the active tab shown prominently at the top.
- **Domain Connection Summary**: A count of distinct domains connected to from this tab.
- **Connection Categories**: Three sections listing connected domains by outcome:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains fully accessed by the tab.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked**: Domains explicitly blocked by content blockers.

Each domain entry shows how many connection attempts were made.

<Tip>
The popup dynamically updates as you browse, reflecting real-time network activity for the active tab.
</Tip>

## 3. Understanding the Default Monitoring Behavior

uBO Scope automatically begins monitoring network requests as soon as it is installed and enabled. There is no need to manually start or configure monitoring for the extension to work.

### What Happens On Installation:

- **Permissions Requested**:
  - Access to site data on all HTTP and HTTPS sites (`https://*/*` and `http://*/*`) to observe network requests.
  - Permission to use the `webRequest` API to track all network requests and their outcomes.
  - Active tab permission to interact with the current page.
  - Storage permission to save session data about network requests.

- **Background Operation**: The extension's background process listens to all network events automatically using browser APIs.

- **Data Collection**: It records successful connections, blocked requests, and stealth-blocked attempts, categorizing domains accordingly.

- **Badge Count**: The toolbar icon shows a badge with the count of distinct third-party domains contacted by the active tab, allowing at-a-glance monitoring.

<Note>
The monitoring captures connections regardless of whether you have other content blockers installed. It acts as a transparent observer, reporting all connection attempts.
</Note>

## 4. Initial Extension Permissions & Security

When installed, uBO Scope requests permissions aligned with its purpose to observe network requests:

- **Host Permissions (`host_permissions`)**: Allows access to URL patterns for HTTP and HTTPS (and additionally WebSocket in Firefox and Chromium) to monitor traffic.
- **WebRequest Permission**: Necessary to listen for network events to detect success, errors, and redirects.
- **Storage Permission**: Used to save monitoring session data locally for popup display and persistent tracking.
- **Active Tab Permission**: Lets the extension interact with currently active web pages for accurate context.

These permissions are standard and strictly scoped to enable the extension’s core functionality without interfering with page content or blocking any requests.

<Tip>
Review the extension permissions in your browser’s extension management page if you want to validate what uBO Scope has access to.
</Tip>

## 5. What Happens Behind the Scenes on First Use

Upon installation and browser startup:

- **Session Data Loading**: uBO Scope loads any previously stored session data about network requests, so your monitoring can pick up where it left off.

- **Public Suffix List Loading**: It loads the public suffix list to accurately derive domain names from hostnames for proper grouping.

- **Network Request Monitoring**: Begins capturing all network requests matching its permissions, classifying them as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

- **Tab Association**: Network requests are tracked per browser tab, allowing the popup to show domain connections on a per-tab basis.

- **Badge Updates**: The extension updates the toolbar icon badge count live as requests complete.

<Note>
You do not need to refresh tabs or manually activate the extension once installed; all monitoring is automatic.
</Note>

## 6. What to Expect Next

With uBO Scope installed and running, your next hands-on step is to explore network connections on a few websites by:

1. Navigating to some sites.
2. Clicking the uBO Scope icon to see connection reports.
3. Observing how badge counts change with browsing activity.

For guidance on interpreting this data and understanding what it means for your privacy and browsing experience, see the guide "[Viewing Your First Connection Report](../guides/getting-started/first-connection-report)".

## Troubleshooting Common First-Use Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common First Launch Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Icon Not Visible After Installation">
If the extension icon does not appear:

- Make sure your browser version meets the minimum required (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Restart the browser to complete installation.
- Check that the extension is enabled in your extension/addon manager.
- In Chrome, pin the extension via the puzzle icon dropdown.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty on a Page">
The popup may initially show no data if the tab has no network requests yet or if you just installed uBO Scope.

- Reload the current tab to trigger network requests.
- Try browsing to a site that loads external resources.
- Verify permissions in the browser extension settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Appear or Update">
If the badge count on the icon does not update:

- Confirm you have navigated to a webpage with network activity.
- Clear session data by disabling and re-enabling the extension.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions.
</Accordion>
