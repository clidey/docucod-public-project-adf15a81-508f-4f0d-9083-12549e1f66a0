# First Launch and What to Expect

Welcome to uBO Scope! This page guides you through what to expect immediately after activating the extension for the first time. Learn how to recognize the badge icon, access the popup interface, and address any permission requests or browser notifications you might encounter.

---

## 1. Recognizing the uBO Scope Badge Icon

Once installed and activated, uBO Scope places its icon on your browser's toolbar.

- **Badge Count:** The icon’s badge displays a number representing the count of distinct third-party domains for which connections have been observed on the current browser tab.
- A **lower count** signals fewer third-party connections, which generally indicates better privacy.
- When there is no network activity yet, or no third-party connections, the badge remains empty.

### How to spot the badge:

- Look for the uBO Scope icon, which uses a simple shield-like logo.
- The badge text appears over the icon and updates dynamically as you browse.

<Tip>
The badge count reflects third-party domains contacted independently of any content blockers you may be using, giving you an unbiased view of network exposure.
</Tip>

## 2. Accessing the Extension Popup

uBO Scope provides detailed information through the popup interface accessible directly from the badge icon.

### Steps to open the popup:

<Steps>
<Step title="Click the uBO Scope icon">
Click the extension icon on your browser toolbar to open the popup. This is your control center for viewing connection details.
</Step>
<Step title="View the tab summary">
The popup header shows the hostname of the current tab’s webpage.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore categories of third-party connections">
Within the popup, third-party domains are grouped into three outcomes:
- **Not blocked** — connections allowed.
- **Stealth-blocked** — connections silently redirected or intercepted.
- **Blocked** — connections explicitly blocked or failed.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect domain counts">
Each domain row displays the domain name alongside the count of connection attempts observed.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the popup shows "NO DATA", it means uBO Scope has not yet recorded network connections for the current tab. Reload the page to start monitoring.
</Tip>

## 3. Initial Permissions and Browser Notifications

On first activation, your browser may prompt you to allow specific permissions required for uBO Scope to function optimally.

### Permissions Requested:

- **webRequest**: Allows uBO Scope to monitor network requests made by webpages.
- **activeTab**: Enables the extension to access information on the active tab for accurate monitoring.
- **storage**: Used for storing temporary session data regarding network requests.

### Common browser prompts:

- Some browsers show a warning about extensions that monitor your browsing activity.
- Accept these prompts to enable full functionality.

<Warning>
Denying required permissions will prevent uBO Scope from capturing network connections correctly, impacting data accuracy.
</Warning>

## 4. What Happens After Activation

- uBO Scope starts passively listening to all web requests from the tabs you visit.
- The badge count updates in real time, reflecting live third-party connection data.
- The popup dynamically shows detailed breakdowns as data becomes available.

<Info>
Because uBO Scope uses the browser’s native `webRequest` API, it works transparently alongside other blockers and cannot block requests itself.
</Info>
