# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Ensure you meet these prerequisites before installing and using uBO Scope to guarantee a seamless experience. This page outlines supported browsers, operating systems, permissions, and constraints based on the product's capabilities and browser environments.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension that depends critically on the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network connections. Support varies slightly depending on the browser platform.

- **Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)**
  - Minimum version: **Chrome 122.0** or equivalent
  - Installation: Available via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - Supports `webRequest` API with required permissions
  
- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum version: **Firefox 128.0** (including Firefox for Android)
  - Installation: Available via [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
  - Implements `webRequest` API fully for this extension's needs

- **Safari (Safari Web Extensions)**
  - Minimum version: **Safari 18.5**
  - Installation: Through Safari's Extensions Gallery or direct distribution (manual install may be required)
  - Uses Safari-specific manifest setting `browser_specific_settings.safari.strict_min_version` to enforce compatibility

<Tip>
If your browser does not meet these version requirements, uBO Scope will not operate correctly as it depends on modern browser APIs.
</Tip>

## 2. Operating System Requirements

Since uBO Scope is a browser extension, it inherits OS compatibility from the supported browsers themselves. Be sure your system supports the following:

- Operating System: Any OS that supports the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, including:
  - Windows 10 and later
  - macOS Ventura (13) or later (especially for Safari 18.5+)
  - Linux distributions capable of running latest Chromium or Firefox browsers
  - Mobile platforms supported by Firefox (Android 128+)

## 3. Permissions and Access Requirements

To function fully, uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions:

- **Host Permissions:**
  - Ability to monitor network requests on all HTTP and HTTPS URLs including WebSocket connections.
  - Manifest declares host permissions for `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, and `ws://*/*` (except Safari limits WebSocket permissions).

- **Extension Permissions:**
  - `activeTab`: To interact with the active browsing tab.
  - `storage`: To persist session data and public suffix list across browsing sessions.
  - `webRequest`: Core API for network monitoring.

<Warning>
Most browsers will prompt or restrict extension permissions, so make sure to accept all necessary permissions on installation.
</Warning>

## 4. Network and API Requirements

- uBO Scope operates exclusively through the browser's `webRequest` API, which provides real-time access to all outgoing network requests.
  - Requests made outside of what `webRequest` exposes (such as some service workers or browser-internal requests) cannot be monitored.

- Firewalls or network proxies should not block the extension's access to these APIs.

## 5. Limitations and Known Constraints

- Some browsers (notably Safari) restrict or limit full `webRequest` API functionality, which may affect monitoring of WebSocket connections.
- The badge count shown on the toolbar icon represents the count of unique third-party remote servers contactedâ€”note that a lower count is generally better and indicates fewer distinct external connections.

## 6. Underlying Domain Handling

- uBO Scope leverages the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/list/) to correctly identify domain registrable parts and third-party domain relationships.
- This improves the accuracy of third-party detection by ignoring suffixes like `.co.uk` or `.com.au` as standalone domains.

## 7. Summary: Installation Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Browser is Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+
- [ ] Operating System supports the installed browser version
- [ ] Granted extension permissions: activeTab, storage, webRequest
- [ ] Network environment permits operation of browser webRequest API
- [ ] Familiarity with badge count meaning (distinct third-party connections)
