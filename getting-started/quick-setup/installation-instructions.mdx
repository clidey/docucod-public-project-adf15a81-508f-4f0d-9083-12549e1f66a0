### 3. Manual Package Installation

If you prefer to install uBO Scope manually or want the latest built version, follow these instructions. This is especially useful for developers or users who want to sideload the extension.

#### 3.1 Build the Extension Package

You must build uBO Scope for your target platform. This assumes a Linux environment with dependencies like `jq` and `zip` installed.

**Build for Chromium:**
```bash
./tools/make-chromium.sh
```

**Build for Firefox:**
```bash
./tools/make-firefox.sh
```

**Build for Safari:** (manual packaging steps may vary; see documentation or repo for details)
- Copy the `platform/safari` directory files to your extension folder.


This will create a zipped extension package in the `build/` directory:
- `build/uBO-Scope.chromium.zip`
- `build/uBO-Scope.firefox.xpi`

#### 3.2 Load the Extension into Your Browser

##### Chromium-based browsers

1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the extracted `build/uBO-Scope.chromium` directory.
5. Confirm the extension icon appears in your toolbar.

##### Firefox

1. Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Select the `build/uBO-Scope.firefox.xpi` file or unpacked directory.
4. The extension loads temporarily (until browser restart).

##### Safari

Safari manual installation requires unpacking and signing the extension per Apple’s developer guidelines.

> For details, see Apple’s [Safari Web Extension Installation documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions).

## 4. Verifying Installation

After installation, verify uBO Scope is active and working:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
2. Click the icon while visiting any webpage.
3. The popup should display the hostname and a count of connected domains.
4. You will see sections labeled **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** with domain lists.

If the popup shows **NO DATA** or remains blank, ensure your browser version supports the extension, and permissions are granted.
