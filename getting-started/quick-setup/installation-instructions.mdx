# Installation (All Supported Browsers)

Get uBO Scope quickly up and running on your preferred browser. This guide walks you through installing the extension on Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari, both via official stores and manual installation methods using packaged builds.

---

## Supported Browsers

- **Chromium-based browsers:** Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera (version 122 or later)
- **Mozilla Firefox:** version 128 or later
- **Safari:** version 18.5 or later

> Ensure your browser is updated to meet these minimum version requirements for full compatibility.

---

## 1. Installing uBO Scope from Official Browser Stores

The easiest way to install is from your browser's official extension/add-on store. This method ensures automatic updates and trusted sources.

### Chromium Browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Brave):

1. Open your browser.
2. Visit the [Chrome Web Store uBO Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
3. Click **Add to Chrome** (or equivalent for your browser).
4. Confirm the installation when prompted.

### Firefox:

1. Open Firefox.
2. Navigate to the official uBO Scope page on [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
3. Click **Add to Firefox**.
4. Approve the required permissions to complete installation.

### Safari:

1. Open Safari (ensure you are running version 18.5+).
2. Open the [Mac App Store Extensions page](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ubo-scope/idXXXXX) or search for uBO Scope in Safari Extensions.
3. Install uBO Scope from the Extensions section.

> Note: The Safari version of uBO Scope requires Safari's manifest version 3 extension support, available from Safari 18.5.

## 2. Manual Installation Using Packaged Builds

If you prefer manual installation, want to use a specific version, or are testing the extension, you can build and install uBO Scope locally.

You need a Linux environment or compatible shell where you can run the provided scripts.

### Building the Extension Packages

The repository includes scripts under the `tools/` directory to build platform-specific packages.

Each script:

- Copies necessary assets and source files
- Updates the version number if provided
- Packages the extension into a zip or XPI file

#### Build Scripts:

| Script | Target Browser | Output Format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tools/make-chromium.sh` | Chromium browsers | ZIP archive
| `tools/make-firefox.sh` | Firefox | XPI archive
| `tools/make-safari.sh` | Safari | ZIP archive

#### How to build:

Open a terminal in the root directory of the repository, then run:

```bash
# For Chromium (example version 1.0.1)
./tools/make-chromium.sh 1.0.1

# For Firefox (example version 1.0.1)
./tools/make-firefox.sh 1.0.1

# For Safari (example version 1.0.1)
./tools/make-safari.sh 1.0.1
```

You can omit the version argument to build the package without modifying the manifest version.

The packaged files will be created inside the `build/` folder, e.g., `build/uBO-Scope.chromium.zip`.

### Installing the Manually Built Extension

#### Chromium Browsers:
1. Open your browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the unpacked directory: `build/uBO-Scope.chromium`.

Alternatively, install using the ZIP package by unpacking it first.

#### Firefox:
1. Open Firefox.
2. Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
3. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
4. Select the built XPI file: `build/uBO-Scope.firefox.xpi`.

> Temporary add-ons are disabled on browser restart.

To install permanently, upload the XPI via `about:addons` or use Firefox's developer signing process.

#### Safari:

Manual installation for Safari extensions requires using Xcode or Safari's developer tools:

1. Unzip the built archive `build/uBO-Scope.safari.zip`.
2. Open Safari, enable **Developer Menu** in Preferences > Advanced.
3. Use **Develop > Show Extension Builder**.
4. Load the unpacked extension folder.
5. Build and install the extension via Safari's developer tools.

## 3. Verifying Installation

After installation:

- The uBO Scope icon appears in your browser's toolbar.
- When visiting websites, the icon badge will display the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- Click the icon to open the popup panel showing categorized connections.

---

## 4. Tips and Best Practices

- **Use official store versions whenever possible** for security and auto updates.
- If manually installing, enable developer modes carefully and disable after troubleshooting.
- Keep your browser updated to maintain compatibility and functionality.
- Review required browser permissions such as `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` to understand what the extension accesses.

<Warning>
Ensure you trust the source when installing manually built extensions, as developer mode installations bypass store protections.
</Warning>

## 5. Troubleshooting Installation Issues

### Extension icon not appearing?

- Verify your browser version meets minimum requirements.
- Confirm the extension was enabled in the extensions/add-ons page.
- Restart your browser and check again.

### Manual load failed?

- Make sure you selected the correct unpacked directory (root folder containing manifest).
- On Firefox, ensure the built XPI corresponds to the current browser version.
- Review browser console or debugging messages for errors.

### Safari extension installation issues?

- Confirm Safari version is 18.5 or above.
- Use Safari's developer tools to load the unpacked folder as an extension.
- Follow Apple's developer documentation for troubleshooting manifest v3 extensions.

For persistent issues, refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](getting-started/validation-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-common-issues) page.
