# First Launch & Basic Usage Guide for uBO Scope

Welcome to the first step in leveraging the power of uBO Scope. This guide walks you through opening the extension popup after installation, understanding how to read domain connection overviews, interpreting badge counts, and viewing your initial network statistics as you browse.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

After installing uBO Scope on your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+), you can access the extension’s popup interface to view detailed information about network connections:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It uses the uBO Scope logo and will appear alongside your other extensions.
2. Click the icon once to open the popup panel.

The popup will immediately display relevant information about the active browser tab.

<Check>
Ensure uBO Scope is enabled in your browser extensions list and permissions are granted to monitor network requests.
</Check>

## 2. Understanding the Domain Connection Overview

The popup panel offers a clear snapshot of third-party network interactions for the current tab.

### Main Elements:

- **Tab Hostname Header:** Shows the domain of the active tab. It splits the hostname and domain visually, with the domain in bold.
- **Connections Summary:** Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains connected by the current tab.
- **Connection Categories:** uBO Scope categorizes network connections into three groups:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which network requests succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains involved in redirects or stealth-blocking behaviors.
  - **Blocked:** Domains for which network requests failed or were blocked.

Each category shows a list of domains and the count of network requests made per domain.

---

## 3. Interpreting Badge Counts

The badge number over the toolbar icon represents the total count of distinct third-party domains successfully connected during the current tab's session.

- A **lower badge count** indicates fewer remote third-party servers contacted, which often aligns with improved privacy.
- **Note:** The badge does not count requests blocked or stealth-blocked—only the allowed domains.

## 4. Viewing Your First Network Statistics in Action

Once you open the popup, you will see live data representing the network activity for the active tab:

1. The domain of the current webpage appears at the top.
2. The summary presents how many distinct third-party domains were connected.
3. Each of the three sections (Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, Blocked) lists the domains ordered alphabetically with the number of requests made.

For example:

```
Tab Hostname: example.
                  com

domains connected: 5

not blocked
examplecdn.com  10
analytics.io    3

stealth-blocked
tracker.hidden 2

blocked
ads.badsite.net 7
```

This information helps you understand which third-party domains are contacted, providing transparency into your browsing session.

## 5. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Open the popup frequently on different sites to get an overview of third-party connections.
- Use the badge count as a quick privacy indicator while browsing.
- Remember not all third-party connections are inherently harmful; many relate to legitimate services like CDNs.
- If the popup shows no data or 'NO DATA', try reloading the tab or visiting a different page.

<Warning>
The extension relies on the browser's `webRequest` API and may have limitations reporting requests outside its scope.
</Warning>

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Usage Issues

### Popup shows NO DATA or is empty
- Ensure you have an active tab selected with a loaded webpage.
- Reload the tab to refresh network data.
- Verify uBO Scope has required permissions in your browser.

### Badge count not updating
- Network requests might not be visible due to browser privacy settings.
- Check that no conflicting extensions block `webRequest` events.
- Restart the browser if issues persist.

### Domains show unexpected or international characters
- uBO Scope automatically converts encoded domain names (punycode) to readable Unicode.
- This display supports internationalized domain names clearly.

### Code Snippet for Quick Reference

```javascript
// Example: Fetch and render data for active tab
const [tab] = await browser.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true });
const tabId = tab.id;
sendMessage({ what: 'getTabData', tabId })
  .then(response => {
    const data = deserialize(response);
    renderPanel(data);
  });
```

This code represents the core logic behind the popup’s data retrieval mechanism.
