# First Launch & Product Overview

Welcome to uBO Scope—a lightweight yet powerful extension that reveals all remote server connections your browser attempts to make. This guide walks you through your very first interaction with uBO Scope, helping you find the extension icon, understand what its badge count means, and effectively use the popup interface to see your connection statistics live.

## 1. Locating the uBO Scope Extension

After successfully installing uBO Scope, the extension integrates directly into your browser toolbar.

### Step 1: Look for the Toolbar Icon

- **Where to find it:** The uBO Scope icon displays in your browser's extension toolbar area, typically to the right of the address bar.
- **What it looks like:** The icon uses the uBO logo in various sizes depending on your browser and screen resolution (16px to 128px).

### Step 2: Pin the Extension for Easy Access

For quick access, pin the uBO Scope icon if your browser supports pinning:

- Click the extensions puzzle icon (or equivalent) in your browser toolbar.
- Find "uBO Scope" in the listed extensions.
- Click the pin icon next to it so it remains visible.

<Tip>
Pinning the uBO Scope extension ensures you can instantly monitor network activity without hunting through menus.

## 2. Understanding the Badge Count

The small numeric badge overlaid on the extension icon is uBO Scope’s quick privacy indicator.

### What Does the Badge Show?

- **Number Meaning:** It shows the count of distinct third-party remote servers your current active tab has connected to.
- **Why It Matters:** A lower badge count generally means fewer third-party connections, indicating better privacy.

### Important Details:

- The badge **reports only distinct third-party domains** contacted, not the total network requests.
- It reflects both allowed and potentially stealth-blocked connections.
- It updates dynamically as you browse.

<Note>
Not all third-party connections are harmful—many correspond to legitimate CDNs or services. Use the badge as a general privacy signal, not a blocker performance score.
</Note>

## 3. Accessing and Navigating the Popup Interface

Clicking the uBO Scope icon opens a detailed popup interface where you can explore connection statistics for your current tab.

### Step 1: Open the Popup

- Simply click on the uBO Scope extension icon.
- The popup loads, showing data related to the active browser tab.

### Step 2: Explore Connection Overview

Once open, the popup presents:

- The **host name** of the current active tab prominently at the top.
- A **summary** showing the total number of distinct domains connected.

### Step 3: Understand the Sections

The popup breaks down connections into three clear categories:

| Section         | Description                                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked** | Domains whose connections were allowed and completed.       |
| **Stealth-blocked** | Domains whose connections were stealthily blocked (hidden). |
| **Blocked**     | Domains whose connections were explicitly blocked.          |

### Step 4: Viewing Domain Details

- Each category lists domains along with counts of connection attempts.
- Domains are displayed using unicode-aware formatting for internationalized domain names (IDNs).

<Check>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or no domains, try reloading the page or switching to a different tab.
</Check>
