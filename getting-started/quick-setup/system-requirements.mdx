# System Requirements for uBO Scope

Understanding the system requirements of uBO Scope is essential to ensure smooth installation and reliable operation. This page clarifies the minimum browser versions and supported platforms where uBO Scope functions optimally. Meeting these prerequisites prevents compatibility issues and enables you to immediately benefit from uBO Scope's network connection visibility.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with the three major browser platforms. To ensure full functionality, please verify your browser meets the following minimum version requirements:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and others)
  - Minimum Version: **122.0**
  - Manifest Version: 3 extensions
- **Firefox (Desktop and Android)**
  - Minimum Version: **128.0**
  - Manifest Version: 3 extensions
- **Safari**
  - Minimum Version: **18.5**
  - Manifest Version: 3 extensions

<u>Note:</u> These minimum versions align with the manifest and browser-specific settings defined in the extension's manifest files.

---

## 2. Supported Platforms

The extension is fully supported on the following platforms:

- Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions running Chromium 122+ browsers
- Firefox desktop on Windows, macOS, Linux
- Firefox Android 128+
- Safari on macOS (version 18.5+) and Safari-supported iOS devices

---

## 3. Required Browser Features

uBO Scope relies on several modern browser capabilities:

- **Manifest Version 3 support:** The extension uses service worker or background script modules depending on the platform.
- **WebRequest API with blocking and reporting:** Needed for monitoring network requests and reporting their outcomes.
- **Storage API:** For saving session data and configuration.

If your browser does not support Manifest V3 extensions or these APIs, uBO Scope will not function correctly.

---

## 4. Network and Permissions Requirements

To track network connections, uBO Scope requests the following host permissions:

- HTTPS and HTTP URLs (`https://*/*`, `http://*/*`)
- WebSocket URLs (`wss://*/*`, `ws://*/*`) â€” supported on Chromium and Firefox

Ensure your security software or firewall does not block these permissions or interfere with extension operations.

## 5. Browser Compatibility Notes

| Browser     | Minimum Version | Notes                                           |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium    | 122.0+          | Supports all features and permissions as expected. |
| Firefox     | 128.0+          | Full support including WebSocket monitoring.       |
| Safari      | 18.5+           | Limited to HTTP/HTTPS, WebSocket monitoring not fully supported due to platform restrictions. |

<u>Tip:</u> Always keep your browser updated to the latest stable version to maximize compatibility and security.

---

## 6. What Happens If Requirements Are Not Met?

- If your browser version is lower than required, the extension may fail to install or silently malfunction.
- The badge count might not update correctly or extension popups may show limited or no data.
- Certain network request types, especially WebSockets, may not be tracked.

In such cases, upgrading your browser is the recommended solution.

## 7. Verifying Your Environment

Before installing uBO Scope, perform the following checks:

1. Check your browser version:

   - **Chromium/Chrome:** Go to `chrome://settings/help`
   - **Firefox:** Go to `about:support`
   - **Safari:** Click `Safari` > `About Safari`

2. Confirm browser version meets or exceeds minimum listed above.

3. Review your extensions settings for permissions, ensuring uBO Scope is allowed to access required URLs.

4. Verify you have no firewall or antivirus software blocking extension functionality.
