## 3. Required Extension Permissions

uBO Scope requires the following core permissions, granted during extension installation:

| Permission    | Purpose                                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `activeTab`   | To access data about the active browser tab                   |
| `storage`     | To store extension state and session data                     |
| `webRequest`  | To monitor network requests and report connections            |

Additionally, uBO Scope requests **host permissions** to monitor connections across all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs:

- `http://*/*`
- `https://*/*`
- `ws://*/*`
- `wss://*/*`

These permissions enable comprehensive tracking of web requests, crucial for accurate diagnostics.

---

## 4. Network and Browser Environment

For effective operation, uBO Scope requires:

- Network connectivity allowing the browser to make web requests
- Browsers configured to allow extensions with host permissions

Firewalls or restrictive proxy configurations that interfere with browser web requests or block extension host permissions may prevent uBO Scope from fully capturing connection data.

## Troubleshooting Prerequisites Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with Prerequisites">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
Verify your browser version:

- **Chromium-based**: Go to `chrome://settings/help`

<Accordion title="Permissions Not Granted">
Without required permissions, uBO Scope cannot function:

- During installation, ensure you approve requested permissions.
- You can verify granted permissions in your browser's extensions management page.
- If accidentally denied, remove and reinstall the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Restrictions Prevent Data Monitoring">
Certain network configurations can block web requests or interfere with extension APIs.
