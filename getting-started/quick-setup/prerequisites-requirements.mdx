# Prerequisites & System Requirements

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to transparently measure all remote server connections initiated during your web browsing sessions. To ensure a smooth installation and optimal operation, please review the following prerequisites, system requirements, and permissions.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers & Versions

uBO Scope leverages modern browser extension APIs and therefore supports only the latest versions of major browsers. Ensure you are using one of the compatible browsers listed below:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.)
  - Minimum version: **122.0 or higher**
- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum version: **128.0 or higher**
- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum version: **18.5 or higher**


> These minimum versions are required because uBO Scope depends on Manifest Version 3 (MV3) extension support and modern WebExtension APIs.

## 2. System Requirements

Since uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension, system resource requirements are minimal. However, make sure the following conditions are met:

- **Operating System:** Any OS supporting the above browser versions (e.g., Windows 10+, macOS 11+, Linux distributions)
- **Memory:** At least 1 GB of RAM recommended to ensure browser and extension responsiveness
- **Disk Space:** Minimal; the extension occupies limited local storage mainly for session data and the public suffix list


## 3. Required Permissions

To operate effectively, uBO Scope requires the following browser permissions:

- **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to access data related to the active tab to track and analyze outgoing network connections
- **`storage`**: Used for saving session data and caching the Public Suffix List to accurately categorize domains
- **`webRequest`**: Core permission to monitor and intercept network requests to detect remote server connections

Additionally, uBO Scope declares host permissions for the following URL schemes to observe all relevant web traffic:

- HTTP and HTTPS URLs:
  - `http://*/*`
  - `https://*/*`
- WebSocket URLs:
  - `ws://*/*`
  - `wss://*/*`


> These permissions enable the extension to monitor all outgoing web and WebSocket connections, which is essential for full visibility of third-party resource requests.

## 4. Browser APIs Utilized

The extension depends on several key browser APIs, which are expected to be available and enabled in the supported browser versions:

- **`webRequest` API**: To listen for, intercept, and analyze network traffic events
- **`storage` API**: To persist session-specific data and the processed Public Suffix List
- **`tabs` API**: To identify and track the active browser tab for contextual data display
- **`action` API**: To manage browser action badges and popup UI


## 5. Network and Security Considerations

- Ensure your browser allows the extension to access network requests by not blocking or restricting extension permissions.
- Firewalls or network security software should not block the extension’s background scripts or browser APIs.
- uBO Scope fetches the latest Public Suffix List from `https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat` to accurately identify domain boundaries; network access to this URL must be allowed.


## 6. Compatibility Notes

- On **Chromium browsers**, uBO Scope uses a service worker as the background context.
- On **Firefox** and **Safari**, traditional background scripts with module support are used.


<Tip>
If you encounter issues with network monitoring or inaccurate domain categorization, check that your browser and extension permissions meet these minimum criteria and that webRequest and storage APIs are functioning correctly.
</Tip>

## Verification

Before proceeding with installation, you can verify your browser compatibility:

- In **Chrome/Edge**: Type `chrome://version` in the address bar and confirm the version number
- In **Firefox**: Type `about:support` and check the application version
- In **Safari**: From the menu, choose `About Safari` to verify the version

Confirm that the version is at or above the minimum as specified above to ensure full support.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Extension Permissions Not Granted">
Ensure when installing that you accept all requested permissions. Without `webRequest` and host permissions, uBO Scope cannot function properly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported Browser Version">
Update your browser to at least the minimum version indicated. Older versions lack Manifest V3 support which is critical.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Restrictions Preventing Public Suffix List Fetch">
uBO Scope downloads and caches the Public Suffix List on first run. Ensure that your firewall or network proxy does not block `https://publicsuffix.org`.
</Accordion>

## Summary

This page defines the platform, version, and permission requirements to run uBO Scope effectively. Meeting these prerequisites ensures you have the right browser environment, system conditions, and necessary permissions for optimal extension performance.
