# First Run: What to Expect

Welcome to your first experience with **uBO Scope**. This guide walks you through what happens when you launch the extension after installation, explains the meaning of the toolbar badge, and shows how to access and interpret the popup interface. Our goal is to get you monitoring your browser's remote connections in real time, unlocking valuable insights into network activity.

---

## 1. Launching uBO Scope

After you install uBO Scope in your supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari), the extension activates automatically. It begins monitoring all network requests from your active browser tabs immediately without any further setup.

### What Happens Behind the Scenes?
- As you browse, uBO Scope listens to your browser’s network events, tracking connections to remote servers.
- It categorizes connections into **allowed** (successful), **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked** (requests redirected by content blockers).
- The extension keeps a rolling count of distinct third-party domains your browser connects to.

<Tip>
No manual activation or configuration is required for the extension to start gathering data once installed.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The small numeric badge displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon is your immediate privacy gauge.

### What It Represents
- The badge number shows the **count of distinct third-party remote servers** your browser connected to for the current active tab.
- A **lower number indicates fewer third-party connections**, which often translates to stricter content blocking or less tracking.
- This number updates dynamically as new connections are detected or tabs are switched.

### Important Clarifications
- The badge counts domains, not individual requests. Many requests to the same domain count as one.
- Legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs) or essential third-party services can cause the count to rise.
- A higher count does not necessarily mean better blocking—some extensions may block fewer connections but cause a higher total.

<Note>
If you see no badge or the badge disappears, it may mean there are no connections to third-party servers from your current tab at that moment.
</Note>

## 3. Accessing the Popup Interface

The main interface for detailed insights is the popup panel, which you open by clicking the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.

### How to Open the Popup
1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s extension toolbar. It displays the badge count when active.
2. Click the icon once to open the popup.

### What You Will See
- The **top section** shows the hostname of the currently active tab and its base domain.
- The **summary line** displays the total count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- Three sections below break down the connected domains by outcome:
  - **Not Blocked**: Connections allowed successfully.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections redirected or stealthily blocked by content blockers.
  - **Blocked**: Connections outright blocked due to errors or preventing network access.

Each domain in these sections is listed with the number of requests made.

<Tip>
The domain names are shown in Unicode for better readability, using punycode conversion when needed.
</Tip>

## 4. What to Expect on Your First Browsing Session

When you first run uBO Scope:

- The badge number may initially be low or zero if you haven’t browsed any pages yet.
- As you visit websites, you will start seeing the badge number increase to reflect distinct third-party domains loading resources.
- Opening the popup allows you to see granular details of which domains are contacted and their connection outcome.

### Example Scenario
- You load a news website.
- uBO Scope reports connections to the main domain under “Not Blocked.”
- Several advertising and analytics third-party domains appear under “Blocked” or “Stealth-Blocked” depending on your content blocker settings.
- The badge updates to show the count of allowed third-party servers.

<Warning>
If the badge count remains empty or the popup shows “NO DATA” consistently:
- Confirm the extension was correctly installed.
- Ensure the browser version meets uBO Scope’s minimum requirements.
- Verify the extension has permission to monitor network requests.
See the [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](/getting-started/basic-usage-validation/troubleshooting-installation) guide for detailed help.
</Warning>

## 5. Real-Time Updates

uBO Scope continuously updates the badge and popup as network requests occur.

- The extension listens to network events including redirects, errors, and successful responses.
- It batches requests for performance efficiency, updating the display approximately every second.
- Switching tabs resets the count and data view to the context of the new active tab.

## 6. Best Practices and Tips

- **Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker:** It does not block connections itself but reports what happens through your existing blockers.
- **Check the badge frequently:** It’s your quick privacy indicator.
- **Open the popup for deep insights:** Understand which third-party domains are active per tab.
- **Reload tabs if needed:** Sometimes a reload helps capture initial connections.

## 7. What’s Next?

- Explore [Configuring uBO Scope](/getting-started/basic-usage-validation/configuring-ubo-scope) to adjust settings.
- Learn how to [Validate Connection Visibility](/getting-started/basic-usage-validation/validate-connection-visibility) for deeper testing.
- Investigate real-world use cases in the [Guides](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/tree/main/docs/guides).

## Troubleshooting Common First-Run Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Your First Run">
  <Accordion title="No Badge Appears After Installation">
    1. Refresh your browser tab or restart the browser.
    2. Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and visible in the toolbar.
    3. Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
    4. Verify permissions granted to uBO Scope, especially storage and webRequest.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists">
    - Make sure you have an active tab with loaded network connections.
    - Remember the popup reflects only the current active tab’s data.
    - Reload the tab if no data shows after some browsing.
    - Disable and re-enable the extension to reset its session.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Badge Number Does Not Update in Real Time">
    - The badge updates approximately every second to conserve resources.
    - Heavy browsing sessions or many tabs might delay updates.
    - Make sure no competing extension or browser setting blocks uBO Scope.
  </Accordion>
