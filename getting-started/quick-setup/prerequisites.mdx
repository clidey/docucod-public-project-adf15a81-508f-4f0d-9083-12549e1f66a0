# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the minimum requirements below to run uBO Scope smoothly and reliably. This page covers supported browsers, minimum browser versions, essential permissions, and system considerations necessary for uBO Scope to function as intended.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with the major modern browsers that support Manifest Version 3 extension APIs, particularly the `webRequest` API it relies on. To have a seamless experience, use the following browser versions or later:

- **Google Chrome / Chromium**: version **122.0** or higher
- **Mozilla Firefox**: version **128.0** or higher
- **Apple Safari**: version **18.5** or higher

<Note>
Older versions of these browsers lack critical API support required by uBO Scope, such as `webRequest` event handling and session storage features. Using unsupported versions may cause the extension to fail silently or provide incomplete data.
</Note>

## 2. Extension Permissions Required

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor and report every network connection a webpage attempts. These permissions are essential and requested during extension installation:

- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to interact with the currently active tab.
- **storage**: Access for saving session data such as network request history.
- **webRequest**: Fundamental permission to observe and report all network requests initiated by webpages.
- **host permissions**: Access to all URLs via these patterns:
  - `https://*/*`
  - `http://*/*`
  - `wss://*/*` (WebSocket Secure)
  - `ws://*/*` (WebSocket)

<Warning>
Denying any of these permissions will limit uBO Scope's visibility into network activity, reducing its transparency and accuracy.
</Warning>

## 3. System Requirements and Environment Considerations

While uBO Scope is lightweight and primarily depends on the browser, observe these system notes for optimal operation:

- **Operating System**: Any OS supporting the specified browser versions (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android for Firefox)
- **Memory**: Extension consumes minimal memory; typical usage is within a few dozen megabytes.
- **Network Access**: Since uBO Scope monitors network requests, your device must have normal internet access without aggressive firewall or proxy blocking that interferes with browser traffic.

## 4. Additional Notes on Browser Settings

- **Extension Installation**: You must have the privileges to install extensions in your browser.
- **WebRequest API Support**: Ensure that browser privacy settings or security extensions do not block access to the `webRequest` API.
- **Session Storage Support**: Browsers must support `storage.session` for transient session data tracking.

## 5. Checking Browser Version and Permissions

Follow these steps to verify your environment:

1. **Check Browser Version**:
   - Chrome: Open `chrome://settings/help` or `chrome://version`
   - Firefox: Open `about:support` or `about:version`
   - Safari: Click Safari menu > About Safari

2. **Verify Extension Permissions**:
   - After installation, open your browser’s extension management page.
   - Locate uBO Scope and check the listed permissions.
   - Ensure all required permissions (activeTab, storage, webRequest, host permissions) are granted.

3. **Allow Host Permissions**:
   - Some browsers may prompt to request additional host permissions on navigation.
   - Accept these to ensure full coverage.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Prerequisite Troubleshooting Tips">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
Update your browser to the latest stable release:

- Visit the official browser download page.
- Follow instructions for upgrading.
- Post-update, verify version again before installing uBO Scope.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing or Denied Permissions">
If the extension lacks required permissions:

- Go to Extensions → uBO Scope → Details.
- Enable all requested permissions.
- If prompted, reinstall the extension.
- In some cases, restart the browser for permissions to take effect.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Incompatible Browser or Platform">
uBO Scope requires browsers that support MV3 and `webRequest` end-points. Avoid using unsupported browsers or outdated forks.

If you experience lack of network data:

- Check if your browser supports the required APIs.
- Consult browser documentation or switch to a supported browser/version.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps

Once your environment meets the prerequisites documented here, proceed to the [Installing uBO Scope](../quick-setup/install-extension) page to add the extension to your browser and configure it for your first session.
