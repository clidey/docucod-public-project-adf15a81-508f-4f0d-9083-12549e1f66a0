# Install uBO Scope on Safari

This guide will walk you through installing uBO Scope on Safari, the Apple macOS and iOS web browser, including the key steps unique to Safari's extension system. By following these steps, you'll have uBO Scope actively monitoring your network connections and accessible from Safari's toolbar.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

- **Supported Browser Version**: Safari 18.5 or above (as specified in the manifest).
- **Operating System**: macOS with Safari 18.5 or later.
- **Permissions Needed**: Ability to install Safari web extensions via Safari Extension preferences.

<u>Note:</u> Safari extensions typically require enabling developer mode or installing from a signed package.

## 2. Installation Instructions

### 2.1 Obtain uBO Scope Safari Extension Package

uBO Scope for Safari is provided as a built extension package. If you want the latest stable release, check if it is available in the official Safari Extensions Gallery or the GitHub releases.

Alternatively, you can build it yourself from source:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
   cd uBO-Scope
   ```
2. Run the build script for Safari:
   ```bash
   ./tools/make-safari.sh
   ```
   This script packages the Safari extension into `build/uBO-Scope.safari.zip`.

### 2.2 Installing the Extension

1. Open Safari.
2. Go to the menu bar and select **Safari > Settings** (or **Preferences**).
3. Navigate to the **Extensions** tab.
4. Click the **More Extensions** button to open the App Store's Extensions section, or if you have the `.safariextension` or `.zip` file:
   - Drag and drop the extension package onto the Extensions page.
   - Alternatively, use Safari’s developer menu (enable it under **Safari > Preferences > Advanced → Show Develop menu**) and use **Develop > Show Extension Builder** to load the extension locally.

5. Safari will prompt you to confirm installation. Approve to install.
6. After installation, ensure the box to enable uBO Scope is checked.

## 3. Configuration & Setup

uBO Scope's Safari manifest requires minimal configuration. It works out of the box once installed and enabled.

- You do not need to configure host permissions; these are pre-defined.
- The extension integrates with Safari’s native extension system, ensuring all required permissions (`activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`) are granted during installation.

<Tip>
If you face issues enabling the extension, confirm that your macOS user account has permission to manage Safari extensions and that Safari is updated to version 18.5 or later.
</Tip>

## 4. First Operation Walkthrough

### 4.1 Verify the Extension Icon

Once installed and enabled, you will see the uBO Scope icon in Safari's toolbar (usually near the address bar).

### 4.2 Opening the Popup Panel

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
2. The popup panel will open, showing current tab information, including:
   - The hostname of the active tab.
   - The number of connected domains.
   - Categories of connection outcomes: **Not Blocked**, **Stealth-Blocked**, and **Blocked**.

### 4.3 Observe Real-Time Connection Data

## 5. Verify Extension Is Working Correctly

- The toolbar badge on the uBO Scope icon shows the count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- The popup displays categories of network requests made by the active tab.

If the badge count remains empty or the popup shows 'NO DATA', ensure:

- uBO Scope is **enabled** in Safari extensions.
- You have navigated to web pages that initiate network connections.
- No Safari content blocking or privacy settings are interfering with extension APIs.
