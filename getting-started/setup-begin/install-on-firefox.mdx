## 1. Prerequisites & System Compatibility

- **Supported Firefox Version**: Ensure you are using Firefox version 128.0 or newer, as this is the minimum version supporting uBO Scope.
- **Operating System**: Any OS where Firefox 128+ runs smoothly (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Internet Access**: Needed to access the Firefox Add-ons store and download the extension.

<Check>
Confirm you're running Firefox 128.0 or later before proceeding.
</Check>

## 2. Installing uBO Scope from Firefox Add-ons

Follow these exact steps to install the extension:

<Steps>
<Step title="Visit the uBO Scope Firefox Add-ons page">
Open your Firefox browser, then navigate to the official uBO Scope page on Firefox Add-ons by visiting:

`https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/`

This page hosts the current, verified version of the extension.
</Step>

<Step title="Start the installation">
Click the **Add to Firefox** button on the page.

You will see a browser prompt to review permissions before installation.
</Step>

<Step title="Review and accept permission prompts">
uBO Scope requires the following permissions:

- Access to data for websites you visit (to monitor network requests)
- Access to browser tabs
- Use of browser storage

Read these carefully. Accepting these permissions allows the extension to function correctly by monitoring network connections across tabs.

Click **Add** to continue.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm installation success">
When installation completes, Firefox will display a confirmation message.

You should see the uBO Scope icon added to your toolbar area — a small badge icon matching the extension’s logo.

If the icon is not visible, check the overflow menu (three dots on the toolbar) and pin the icon for convenient access.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you encounter any issues accessing the add-on page, verify your browser version and network connection.

Also, avoid installing the extension from third-party sites to prevent security risks.
</Tip>

## 3. Understanding Permission Requests

The permissions requested are essential for uBO Scope to monitor network connections accurately:

- **Access Your Data for All Websites**: Required so the extension can listen to all web requests your browser makes and classify them.
- **Access Browser Tabs**: To keep track of the active tab and aggregate connection data accordingly.
- **Storage Permission**: To save session data locally for reliable reporting.

<Warning>
Granting these permissions does not give uBO Scope control over your browser or personal data beyond monitoring network requests.

The extension does not modify or interfere with webpage content.
</Warning>

## 4. Confirming Successful Installation

To verify the extension is installed and working:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope Icon:** It should appear in your Firefox toolbar. It looks like the uBO Scope logo.

2. **Check the Icon Badge:** Upon browsing websites, the icon badge will display a number representing the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected by the active tab.

3. **Open the Extension Popup:** Click the icon to open the popup panel. You should see domain connection data categorized as ‘not blocked,’ ‘stealth-blocked,’ and ‘blocked’ originating from the current tab.

4. **Test on a Popular Website:** Navigate to a commonly visited site (like your favorite news site) and then click the popup to see real-time network connections.

<Check>
If you see data in the popup and the badge number updates as you navigate, the installation was successful.
</Check>

<Note>
The first visit to a site may show limited data until the extension accumulates requests during the page load.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Toolbar Icon:** Open Firefox’s Add-ons Manager (`about:addons`), locate uBO Scope, and click the 'Enable' button if disabled. Drag the icon from the overflow menu to the toolbar to pin it.

- **Permission Denied during Installation:** Make sure you have the latest Firefox version and no strict privacy extensions preventing installations.

- **No Badge Number Appearing:** Confirm you have given full site access permissions; without it, the extension cannot monitor network requests.

- **Popup Shows No Data:** Reload the active tab or navigate to a fresh website and then open the popup again.
