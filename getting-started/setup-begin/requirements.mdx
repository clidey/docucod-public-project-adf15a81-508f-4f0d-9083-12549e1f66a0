# Prerequisites & Supported Browsers for uBO Scope

Welcome to the starting point for setting up uBO Scope, your essential tool to reveal network connections made by your browser tabs. This guide focuses exclusively on the system requirements and supported browsers to ensure you have a smooth and frustration-free installation experience.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to operate seamlessly on the following modern browsers, each with officially supported minimum versions to guarantee full functionality:

- **Google Chrome (Chromium-based)**
  - Minimum version: 122.0
  - Installation via Chrome Web Store.
  - Supports WebSocket protocols (`wss://` and `ws://`).

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum version: 128.0
  - Installation via Firefox Add-ons Marketplace.
  - Includes explicit support for Firefox's WebExtension manifest specifics.

- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum version: 18.5
  - Installation via Safari Extensions Gallery or appropriate channels.
  - Supports HTTP/S but does not officially list WebSocket host permissions.


> All three browsers support the core permissions needed by uBO Scope: access to active tabs, storage for data persistence, and the `webRequest` API to monitor network activity.

## 2. Operating System Compatibility

Because uBO Scope operates as a browser extension, compatibility depends primarily on the supported browsers rather than specific OS limitations. Accordingly:

- **Windows, macOS, Linux**
  - Supported via Chrome and Firefox browsers.

- **iOS / iPadOS**
  - Supported via Safari starting version 18.5.
  - Chromium-based browsers on iOS are subject to Apple's WebKit limitations.

- **Android**
  - Supported via Firefox with minimum version 128.0.
  - Chromium browsers on Android should support the extension from Chrome 122 onward.


## 3. Browser Permissions Required

For uBO Scope to monitor and report network requests effectively, it requires the following permissions at installation:

- `activeTab`: To obtain information about the currently active tab.
- `storage`: To store session and configuration data persistently.
- `webRequest`: To listen to network requests and their outcomes.

Additionally, the extension requests host permissions for URLs matching:

- `https://*/*`
- `http://*/*`
- For Chromium and Firefox versions: also `wss://*/*` and `ws://*/*`

> These permissions enable uBO Scope to monitor requests across HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket protocols.


## 4. System Requirements

To achieve responsive and reliable results, ensure your system meets these baseline requirements:

- **Memory and Storage:**
  - Minimal disk space usage; the extension stores only session and suffix list data.
  - Browser allocated RAM is sufficient; uBO Scope's footprint is lightweight.

- **Network:**
  - No special firewall or proxy configuration needed; standard outbound access to the web for updates and data fetching.

- **Browser Features:**
  - Support for Manifest V3 extensions.
  - Support for the `webRequest` API.


## 5. Before You Begin: Preparation Steps

Follow these simple steps before installing uBO Scope to avoid common pitfalls:

1. **Update Your Browser:** Ensure your browser is updated to at least the minimum supported version defined above.
2. **Review Extension Permissions:** Be prepared to grant requested permissions during installation.
3. **Disable Conflicting Extensions:** Especially other web request monitorers or older versions of uBlock Origin.
4. **Network Access:** Confirm your network environment does not block extension installations or API calls.


## 6. Verification & Troubleshooting

If you face issues during installation or operation, consider the following:

- Ensure the browser version meets the minimum requirement.
- Verify that WebExtension support (Manifest V3) is fully enabled.
- For Firefox, confirm your version is at least 128.0 or above.
- On Safari, confirm macOS or iOS version supports Safari 18.5+.
- Check that permissions were granted fully upon installation.
- Ensure no restrictive firewall or security software interferes with network hooks.


## 7. Summary

By confirming you meet the above prerequisites — updated supported browsers, appropriate permissions, and system readiness — you're perfectly set to install and enjoy uBO Scope effortlessly.
