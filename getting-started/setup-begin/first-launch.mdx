# Your First Run: Opening the Popup & Seeing Results

Welcome to your first interaction with uBO Scope! This guide walks you through accessing the extension's popup in your browser, explains what you'll see on your initial visit, and clarifies how uBO Scope immediately starts reporting remote server connections for the active tab. You'll learn how to interpret the badge count quickly and understand the core visual feedback uBO Scope provides.

---

## 1. Accessing the uBO Scope Popup

uBO Scope is designed to provide instant, real-time visibility into your active tab’s network connections through its popup interface. Accessing this popup differs slightly by browser:

### Chrome
1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar (it looks like a shield).
2. Click the icon to open the popup window.

### Firefox
1. Find the uBO Scope icon on your toolbar.
2. Click it to display the popup with connection details.

### Safari
1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar button.
2. The popup will open, showing connection statistics.


<Tip>
If you don’t see the uBO Scope icon, ensure the extension is installed and enabled. You may need to pin it to your toolbar from the extensions menu.
</Tip>

## 2. What You See on Your First Visit

Upon opening the popup for the first time, uBO Scope immediately begins reporting network activity from the active tab, categorizing connections to remote servers as follows:

- **Not blocked (Allowed):** Connections that were permitted by your browser or content blocker.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections silently or invisibly prevented, often through redirections.
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked and failed.

### Popup Layout Overview

- **Tab Hostname:** At the top, the domain of the active tab is displayed prominently.
- **Summary Section:** Shows the total number of distinct domains your current tab connected to.
- **Outcome Sections:** Three separate panels list domains by their network request outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked), including how many requests per domain.

## 3. Understanding the Badge Count

The badge on the browser toolbar icon displays a number reflecting the **count of distinct domains your current tab has successfully connected to that were not blocked**.

- A badge number appears only if at least one allowed connection exists.
- This count does **not** include blocked or stealth-blocked domains.
- The count updates dynamically as network requests are made and processed.

<Info>
A **lower badge count is generally better**, indicating fewer third-party connections were allowed, which often correlates with improved privacy.
</Info>

## 4. How uBO Scope Starts Working Immediately

The moment the popup opens, uBO Scope actively listens to your browser’s network requests for the current tab, showing live updates:

- New remote server connections appear automatically.
- Domains are categorized instantly based on request results.
- The popup refreshes to always show up-to-date activity.

This immediate feedback lets you monitor third-party activity on any webpage effortlessly.

## 5. Quick Steps to Verify Your First Run

## 6. Tips for First-Time Users

- **Keep the popup open** for live updates on network connections.
- The tab hostname reflects the top frame's domain.
- Domains in the popup are counted at the domain level, not just hostnames.

## 7. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Your First Run">  
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty">  
Make sure you have an active tab where network requests are being made. Reload the tab to generate new activity. Some sites with minimal network calls may show limited data.

<Accordion title="Badge Count Stays Blank or Does Not Update">  
Verify that uBO Scope is enabled with required permissions. Also, ensure no browser security settings or other extensions are blocking webRequest API access.
