# Solving Common Installation Problems

This page provides quick, practical solutions to the most frequent installation issues users encounter with **uBO Scope**. Whether your extension doesn’t appear after installation, you face problems related to specific browser stores, or errors arise during script-based installation, this guide equips you to resolve them effectively and get up and running with minimal delay.

---

## 1. Extension Not Appearing After Installation

### Step 1: Confirm Browser Compatibility
- Verify you are using a supported browser:
  - **Chromium-based browsers** (Chrome 122 or later)
  - **Firefox** (version 128 or later)
  - **Safari** (version 18.5 or later)

> Check your browser version by accessing its `About` page.

### Step 2: Confirm Extension Installed Correctly
- Install only from official sources listed in the [Installation Steps](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope#getting-started/introduction-installation/installation-steps) or load unpacked extensions using developer mode.
- After installation, look for the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar.

### Step 3: Ensure Extension Is Enabled
- Go to the browser’s extensions or add-ons page.
- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled.
- If disabled or uninstalled, re-enable or reinstall.

### Step 4: Check Manifest and Permissions
- Some browsers enforce minimum version and permission requirements.
- The extension requires permissions including `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
- If permissions are blocked, the extension may not load properly.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Icon Missing**: Try restarting the browser.
- **Extension Installed But No Activity**: Ensure permissions requested during installation were accepted.
- **Toolbar Icon Hidden**: In Chromium-based browsers, right-click the toolbar and choose “Show extension icon”.

## 2. Store-Specific Installation Issues

### Chrome Web Store
- **Issue**: Extension doesn’t install or update.
- **Resolution**:
  - Clear the Chrome Web Store cache.
  - Restart your browser.
  - Verify you are logged in with the correct Google account.

### Firefox Add-ons Store
- **Issue**: Add-on blocked or not listed.
- **Resolution**:
  - Firefox requires extensions to meet strict signing policies.
  - Ensure you have the latest Firefox version.
  - Use the official Firefox Add-ons site to install.
  - If using developer versions or non-signed installs, enable developer mode in about:config.

### Safari Extensions
- **Issue**: Extension not appearing or can’t be enabled.
- **Resolution**:
  - Safari requires a minimum version of 18.5.
  - Confirm that the extension is installed via the official App Store.
  - Check Safari’s Extensions Preferences pane and enable uBO Scope.
  - Restart Safari after enabling.

## 3. Problems with Script-Based or Manual Installation

If you installed uBO Scope manually (e.g., loading unpacked extension during development):

### Step 1: Check Loading Process
- Open the browser’s extensions page (chrome://extensions or about:addons).
- Enable developer mode.
- Load the extension directory using the "Load unpacked" or equivalent option.

### Step 2: Verify Manifest and File Structure
- The manifest file must be present (`manifest.json`), and must conform to Manifest Version 3.
- Required files include:
  - `popup.html` and its dependent CSS/JS
  - `/js/background.js` as background service worker or script
  - Image assets in `img/browsericons/`

### Step 3: Check for Console Errors
- Open the browser’s developer tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
- Look under the `Extensions` or `Service Worker` console for error messages.
- Address errors such as missing files, permission issues, or syntax problems.

### Step 4: Refresh and Restart
- After correcting errors, reload the extension.
- Restart the browser to clear caches and ensure service worker starts properly.

### Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to enable developer mode before loading unpacked extensions.
- Misplaced files causing missing resource errors.
- Unsupported APIs due to browser version.
