# What To Do If the Extension Isn’t Working

If uBO Scope isn’t functioning as expected—whether the extension UI is missing, the popup shows no data, or the badge count isn’t updating—this guide provides step-by-step troubleshooting to get you back on track quickly. Follow these actionable steps to diagnose common issues related to permissions, compatibility, browser state, and more.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation and Visibility

Start with the basics to ensure the extension is installed and visible in your browser.

- **Locate the Toolbar Icon:** Check your browser’s extension or addon toolbar for the uBO Scope icon.
  - If missing, verify the extension is installed in your browser’s extensions page.
  - On some browsers, extensions might be hidden behind an extensions menu—expand this menu to find it.

- **Verify Installation via Extension Management Page:**
  - **Chrome / Chromium:** Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
  - **Firefox:** Go to `about:addons` > Extensions.
  - **Safari:** Open Safari Preferences > Extensions.
  - Confirm uBO Scope is enabled and not disabled or removed.

<Tip>
If the extension is not listed, reinstall it from the official store:
- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

See Installation Steps guide for detailed instructions.
</Tip>

## 2. Check Browser Compatibility and Permissions

Outdated browsers or missing permissions can prevent uBO Scope from working correctly.

- **Browser Version:**
  - Ensure your browser version meets the minimum requirements (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
  - Update your browser to the latest stable release.

- **Manifest and API Support:**
  - The extension requires Manifest V3 and the `webRequest` API.
  - Confirm your browser supports these (most recent versions do).

- **Extension Permissions:**
  - uBO Scope needs permissions: `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
  - On some browsers, you may need to manually approve these permissions on install or in extension settings.

- **Host Permissions:**
  - The extension requires access to all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs.
  - Verify no permission prompts were denied.

<Note>
If permissions are missing, manually adjust them in your browser’s extension settings or reinstall the extension.
</Note>

## 3. Restart Your Browser and Refresh Tabs

Extension glitches can often be resolved by restarting the browser.

- **Close All Tabs and Browser Windows:**
  - Completely exit the browser.
  - Wait a few seconds to clear any lingering background processes.

- **Reopen the Browser:**
  - Open only your necessary tabs to minimize resource usage.

- **Refresh the Page:**
  - Navigate to the page you want to monitor and open the uBO Scope popup.

<Check>
Look for updated badge counts, domain connections, or any previously missing UI elements.
</Check>

---

## 4. Verify the Popup Interface Shows Data

The popup UI should display the domains connected under different request outcomes (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).

- **Open the Popup:** Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
- **Check the Header:** It should show the hostname of the current tab.
- **Observe Outcomes Sections:**
  - `not blocked` (allowed connections)
  - `stealth-blocked`
  - `blocked`
- **Domain Lists:** Each section lists third-party domains with a badge count showing the number of requests.

<Warning>
If the popup displays "NO DATA" or remains empty for active web browsing,
 - Ensure the tab has fully loaded.
 - Confirm the extension is enabled.
 - Try opening a different tab or site.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Check Badge Count Behavior

The badge on the toolbar icon displays the number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections.

- **Badge Should Update Dynamically:** It changes as you browse different pages.
- **If Badge is Missing or Static:**
  - Confirm extension has permission to display badges.
  - Try closing and reopening tabs.
  - Restart the browser.

<Tip>
Note that lower badge counts mean fewer distinct third-party servers connected to, which usually indicates less exposure.
</Tip>

---

## 6. Reset Extension Data (Clear Cached Session)

Corrupted or outdated cached data can cause incorrect displays.

- **Clear Extension Storage:**
  1. Open your browser’s extension management.
  2. Find uBO Scope preferences or storage settings.
  3. Clear local storage or reset settings if available.

- **Alternatively, uninstall and reinstall the extension.**

<Warning>
This will erase any cached connection data but not affect your browser or other extensions.
</Warning>

---

## 7. Investigate Blocking Conflicts or Interference

Other content blockers or proxy/DNS services might influence uBO Scope’s data.

- **Test with Other Content Blockers Disabled:**
  - Temporarily disable other ad blockers or privacy extensions.
  - Reload the page and check if uBO Scope updates.

- **Check DNS or Network Filters:**
  - uBO Scope relies on browser `webRequest` events.
  - Network-level blocking (DNS filtering) outside browser control might hide requests from uBO Scope.

- **Use Known Websites:**
  - Visit commonly used, popular websites to check if expected connections show up.

<Tip>
Content blockers with stealth mode may cause connections to be "stealth-blocked" and reported accordingly.
</Tip>

---

## 8. Debugging Using Browser Developer Tools

For advanced troubleshooting, use the browser's developer console to inspect extension behavior.

- **Open Developer Tools:** Usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Cmd+Option+I on Mac).
- **Check Console for Errors:**
  - Select the “Extensions” or “Background Pages” context.
  - Look for error messages or warnings related to uBO Scope.

- **Check Network Activity:**
  - Confirm that network requests are visible.

- **Reload Extension:**
  - In Chrome/Chromium, use `chrome://extensions` and click Reload for uBO Scope.
  - In Firefox, use `about:debugging` > This Firefox > Reload.

<Warning>
Do not modify extension files unless you are confident in JavaScript development.
</Warning>
