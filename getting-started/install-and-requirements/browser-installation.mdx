## 2. Installation Steps by Browser

Follow the instructions below according to your browser.

### 2.1 Installing on Google Chrome or Chromium-based Browsers

1. Open [Chrome Web Store uBO Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
2. Click **Add to Chrome**.
3. Confirm by clicking **Add extension** in the dialog.
4. Wait for the extension to download and install.
5. After installation, the uBO Scope icon will appear next to your address bar.

### 2.2 Installing on Mozilla Firefox

1. Open [Mozilla Add-ons uBO Scope page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Confirm any permission requests and click **Add**.
4. The extension icon will appear on your toolbar.

### 2.3 Installing on Apple Safari

1. Safari extensions require installation from the App Store or a developer-supplied signed package.
2. Currently, obtain uBO Scope for Safari from the developer’s distribution channel or the Mac App Store if available.
3. Enable the extension in Safari under `Preferences > Extensions > uBO Scope`.

<Note>
Because Safari’s extension ecosystem differs, installing uBO Scope involves extra steps like enabling the extension manually in Safari settings.
</Note>

## 3. Post-Installation: Activating uBO Scope

After installation, ensure uBO Scope is activated and ready:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar (top-right corner).
2. Click on the icon to open the extension popup.
3. You should see the popup UI attempt to display domains connected for the active tab.

<Check>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or no domain information, try refreshing the active webpage and click the extension icon again.
</Check>

---

## 4. What to Expect During Installation

- The extension requests permissions for:
  - `activeTab` to access the current browsing context.
  - `storage` to save session data and settings.
  - `webRequest` to monitor network traffic and determine connection outcomes.

- The toolbar icon badge displays a numeric count of distinct third-party remote servers connected by the current tab.

- The popup UI shows three categories of domains:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains to which browser connections succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were redirected stealthily.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where connection attempts were blocked.

---

## 5. Practical Tips

- For best results, browse several webpages after installation to accumulate network observations.
- The badge count should ideally be low; a higher count indicates more third-party connections.
- Remember that some third-party connections are legitimate, such as CDN requests.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Installation Issues

<Tip>
If uBO Scope does not appear after installation:
- Verify browser version meets minimum requirements.
- Check that the extension is enabled via the browser’s extension/add-on manager.
- Restart your browser and try again.
</Tip>

<Tip>
If you encounter permission or security warnings during installation, review browser policies or corporate restrictions that may block extension installs.
</Tip>
