# System Requirements for uBO Scope

This page outlines the essential software environments and browser support needed to run uBO Scope effectively. Before installing uBO Scope, verify your setup meets these requirements to ensure smooth operation and full feature availability.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with the leading browsers: Chromium-based browsers (like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge), Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari. However, each browser has specific version minimums and API support requirements.

| Browser           | Minimum Version Supported | Notes on API Support                                    |
|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium          | 122.0+                    | Requires Manifest V3 and full support for `webRequest` API with service workers. |
| Firefox           | 128.0+                    | Requires Firefox version 128 or newer with compatible `webRequest` API and Manifest V3 compliance. |
| Safari            | 18.5+                     | Requires Safari 18.5 or newer with `webRequest` API support under Manifest V3 standards. |


<Note>
The extension relies heavily on the `webRequest` API which must be fully implemented by the browser. Browsers prior to the specified versions may have incomplete or missing API support, resulting in unreliable or incomplete data collection.
</Note>

---

## 2. API Dependencies

uBO Scope exclusively depends on browser extension APIs compliant with Manifest Version 3 (MV3). Key permissions and features crucial for operation:

- **`webRequest`**: Monitors and reports network requests, capturing all remote server connections.
- **`storage`**: Saves session data temporarily to manage tab-related details.
- **`activeTab`**: Provides access to data for the currently active tab to present accurate domain activity.

These are mandatory permissions declared in the extension manifest, granted during installation.

<Info>
Because of these API dependencies, uBO Scope captures connection outcomes reliably only if your browser fully supports these APIs with MV3 extensions.
</Info>

## 3. Platform-Specific Details

### Chromium-based Browsers

- Minimum version: **122.0 or later**
- Uses a service worker for background processing as specified in the manifest.
- Full HTTPS and WSS host permissions granted to monitor network connections.

### Firefox

- Minimum version: **128.0 or later**
- Supports `background.scripts` with module type for background scripts.
- Similar host permissions as Chromium.

### Safari

- Minimum version: **18.5 or later**
- Background scripts are defined under `background.scripts` for Safari compatibility.
- Host permissions include HTTP/S but exclude WSS/WS due to platform restrictions.

<Warning>
Safari currently does not request permissions for WebSocket (`ws://` or `wss://`) protocols as these are not listed in the manifest's host permissions, potentially limiting monitoring of WebSocket connections.
</Warning>

## 4. System and Environment Requirements

While uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension not requiring additional system-level software, ensure your environment has:

- **Up-to-date browser** matching or exceeding the minimum versions.
- **Internet connectivity** to download the extension and to allow external domain resolution.
- **WebRequest API availability**: Use browsers that fully implement this API under MV3.

<Check>
Some enterprise setups or custom browser builds may disable the `webRequest` API or restrict extension permissions; verify your browser policy settings if issues arise.
</Check>

---

## 5. Verifying Compatibility Before Installation

Follow these simple checks to confirm readiness:

1. Open your browserâ€™s About page (e.g., `chrome://settings/help` for Chrome).
2. Confirm the browser version is equal to or greater than the supported minimum.
3. Check extension platform compatibility by reviewing other MV3 extensions if installed.
4. Ensure no restrictive browser policies disable extension APIs.

<Tip>
For the best and most reliable experience with uBO Scope, keep your browser updated to the latest stable release.
</Tip>

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **Extension installation fails**: Likely caused by unsupported browser version or disabled extension APIs.
- **No data or incomplete network request monitoring**: Confirm your browser supports the `webRequest` API fully, particularly under MV3.
- **Badge count remains empty after visiting sites**: Verify active tab permissions and browser compatibility.

## 7. Next Steps

Once your system and browser meet these requirements, proceed to the [Browser Installation Guide](https://your.documentation.url/getting-started/install-and-requirements/browser-installation) to install the extension and begin using uBO Scope.

## Appendix: Manifest Minimum Versions Extracted

For quick reference, here are the relevant manifest version constraints from each platform:

```json
// Chromium manifest excerpt
{
  "minimum_chrome_version": "122.0",
  "manifest_version": 3
}
```

```json
// Firefox browser_specific_settings excerpt
{
  "browser_specific_settings": {
    "gecko": {
      "strict_min_version": "128.0"
    },
    "manifest_version": 3
  }
}
```

```json
// Safari browser_specific_settings excerpt
{
  "browser_specific_settings": {
    "safari": {
      "strict_min_version": "18.5"
    },
    "manifest_version": 3
  }
}
```

Ensure your browser matches or exceeds these version thresholds.
