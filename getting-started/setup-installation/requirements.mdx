# System Requirements

Ensure your device and browser environment are fully compatible with uBO Scope to enjoy a smooth and reliable experience. This section details supported browsers, operating systems, permissions, and API compatibility necessary for effective operation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Installation Sources

uBO Scope is designed as a lightweight browser extension compatible with major browsers. Install only from official sources for security and updates:

| Browser   | Install from                                          |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium  | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox   | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)|


> Note: Support varies by browser version. Always use the minimum supported browser versions listed below.


## 2. Operating Systems and Browser Versions

uBO Scope supports the following platforms with specific browser version minimums:

| Platform        | Minimum Browser Version |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Windows, macOS, Linux (Chromium-based browsers) | Chromium 122.0 and above             |
| Windows, macOS, Linux (Firefox)                  | Firefox 128.0 and above               |
| macOS (Safari)                                  | Safari 18.5 and above                |


Ensure your browser is up to date to meet these minimum versions, guaranteeing full feature availability and security.

## 3. Required Permissions and API Compatibility

For accurate monitoring of network requests, uBO Scope requires specific permissions and relies on browser APIs:

- **Permissions**:
  - `activeTab`: To access current tab information.
  - `storage`: To store session and configuration data.
  - `webRequest`: To monitor network requests made by webpages.
- **Host Permissions**:
  - Access to URLs matching `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, and `wss://*/*` to track HTTP and WebSocket communications.
- **API Dependence**:
  - The extension leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to report on connections—including those blocked by other content blockers or DNS filters—as long as those requests are processed through this API.

<Tip>
If a browser or its version lacks full `webRequest` API support, uBO Scope won't be able to report all network requests accurately.
</Tip>

## 4. Network Environment and Connectivity

uBO Scope does not require special network configuration but considers:

- **Network Access:** The extension must be allowed to access webRequest data on network traffic.
- **Firewall and Proxy:** No additional firewall or proxy configuration is required unless restrictive policies block browser extensions or webRequest API.


## 5. Common Pitfalls and Compatibility Notes

- **Browser Restrictions:** 
  - Some browsers or platforms may limit extension capabilities, especially concerning the `webRequest` listeners.
  - Browsers must report network requests through their `webRequest` API for uBO Scope to detect them.
- **Content Blocker Conflicts:**
  - Despite other content blockers running, uBO Scope can report network requests unless the requests are completely invisible to the `webRequest` API.
  - The badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected, not the number of blocked requests.

## 6. Verification Steps

Before proceeding to installation, verify your environment with these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Version">
- In your browser, open the About page (e.g., `chrome://settings/help` for Chrome).
- Confirm the version number meets or exceeds the minimum as stated above.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Extension Permissions">
- Upon adding the extension, verify the requested permissions match those listed in this guide.
</Step>
<Step title="Test API Availability (Advanced)">
- Tools like browser developer consoles can be used to confirm `webRequest` API availability.
- Refer to browser-specific docs if unsure.
</Step>
</Steps>


# Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="System Requirements Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
Update your browser to the latest version to meet uBO Scope’s requirements. Older versions may lack necessary APIs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension Permissions Not Granted">
Check if the extension requests permissions during installation; if denied, reinstall and accept permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="webRequest API Not Supported or Disabled">
Some browser configurations or privacy modes disable `webRequest` API. Confirm this isn't the case by testing with a different browser or profile.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Blockages or Firewalls"
>
Ensure no corporate policies or firewall settings block browser extensions or interfere with their APIs.
