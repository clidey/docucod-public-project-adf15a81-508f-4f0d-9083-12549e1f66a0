## 6. What to Expect After Installation

Upon successful installation, uBO Scope runs quietly in the background, monitoring your active tabs. It does not block or alter your browsing but displays all remote server connections initiated by webpages.

The extension toolbar icon badge shows the count of distinct third-party remote domains connected by the current tab, updating in real time.

Clicking the icon brings up a detailed popup showing:
- Which domains were allowed
- Which domains were blocked
- Which domains were "stealth-blocked" by other mechanisms

This transparency empowers you to understand and audit the network activity of each webpage you visit.
