# Configuration & Initial Setup

This guide walks you through accessing and configuring uBO Scope immediately after installation. You'll learn how to review permissions, understand the initial setup steps, and perform first-run actions to ensure uBO Scope functions optimally from the start.

---

## 1. Accessing uBO Scope After Installation

Once installed, uBO Scope integrates seamlessly into your browser toolbar as an extension icon.

### Steps to Open uBO Scope Interface:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope Icon**
   - Look for the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar. It typically appears as the extension’s logo (a shield-like symbol).

2. **Click the Icon**
   - Click the icon to open the popup interface showing real-time connection summaries for the active tab.

3. **Confirm uBO Scope is Active**
   - The popup will display the list of third-party domains connected by the webpage you are visiting.
   - If you see "NO DATA" or an empty state, proceed to check permissions and installation completeness.


<Tip>
Always open uBO Scope on a webpage that is actively loading network resources (for example, your favorite news site) to see meaningful data.
</Tip>

## 2. Review Extension Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network requests effectively. Confirm these permissions immediately after installation for best performance.

### Required Permissions:

- **webRequest permission**: Allows interception and observation of network requests.
- **Host permissions**: Access to all HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
- **Storage permission**: To save session data for ongoing monitoring.
- **activeTab permission**: To interact with the currently active browser tab.

### How to Check Permissions:

1. Open your browser’s extension management page:
   - Chrome: `chrome://extensions`
   - Firefox: `about:addons`
   - Safari: Preferences > Extensions

2. Find uBO Scope in the list and select it.

3. View the list of permissions granted.

4. If any of the required permissions are missing, consider reinstalling or manually enabling them, depending on your browser.

<Warning>
Without granted permissions to access network requests and hosts, uBO Scope cannot observe third-party connections and will not provide accurate or any results.
</Warning>

## 3. Ensure Setup Completeness

After installation and confirming permissions, verify that uBO Scope’s internal data and support files are initialized correctly.

### Automatic Initialization:

- Upon first run, uBO Scope loads the Public Suffix List and prepares session data storage.
- This process happens silently but is critical to correctly map hostnames to domains.

### What to Expect:

- Your first tab with network activity triggers uBO Scope to start collecting and classifying all network connections.
- The toolbar icon badge will update to reflect the number of distinct third-party domains detected.

### Verification Steps:

1. Navigate to a website with mixed content (loads third-party resources).
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to view the popup panel.
3. Check the sections labeled **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
4. Confirm that these lists populate with domain rows and corresponding counts.

<Check>
The *domains connected* summary count should reflect the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.
</Check>

## 4. First-Run Actions for Best Results

To get full value from uBO Scope, follow these recommended actions immediately after installation:

### Steps:

1. **Load a Test Website**
   - Visit a website known to load third-party content (e.g., news sites, blogs, or social media).

2. **Open uBO Scope Popup**
   - Click the extension icon to open the report panel.
   - Observe the summary count and categorized domains.

3. **Review Domain Classifications**
   - **Not blocked**: Domains the browser connected to successfully.
   - **Stealth-blocked**: Domains where requests were redirected or suppressed invisibly.
   - **Blocked**: Domains where connection attempts failed or were explicitly blocked.

4. **Monitor the Toolbar Badge**
   - This number reflects the count of distinct third-party domains allowed for the active tab.

5. **Refresh the Tab**
   - Reload the webpage and watch the badge update in real time.

### Tips:

- Refreshing the tab helps verify that uBO Scope actively monitors new network activities.
- Using sites with advertising and tracking often shows a clear divide among domains, illustrating the extension's value.
- If you use content blockers (like uBlock Origin), observing these numbers helps validate their effectiveness.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

If uBO Scope does not show data or behaves unexpectedly after installation, consider the following:

### Issue 1: Toolbar icon does not show a badge or data remains "NO DATA"
- Confirm that permissions for webRequest and host access are granted.
- Reload the browser after installation.

### Issue 2: Popup panel remains empty on sites known to have third-party resources
- Try refreshing the tab.
- Disable other extensions temporarily to check conflicts.

### Issue 3: Badge number does not update
- Ensure you have reloaded a page that triggers network activity.
- Verify that the background service worker of uBO Scope is running.

<Tip>
If issues persist, consult the [Installation Troubleshooting guide](../first-run-validation/troubleshooting-setup) for detailed remedies.
</Tip>

## 6. Understanding the Configuration Interface

uBO Scope’s configuration is minimal and handles itself with no manual user setup required beyond installation and granting permissions.

### What You See in the Popup:
- The popup interface shows a categorized list of domains from the current tab.
- Sections:
  - **Not blocked**: Successfully connected third-party domains.
  - **Stealth-blocked**: Connections intercepted but invisibly redirected or suppressed.
  - **Blocked**: Failed or explicitly blocked connections.
- A summary count provides a quick overview of the distinct allowed domains.

### Why This Matters:
- These categories help you immediately gauge your browsing exposure to third-party servers.
- The badge count on the toolbar is a quick metric representing third-party distinct servers contacted.

After completing this setup and initial validation, you are ready to:

- Explore the **First Successful Use** guide to understand realistic usage scenarios.
- Consult **Interpreting Connection Insights** to make informed decisions based on reported data.
- Use the extension side-by-side with your preferred content blockers for enhanced privacy awareness.
