## 2. Installation Instructions

### 2.1 Installing from Official Web Stores

The simplest and most secure approach is to install uBO Scope directly from the browser’s official extension stores.

| Browser | Installation Link |
|---------|------------------|
| Chrome / Chromium | [Chrome Web Store: uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox | [Firefox Add-ons: uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |

#### Steps:

1. Open your browser and visit the appropriate store link for your browser.
2. Click 'Add to Chrome' or 'Add to Firefox'.
3. Confirm all requested permissions.
4. Once installed, the uBO Scope icon appears in your browser toolbar.

<Tip>
Installing from official stores guarantees you’re getting a safe and unaltered version that automatically updates.
</Tip>

### 2.2 Manual Installation via Source Build

If you prefer to build or install manually (e.g., for development or custom versions), follow these steps.

#### Prerequisites:

- Linux environment or compatible shell
- Git installed
- jq installed for JSON manipulation

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
cd uBO-Scope
```

#### Step 2: Build the Extension Package

For Firefox (example):

```bash
./tools/make-firefox.sh 1.0.1
```

_For Chromium or Safari, replace `make-firefox.sh` with your target platform’s build script._

This will create a packaged extension in the `build/uBO-Scope.firefox` directory and zip it as `.xpi` for Firefox.

#### Step 3: Load the Extension in Your Browser

- **Firefox:**
  - Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
  - Click 'Load Temporary Add-on…' and select the generated `.xpi` file.

- **Chrome:**
  - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
  - Enable 'Developer mode'.
  - Click 'Load unpacked' and select the `build/uBO-Scope.chromium` folder.

- **Safari:**
  - Use Safari’s Extension Builder to load the unpacked project from the appropriate folder.

<Warning>
Temporary loading means the extension will be disabled after the browser restarts. For permanent installation, package and sideload as per browser guidelines.
</Warning>

## 3. Verification Steps

### Confirm Installation

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar (usually a shield or uBO Scope logo).
2. Click the icon. The popup window should display with "domains connected" and sections for "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" domains.
3. Browse a few websites. The badge number on the toolbar icon should increment if third-party remote connections are detected.

### Verify Permissions

- Navigate to your browser’s extension management page.
- Check that uBO Scope has the following permissions enabled:
  - Active Tab
  - Storage access
  - WebRequest API

<Tip>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or does not update, try refreshing active tabs or restarting your browser.
</Tip>
