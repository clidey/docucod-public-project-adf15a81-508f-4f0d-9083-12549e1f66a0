# First Launch & Basic Configuration

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide will walk you through activating the extension after installation, granting any necessary permissions, understanding the extension icon and badge, and confirming that uBO Scope is ready to monitor your network connections effectively.

---

## 1. Post-Installation Activation & Permissions

After installing uBO Scope in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari), you need to complete a few simple steps to activate and configure it for first use.

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Icon

- Check your browser's toolbar for the uBO Scope icon (a stylized uBO logo).
- The icon is installed automatically by the browser but may be hidden behind an extensions menu or overflow area.

### Step 2: Confirm Extension Permissions

- **Important:** uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor web requests and active tabs.
- When you first click the icon, the browser may prompt you to allow permissions such as:
  - Access to current tabs
  - WebRequest API access
  - Storage for settings
- Grant these permissions fully to enable accurate monitoring.

### Step 3: Confirm Activation

- Clicking the icon should open the uBO Scope popup UI.
- If the popup does not appear or shows 'NO DATA', ensure the extension is enabled and has the required permissions in your browser’s extensions settings.

<Tip>
If the icon is not visible, check your browser’s extensions management page and pin or enable the extension.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Extension Icon and Badge

### What the Badge Indicates

- The badge on the icon displays a **number representing the count of distinct third-party remote servers** your browser connected to on the current active tab.
- A **lower number** indicates fewer third-party connections, which typically corresponds to less tracking or fewer external resources.

### Badge Color and Behavior

- The badge updates live as you navigate webpages, reflecting the number of distinct connections.
- If no third-party connections have been detected yet, the badge will be blank.

### Interpreting the Information

- The badge is your quick overview. Clicking the icon brings up detailed connection data, categorized as:
  - **Not blocked** (allowed connections)
  - **Stealth-blocked** (redirected or stealth blocked connections)
  - **Blocked** (connections prevented by content blockers or errors)

## 3. Ensuring uBO Scope is Ready to Monitor

uBO Scope integrates deeply with your browser’s native webRequest API to report every network connection attempt, regardless of other content blockers. To confirm it is working:

### Step 1: Open a New Tab and Visit a Website

- Navigate to a website with a typical mix of first- and third-party requests.

### Step 2: Click the uBO Scope Icon

- Observe the popup UI loading information:
  - The hostname and domain of the current tab displayed at the top.
  - A summary showing the total number of distinct domains connected.
  - Lists of domains categorized by connection outcome.

### Step 3: Verify the Badge Count Updates

- The number on the extension icon badge should correspond to the count shown in the popup’s summary.

### Step 4: Use the Extension on Multiple Tabs

- Switch tabs and activate the extension icon to see each tab’s unique connection details and badge.

### What to Do If Data Is Not Appearing

- Ensure the extension has not been disabled or restricted by browser settings.
- Refresh the webpage and click the icon again.
- Check that your browser version meets uBO Scope’s minimum requirements (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

<Warning>
Without the necessary permissions or with unsupported browser versions, uBO Scope will not report connections accurately.
</Warning>

- Data is stored temporarily per session to provide real-time updates.
- No manual configuration of filters or domains is needed.

<Note>
For users interested in advanced usage, such as analyzing connection details or custom workflows, refer to the guides on the popup UI and interpreting badge counts.
