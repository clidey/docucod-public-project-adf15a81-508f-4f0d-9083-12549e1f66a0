## 2. Installing from Official Extension Stores

### 2.1 Chromium-based Browsers (Chrome Web Store)

1. Open your Chromium-based browser.
2. Navigate to the [uBO Scope on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
3. Click **Add to Chrome** (or your browser's equivalent button).
4. Confirm by clicking **Add Extension** in the prompt.
5. Wait for the installation to complete. You should see the uBO Scope icon appear in your toolbar.

### 2.2 Mozilla Firefox

1. Open Firefox.
2. Visit the [uBO Scope add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
3. Click **Add to Firefox**.
4. Approve any permission requests.
5. Wait for the extension to install; the uBO Scope icon will appear on your toolbar.

### 2.3 Safari (Manual Installation Required)

Safari requires manual installation as the extension is not distributed through the App Store.

1. Download or clone the uBO Scope repository from GitHub:  
   `git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git`
2. Use the provided packaging script for Safari:

   ```bash
   ./tools/make-package.sh safari
   ```

3. Locate the created extension package under `build/uBO-Scope.safari`.
4. Open Safari, go to **Safari > Settings > Extensions**, and enable Developer Mode.
5. Load the unpacked extension from the Safari build folder.

<Tip>
Manual installation on Safari requires you to enable Developer Mode for extensions and load the unpacked extension folder.
</Tip>

## 3. Verifying Installation

Confirm uBO Scope is correctly installed and running with the following steps:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon (a blue shield with "Scope") in your browser toolbar.
2. Click the icon to open the extension popup panel.
3. The popup should display the current tab’s hostname and connection summary.
4. Test functionality by visiting a website; you should see counts of connected third-party domains update.

<Check>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or no detailed connection info, the extension might not be active or lack permissions—refer to troubleshooting documentation.
</Check>

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

- **Permissions**: Ensure you allow permissions requested during installation, especially `webRequest` and `activeTab`, to enable full network connection monitoring.
- **Browser Updates**: Keep your browser updated to avoid compatibility issues.
- **Extension Conflicts**: While uBO Scope works independently, some content blockers or privacy tools might interfere with network event reporting.
