# Supported Browsers & Requirements

uBO Scope is designed to provide transparent, real-time visibility of remote server connections initiated by your browser. To ensure a seamless experience, it is essential to understand which browsers support uBO Scope and the specific requirements and limitations that apply.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope supports the following major browsers, leveraging their native webRequest API capabilities:

- **Chromium browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave) 
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Safari** (from version 18.5 and above)

The extension adapts to each browser’s specific extension manifest format and background script behavior while maintaining consistent functionality.

### Browser-Specific Notes

| Browser     | Minimum Version | Installation Source                          | Notes                                |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Chromium    | 122.0+          | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) | Requires Manifest V3 support         |
| Firefox     | 128.0+          | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)                              | Supports Android Firefox as well     |
| Safari      | 18.5+           | Apple App Store                                | Background type uses "modules"      |

Each platform includes tailored permissions and background script configurations aligned with the browser’s extension APIs.

## 2. System & Network Requirements

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure your system meets the following prerequisites:

### System Requirements
- **Operating Systems:** Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS (Safari), Android (Firefox)
- **Memory & Disk:** Standard system requirements for browser extensions, with minimal overhead
- **Browser Version:** As specified above for each browser

### Network & Permissions
uBO Scope needs permission to monitor network traffic originating from your browser:

- **Permissions Required:**
  - `activeTab` – To track your current tab's requests
  - `storage` – To save session data and public suffix lists
  - `webRequest` – To monitor network request statuses
- **Host Permissions:**
  - Access to all HTTP and HTTPS URLs (e.g., `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`), and WebSocket URLs where applicable

### Important Network Notes
- uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API to report network activity. Therefore, any network requests not exposed by this API (such as certain DNS-level blocks or native apps outside the browser) will not be visible.
- Compatibility and accuracy depend on the browser implementing `webRequest` event reporting.

---

## 3. Limitations & Known Constraints

Understanding these limitations helps set expectations for uBO Scope’s behavior:

- **Service Worker Eviction:** On Chromium, the background script operates as a service worker which the browser may terminate when idle, but uBO Scope retries messaging internally to avoid data loss.
- **Partial Visibility:** Some network requests made outside the scope of browser APIs (e.g., DNS-based blocking, OS-level filtering) are not captured.
- **Browser-Specific Event Coverage:** WebSocket request reporting is supported in Chromium and Firefox but is limited or unavailable in Safari.
- **Public Suffix List Usage:** The extension uses an embedded public suffix list to accurately discern domains, which is loaded and cached automatically.

---

## 4. Preparing Your Browser for Installation

To avoid common issues when installing uBO Scope, perform these preparatory steps:

- **Update your browser** to the latest stable version meeting the minimum version requirements.
- **Verify extension permissions:** Be ready to grant access to all sites for monitoring network requests.
- **Disable conflicting extensions:** Other extensions that heavily manipulate or block webRequest events might interfere with uBO Scope.

## 5. Summary of Permissions in Manifest Files

uBO Scope’s manifest files specify permissions and settings tailored to each browser platform. Here’s an overview of the critical fields:

| Feature           | Chromium Manifest                                | Firefox Manifest                             | Safari Manifest                              |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Background Script | `service_worker: "/js/background.js"` (module) | `scripts: ["/js/background.js"]` (module)  | `scripts: ["/js/background.js"]` (module)  |
| Host Permissions  | `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, `ws://*/*` | `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, `ws://*/*` | `https://*/*`, `http://*/*` (no websocket) |
| Permissions       | `["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"]`   | `["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"]` | `["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"]` |
| Minimum Version   | 122.0 (Chrome)                                  | 128.0 (Firefox)                              | 18.5 (Safari)                                |

This ensures uBO Scope operates with consistency and appropriate privileges in each environment.

## 6. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Unsupported browser versions:** Attempting to install on browser versions older than the minimum will cause failure or unstable behavior.
- **Missing permissions:** Denying requested permissions at install time will prevent uBO Scope from monitoring network traffic.
- **Conflicts with other extensions:** Some content blockers or privacy tools may hide network requests from `webRequest`, limiting uBO Scope’s visibility.
- **Limited WebSocket support on Safari:** Users requiring WebSocket monitoring should prefer Chromium or Firefox.
