# Supported Browsers & Requirements

This page outlines the supported browsers for uBO Scope—Chromium, Firefox, and Safari—and details their relevant system requirements. It also explains critical browser API dependencies, particularly the `webRequest` API, which enables uBO Scope to observe network traffic. Understanding these aspects will help ensure compatibility before installation and clarify usage limitations.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a lightweight companion extension that functions across the three major browser platforms where the `webRequest` API is available and sufficiently supported:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Brave, Edge)
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Apple Safari**

Each supported browser has specific minimum version requirements and permissions required for uBO Scope to work effectively.

<AccordionGroup title="Browser Compatibility & Version Requirements">
<Accordion title="Chromium">
- **Minimum version:** 122.0 (or later)
- **Required permissions:** `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`
- **Host permissions:** Supports HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS protocols on all hosts (`https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`)
- **Manifest:** Uses Manifest Version 3 with background service worker.

### Notes
- uBO Scope listens to network activity for all tabs and windows using the browser's `webRequest` API.
- Minimum Chromium version ensures the extension operates with Manifest V3 background service workers and appropriate permission models.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mozilla Firefox">
- **Minimum version:** 128.0 (or later)
- **Required permissions:** `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`
- **Host permissions:** Supports HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS protocols on all hosts.
- **Manifest:** Manifest Version 3 with background scripts for handling network events.

### Notes
- Firefox's strict minimum version guarantees compatibility with the `webRequest` API and Manifest V3 rules.
- The extension supports both desktop and Firefox Android variants supporting Manifest V3.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Apple Safari">
- **Minimum version:** 18.5 (or later)
- **Required permissions:** `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`
- **Host permissions:** Supports HTTP and HTTPS protocols only.
- **Manifest:** Manifest Version 3, background scripts.

### Notes
- Safari currently does not support WS and WSS protocols for host permissions, limiting some WebSocket network connection tracking.
- The extension relies on Safari's implementation of `webRequest` APIs, available from Safari 18.5 forward.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 2. System and Environment Requirements

Before installing uBO Scope, verify that your system meets these key criteria:

- A compatible browser version as outlined above.
- Sufficient permissions granted to the extension at install or runtime, particularly access to `webRequest` and relevant host permissions.
- Internet access for fetching the Public Suffix List dynamically (used internally to process domains).

---

## 3. Understanding Browser API Dependencies

uBO Scope’s main capability relies on the browser's **`webRequest` API**, which allows it to monitor network traffic initiated by webpages. This API informs uBO Scope about:

- **Requests in progress**
- **Redirects**
- **Request failures**
- **Successful responses**

### Why This Matters

Without access to `webRequest`, uBO Scope cannot observe network connections or report details on third-party servers. This API ensures that uBO Scope achieves its core function: revealing remote server connections regardless of content blockers or DNS-level filtering.

### Coverage and Limitations

- uBO Scope **reports connections only visible to the browser's `webRequest` API**.
- Requests made outside this API's reach (e.g., some native DNS-level resolutions, system processes) are not visible.
- WebSocket protocols (`ws://` and `wss://`) are supported on Chromium and Firefox but **not on Safari** due to platform restrictions.

<Tip>
If you notice missing or incomplete connection reports, check that your browser version supports `webRequest` fully and that uBO Scope has all the required permissions.
</Tip>

## 4. Verification Before Installation

To ensure smooth installation and operation, follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check your browser version">
- Open your browser’s "About" menu.
- Verify that your version is equal to or later than the minimum stated above for your browser.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm permission requirements">
- Ensure you are able to grant permissions for `webRequest` and storage upon installation.
- Be prepared for uBO Scope to request host permissions for all URLs (`*://*/*`).
</Step>
<Step title="Verify API availability (advanced)">
- For developers or power users, verify that the browser exposes the `webRequest` API via developer tools or extension debugging.
- Note: This is optional and typically not needed for most users.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Attempting to install uBO Scope on unsupported browsers or versions will result in limited functionality or no operation, with no network events reported.
</Note>

## 5. Summary of Browser-Specific Details

| Browser  | Minimum Version | `webRequest` API Support | Host Permissions | Notes on Protocols |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Chromium | 122.0+          | Full                     | HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS | Full support for all protocols|
| Firefox  | 128.0+          | Full                     | HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS | Supports all protocols and mobile
| Safari   | 18.5+           | Partial                  | HTTP, HTTPS only  | No WS/WSS support; restricted capabilities|

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope does not report any connections">
- Verify you are running a supported browser/version.
- Confirm the extension has required permissions.
- Restart the browser after installation.
- Check that no other extensions are blocking `webRequest` API calls to uBO Scope.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="WebSocket connections not showing up">
- Check if you are using Safari, which does not support WS/WSS capture.
- On Chromium or Firefox, ensure permissions include WS and WSS URLs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension fails to install or enable permissions">
- Confirm minimum browser version.
- If using enterprise or managed browsers, check policy settings that may block extension permissions.
- Try reinstalling the extension.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Additional Considerations

- **Privacy and Security:** uBO Scope only monitors network traffic visible to the browser, respecting the browser’s security model.
- **Performance:** The extension is lightweight and designed not to degrade browsing performance.
- **Updates:** Browsers may update API policies; ensure your browser and uBO Scope are kept current.

## 8. Next Steps

Once you have verified your browser compatibility and system readiness:

- Proceed to the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/setup-installation/installation) to install uBO Scope.
- After installation, continue to [First Launch & Basic Configuration](/getting-started/setup-installation/first-launch-configuration) for initial setup.
- Explore the [Quick Start & Validation](/getting-started/getting-aware/quick-validation) guide to confirm the extension is working as expected.

<Tip>
Ensuring compatibility upfront significantly reduces setup issues and sets you up for a smooth experience using uBO Scope's powerful network monitoring capabilities.
