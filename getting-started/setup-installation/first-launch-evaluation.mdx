# First Launch and Basic Configuration

Welcome to your first experience with **uBO Scope**! This guide walks you through launching the extension's popup interface, understanding what the display shows, and making sense of the initial results concerning network connections. No advanced setup is required — just straightforward instructions to unlock immediate value.

---

## 1. Launching the uBO Scope Popup

Upon installing uBO Scope, it integrates with your browser toolbar. The extension icon shows a numerical badge representing the number of distinct third-party domains your active tab connects to.

### Steps to Open the Popup

1. **Navigate to an active browser tab** where you want to analyze network connections.
2. **Click the uBO Scope icon** in your browser's toolbar (it displays the current badge count).
3. The popup window will appear, showing a domain and connection overview related to the active tab.

<Check>
Make sure the browser has uBO Scope installed and enabled. If the popup doesn’t open, check your browser's extension management page to verify the extension's status.
</Check>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Display

The popup is designed to give you immediate insight into all remote connections initiated by the active tab. Information is organized into three categories:

- **Not Blocked**: Domains where connections succeeded and were allowed.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were blocked in a stealthy manner, invisible to the webpage.
- **Blocked**: Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.

### Popup Layout and Elements

- **Tab Hostname Header**: Displays the current active tab's hostname and top-level domain.
- **Summary Section**: Shows the total number of distinct connected domains.
- **Outcome Sections**: Separate sections for each connection outcome with domain-wise breakdowns and counts.

### Interpreting Counts and Domains

- The **badge count** on the extension icon corresponds to the count of distinct allowed domains.
- The domain listing includes counts showing how many requests were made to that domain.
- Domains appearing under 'stealth-blocked' indicate requests blocked by mechanisms invisible to the page, usually by content blockers or stealth techniques.

<Info>
The extension uses the Public Suffix List to accurately identify base domains from hostnames, enabling correct grouping.

## 3. Making Sense of Initial Results

On your first launch, the popup may show some domains connected by the active tab. Here's how to interpret the typical results:

- If the summary count is **zero**, it generally means either no third-party connections occurred or the extension has not collected data yet.
- Domains under **not blocked** are resources or servers your browser successfully connected to while loading the page.
- Domains under **blocked** or **stealth-blocked** could correspond to networks filtered by browser content blockers or other privacy tools.

### Practical Example

Suppose you open a news website:

- The not blocked list might include CDN domains such as `cdn.example.com` or analytics domains configured to allow connections.
- The stealth-blocked list might include tracking or ad-related domains blocked silently.
- The blocked list might show domains explicitly denied by your content blocker.

This transparent overview helps you understand your browsing exposure and the effectiveness of your content blockers.

## 4. Tips for Effective First Use

- **Refresh the tab** after installing uBO Scope to populate network connection data.
- Use the popup frequently to monitor changes in third-party connections as you browse.
- Consider viewing your content blocker settings if unexpected domains appear as allowed.

<Warning>
If the popup always shows `NO DATA` or remains blank despite network activity, verify your browser permissions and ensure no conflicting extensions override uBO Scope’s access to network requests.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Popup shows "NO DATA"
- Reload the active tab to trigger new network requests.
- Confirm uBO Scope permissions are granted and the extension is enabled.
- Check if other content blockers or privacy features prevent uBO Scope from observing the network requests.

### Badge count is not updating
- The badge syncs with the allowed domains count; if you see a discrepancy, reload the tab.
- Browser may suspend background workers; try restarting the browser.

### No domains listed under blocked or stealth categories
- This can happen if no requests were blocked or stealth-blocked during the tab’s active session.
- Test by visiting a website known for ads or trackers, then reopen the popup.
