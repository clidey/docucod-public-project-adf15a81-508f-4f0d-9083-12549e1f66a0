# First Run & Basic Configuration

Welcome to your first interaction with **uBO Scope**. This guide walks you through launching the extension, granting the necessary permissions, and understanding the initial popup interface and toolbar badge. By following these steps, you will gain immediate insight into the remote server connections made by the webpages you visit.

---

## 1. Accessing the Extension

After you have installed uBO Scope (refer to [Installation Guide](/getting-started/setup-installation/installation) for your browser), you are ready to open and explore it.

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon** on your browser toolbar. It uses the uBO Scope logo, which appears after installation.
2. **Click the icon** to open the extension popup interface.

> <Check>
> If the icon does not appear:
> - Check your extension list and ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
> - On some browsers, you may need to pin the extension to the toolbar for easy access.
> </Check>

---

## 2. Granting Required Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network connections:

- **Active Tab Access:** To fetch details about the current tab.
- **Storage:** To save session data across usage.
- **WebRequest:** To listen to all network requests for HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS protocols.

These permissions are requested at installation. To verify:

- Open your browser's extensions page.
- Find uBO Scope and **review the permissions granted**.

> <Warning>
> If permissions are revoked, uBO Scope will not be able to report connections accurately.
> You might need to reinstall or re-enable permissions.
> </Warning>

## 3. Understanding the Popup Interface

When you open the popup, you see an organized summary of network connections for the active tab.

### Key Interface Elements:

- **Hostname Display:** The top section shows the current webpage's hostname and domain.
- **Summary of Domains Connected:** Displays the total count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Outcome Sections:** Three categorized sections list domains by their connection status:
  - **Not blocked:** Domains that successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains with redirected or stealth-blocked requests.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed or were blocked.

### Example:

```
example.com
---
domains connected: 5

not blocked:
- cdn.example.net (4)
- api.example.org (2)

stealth-blocked:
- ads.hiddenexample.com (1)

blocked:
- tracker.badexample.io (3)
```

> <Tip>
> The domain counts next to each domain indicate the number of requests attempted or blocked.
> </Tip>

---

## 4. Toolbar Badge Behavior

uBO Scope's icon badge dynamically updates to reflect network activity:

- Displays **the number of distinct third-party domains connected successfully** for the active tab.
- The badge is **empty if no third-party domains are detected or all requests are blocked**.

> <Info>
> A lower badge count generally indicates fewer external connections, which may suggest a more privacy-focused browsing experience.
> </Info>

### Visual Expectations on First Run:

- Before any webpage is loaded or if no network requests are made, the badge will be empty.
- As you browse, the badge updates in near-real time reflecting the current tab’s network.

## 5. Tips for First-Time Users

- **Visit different websites** to see how the domain counts and categories change dynamically.
- **Open the popup often** to explore details of connected and blocked domains.
- **Use alongside content blockers** to validate their effectiveness in blocking third-party connections.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Problem: The Popup shows 'NO DATA'
- **Cause:** uBO Scope has not detected any network connections for the active tab yet.
- **Solution:**
  - Refresh the page.
  - Ensure the page makes network requests.
  - Confirm uBO Scope permissions are intact.

### Problem: Badge remains empty despite browsing activity
- **Cause:** Possibly because the page does not contact any third-party domains or the permissions are restricted.
- **Solution:**
  - Try visiting complex sites that load external resources.
  - Check and re-enable extension permissions.

### Problem: Extension icon missing from toolbar
- **Solution:**
  - Check extension management page in your browser.
  - Pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.
  - Restart your browser if necessary.

## Appendix: Visual Layout of the Popup

The popup interface contains three major domain outcome sections, each showing domain names and counts. The top displays the tab hostname and domain.

```plaintext
+---------------------------------------+
| [tabHostname] hostname.domain.tld     |
| domains connected: [count]            |
+---------------------------------------+
| not blocked                          v |
|   domain1.com            12          |
|   domain2.net             3          |
+---------------------------------------+
| stealth-blocked                     v |
|   stealthdomain.xyz        1          |
+---------------------------------------+
| blocked                            v |
|   blockedtracker.bad        4          |
+---------------------------------------+
```

This intuitive design helps you grasp real-time connection statuses without overwhelm.
