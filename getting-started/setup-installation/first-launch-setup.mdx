# First Launch & Permissions

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through the initial steps after installing the extension, focusing on handling permissions prompts and verifying that the extension is active and ready to monitor your network connections.

---

## 1. Understanding Permissions on First Launch

When you install uBO Scope in your browser, it requires specific permissions to function correctly. These permissions allow the extension to monitor network requests and store data necessary for its operation.

### Key Permissions Requested

- **`webRequest`**: Enables uBO Scope to observe all web requests made by your browser, including successful, blocked, and redirected connections. This is essential to provide accurate reporting of remote server connections.

- **`storage`**: Allows the extension to save session data and configuration locally.

- **`activeTab`**: Grants temporary access to details about the active browser tab needed to monitor its network connections.

- **Host Permissions**: Access to URLs such as `https://*/*` and `http://*/*` (plus `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*` in some browsers) lets the extension observe requests across all sites you visit.

<Tip>
These permissions ensure uBO Scope can transparently report all third-party and first-party connections encountered while browsing, giving you a full picture of your network activity.
</Tip>

### Browser-Specific Permission Prompt Behavior

- **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave etc.)**: On installation, you may see a prompt to allow these permissions upfront.

- **Firefox**: Firefox may request permissions on first use or installation, sometimes via an XPI install dialog.

- **Safari**: Safari requests approval for permissions that may affect privacy and needs macOS 13 (Ventura) or later with Safari 18.5+.

<Warning>
If you deny the required permissions, uBO Scope cannot monitor your network traffic, rendering the extension unable to provide meaningful data.
</Warning>


## 2. Granting Permissions: Step-by-Step

Follow these steps to ensure uBO Scope has all permissions it needs:

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the Extension">
Download and install uBO Scope from your browser’s official extension store:

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- Safari Extension Gallery or equivalent for Safari 18.5+

Proceed with the standard installation flow.
</Step>

<Step title="Respond to Initial Permission Prompts">
Immediately after installation, your browser will prompt you to grant permission for uBO Scope to access browsing activity and storage.

- Review the permissions carefully.
- Click ‘Allow’ or ‘Grant’ to proceed.

If you miss this prompt or want to check permissions later, see the browser-specific sections below.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Extension Activation via Toolbar Icon">
After permissions are granted, look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar:

- The icon uses the uBO Scope logo.
- Initially, it may show a badge with a count of "0" or blank if no connections are recorded yet.

Clicking the icon opens the popup UI where connection data will appear once browsing activity is detected.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Verifying Permissions and Extension Status

You can confirm uBO Scope is correctly installed and permitted to work through these browser-specific instructions:

### Chrome & Chromium-based Browsers

1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Find uBO Scope in the list.
3. Click ‘Details’.
4. Scroll down to verify permissions:
   - ‘Read and change all your data on websites you visit’ (host permissions)
   - ‘Access browser tabs’ (activeTab)
   - ‘Read and write to browser storage’ (storage)
   - ‘Access your browsing activity’ (webRequest)

5. Ensure uBO Scope is enabled.

### Firefox

1. Go to `about:addons`.
2. Locate uBO Scope.
3. Click on the extension options (three dots) > ‘Manage’.
4. Confirm permissions are granted, especially for network monitoring.

2. Select uBO Scope.
3. Confirm the extension is enabled.
4. Ensure Safari system permissions for extensions are granted in macOS System Settings under Privacy & Security.
