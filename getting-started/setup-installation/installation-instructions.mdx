## Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation or want to build the extension yourself, these instructions cover generating the extension packages for **Chromium-based browsers**, **Firefox**, and **Safari** on a Linux system.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
cd uBO-Scope
```

### Step 2: Build the Extension Package

You can create the extension package for your target browser by running the provided shell scripts.

#### For Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.):

```bash
./tools/make-chromium.sh
```

This generates the extension files in `build/uBO-Scope.chromium` and creates a ZIP archive `build/uBO-Scope.chromium.zip`.

#### For Firefox:

```bash
./tools/make-firefox.sh
```

This generates the extension files in `build/uBO-Scope.firefox` and creates an XPI archive `build/uBO-Scope.firefox.xpi`.

#### For Safari:

```bash
./tools/make-safari.sh
```

This creates the packaged extension in `build/uBO-Scope.safari` and archives it as `build/uBO-Scope.safari.zip`.

<Note>
All scripts assume a Linux environment and require bash shell and standard utilities like `zip` and `jq`.
</Note>

### Step 3: Install the Extension in Your Browser

#### Chromium

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle switch at top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the folder `build/uBO-Scope.chromium`.
5. The extension will load and appear in your toolbar.

#### Firefox

1. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Select the `build/uBO-Scope.firefox/xpi` file.
4. The extension will load and appear in your toolbar.

<Warning>
Temporary loading in Firefox lasts only for the session. To install permanently, submit to the Firefox Add-ons store or sideload as per Firefox’s guidelines.
</Warning>

#### Safari

Safari requires enabling developer mode and manually loading the extension:

1. Open **Safari** preferences.
2. In the **Advanced** tab, enable **Show Develop menu in menu bar**.
3. Open the **Develop** menu and choose **Show Extension Builder**.
4. Click **+** and select **Add Extension**.
5. Choose the folder `build/uBO-Scope.safari`.
6. Press **Install** to add the extension to Safari.

<Info>
Safari 18.5 or newer is required for uBO Scope, which uses Manifest Version 3.
