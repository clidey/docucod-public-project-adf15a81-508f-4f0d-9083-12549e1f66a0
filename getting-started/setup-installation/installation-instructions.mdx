## 2. Permissions Overview

During installation, uBO Scope requires the following permissions:

- `webRequest`: To monitor and report remote server connections initiated by the browser.
- `storage`: To save your preferences and extension data reliably.
- `activeTab`: To interact with the currently active tab for detailed monitoring.

Additionally, the extension requests host permissions to access all web traffic over HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket (WS), and Secure WebSocket (WSS) protocols. This broad access is essential for uBO Scope to provide comprehensive auditing.

<Note>
Permissions requested are mandatory for the extension to operate as designed. They do not grant uBO Scope the ability to modify web content or block connections; they only enable monitoring.
