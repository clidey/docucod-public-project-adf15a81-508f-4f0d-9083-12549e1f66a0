# Supported Browsers & Prerequisites

This page outlines the minimum browser versions, supported platforms, and prerequisites necessary for installing and running uBO Scope smoothly. Understanding these essentials ensures the extension operates reliably and leverages browser APIs fully.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a cross-browser extension compatible with the following browsers. Each has specific minimum version requirements to guarantee full functionality, especially for real-time network request monitoring using browser APIs.

| Browser   | Minimum Version | Notes                                                |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Chrome    | 122.0           | Chrome version 122 or later with Manifest V3 support |
| Firefox   | 128.0           | Firefox version 128 or later, supporting Manifest V3 |
| Safari    | 18.5            | Safari version 18.5 or later, requires Manifest V3  |


> These versions align with uBO Scope's use of Manifest V3 and `webRequest` API features that our extension depends upon.


### Details per Browser

- **Chrome**
  - Requires at least version 122.0, as specified in the extension’s `manifest.json`.
  - Supports essential permissions: `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` for network monitoring.
  - Compatible with Chromium-based browsers that follow the same architecture.

- **Firefox**
  - Requires version 128.0 or higher. This is enforced in the browser-specific `manifest.json`.
  - Must support Manifest V3 to ensure service worker background execution.
  - Permissions mirror Chrome for consistent functionality.

- **Safari**
  - Requires at minimum Safari 18.5, configured in its `manifest.json`.
  - Supports necessary permissions and scripts via modules for better resource management.
  - Host permissions differ slightly by excluding `wss://` and `ws://` protocols (only HTTP and HTTPS).


## 2. Platform & Environment Requirements

- **Operating Systems**
  - browser support depends strictly on the browser's supported platforms.
  - Windows, macOS, Linux are supported for Chrome and Firefox.
  - Safari support is available on macOS devices running Safari 18.5 or newer.

- **Network Access**
  - uBO Scope requires network access for fetching and updating the public suffix list, essential for correctly identifying third-party domains.

- **Permissions**
  - The extension requires permission to intercept network requests (`webRequest`) and access the active tab (`activeTab`).
  - Storage permission is needed to save session and public suffix list data.


## 3. Prerequisites Before Installing uBO Scope

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure the following conditions are met:

1. You are running one of the supported browsers at or above the minimum required version.
2. Your browser supports Manifest Version 3 extensions.
3. You have permission to install extensions in your browser (e.g., administrator or user scope).
4. You have an active internet connection to allow the extension to fetch necessary resources such as the public suffix list.

<Tip>
If you are unsure about your browser version, check your browser’s About page to verify the version and upgrade if necessary before proceeding with installation.
</Tip>


## 4. Compatibility Considerations

- **Content Blockers Independence**
  - uBO Scope operates independently of other content blockers, tapping into the browser’s native `webRequest` API to report network connection outcomes.

- **Limitations**
  - Network requests made outside the scope of browser APIs (for example, native DNS-based blocking outside webRequest visibility) cannot be monitored by uBO Scope.
  - The installed browser must fully support the required permissions and APIs; otherwise, uBO Scope may fail to display accurate data.

- **Permissions**
  - The extension’s permissions request covers all `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and depending on the browser, WebSocket schemes to monitor network requests broadly.

- **Version Mismatch Risks**
  - Installing the extension on unsupported browser versions may lead to incomplete or faulty behavior, such as failure to capture network request events or UI errors.


## 5. Verification of Browser Compatibility

Follow these steps to verify if your environment can run uBO Scope:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Version">
- Open your browser.
- Navigate to the "About" section (typically found in the Help menu or Settings).
- Confirm the version number meets or exceeds the minimum required version.
</Step>
<Step title="Ensure Permission to Install Extensions">
- Verify you can add extensions.
- For managed environments, consult your administrator if necessary.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Manifest Version 3 Support">
- Most browsers starting from the specified minimum versions support Manifest V3.
- You may refer to the browser’s official developer extension documentation for confirmation.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 6. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Compatibility Issues">
<Accordion title="Extension Installation Fails or is Blocked">
- **Cause:** Browser version is outdated or enterprise policies restrict extension installations.
- **Solution:** Update the browser to the latest version and check with your IT administrator.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Requests Not Displaying">
- **Cause:** Browser may not support all required webRequest APIs or permissions were not granted.
- **Solution:** Confirm permissions during installation and verify browser version.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension Incompatible Error">
- **Cause:** Manifest V3 not supported by current browser version.
- **Solution:** Upgrade browser to meet minimum requirements listed above.
</Accordion>
