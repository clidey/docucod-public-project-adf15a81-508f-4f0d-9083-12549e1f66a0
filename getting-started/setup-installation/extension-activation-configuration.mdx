# Activating and Configuring uBO Scope

This guide walks you through enabling uBO Scope in your browser after installation, verifying the necessary permissions, and understanding the initial setup as presented in the extension's popup interface. It focuses strictly on activation and configuration steps—no advanced setup is needed for baseline functionality.

## 1. Enable uBO Scope After Installation

Once you have installed uBO Scope from your browser’s extension/add-ons store, follow these steps to ensure it is active and ready:

### Step 1: Confirm Installation
- Verify uBO Scope appears in your browser’s toolbar as an icon (or under the extensions menu).
- If it does not appear, check your extension manager to ensure it is installed and enabled.

### Step 2: Pin or Enable the Extension Icon
- **For Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge):**
  - Click the extension puzzle icon near the address bar.
  - Locate uBO Scope and click the pin icon to place it on the toolbar.
- **For Firefox:**
  - Right-click on the toolbar and select “Customize Toolbar.”
  - Drag the uBO Scope icon to your visible toolbar area.
- **For Safari:**
  - In Safari preferences > Extensions, ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
  - Add the uBO Scope icon to your toolbar if it is not already visible.

### Step 3: Grant Permissions Automatically on Installation
- uBO Scope requests essential permissions such as `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` automatically during installation.
- There is no additional manual permission setup required from users for basic operation.

<Tip>
If installation or activation does not proceed as expected, revisit the installation guide or your browser’s extension settings to confirm permissions and enablement.
</Tip>

## 2. Verify Required Permissions Are Set

uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API and other permissions to monitor network connections effectively.

### What uBO Scope Needs:
- **webRequest permission:** To track network requests and determine connection outcomes.
- **activeTab permission:** To access data about the active browser tab.
- **storage permission:** To save session and configuration data locally.

These permissions are requested and granted at installation automatically. To verify:

- Open your browser’s extensions page.
- Locate uBO Scope and click on “Details” or the equivalent.
- Review the list of permissions to ensure the ones above are listed and enabled.

<Note>
No manual intervention is needed to configure permissions unless your browser has strict policies or user settings restricting extension permissions.
</Note>

## 3. Initial Setup and Popup Interface Overview

When you first interact with uBO Scope, clicking its toolbar icon opens a popup UI presenting connection data for the active tab.

### What You See on First Launch:
- **Hostname and Domain Display:** Shows the current tab’s top-level hostname and domain.
- **Connection Summary:** Number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Categorized Connection Lists:** Three categorized lists showing:
  - *Not Blocked* (allowed connections)
  - *Stealth-Blocked* (redirected but not blocked outright)
  - *Blocked* (failed or denied connections)

### Important Details:
- All data is automatically collected with no setup from the user.
- The popup updates dynamically based on the active tab’s network activity.
- No settings or configuration options are presented or required in the popup for initial use.

<Tip>
Refresh a webpage after installation and click the uBO Scope icon to see live data on active connections.
</Tip>

- There are no separate preference pages or customizable options for day-to-day monitoring.
- The extension focuses on reading and reporting network connection outcomes transparently.
