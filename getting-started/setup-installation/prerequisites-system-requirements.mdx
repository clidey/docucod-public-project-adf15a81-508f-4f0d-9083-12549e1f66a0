# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing and using uBO Scope, ensure your system and browser meet the necessary prerequisites to guarantee full compatibility and optimal performance. This page guides you through the supported browsers, minimum version requirements, and key permissions needed.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a lightweight browser extension compatible with major modern browsers. However, due to its reliance on certain browser APIs, it requires specific minimum versions.

| Browser  | Minimum Version | Notes                                 |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Chrome / Chromium**  | 122.0          | Required because of Manifest V3 and Web Request API behavior.
| **Firefox**            | 128.0          | Supports Manifest V3 with gecko-specific settings.
| **Safari**             | 18.5           | Requires Safari Web Extensions support with specific manifest versioning.


Ensure your browser is updated to or beyond these versions before proceeding.

<Note>
Using versions below these minimums may cause uBO Scope to fail silently or malfunction because key APIs or manifest requirements are not available.
</Note>

## 2. Platform and Environment

uBO Scope is a browser extension and therefore runs within browser environments on the following platforms:

- **Desktop Operating Systems:** Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Supported Browsers:** Chrome-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave), Firefox desktop, Safari on macOS

While the extension supports Firefox on Android (via `gecko_android` manifests), users should confirm the version meets the Firefox minimum version requirement.

---

## 3. Permissions Required

To perform its tasks, uBO Scope requires explicit permissions granted by the browser:

- **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to access the currently active tab to retrieve network request data.
- **`storage`**: Utilized to save network request session data locally for persistence between browser sessions.
- **`webRequest`**: Grants the extension the ability to monitor network requests in real time.

Additionally, it requests host permissions to monitor requests across HTTP, HTTPS, and websocket protocols:

- `http://*/*`
- `https://*/*`
- `ws://*/*` (Chromium and Firefox only)
- `wss://*/*` (Chromium and Firefox only)

<Warning>
During installation, you will be prompted to allow these permissions. Denying them will prevent uBO Scope from functioning correctly.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Network and Security Considerations

- **Connectivity:** uBO Scope requires internet access to fetch the public suffix list used to parse domains correctly. This is done once and cached for future use.
- **Security:** The extension respects browser sandboxing; all data collection is local and only records network requests reported by the browser.

<Info>
No external servers receive your browsing data from uBO Scope.
</Info>

## 5. Summary of Manifest Specifications

Each supported browser uses a slightly tailored manifest file appropriate to its extension platform:

- **Chromium:** Uses Manifest V3 with `service_worker` background script.
- **Firefox:** Uses Manifest V3 with `scripts` for background.
- **Safari:** Uses Manifest V3, requiring strict minimum version 18.5.

These manifest details ensure uBO Scope installs correctly and gains the required access rights.

## 6. Verifying Your Environment

Follow these steps to verify your environment before installation:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Version">
- Open your browser.
- Navigate to 'About' in the settings (e.g., `chrome://settings/help`, `about:support` in Firefox).
- Confirm your browser version matches or exceeds the minimum required version listed above.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Permission Availability">
- Check that your browser supports Manifest V3 extensions.
- Ensure the `webRequest` API is accessible and enabled.
</Step>
<Step title="Software Updates">
- If necessary, update your browser to its latest version via official channels.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 7. Troubleshooting Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
If your browser version is older than the minimum required:

- Update your browser through its official updater.
- If your platform does not support newer versions, uBO Scope will not function properly.
- Consider upgrading your operating system or browser alternative.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Not Granted During Installation">
- Verify browser extension permission prompts carefully.
- Re-install the extension and explicitly accept all permissions requested.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Access Blocked or Restricted">
- Ensure that your firewall or network policies do not block internet access required for extensions.
- Check if browser security settings or privacy tools interfere with webRequest API.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
