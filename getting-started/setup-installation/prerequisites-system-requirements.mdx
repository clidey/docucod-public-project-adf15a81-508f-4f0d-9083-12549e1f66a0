# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

This guide ensures you have the right environment and permissions to run **uBO Scope** smoothly. Before installing or using the extension, validate your browser compatibility, operating system support, and necessary extension permissions related to network monitoring.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope integrates directly with the browser's network stack to monitor third-party connections. To work correctly, your browser must support the `webRequest` API with the required permissions.

| Browser           | Minimum Version | Notes                         |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Chrome / Chromium-based Browsers** | 122.0+         | Includes Edge, Brave, Vivaldi  |
| **Firefox (Desktop & Android)**       | 128.0+         | Full support with webRequest API |
| **Safari**                         | 18.5+          | Web extension support available |


### How to Check Your Browser Version

- **Chrome/Chromium:**
  - Navigate to `chrome://settings/help`
  - Version info displayed at the top
- **Firefox:**
  - Go to `about:support` and locate "Application Basics" 
  - Version displayed under "Firefox Version"
- **Safari:**
  - Click Safari > About Safari from the menu bar


<Tip>
Always keep your browser updated. uBO Scope leverages modern browser APIs that older versions might not fully support.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Operating System Compatibility

uBO Scope runs as a browser extension, so it inherits compatibility from the browser itself. Supported operating systems include:

- **Windows 10 and later** (compatible with Chromium-based browsers and Firefox)
- **macOS 12 Monterey and later** (Safari 18.5+ required for Safari users)
- **Linux distributions** where Chromium-based browsers or Firefox support is available
- **Android 64-bit devices** running Firefox 128+ for Firefox version of uBO Scope


<Note>
Mobile browser support is currently limited to Firefox on Android. Chromium-based browsers on Android do not yet support all required extension APIs for uBO Scope.
</Note>

---

## 3. Extension Permissions Required

uBO Scope requires several permissions to fully monitor network requests and provide accurate third-party connection data:

| Permission      | Purpose                                         |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `webRequest`    | To track all network requests made by webpages |
| `host_permissions` | Access URLs across HTTP and HTTPS schemes for monitoring requests |
| `storage`       | To save session data and preferences            |
| `activeTab`     | To access the currently active browser tab      |


Check that your browser grants these permissions to uBO Scope during or after installation.

---

## 4. Network and Host Permissions

Because uBO Scope observes network requests, it requires access to data that flows between your webpages and remote servers. It specifically requests permissions on host patterns:

- **Chromium:**
  - `https://*/*`
  - `http://*/*`
  - `wss://*/*`
  - `ws://*/*`

- **Firefox:**
  - Same as Chromium, including WebSocket schemes

- **Safari:**
  - Limited to `https://*/*` and `http://*/*` due to platform restrictions


<Tip>
This network permission scope enables uBO Scope to capture all relevant connection attempts, including web sockets, ensuring comprehensive monitoring.
</Tip>

## 5. Verifying Browser Compatibility for uBO Scope

Follow these steps to verify your environment is compatible:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Version">
Verify that your browser meets the minimum version requirements listed above.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Extension Permissions">
After installation, open your browser's extensions page and check "Permissions" for uBO Scope. Ensure it has access to "Read and change all your data on websites you visit" or the equivalent.
</Step>
<Step title="Validate WebRequest API Availability">

1. Open your browser console (usually F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).
2. Navigate to your extensions or add-on debug page (platform-specific).
3. Confirm that the 'webRequest' API is enabled and no errors about missing permissions are present.

</Step>
<Step title="Test Network Monitoring">
Visit a website and observe that the uBO Scope badge updates with connection counts, indicating it is capturing network requests.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## 6. User Permissions and Browser Settings

uBO Scope relies on permissions granted during installation and active participation in browser events.

- **Ensure you allow all requested permissions** at install time to enable full functionality.

- Certain browsers may require you to enable extension access explicitly in their settings under "Site Access" or "Allow this extension to read and change site data".

- When browsing in private/incognito modes, make sure to enable the extension's permission separately if you want monitoring in those sessions.

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues Related to Prerequisites and Compatibility">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Old">
Make sure your browser is upgraded to the listed minimum version or above. Older browsers lack critical APIs, preventing uBO Scope from working correctly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Insufficient Extension Permissions">
If uBO Scope badge remains empty or shows no domains, verify that you've granted all permissions. Reinstall or manually adjust extension permissions if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Restricted Network Permissions on Safari">
Safari's restrictive API may limit websocket monitoring; uBO Scope may capture fewer connections compared to Chromium or Firefox.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Using Unsupported Browsers or Platforms">
uBO Scope is tested only on Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, and Safari 18.5+. Other browsers, older versions, or mobile platforms besides Firefox Android may not work.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension Disabled in Private Mode">
If you want monitoring when browsing privately, explicitly enable uBO Scope in the browser's extension management for incognito or private sessions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
