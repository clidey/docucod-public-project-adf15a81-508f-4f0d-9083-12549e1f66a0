# Supported Browsers & Prerequisites

This page details the browsers supported by uBO Scope, including the minimum version requirements and necessary permissions, ensuring you can install and run the extension smoothly.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to integrate seamlessly into your browsing experience by leveraging the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network connections. It supports the following major browsers:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge)
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Apple Safari**

### Browser Versions & Compatibility

| Browser           | Minimum Version | Notes                                        |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Chromium-based     | 122.0+          | Requires Manifest V3 support and webRequest permissions |
| Firefox           |  128.0+         | A recent Firefox version supporting required APIs |
| Safari            | 18.5+           | Safari Web Extensions compatible version      |


> The strict minimum versions ensure full compatibility with the underlying browser APIs that uBO Scope depends on.

## 2. Required Permissions

To provide accurate and comprehensive reporting of network requests, uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions:

- **`webRequest`**: To observe and record network request events such as redirects, errors, and completions.
- **`storage`**: To save session data related to observed network activities.
- **`activeTab`**: To access details about the currently active tab for per-tab insights.
- **Host Permissions**: Access to URLs with patterns matching <code>http://*/*</code> and <code>https://*/*</code> (including WebSocket protocols in supported browsers) to monitor network requests across all sites.


<CodeGroup>
```json
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*", "wss://*/*", "ws://*/*"]
}
```
```json
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*"] // Safari does not support WebSocket in host permissions
}
```
</CodeGroup>

> These permissions enable uBO Scope to capture a full and unbiased picture of network requests regardless of which content blockers are in use or network-level blocking.

---

## 3. Important Notes on Browser Support

- **Chromium browsers** require at least version 122 due to the use of Manifest V3 service workers and updated webRequest APIs.
- **Firefox's** web extension APIs must be version 128 or higher to ensure reliable background service operation.
- **Safari** support requires version 18.5 or newer to use Safari web extensions APIs and service workers properly.

<u>These minimum versions must be met to avoid unexpected behavior, missing data, or failure to install the extension.</u>


## 4. Installation Source Recommendations

To ensure you are installing uBO Scope safely and with the latest updates, use only official browser stores:

- **Chromium:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- **Firefox:** [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- **Safari:** Installation is via Safari Extensions Gallery or manual sideloading if supported by your environment.


## 5. Verifying Browser Environment for uBO Scope

Before installation, confirm your browser version and permissions as follows:

1. **Check Browser Version:**
   - Open your browser's "About" menu to see the current version.

2. **Permissions:**
   - uBO Scope requests permissions during installation; ensure you grant them.
   - In managed or restricted environments, verify permission policies do not block required API access.

3. **Extension Support:**
   - Confirm support for Manifest V3 (for Chromium) or equivalent extension standards.


## 6. Troubleshooting Prerequisites

<Tip>
If the extension fails to record network requests or shows no data:
- Ensure your browser meets the minimum version.
- Verify that webRequest permissions were not denied.
- Check that no conflicting extensions block access to the webRequest API.
- On Safari, verify the version is 18.5 or above and the extension is enabled in settings.
</Tip>
