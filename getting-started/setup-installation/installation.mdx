## 1. Supported Browsers and Compatibility Check

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure your browser meets the extension's compatibility and version requirements as detailed in the [Supported Browsers & Requirements](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/getting-started/setup-installation/prerequisites-browsers.mdx) page.

Key compatibility notes:

## 3. Verifying Successful Installation

After installation, it is critical to confirm that uBO Scope is active and ready to monitor your network connections.

### 3.1 Look for the Toolbar Icon

- Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. It features the distinctive uBO logo.
- If the icon is not visible, check the extension menu or customize toolbar options to enable its visibility.

### 3.2 Basic Extension Activation

- Click the toolbar icon to open uBO Scope’s popup interface.
- You should see a display indicating domains connected, along with separated sections for `not blocked`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked` domains.
- Initially, if no page is loaded or no network activity recorded, the popup will state `NO DATA`.

### 3.3 Confirm Permissions

- If permissions were declined, reinstall or adjust through your browser's extension settings.

## 4. First Launch and Basic Usage

Once installed and verified, uBO Scope begins tracking network connections automatically when you browse the web.

- Navigate to any website.
- Click the uBO Scope icon to observe the count of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected with during the current session.
- The badge number on the icon represents the count of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections—lower numbers suggest lower third-party exposure.

For a more detailed walkthrough of monitoring and interpreting results, see the [First Launch & Basic Configuration](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/getting-started/setup-installation/first-launch-configuration.mdx) guide.

## 5. Troubleshooting

If the toolbar icon does not appear or the extension popup displays no data:

- Confirm browser version matches minimum requirements.
- Verify that the `webRequest` permission is granted to uBO Scope in your browser's extension settings.
- Restart the browser to reload the extension.
- Check for conflicting extensions or security settings that may block the webRequest API.
- Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/getting-started/getting-aware/troubleshooting.mdx) page for detailed fixes.
