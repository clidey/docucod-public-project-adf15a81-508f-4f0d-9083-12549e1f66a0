# Prerequisites & Supported Browsers

Welcome to the essential first step for using **uBO Scope** effectively. This page helps you understand which browsers are compatible, the minimum system requirements, and key limitations to ensure smooth operation. Knowing these prerequisites empowers you to get the most value from uBO Scope’s powerful network connection insights.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension that relies heavily on modern browser APIs, particularly the `webRequest` API. Compatibility across the major browsers is as follows:

| Browser | Minimum Version | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ----- |
| **Google Chrome (Chromium-based)** | 122.0 and above | Supports full functionality including `webRequest` listeners via service workers.
| **Mozilla Firefox** | 128.0 and above | Full support including on Android with strict minimum version.
| **Apple Safari** | 18.5 and above | Requires Safari's Web Extensions support; functionality is slightly limited by platform rules.

### Details:

- **Chromium Version:**
  - The extension requires at least Chromium 122.0.
  - Uses Manifest V3 with service workers.
  - Supports network protocols `http`, `https`, `ws`, and `wss`.

- **Firefox Version:**
  - Requires Firefox 128.0 or newer (including Gecko Android).
  - Supports network protocols `http`, `https`, `ws`, and `wss`.

- **Safari Version:**
  - Requires Safari 18.5 or newer.
  - Uses Safari Web Extensions architecture.
  - Limited to `http` and `https` network permissions (no websocket support).

<Tip>
Using an unsupported browser version will prevent uBO Scope from capturing and reporting accurate data about network connections. Always update your browser to the latest stable release.
</Tip>

## 2. System & Environment Requirements

uBO Scope is built as a lightweight extension. Still, to observe all network activity accurately, ensure your environment meets these criteria:

- **Operating System:** Compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux, Android (for Firefox), and macOS/iOS for Safari.
- **Browser Settings:**
  - Must permit extensions.
  - `webRequest` API support must not be restricted by privacy settings or policies.
- **Network Requirements:**
  - No special firewall or proxy rules are needed for uBO Scope itself, but the browser must have access to the internet to monitor requests.

<Note>
Since uBO Scope listens to network requests via the browser's APIs, it cannot detect traffic from external apps or from browsers that sandbox their network stack outside these API controls.
</Note>

## 3. Extension Permissions and API Requirements

uBO Scope's ability to monitor distinct third-party network connections depends on browser permissions and APIs:

- **Required Permissions:**
  - `activeTab` — to operate on the currently active browser tab.
  - `storage` — to store session and configuration data.
  - `webRequest` — the core API to listen to all network requests.

- **Host Permissions:**
  - Covers all HTTP and HTTPS URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`).
  - WebSocket (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) are supported on Chromium and Firefox, not on Safari.

- **API Constraints:**
  - The extension depends on the browser accurately reporting all network requests.
  - Network requests outside the scope of `webRequest` API (e.g., some internal browser features or native apps) won’t be visible.

<Warning>
Browsers implementing special network privacy protections or sandboxing may hide some requests from this API, resulting in incomplete data.
</Warning>

## 4. Known Limitations & Platform Notes

- **Mobile Browsers:**
  - **Firefox for Android** supports uBO Scope starting from Firefox 128.0 (matching desktop).
  - **Chrome for Android** does not currently support Manifest V3 extensions with `webRequest` listener in a way compatible with uBO Scope.
  - **Safari on iOS** supports web extensions but has stricter API limitations, which may reduce data granularity.

- **Legacy Browsers:**
  - Older versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari do **not** support Manifest V3 or the relevant APIs.
  - uBO Scope will **not** function correctly or be installable in unsupported versions.

- **Incognito/Private Mode:**
  - The extension requires explicit permission or settings in the browser to run in Incognito/Private Mode.
  - Check your browser's extension settings to enable this mode if needed.

## 5. Verifying Your Setup

Before installing or using uBO Scope, verify your system compatibility by:

1. Checking your browser version against the minimum supported versions.
2. Ensuring extensions are enabled in your browser settings.
3. Confirming `webRequest` API support via browser extension developer documentation or trusted sources.

Once installed, proceed to the [Installation Guide](../installation) for clear step-by-step instructions.

## Appendix: Summary of Manifest Permissions by Browser

| Browser | Manifest Version | Minimum Version | Permissions | Host Permissions |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| Chrome  | 3                | 122.0+          | activeTab, storage, webRequest | http(s) + ws(s) |
| Firefox | 3                | 128.0+          | activeTab, storage, webRequest | http(s) + ws(s) |
| Safari  | 3                | 18.5+           | activeTab, storage, webRequest | http(s) only     |

These reflect the actual manifest files included in the extension source for each platform, ensuring accuracy and transparency.
