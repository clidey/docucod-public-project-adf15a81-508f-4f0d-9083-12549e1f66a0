# First-Time Setup & Configuration

Welcome to uBO Scope! After installing the extension, this guide will help you quickly understand its initial state, explain how the toolbar badge counts your network connections, and show you the minimal steps you can take to customize your first experience. No complex configuration is required to get started.

## 1. Understanding uBO Scope's Initial State

Once installed, uBO Scope starts monitoring your browser tabs without any manual configuration. Its primary goal is to reveal the network connections—allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked—originating from websites you visit.

### What Happens After Installation?
- uBO Scope automatically hooks into your browser’s webRequest API.
- It silently collects data on all network requests for every active tab.
- The toolbar badge displays a count that updates dynamically without user intervention.

<Tip>
You do not have to configure anything for uBO Scope to start providing immediate, actionable feedback on network activity.
</Tip>

## 2. How the Badge Counts Work

The toolbar badge on uBO Scope’s icon provides a real-time count of distinct third-party remote servers that your browser connects to on the active tab.

### Key Points:
- **Distinct Third-Party Count:** The badge shows how many unique third-party domains had network connections on a given page.
- **Lower is Better:** Fewer third-party connections usually indicate a cleaner, safer browsing experience.
- **Counting logic includes:**
  - **Allowed connections:** Successful connections made.
  - **Blocked connections:** Requests prevented by content blockers or network errors.
  - **Stealth-blocked connections:** Redirects or stealthy blocks that don’t fully show in other blockers.

### Immediate Feedback
- When you open a webpage, the badge count updates to reflect active third-party connections.
- The popup panel (accessed by clicking the icon) offers detailed domain breakdowns categorized under 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'.

<Info>
A quick glance at the badge after loading any tab gives you immediate insight into the level of third-party connectivity happening under the hood.

## 3. Minimal Configuration for Tailoring Your Experience

uBO Scope has intentionally minimal configuration to keep the onboarding smooth. However, there are basic considerations and options to enhance your experience.

### Steps You Can Take:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Permissions">
Ensure you have granted the necessary browser permissions:

- Active Tab
- Storage
- WebRequest

These are required for uBO Scope’s full functionality.

> To check or modify permissions, go to your browser's extension settings.
</Step>
<Step title="Understand the Badge Display">
Know that the badge count reflects **allowed third-party connections only** by default.

You can verify detailed outcomes (blocked, stealth) in the popup panel.
</Step>
<Step title="Access the Popup Panel for Details">
Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
- See the domain-level connection breakdown.
- Get immediate visibility into which domains are blocked or allowed.
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust Browser Settings or Other Extensions If Needed">
While uBO Scope requires no configuration, ensure other content blockers or privacy tools do not interfere with the webRequest API.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
uBO Scope does not offer complex settings or filters at this stage. It is designed to provide transparency with minimal user input.
</Note>

## 4. What to Expect on First Run

### Real-Time Updates
- As you browse, uBO Scope updates both the badge count and popup information dynamically.
- The extension tracks network events like redirects, errors, and successful responses.

### Initial Data Display
- Initially, the badge may show no count if the tab has no third-party connections.
- Opening the popup for a tab without network activity will display 'NO DATA' or zero counts.

### Sample Scenario:

1. Open a new tab and navigate to a popular website.
2. Observe the badge increment as uBO Scope detects third-party connections.
3. Click the badge to open the popup panel and explore the listed domains under 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'.

<Tip>
Refresh the page if you don't see an immediate badge count update to ensure uBO Scope has captured the requests.
</Tip>
