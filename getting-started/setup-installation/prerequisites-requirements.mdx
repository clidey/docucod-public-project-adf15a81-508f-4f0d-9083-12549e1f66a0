# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Before installing and running uBO Scope, it is essential to ensure your environment meets the necessary system and browser requirements. This page guides you through supported platforms, browser-specific considerations, and permission prerequisites to guarantee a smooth installation and reliable operation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with major modern browsers, leveraging the `webRequest` API for comprehensive network connection reporting.

- ### Chromium-Based Browsers
  - **Examples**: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera
  - **Minimum Browser Version**: 122.0 or later
  - **Notes**: Uses a service worker as the background script.

- ### Mozilla Firefox
  - **Minimum Version**: 128.0 or later (including Firefox for Android)
  - **Notes**: Uses a background module script.

- ### Apple Safari
  - **Minimum Version**: 18.5 or later
  - **Notes**: Uses background scripts as modules.


<Check>
Make sure your browser is updated to at least the minimum applicable version listed above for full compatibility.
</Check>

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

Since uBO Scope operates as an extension within supported browsers, it inherits compatibility from those browsers:

- **Windows** (all versions supporting required browser versions)
- **macOS** (including support for Safari)
- **Linux** (Chromium-based browsers and Firefox)
- **Android** (Firefox 128 and above)


## 3. Permissions Required

uBO Scope requires specific permissions from the browser to monitor all network requests and function correctly.

- **`webRequest` permission**
  - Enables monitoring of all network requests made by webpages.
- **`storage` permission**
  - Allows the extension to save session data and configuration.
- **`activeTab` permission**
  - Grants temporary access to the active tab for gathering current tab data.
- **Host Permissions**
  - Access to all HTTP and HTTPS URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`), plus WebSocket URLs (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`), depending on the browser.


## 4. Browser-Specific Considerations

<u>uBO Scope has subtle differences in behavior or requirements across browsers. Understand these before installation:</u>

- **Chromium browsers**
  - Minimum Chrome version 122 to support all manifest v3 features used.
  - Uses a service worker background script, which can be unloaded and reloaded by the browser dynamically.
  - Supports full WebSocket monitoring.

- **Firefox**
  - Uses a module-based background script.
  - Supports detailed WebSocket monitoring.
  - Requires extension ID and minimum version 128 to access WebRequest APIs fully.

- **Safari**
  - Requires Safari 18.5 or later due to strict versioning policy.
  - Uses background scripts as modules.
  - WebSocket monitoring may be limited or behave differently due to Apple’s API limitations.


<Warning>
Using browsers or versions below the minimum requirements will cause malfunction or inability to monitor network requests, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete data.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Network Environment Requirements

- The browser's `webRequest` API must be available and enabled.
- No firewall or network policy should block the extension’s access to needed URLs.

<Tip>
Since uBO Scope observes network traffic through browser APIs, it cannot report connections made outside of the browser or hidden from the `webRequest` API.
</Tip>
