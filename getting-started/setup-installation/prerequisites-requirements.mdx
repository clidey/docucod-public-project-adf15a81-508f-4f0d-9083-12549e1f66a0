# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing uBO Scope, it’s essential to ensure your environment is compatible and properly prepared. This page guides you through the necessary browser support, permissions, and user settings required for a seamless installation and optimal functionality.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed to work across major browsers with adherence to their manifest and API specifications. Verify that your browser version meets the minimum requirements below for guaranteed compatibility:

- **Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)**
  - Minimum Version: **122.0**
  - Manifest Version: 3

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum Version: **128.0**
  - Manifest Version: 3

- **Safari**
  - Minimum Version: **18.5**
  - Manifest Version: 3

> These minimum versions reflect the earliest releases supporting the APIs and manifest features uBO Scope depends on for reliable operation.


## 2. Permissions Required

Upon installation, uBO Scope requests specific permissions needed to observe and report network connections initiated by your browser:

- **activeTab:** Grants temporary access to the active tab for data collection.
- **storage:** Allows saving and retrieving session and configuration data locally.
- **webRequest:** Core to uBO Scope's monitoring, this enables the extension to observe all web requests made by tabs.

Additionally, uBO Scope declares **host permissions** to monitor network requests across all web addresses and protocols it covers:

- `https://*/*`
- `http://*/*`
- For Chromium and Firefox, also:
  - `wss://*/*` (WebSocket Secure)
  - `ws://*/*` (WebSocket)

In Safari, WebSocket permissions are not declared, reflecting platform compatibility constraints.


## 3. User Account and Access Requirements

- No user account or login is required to install or use uBO Scope.
- Ensure you have permission to install browser extensions on your device.
  - On managed or corporate devices, administrative restrictions may prevent installation.


## 4. Network and Connectivity Requirements

- uBO Scope monitors network activity through browser APIs; it requires an active internet connection to observe outgoing requests.
- Firewall or security software should not block the extension or its access to the `webRequest` API.
- The extension requires access to standard web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS) for effective monitoring.


## 5. System Requirements

uBO Scope is lightweight and has minimal hardware requirements, but the following baseline ensures smooth installation and operation:

- **Operating System:** Any OS supported by the aforementioned browser versions (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS for compatible browsers).
- **Memory:** No specific memory requirement beyond that needed to run the browser.
- **Storage:** Minimal, only to store extension code and session data.


## 6. Additional Notes

- uBO Scope requires browsers that support Manifest V3 extensions and the `webRequest` API with monitoring capabilities. Some older browsers or versions may be incompatible.
- The extension will not observe network requests made outside of browser contexts or those bypassing the browser’s network stack.

## Troubleshooting Pre-Installation Issues

### Common Problems

| Issue | Description | Resolution |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Installation blocked by browser | Browser version below required minimum. | Update the browser to the latest stable version. |
| Insufficient permissions | In managed environments, installation or permissions denied. | Contact your administrator or use a personal device. |
| Extension won’t install on unsupported OS | OS does not support minimum browser version. | Upgrade your operating system or use supported hardware. |


<Tip>
To check your browser version:

- **Chrome/Edge/Brave:** Go to `chrome://settings/help`
- **Firefox:** Go to `about:support` and look for "Application Basics"
- **Safari:** Use "About Safari" in the Safari menu
</Tip>
