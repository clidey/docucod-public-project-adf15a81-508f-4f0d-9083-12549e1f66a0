# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Prepare your environment to successfully install and run uBO Scope by verifying compatibility with supported browsers and operating systems. This guide helps ensure your setup meets all necessary conditions to maximize uBO Scope’s ability to monitor and report remote server connections accurately.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with the following browsers:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.)
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Apple Safari**

> Each browser has minimum version requirements and slight differences in supported APIs, so validate your browser version carefully.

### Minimum Browser Versions

| Browser       | Minimum Version Required |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Chromium      | 122.0                    |
| Firefox       | 128.0                    |
| Safari        | 18.5                     |

These requirements ensure uBO Scope can access necessary APIs, such as `webRequest`, for monitoring network activity.

<Note>
Using browsers below these versions may result in partial or complete loss of functionality.
</Note>


### How to Check Your Browser Version

- **Chromium/Chrome:**
  1. Click the menu (three dots) in the upper-right.
  2. Go to **Help** > **About Google Chrome**.
  3. Confirm the version number meets or exceeds 122.0.

- **Firefox:**
  1. Click the menu (three lines) in the upper-right.
  2. Select **Help** > **About Firefox**.
  3. Confirm the version number meets or exceeds 128.0.

- **Safari:**
  1. Click **Safari** in the top menu bar.
  2. Select **About Safari**.
  3. Confirm the version number meets or exceeds 18.5.


## 2. Operating System Compatibility

uBO Scope supports installation on platforms that run supported browsers of the required minimum versions. Typical environments:

- **Windows 10 or later** for Chromium and Firefox
- **macOS 13 Ventura or later** for Safari and other browsers
- **Linux distributions** supporting Chromium/Firefox stable or newer releases


## 3. Permissions & Access Requirements

uBO Scope requires explicit browser permissions to monitor network requests and display connection data.

### Permissions Requested

- **activeTab:** To access details about the currently active tab.
- **storage:** To save session and configuration data locally.
- **webRequest:** To listen to all network requests made by the browser.

### Host Permissions

To capture network connections, uBO Scope requires access to all URLs that the browser may request:

- HTTP and HTTPS: `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`
- WebSocket: `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` (Supported on Chromium and Firefox; Safari only supports HTTP/HTTPS)

These permissions are granted when installing the extension and can be reviewed or revoked via your browser’s extension management page.

<Warning>
Restricting or disabling permissions may prevent uBO Scope from accurately reporting network activity.
</Warning>


## 4. Network Requirements

Ensure your network environment does not block or interfere with browser extension operation:

- Web requests (HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS) should be allowed without restrictive firewall or proxy rules that block extensions.
- Browsers must be allowed to use their built-in APIs normally without additional security policies preventing extensions from hooking into webRequest events.


## 5. Validating Your Setup Before Installation

Follow these steps to confirm your environment meets uBO Scope prerequisites:

1. **Confirm your browser version** using the instructions above.
2. **Verify operating system compatibility**.
3. **Review browser permissions** and ensure extension installation is allowed.
4. **Check your internet connectivity and security policies** to allow browser extensions full operation.


## 6. Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- Some browsers running strict privacy or security modes may limit visibility to network requests. Disable such modes temporarily if uBO Scope appears non-functional.
- If using corporate or managed devices, extension installation or permissions may be restricted by administrative policies.
- Safari currently limits WebSocket monitoring due to API constraints; expect partial reporting compared to Chromium and Firefox.


## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Extension Can’t Install or Lacks Permissions
- Verify your browser version meets minimum requirements.
- In browser settings, enable extension installation from trusted sources.
- Confirm no organizational or security policies block extensions.

### Issue: Network Requests Not Being Reported
- Check that all required permissions are granted.
- Disable conflicting extensions that may intercept or block webRequest events.
- Restart the browser after installation to ensure full activation.

## Summary

Ensuring your environment meets these prerequisites is crucial for uBO Scope to function reliably. After validating browser versions, operating system compatibility, permission grants, and network settings, proceed with installation and enjoy transparent visibility into your browser’s remote server connections.
