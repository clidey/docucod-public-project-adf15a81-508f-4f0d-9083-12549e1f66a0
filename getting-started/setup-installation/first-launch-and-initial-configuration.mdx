# First Launch & Initial Configuration

Welcome to uBO Scope!

## 1. Activating uBO Scope in Your Browser

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to reveal every attempted or successful remote server connection made by webpages. To activate it:

1. **Install uBO Scope:**
   - If you have not yet installed uBO Scope, please refer to the [Installing on Your Browser](./installing-on-your-browser) guide first.
   - Supported browsers include **Firefox (≥ 128.0)**, **Chrome/Chromium (≥ 122.0)**, and **Safari (≥ 18.5)**.

2. **Confirm Permissions Request:**
   - Upon installation, your browser will prompt you to grant uBO Scope specific permissions:
     - `activeTab`: To monitor active tabs.
     - `storage`: To save session data and settings.
     - `webRequest`: To listen to network requests across all sites.
   - These permissions are essential for uBO Scope to function properly.
   
3. **Enable the Extension:**
   - After installation, ensure uBO Scope is enabled in your browser's extensions or add-ons manager.

<Tip>
The extension uses broad host permissions (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and WebSocket variants) to monitor all network requests, reflecting comprehensive connection transparency.
</Tip>

## 2. What to Expect on First Launch

Once activated:

- **Browser Toolbar Icon:**
  - Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's extension toolbar.
  - The icon displays a badge count showing the number of distinct third-party domains contacted by the active tab.

- **Popup Interface:**
  - Clicking the icon opens the popup panel displaying:
    - The current tab's domain and subdomain breakdown.
    - Counts and lists of domains categorized as **Not Blocked**, **Stealth-Blocked**, and **Blocked**.

- **Data Collection:**
  - The extension immediately begins monitoring web requests for each active tab.
  - It uses browser events to aggregate outcomes and updates the badge in near-real-time.

<Info>
The badge count represents the number of distinct third-party remote servers for which connections were detected, with a lower count generally indicating fewer third-party connections.
</Info>

## 3. Initial Permission and Configuration Steps

To enable full core functionality:

1. **Allow Browser Permissions Prompt:**
   - When first enabled, uBO Scope must be granted permissions mentioned above.
   - Without these, the extension cannot capture or report network activity.

2. **No Manual Configuration Required:**
   - uBO Scope operates immediately after installation.
   - It requires no additional user configuration.

3. **Session Data Management:**
   - The extension internally stores session data relevant to observed network requests using browser session storage.
   - This persists monitoring data per tab during your browsing session.

4. **Network Monitoring Compliance:**
   - Your browser must support the `webRequest` API and allow such permissions for full visibility.
   - Some browser privacy settings or other extensions may interfere with uBO Scope's ability to monitor requests.

<Warning>
If you deny any permissions during installation, uBO Scope will not operate correctly, and network connection visibility will be impaired.
</Warning>

## 4. Accessing and Recognizing uBO Scope

### Locating the Extension Icon:

- **Firefox:**
  - The uBO Scope icon appears in the toolbar immediately after enabling.
  - The default tooltip when hovering is 'uBO Scope'.

- **Chrome/Chromium:**
  - The icon appears near the address bar.
  - Badge shows distinct third-party connection count for the active tab.

- **Safari:**
  - The icon is available in your Safari extensions toolbar.

### Interacting with the Extension:

1. Click the icon to open the **popup panel**.
2. Observe the summary statistics and categorized domain lists:
   - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which connections succeeded or were allowed.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where redirections or stealthy blocking likely occurred.
   - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were blocked or failed.
3. Refresh active tabs or navigate to new sites to see real-time updates in connection data and badges.

<Tip>
You can rely on the badge count as a quick privacy indicator: fewer distinct third-party connections generally mean less tracking.
</Tip>
