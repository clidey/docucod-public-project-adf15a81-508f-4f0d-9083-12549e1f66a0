# First Launch & Basic Configuration

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide will help you open the extension for the first time, understand its popup interface, and adjust any default behaviors if needed. You’ll also learn the significance of the toolbar badge and how to confirm the extension is active and monitoring your browser’s network connections.

---

## 1. Opening uBO Scope for the First Time

After installing uBO Scope through your browser’s extension store (e.g., Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Safari Extensions), follow these simple steps to access it:

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the Extension Icon in the Toolbar">
Find the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar — it should appear as the extension’s distinctive icon.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Icon to Open the Popup Interface">
Click the toolbar icon once to open the uBO Scope popup window. This interface provides instant real-time insights into network connections on your current active tab.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the icon is not visible, check your browser's extension menu or pin uBO Scope to the toolbar for quick access.
</Tip>


## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface

When you open the uBO Scope popup, you'll see a structured summary of network connections for the active browser tab. Here's how to interpret each section:

### Header: Hostname and Domain
- **Hostname panel** shows the domain name of the current webpage.
- The left span (if present) highlights any subdomain prefix.
- The right span shows the base domain for clarity.

### Summary Section
- Displays the number of distinct domains contacted by the current tab. A lower number indicates fewer third-party connections, aligning with better privacy practices.

### Outcome Sections
- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Lists domains from which resources successfully loaded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Shows domains where the request was redirected in a stealthy way, making the resource unavailable without obvious blockage.
- **Blocked:** Lists domains for which network requests failed or were explicitly blocked.

### Domain Rows
Each domain entry includes:
- The domain name (converted to Unicode for readability).
- A count badge indicating how many requests involved that domain.


## 3. Significance of the Toolbar Badge

The extension’s toolbar icon displays a **badge number**:

- This number is the count of **distinct third-party remote servers** your browser connected to on the active tab.
- **Lower badge count is better**, indicating fewer external connections, which often means less tracking and improved privacy.

The badge updates dynamically as you browse, reflecting real-time network activity.

<Note>
This badge count is distinct from content blockers’ block counts. It represents how many unique third-party domains were contacted — giving you a clearer picture of network exposure.
</Note>


## 4. Adjusting Default Behaviors

uBO Scope is designed to work out-of-the-box without complex setup. However, understanding what controls are available can empower you:

- **No configuration panel exists:** The extension runs automatically and passively monitors network requests.
- **Data Privacy:** The extension only reads network requests your browser is already processing and does not interfere with blocking policies.
- **Disabling the Toolbar Badge:** Not currently offered; the badge is essential for quick status overview.

If you want to explore detailed connection logs or perform further analysis, additional features may be introduced in future versions. For now, the straightforward default setup delivers immediate value.


## 5. Confirming the Extension is Active

To ensure uBO Scope is properly installed and running:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Toolbar Icon Presence">
Ensure the uBO Scope icon appears in your browser’s toolbar.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Badge Number">
When you visit websites, watch for the badge number to update, showing the count of third-party domains connected.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup and Check Data Display">
Click the icon and review the popup sections (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked). If these populate with data about connected domains, the extension is working.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the badge remains blank or the popup shows "NO DATA," try refreshing the page or verifying that your browser supports the necessary webRequest API (see the Supported Browsers & Requirements documentation).
</Tip>


## 6. Walkthrough Example: First Use Scenario

1. **Install uBO Scope from your browser’s store.**
2. Visit a popular website (e.g., https://example.com).
3. Click the uBO Scope icon in your toolbar.
4. The popup displays the site’s hostname at the top.
5. The summary shows the number of distinct third-party domains.
6. Review the lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
7. Observe the badge number — this reflects distinct domains contacted.

This immediate feedback helps you understand the network activity happening behind the scenes.


## 7. Common Questions & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions">
<Accordion title="Why is the badge number sometimes empty or zero?">

- The badge will be empty if the current tab has no outstanding network connections to third parties during your session.
- It can also be blank just after loading before data populates; wait a moment and refresh if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if the popup shows 'NO DATA'?">

- This usually means the extension has not yet received network data for that tab.
- Refresh the tab or click to another tab and return to trigger data updates.
- Confirm your browser supports the extension’s required APIs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I customize which domains uBO Scope tracks or blocks?">

- Currently, the extension only measures connections and does not block or filter.
- For blocking functionality, use a dedicated content blocker like uBlock Origin.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
