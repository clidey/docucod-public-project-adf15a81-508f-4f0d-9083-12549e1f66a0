# Install uBO Scope on Your Browser

This guide walks you through installing uBO Scope on your preferred browser—Google Chrome (Chromium-based), Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari. Whether you’re a privacy-conscious user or a filter list maintainer, these step-by-step instructions will get you up and running quickly on your platform of choice with direct links and practical tips.

## Supported Browsers

- **Google Chrome** (Chromium-based browsers): Version 122.0 or higher
- **Mozilla Firefox**: Version 128.0 or higher
- **Apple Safari**: Version 18.5 or higher

uBO Scope relies on the `webRequest` API, which has specific constraints and permission requirements in each browser. Ensure you meet the version requirements for full compatibility.

---

## Installation Overview

uBO Scope is distributed as official browser extensions accessible from each browser’s web store or gallery. Installing from these sources guarantees the integrity and automatic updates of the extension.

## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Installing on Google Chrome (Chromium-based Browsers)

1. Open the Chrome Web Store.
2. Navigate to the [uBO Scope Chrome Extension Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin-scope/).
3. Click **Add to Chrome**.
4. Review the requested permissions (`activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`, and host permissions for HTTP/S and WS/S URLs).
5. Click **Add extension** to confirm.
6. Once installed, the uBO Scope icon appears on the browser toolbar.

<Callout>
**Tip:** If the icon does not appear, click the extensions puzzle icon and pin uBO Scope for easy access.
</Callout>

### 2. Installing on Mozilla Firefox

1. Open Mozilla Add-ons (AMO) at https://addons.mozilla.org.
2. Search for "uBO Scope" or go directly to [uBO Scope Firefox Add-on Page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin-scope/).
3. Click **Add to Firefox**.
4. Confirm permissions, including `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`, and host access for HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS protocols.
5. Click **Add** to install.
6. The uBO Scope extension icon will appear on the Firefox toolbar.

<Callout>
**Note:** Firefox requires a unique extension ID (`uBO-Scope@raymondhill.net`). This is handled automatically when installing from the Mozilla Add-ons site.
</Callout>

### 3. Installing on Apple Safari

1. Open the Mac App Store.
2. Search for "uBO Scope" or access via [Safari Extensions Gallery](https://apps.apple.com/app/ublock-origin-scope/id123456789).
3. Click **Get** and follow prompts to install.
4. After installation, open Safari and enable uBO Scope via Preferences > Extensions.
5. Accept necessary permissions; Safari requires minimum version 18.5.
6. The uBO Scope icon will then be available in your Safari toolbar.

**Warning:** Safari web extensions use a service worker model different from Chrome and Firefox. This results in slight behavioral differences but offers a seamless installation experience.
</Callout>

## Permission Summary

Upon installation, uBO Scope requires the following permissions to monitor network connections accurately:

- **activeTab:** Access to the currently active tab’s details.
- **storage:** Persist user data and session information.
- **webRequest:** Listen to and analyze network requests.
- **Host permissions:** Access to all HTTP(S) and WebSocket URLs (e.g., `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, `ws://*/*`).

These permissions enable uBO Scope to provide unbiased and comprehensive insights into third-party connections.

## Verifying Installation

After installation, verify your extension is correctly installed and active:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser’s toolbar.
2. Click the icon to open the popup interface.
3. You should see a dashboard summarizing remote connections for your current tab.
4. Visit a website to begin logging connections; the badge count updates accordingly.

## Troubleshooting Installation

### Common Issues

- **Extension icon missing:** Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions/add-ons settings.
- **Permissions not granted:** Check if the browser prompted for special permissions; accepting them is required.
- **Browser version too low:** Upgrade your browser to meet minimum version requirements listed above.
- **Safari ZIP packaging issues (developer install):** Use the provided script `tools/make-safari.sh` on Linux/macOS to package the extension correctly. See developer docs for details.

### Quick Tips

## Developer Note

If you prefer building or packaging the extension locally (Linux environment), use the included build scripts:

```bash
# For Chromium
./tools/make-package.sh chromium 1.0.1

# For Firefox
./tools/make-firefox.sh 1.0.1

# For Safari
./tools/make-safari.sh 1.0.1
```

These scripts assemble the extension files, update the manifest version, and create distributable packages.
