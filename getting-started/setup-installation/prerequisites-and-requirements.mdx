# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Ensure your environment meets the requirements outlined below to run uBO Scope smoothly and securely. This page clarifies which browsers and versions are supported, platform constraints, necessary permissions, and any preparatory steps before installation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope integrates with major browsers by leveraging the `webRequest` API, making it compatible with the latest stable versions as follows:

| Browser   | Minimum Version | Notes                          |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Chromium  | 122.0+          | Includes Chrome, Edge, Brave   |
| Firefox   | 128.0+          | Supports desktop & Android     |
| Safari    | 18.5+           | Strict minimum version enforced |


**Important:** Older versions may lack the required `webRequest` features or fail manifest v3 compliance, which uBO Scope depends on.

## 2. Platform Limitations

- **Chromium-based Browsers**: Must be updated to version 122 or higher.
- **Firefox**: On Android, the same minimum version 128 applies.
- **Safari**: Only version 18.5 or higher supports the extension's features.

The extension may not work on browsers or platforms without full support for Manifest V3 extensions.

## 3. Required Permissions and Access

uBO Scope needs specific permissions to monitor network requests properly:

- **Active Tab Access** (`activeTab`): To gather request details specific to the current browser tab.
- **Storage Access** (`storage`): To save session and configuration data.
- **Network Monitoring** (`webRequest`): Critical to observe and classify all network requests. 
- **Host Permissions**: 
  - For Chromium and Firefox: Covers HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and Secure WebSocket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
  - For Safari: Limited to HTTP(S) URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`) due to platform constraints.

Before installing, you must be able to grant these permissions to the extension when prompted.

## 4. Preparation Before Installation

Follow these steps to prepare your system:

<Steps>
<Step title="Update Your Browser">
Ensure your browser version meets the minimum required version listed above. Visit your browser's 'About' page or official download site to upgrade.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Platform Compatibility">
Verify your operating system supports the targeted browser version. For Safari users, confirm your macOS version supports Safari 18.5 or higher.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Permissions">
Understand that uBO Scope requires network access permissions; be comfortable with granting access when installing.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Network and Security Considerations

- uBO Scope requires network access capabilities to inspect all outgoing browser requests.
- Ensure no firewall or enterprise policies block extension permissions or restrict `webRequest` events.
- Some privacy-focused or custom browsers that alter network APIs might interfere with extension functionality.

## 6. Version and Update Notes

- The current uBO Scope version is **1.0.1** across platforms.
- You can verify extension versions on the browser extensions page.
- No frequent updates are expected, but reviewing change logs on the official GitHub repository is recommended for significant version changes.

## 7. Summary

To run uBO Scope effectively, use a supported browser with minimum versions as listed; grant essential permissions for active tab access, storage, and `webRequest`. Verify your platform's compatibility and browser updates before installation to avoid common pitfalls.
