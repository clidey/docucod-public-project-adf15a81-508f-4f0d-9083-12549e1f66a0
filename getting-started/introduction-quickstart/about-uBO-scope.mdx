# What is uBO Scope?

## Introduction

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension crafted to give you complete visibility into every remote server connection your browser attempts or establishes. Unlike traditional content blockers that focus primarily on blocking or filtering, uBO Scope reveals all network activity at the domain level, helping you understand which third-party servers your browser interacts with — whether those connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.

This insight empowers privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers by providing transparent, actionable data about your actual exposure to remote servers while browsing.

## Why uBO Scope Matters

Many users rely on content blockers to limit tracking or unwanted content, but measuring how well these blockers perform is not straightforward. uBO Scope addresses this challenge by focusing on **distinct third-party remote servers contacted per browser tab** and exposes connection results regardless of any active blocker.

### Key Concepts

- **Badge Count Represents Connected Remote Servers:** The extension icon badge shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers with successful connections. Lower counts indicate fewer external connections, which may reflect tighter privacy.

- **Third-Party Is Defined by Domain:** Domains considered ‘third-party’ are distinct from the domain of the active tab. This helps users identify potentially unwanted external servers.

- **Visibility Independent of Blocking Methods:** Whether content blocking occurs at the browser level, DNS, or other methods, uBO Scope taps into the browser's `webRequest` API to report on all relevant network requests.


## What uBO Scope Does:

- Reports **all network requests initiated by the current webpage**, including redirects and errors.
- Categorizes connections into:
  - **Allowed (Not blocked):** Resources successfully loaded.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Redirected or suppressed connections that are harder to detect.
  - **Blocked:** Requests that failed due to blocking.
- Shows these categories grouped by domains to deliver a clear understanding of network behavior.


## Differentiation from Traditional Content Blockers and Tests

### Debunking Myths About Content Block Counts

<u>"This content blocker blocks more resources, so it must be better."</u>

- Higher block counts often paradoxically correlate with more third-party connections. This happens because some filters block many objects but still allow connections to multiple unique domains. uBO Scope emphasizes **unique external domains connected** to better represent privacy exposure.

### Understanding the Limits of "Ad Blocker Test" Pages

<u>"Ad blocker test pages accurately measure blocker effectiveness."</u>

- These test pages use many fabricated network requests to detect blocking. Real-world browsing rarely generates such requests, rendering these sites unreliable for measuring real blocker efficacy.

- Moreover, many content blockers perform stealthy blocking and optimizations which these test pages cannot detect.

uBO Scope sidesteps these problems by reporting actual network activity intercepted via the browser APIs.


## How It Works (High-Level Overview)

uBO Scope listens to your browser's network events using the `webRequest` API, recording every network request toward remote servers. It associates these requests with your active tabs, groups them by domain, and tracks each outcome:

- **Success:** Resource reached and loaded
- **Redirect:** The request was redirected (often used for subtle blocking or stealth approaches)
- **Error:** The connection failed or was blocked

This data feeds the badge count on the extension icon and populates the popup UI with detailed domain-level reporting.


## Browser Compatibility & Support

uBO Scope is compatible with all major browsers that support the necessary web extension APIs, including Chromium-based browsers (e.g. Chrome, Edge), Firefox, and Safari. The extension uses browser-specific manifests to ensure smooth operation across these environments.

## Getting Started With uBO Scope

1. **Install the extension** from your browser’s official addon marketplace:

   | Browser   | Install Link |
   | ---       | ---          |
   | Chromium-based | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
   | Firefox   | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |

2. **Observe the badge icon** on your toolbar — it dynamically updates to show the number of distinct third-party domains contacted by the current active tab.

3. **Click the icon** to open the popup and see detailed categorized lists of domains:

   - Not blocked (Allowed)
   - Stealth-blocked
   - Blocked

4. Use this insight to audit your content blockers, assess privacy exposure, and assist filter list development.

## Practical Use Cases

- **Privacy-Aware Users:** Understand which third parties your browsing interacts with beyond simple block counts.
- **Content Blocker Users:** Validate your blocker’s real-world effectiveness based on domains contacted.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Debug and refine filters based on accurate connection data, including stealth blocking outcomes.

## Additional Notes

- **Badge Count Interpretation:** A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party network connections, which usually correlates with better privacy.
- **Not All Third Parties Are Bad:** Legitimate resources like CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) might appear here but are usually essential for website functionality.
- **First Version:** This initial release focuses on revealing remote server connections; further features targeted at filter list maintainers are planned.
