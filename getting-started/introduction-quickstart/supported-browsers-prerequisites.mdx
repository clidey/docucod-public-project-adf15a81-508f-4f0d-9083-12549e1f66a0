# Supported Browsers & Requirements

This guide helps you understand which browsers support uBO Scope, the minimum requirements to install it, and important limitations to be aware of before starting.

Getting your environment ready with the right browser and permissions ensures a smooth, accurate experience with uBO Scope.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with major modern browsers that support Manifest Version 3 (MV3) extensions and the `webRequest` API, which enables the extension to monitor network requests effectively.

### Currently Supported Browsers

| Browser Engine       | Supported Versions                     | Installation Source            |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Chromium-based       | Chrome 122+, Edge (Chromium) 122+, Opera  | Chrome Web Store             |
| Firefox             | Firefox 128+                         | Firefox Add-ons Marketplace    |
| Safari              | Safari 18.5+ (strict)                | Safari Extensions Gallery      |


> Note: uBO Scope requires the latest versions of these browsers to ensure full MV3 and API compatibility. Older versions may not support required features.

### Browser-Specific Notes

- **Chromium-based browsers** require at least Chrome 122 due to Manifest Version 3 constraints and background service worker support.
- **Firefox** imposes minimum version 128 to support required APIs fully.
- **Safari** support begins at version 18.5, with a strict minimum enforced.

Refer to each browser's respective marketplace for installation:

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/)


## 2. Installation Prerequisites & Permissions

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure the following prerequisites and permission requirements are met.

### System & Browser Requirements

- A modern operating system capable of running supported browser versions.
- Sufficient storage and RAM to run browser extensions smoothly.

### Permissions Required by uBO Scope

The extension requires permissions to:

- Access the active tab (`activeTab`) to monitor network activity in the current tab.
- Use `storage` to preserve session data and configuration.
- Use `webRequest` to listen to network traffic and capture connection events.

These permissions are declared in the browser-specific manifest files.

### Network & Firewall Requirements

- The extension listens to network requests over HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket protocols.
- Host permissions include all URLs matching `https://*/*`, `http://*/*` (and WebSocket schemes in Firefox).
- Make sure firewall or antivirus software does not block the browser’s network or extension activities.


## 3. Important Limitations

Understanding where uBO Scope can and cannot operate ensures realistic expectations and optimal usage.

### Reliance on the `webRequest` API

- uBO Scope tracks network requests exclusively through the browser’s `webRequest` API.
- Requests outside the reach of this API — such as those initiated by external applications or certain browser internals — will not be reported.

### Browser Restrictions

- Some browsers restrict specific types of network requests or may limit extension APIs on certain platforms like mobile or sandboxed environments.
- On platforms where Manifest V3 or the relevant API is not fully implemented, uBO Scope may not function as intended.

### Impact on Badge Count

- The toolbar icon badge displays the count of distinct third-party domains connected during a tab’s session.
- This count depends on permissions and network monitoring capabilities; missing permissions or blocked access can affect accuracy.


## 4. Preparing Your Environment for Installation

Follow these steps to ensure your system meets requirements for uBO Scope.

### Step 1: Verify Browser Version

1. Open your browser.
2. Navigate to the `About` or `Help` menu.
3. Confirm the version meets or exceeds the following:
   - Chrome/Chromium-based: 122.0 or newer
   - Firefox: 128.0 or newer
   - Safari: 18.5 or newer

> If your browser version is older, update it before proceeding.

### Step 2: Review Extension Permissions

Ensure that your browser allows extensions to request the needed permissions:

- Access to tabs
- Network request monitoring (`webRequest`)
- Storage access

If your organization or system has restrictions, work with the administrator to allow these.

### Step 3: Disable Conflicting Extensions (Optional but Recommended)

Some extensions might interfere with uBO Scope’s ability to detect network requests. If possible, disable or temporarily uninstall content blockers or network-monitoring extensions while first installing and testing uBO Scope to avoid conflicts.


## 5. Summary of Requirements

| Requirement                  | Details                                            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Browser Version             | Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+           |
| Browser Permissions         | `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`               |
| Host Permissions            | Access to all URLs for monitoring (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`) |
| Network Access              | HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket connections monitored       |
| Environment Restrictions   | Extensions allowed, no blocking by firewalls/AV    |


## 6. Troubleshooting Compatibility

If you experience issues during installation or usage:

- Confirm your browser version and update if needed.
- Check that the extension has been granted all requested permissions.
- Verify that no other extensions or security software block network monitoring.
- For Firefox, ensure that you have not disabled `webRequest` permissions or restricted background services.


## 7. Next Steps

Once your browser environment meets these requirements, proceed to:

- [Installing uBO Scope on Your Browser](../installation-setup/installing-ubo-scope)
- [First-Time Configuration](../installation-setup/first-time-setup)
- Learn how to interpret connection data in [Your First Use: What to Look For](../using-validating/first-use-and-interpretation)

These guides will walk you through installation, setup, and initial usage to get the most out of uBO Scope.

<Tip>
Always keep your browser up to date. Using the latest browser versions guarantees better compatibility with extensions like uBO Scope which rely on recent APIs and Manifest V3 support.
</Tip>

<Warning>
uBO Scope's effectiveness depends on browser APIs and permissions. If you restrict these, you may not see complete or accurate network connection data.
