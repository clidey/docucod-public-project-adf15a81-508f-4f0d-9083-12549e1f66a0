## Step 4: Verify Installation

Confirm that uBO Scope is properly installed and active:

- The extension icon should appear in the toolbar prominently.
- On navigating to any website, the toolbar badge count should update to show the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted.

<Tip>
If the badge does not appear or updates unexpectedly, ensure the extension has the necessary permissions and that your browser is up to date.

## Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Pitfalls and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Extension Icon Missing">
- Check your browser’s extensions page to ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
- For Chrome, click the puzzle icon and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.
- For Firefox, open the Add-ons Manager and verify activation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Denied or Not Prompted">
- Some browsers require explicit permission grants. Check browser settings under Extensions > uBO Scope > Permissions.
- Ensure you allow access to all sites if prompted, otherwise uBO Scope cannot monitor network requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- Refresh open tabs or restart the browser to refresh network event monitoring.
- Verify the browser is up to date with support for `webRequest` API.
- Conflicting extensions (e.g., other network tools) can sometimes interfere with badge updates.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Additional Notes

- uBO Scope relies on browser `webRequest` APIs to listen to network events. Some restrictive environments or privacy settings might block these APIs.
- This extension reports third-party connection attempts independent of content blockers or DNS interference — functionality requires those APIs to be present.
