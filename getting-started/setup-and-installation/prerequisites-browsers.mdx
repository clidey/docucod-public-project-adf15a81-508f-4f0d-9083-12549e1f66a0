# System Requirements and Supported Browsers

Prepare for a smooth installation and operation of uBO Scope by understanding the essential system, browser, and permission requirements. This guide equips you with everything needed to ensure compatibility and a flawless user experience before adding the uBO Scope extension to your browser.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

uBO Scope runs as a browser extension and thus inherits the compatibility of supported browsers. Ensure your operating system supports the latest versions of one of these browsers:

- **Windows 10 or later**
- **macOS 11 Big Sur or later**
- **Linux distributions** with supported browsers installed

<u>**Note:**</u> There is no standalone desktop application; uBO Scope operates entirely within your browser.

## 2. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope supports Chromium-based browsers, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari with key version requirements:

| Browser        | Minimum Version         | Download Link / Store                                             |
| -------------- | -----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Google Chrome**, Microsoft Edge, and other Chromium flavors | Chrome 122+ (MV3 support) | [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions) |
| **Mozilla Firefox** (Desktop and Android) | Firefox 128+          | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |
| **Safari**        | Safari 18.5+            | [Safari Extensions Gallery](https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1466606777) |

<u>**Important:**</u> Legacy browsers or versions that do not support Manifest Version 3 (MV3) or the `webRequest` API with the necessary permissions are not compatible.

## 3. Required Extension Permissions

To fully observe all network connections and provide accurate insights, uBO Scope requests the following permissions:

- **`webRequest`**: Monitors all outgoing web requests to capture connection details.
- **`activeTab`**: Accesses information about the current browser tab.
- **`storage`**: Stores session and persistent data locally to maintain state.
- **Host permissions**: Covers all HTTP and HTTPS URLs (`http://*/*` and `https://*/*`) and WebSocket URLs (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) on Chromium and Firefox.

<u>**Note:**</u> Safari currently requests only HTTP and HTTPS host permissions and does not utilize WebSocket permissions due to platform limitations.

## 4. WebRequest API Limitations

The core functionality of uBO Scope depends on the browser’s **`webRequest` API**. Understanding its scope and limitations helps set accurate expectations:

- The API allows capturing details about initiated network requests including redirects, errors, and successful responses.
- Not all network requests will be reported if the browser blocks or manages them outside the API’s scope (e.g., requests made by non-browser components or some service workers).
- Browsers supporting MV3 may have some restrictions or filtering on `webRequest` handlers; ensure your browser version aligns with uBO Scope’s MV3 operation needs.

<u>**Consequence:**</u> Some third-party connections made outside the monitored scope (e.g., DNS-level blocking or native app connections) will not appear in uBO Scope.

## 5. Preparing Your Browser for uBO Scope Installation

To guarantee uBO Scope will function as intended, follow these preparation steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Browser Version">
Check your browser version to confirm minimum compatibility:

- On Chrome/Edge/Chromium: Go to `chrome://settings/help` or `edge://settings/help`.
- On Firefox: Go to `about:support` or `about:preferences`.
- On Safari: Use the Apple menu > About Safari.

Upgrade if necessary.
</Step>
<Step title="Grant Extension Permissions">
During installation, uBO Scope will prompt for permissions:

- Review and accept the permissions.
- If you have strict privacy extensions, verify that uBO Scope is allowed to operate.
</Step>
<Step title="Disable Conflicting Extensions (Optional)">
While uBO Scope is compatible with many content blockers, disabling other extensions that aggressively hook into network requests may reduce interference.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Summary of Manifest Permissions by Platform

| Platform    | Host Permissions                           | WebRequest Permissions | Minimum Browser Version |
| ----------- | -----------------------------------------| ---------------------- | -----------------------|
| Chromium   | `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` | Yes                    | 122+                   |
| Firefox    | `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` | Yes                    | 128+                   |
| Safari     | `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`               | Yes                    | 18.5+                  |

<Note>
Your browser’s compliance with Manifest Version 3 and full `webRequest` API support is critical for accurate data collection since uBO Scope leverages these APIs extensively.
</Note>

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Tips

- **Older browsers or unsupported versions will not load uBO Scope properly.** Always keep your browser up to date.
- **uBO Scope cannot monitor network requests made outside the browser’s `webRequest` API scope.** For example, native applications or DNS-level filters are invisible to uBO Scope.
- **WebSocket monitoring is only available on Chromium browsers and Firefox.** Safari does not support this due to its platform restrictions.
- **If the badge count does not update or shows no data, ensure uBO Scope has not been denied permissions or blocked by other extensions.**
