## Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### 1. Choose Your Browser Store

uBO Scope is officially available via each browser's trusted extension or add-on store:

| Browser        | Installation Link                                                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium (Chrome Store) | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Mozilla Firefox        | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)                       |

> Safari users must use the Safari Extensions Gallery or the appropriate Apple Extension installation method.

### 2. Navigate to the Store Page

Open your browser and visit the appropriate link above for your browser.

### 3. Install uBO Scope

On the extension page:

- Click the **Add to Browser** or **Install** button.
- Confirm any prompts the browser presents.

### 4. Review Permissions

During installation, your browser will request certain permissions:

- **Access to active tab:** Allows uBO Scope to monitor network requests on the sites you visit.
- **Storage:** Enables saving session data and settings locally.
- **WebRequest:** Necessary for intercepting and logging network connections.

<Tip>
These permissions are essential for uBO Scope’s core function: to transparently report all remote server connections made by your browser.
</Tip>

### 5. Confirm Installation

After installing, look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. The icon by default will be:

- A small badge that updates with the count of distinct connected third-party domains.

---

## Post-Installation Tips

- Click the toolbar icon to open the uBO Scope popup and begin monitoring network connections.
- If the icon does not appear, check your browser’s extension management page to ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
- Restart your browser after installation if you encounter unexpected issues.

<Warning>
The badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers successfully connected during browsing. Lower counts are generally better and indicate fewer third-party connections.
</Warning>
