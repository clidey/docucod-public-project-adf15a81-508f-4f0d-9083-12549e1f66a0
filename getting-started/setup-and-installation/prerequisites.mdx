# System Requirements & Supported Browsers

Understanding whether your environment meets the requirements for installing and running uBO Scope is essential to ensure smooth operation and accurate monitoring of your browsing sessions. This guide provides a clear overview of supported browsers, operating system prerequisites, and permission expectations so you can prepare your system for installation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to work seamlessly on major modern browsers with support for Manifest Version 3 extensions and the WebRequest API. Below are the officially supported browsers:

- **Chromium-based browsers**
  - Google Chrome (version 122.0 and above)
  - Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based)
  - Other Chromium variants supporting MV3

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Firefox 128.0 and above

- **Apple Safari**
  - Safari 18.5 and above

The extension leverages browser-specific APIs and permissions that are only available or stable in these versions and above.

<Info>
To check your browser version:

- Chrome/Edge: Go to `chrome://settings/help` or `edge://settings/help`.
- Firefox: Navigate to `about:support`.
- Safari: Use `Safari > About Safari` from the menu.
</Info>

## 2. Operating System Compatibility

Since uBO Scope is a browser extension, its compatibility largely depends on the browser itself. Supported browsers run on Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile OS versions where applicable:

- **Windows**: Windows 10 or later recommended for latest browser versions.
- **macOS/X**: macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later for Safari and other browsers.
- **Linux**: Various popular Linux distributions with modern browsers.
- **Mobile**: Limited support; focus is on desktop browsers.

<Note>
Mobile browsers generally have restrictions or lack support for extensive webRequest APIs, so uBO Scope functionality may be limited or unavailable on mobile platforms.
</Note>

## 3. Prerequisites and Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions to deliver its full capabilities:

- **WebRequest Permission**: To monitor all network requests and gather connection outcomes.
- **ActiveTab Permission**: To access data about the currently active tab, enabling per-tab network connection reports.
- **Storage Permission**: For storing session data persistently to maintain history and state across tabs.

These permissions are requested explicitly during extension installation and must be granted for uBO Scope to function correctly.

<Warning>
If you deny any of these permissions, uBO Scope will not be able to monitor connections accurately, and data presented in the popup will be incomplete or empty.
</Warning>

## 4. Network and Security Considerations

- The extension requires access to network request details across all HTTPS and HTTP origins (`*://*/*`) as well as WebSocket schemes to fully capture connection attempts.
- Your browser or system firewall should not block extension functionality or injection.

## 5. Summary of Requirements

| Category            | Details                                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Browsers            | Chrome >= 122, Firefox >=128, Safari >=18.5 |
| OS Platforms        | Windows 10+, macOS Catalina+, Linux distros |
| Permissions         | `webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`         |
| Network Access      | Full access to HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS URLs     |

## 6. Preparing for Installation

Before installing uBO Scope:

1. Verify your browser version meets the minimum requirements.
2. Ensure you can grant the necessary extension permissions.
3. Confirm no existing firewall or browser security tool will interfere with WebRequest API usage.
