# Initial Configuration

After installing uBO Scope, most users will find that **no further configuration is necessary**. This simplicity is by design — uBO Scope operates transparently and effectively straight out of the box, providing immediate visibility into your browser's network connections without any setup overhead.

---

## What to Expect Immediately After Installation

Upon installation, uBO Scope will automatically start monitoring your active tabs and display its reporting interface when you click its toolbar icon:

- **Toolbar Badge:** Displays the count of distinct third-party remote domains accessed by the current tab.
- **Popup Interface:** Breaking down network connection outcomes by domain status (allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked).

No user input or manual activation is needed for uBO Scope to begin working.

## Why No Configuration Is Needed

uBO Scope is architected to hook into browser network event listeners and maintain session data automatically:

- It uses browser APIs (`webRequest`, `storage`, `tabs`) and a Public Suffix List for domain parsing.
- The extension categorizes network requests in real time without user intervention.
- All data shown in the popup derives directly from the current tab’s network activity.

Configuring any settings is unnecessary because there are no user-adjustable parameters affecting data collection or presentation.

<Tip>
If you are looking to customize the extension behavior, note that uBO Scope currently offers a zero-config experience. The developer has chosen to keep it simple to focus on trustworthy and accurate connection reporting.

## Overview of How uBO Scope Works Out of the Box

1. When you navigate web pages, uBO Scope listens for network requests happening in your browser.
2. Requests are classified by outcome: **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked**.
3. Domains are parsed and grouped according to the Public Suffix List to accurately aggregate counts.
4. The badge on the toolbar icon dynamically updates to show the number of distinct connected third-party domains.
5. Clicking the icon opens a detailed pop-up panel summarizing the requests made by the current tab.

This entire flow requires no interaction—simply install and start browsing.

## What If You Don’t See Any Data?

- Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extension manager.
- Refresh your active tabs after the installation completes.
- Confirm required permissions (e.g., `webRequest`, `activeTab`) were granted during installation.

<Tip>
If you previously had uBO Scope installed with a different version, consider restarting your browser to reset session state.

## Advanced Notes for Filter List Maintainers and Technical Users

While no basic configuration is required, advanced users interested in the internal workings or contributing can explore:

- The background script (`js/background.js`) manages session data and request classification.
- The public suffix list (`assets/thirdparties/publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat`) is used for domain resolution.
- Communication between the background and popup uses serialized messages to update the UI.

You can examine and customize these if building specialized versions, but such action is outside the scope of typical usage.

## Summary

- uBO Scope requires **no initial configuration** after installation to start reporting connections.
- The extension works invisibly in the background, updating badge and popup data dynamically.
- If no data appears, verify installation status and browser permissions.

For most users, configuration is best left as-is to ensure accurate and reliable results with minimal effort.
