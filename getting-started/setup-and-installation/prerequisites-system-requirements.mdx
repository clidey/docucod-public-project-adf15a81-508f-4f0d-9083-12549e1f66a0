# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Ensure your setup meets the following requirements before installing and using uBO Scope. This preparation guarantees the extension functions correctly and provides accurate network request visibility.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed to run as a browser extension on major browsers that support the `webRequest` API with Manifest V3. The extension depends on system APIs for monitoring network requests.

| Browser       | Minimum Version          | Notes                                        |
|---------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Chromium      | 122.0 and above          | Requires minimum Chrome version 122.0 or newer |
| Firefox       | 128.0 and above          | Supports desktop and Android versions starting at Firefox 128 |
| Safari        | 18.5 and above           | Requires Safari version 18.5 or higher         |


> The version constraints ensure the browsers fully support necessary extension APIs including background service workers and advanced `webRequest` behaviors.

## 2. Permissions Required

uBO Scope depends on several key permissions granted during installation. These enable the extension to monitor network requests and manage its settings.

- **webRequest**: Crucial for intercepting and logging browser network requests across tabs.
- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to interact with the currently active browser tab to provide real-time data.
- **storage**: Needed to store session data and public suffix list persistently.

Additionally, uBO Scope requires **host permissions** to monitor network traffic:

- For Chromium and Firefox: 
  - `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`
- For Safari: 
  - `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`

These broad host permissions enable the extension to listen to all network requests made by the browser on various protocols.

---

## 3. Browser API Dependency

uBO Scope relies entirely on the browser's `webRequest` API to gather data about network connections:

- It listens for all outgoing HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket requests.
- Accurately captures outcomes such as allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked, redirects, and errors.
- Requires these requests to be visible to the browser's extension APIs to report correctly.

**Important:** Network requests made outside the reach of `webRequest` (e.g., some private network APIs, or native app requests) will not be captured by uBO Scope.

---

## 4. Operating System Compatibility

uBO Scope supports any desktop or mobile operating system compatible with the above browser versions. There are no additional OS-specific requirements.

---

## 5. Device and Network Requirements

- **Internet Access:** Needed to download the extension and fetch the Public Suffix List (cached internally for efficiency).
- **WebSocket Support:** For monitoring WebSocket connections (Firefox and Chromium browsers).

No special firewall or port configurations are required, but ensure that the browser can freely access the internet to allow uBO Scope to monitor connections.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Checks">
<Accordion title="Extension Does Not Appear After Installation">
- Verify that your browser version meets the minimum stated above.
- Confirm the extension has the necessary permissions (manage via the browser's extension settings).
- Check if any other security settings or content blockers prevent extension operation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Inaccurate or Missing Network Request Data">
- Ensure your browser supports `webRequest` API fully (refer to your browser's developer documentation).
- Confirm that no browser privacy settings are restricting extension access to webRequest events.
- Restart the browser to clear any runtime issues.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing WebSocket Monitoring on Safari">
- Safari does not currently fully support monitoring websocket connections via `webRequest`; this is expected behavior.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Always keep your browser updated to the latest version satisfying the minimum version requirements to ensure full compatibility and security.
</Tip>

## Summary

Meeting these prerequisites is essential for uBO Scope to deliver comprehensive, real-time visibility into all third-party network connections your browser attempts. Before proceeding to installation, verify your browser version, permissions, and platform compatibility.
