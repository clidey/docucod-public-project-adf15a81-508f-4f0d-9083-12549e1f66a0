# Prerequisites and System Requirements for uBO Scope

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure your environment meets the necessary prerequisites. This will guarantee a smooth installation and optimal performance of the extension, helping you fully leverage its capabilities to monitor third-party network connections.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope supports the latest web browsers that provide robust access to network request data through the `webRequest` API. Below are the supported browsers along with their strictly required minimum versions:

| Browser     | Minimum Version | Notes                                     |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Chromium    | 122.0+          | Supports standard webRequest API with WebExtension manifest v3.
| Firefox     | 128.0+          | Uses Gecko-specific WebExtension API capabilities.
| Safari      | 18.5+           | Requires Safari App Extensions with manifest v3 compatibility.

<u>**Important:** Using versions below these minimums will result in incomplete or no data reporting by uBO Scope.</u>

---

## 2. System Requirements

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension but depends on certain environmental factors:

- **Operating System:** Compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux, and supported platforms for the browsers listed above.
- **Memory:** Minimal overhead; typical browser memory requirements apply.
- **Disk Space:** Negligible extra space beyond the browser’s extension storage.

---

## 3. Network and Permissions Requirements

uBO Scope requires permission to monitor all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket (WS), and WebSocket Secure (WSS) network requests. This is essential to accurately report on remote server connections made by webpages.

- **Host Permissions:** 
  - Ability to observe requests to all web origins (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`).
  - WebSocket URL patterns (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) where supported.

- **Browser Permissions:**
  - `activeTab` to access the current tab’s network activity.
  - `storage` to maintain session data.
  - `webRequest` API permission to listen to network requests in real time.

<u>Note that these permissions are granted during installation and cannot be skipped without rendering uBO Scope non-functional.</u>

---

## 4. Limitations and Known Constraints

- **webRequest API Availability:** uBO Scope functions strictly by monitoring network traffic available through the browser’s webRequest API. If a browser platform restricts or limits this API, some data may be incomplete or unavailable.

- **Network Requests Outside WebRequest Scope:** Requests made outside the browser’s webRequest scope (e.g., some internal browser features or sandboxed network calls) are not reported.

- **Content Blocker Influence:** uBO Scope measures network activity regardless of other content blockers or DNS-level filtering, but the accuracy depends on the browser’s event reporting.

- **Platform-Specific Behavior:** 
  - Safari’s extension support begins at version 18.5 and requires manifest v3 compliance.
  - Firefox and Chromium handle WebSocket and HTTP requests similarly but have distinct manifest and extension packaging.

---

## 5. Verification Steps Before Installation

Follow these steps to confirm that your environment is ready:

1. **Check Browser Version:**

   - Open your browser’s 'About' section and verify the version meets or exceeds the minimum requirement.

2. **Review Extension Permissions:**

   - Ensure your browser allows installation of extensions with the required permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).

3. **Confirm Network Access Policy:**

   - If you are behind firewall or proxy settings, confirm they do not block standard HTTP/S or WebSocket traffic.

<Tip>
If your browser or platform does not meet these prerequisites, update to the latest version or switch to a supported browser to ensure full functionality.

| Browser  | Min Version | Manifest Version | Permissions Needed                            | Notes                            |
|----------|-------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Chromium | 122.0+      | MV3              | `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`         | Supports WebSocket monitoring    |
| Firefox  | 128.0+      | MV3              | `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`         | Supports WebSocket monitoring    |
| Safari   | 18.5+       | MV3 with Safari-specific config | `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest` | Requires Safari 18.5 minimum     |
