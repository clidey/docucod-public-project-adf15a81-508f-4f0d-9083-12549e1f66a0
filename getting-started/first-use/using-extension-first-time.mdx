# Launching the Extension for the First Time

Welcome to your first interaction with uBO Scope! This guide will walk you through how to access the uBO Scope popup interface immediately after installation, understand its core elements, and verify that it is functioning as expected. In just a few simple steps, you'll see real network connection data right in your browser's toolbar.

---

## 1. Accessing the uBO Scope Popup

Once uBO Scope is installed and active in your browser, the extension's icon appears in your browser's toolbar.

### Steps:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope toolbar icon** in your browser (it looks like the uBO Scope logo).

2. Click the icon once to open the popup interface.
   - The popup loads automatically and shows connection information related to the currently active tab.

3. If you do not see the icon:
   - On **Chrome or Chromium-based browsers**, click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions) and pin uBO Scope.
   - On **Firefox**, check if uBO Scope is enabled in `about:addons` and consider customizing the toolbar.
   - On **Safari**, enable the extension via Safari's Preferences under Extensions.

<Tip>
If the popup does not open by clicking the icon, try restarting your browser or verifying the installation process was completed successfully.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface

The popup is your window into all third-party remote network connections detected for the active browser tab.

Here is what you will see:

- **Header (`#tabHostname`)**: Shows the hostname and domain of the active tab's main frame.
- **Summary Section**: Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- **Connection Outcome Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains that allowed connections.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains that were stealth-blocked (requests redirected without user-visible blocking).
  - **Blocked**: Domains where connections were blocked.

Each section lists relevant domains along with how many requests were made to each.

### Example Layout

```plaintext
[example popup]

Hostname: example.
summary: domains connected: 5

not blocked
- cdn.example.com (3)
- analytics.example.net (1)

stealth-blocked
- tracker.stealthblock.org (2)

blocked
- ads.blockedserver.com (4)
```

<Tip>
The popup dynamically updates as you browse, showing real-time connection outcomes for the page.

## 3. Confirming Successful Installation and Operation

To be confident that uBO Scope is working:

### Step 1: Open any webpage (e.g., https://example.com).

### Step 2: Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.

### Step 3: Confirm you see:
- The page’s hostname displaying correctly at the top.
- A number in 'domains connected' indicating detected third-party connections.
- Lists populated with domain names and their request counts.

If you see "NO DATA" and the domains count remains "?":
- Refresh the page and open the popup again.
- Check if uBO Scope has needed permissions and is enabled (refer to the [Verifying Extension Permissions](https://your-docs.com/getting-started/installation-setup/setup-permissions) guide).

If the badge (number on the toolbar icon) updates when loading new pages, this is another strong indicator the extension operates correctly.

<Check>
You can validate expected behavior by:
- Opening multiple tabs to different sites to see the badge number update.
- Comparing with other network monitoring tools if desired.
</Check>

## 4. Tips for First-Time Use

- **Refresh the active tab** after installing uBO Scope to ensure network data collection starts.
- The extension captures connection data in real-time; opening the popup too early may show limited information.
- The toolbar badge count reflects distinct third-party domains contacted by the page, helping you understand connection diversity.

<Tip>
Remember, a lower badge count typically means fewer third parties contacted, which may be desirable for privacy.
</Tip>
