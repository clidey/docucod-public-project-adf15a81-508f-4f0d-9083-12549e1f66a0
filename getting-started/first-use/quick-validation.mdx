# Quick Validation & Understanding Results

This guide will help you verify that uBO Scope is correctly reporting network connections for the active browser tab. You'll learn how to interpret the toolbar badge count, understand the domain connection summaries shown in the popup interface, and spot common errors or unexpected results.

---

## 1. Validate uBO Scope is Active and Tracking

Before interpreting results, ensure uBO Scope is properly installed, enabled, and has permissions:

- Confirm installation via your browser extension management page. See the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/setup-overview/installation) for details.
- Check that the uBO Scope icon appears in your toolbar.
- Make sure uBO Scope has the needed permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`, and host permissions for all URLs) from the installation requirements.

<Tip>
If the extension icon or badge does not appear, verify your browser version meets minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
</Tip>

---

## 2. Understand the Toolbar Badge Count

The badge on the extension's toolbar icon reports the **number of distinct third-party remote domains** contacted by the current tab.

- **What is counted?**
  - Each unique third-party domain from which the browser fetched resources (images, scripts, etc.) or attempted connections.
  - The count reflects only distinct domains, **not individual requests**.
  - Lower counts generally mean fewer third-party connections, which is often better for privacy.

- **Common Misconception:** The badge does **not** count blocked requests but rather allowed connections.

<Info>
If the badge is empty (no number), it means no third-party connections were detected for the current tab.
</Info>

## 3. Opening and Navigating the Popup Interface

The popup UI provides a detailed breakdown of network requests by their outcome:

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
- The top header shows the **main hostname** of the current page.
- The **summary section** displays the total count of distinct domains connected.
- Below the summary are three outcome sections:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains where connections succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains blocked stealthily by content blockers (these requests were triggered but not visible to the page).
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were failed or blocked outright.

Each domain entry shows the domain name and a badge of the number of connections to it.

---

## 4. Interpreting Domain Connection Lists

### Not Blocked

These are third-party domains from which the browser successfully fetched resources or established connections. Expect to see legitimate services here, such as content delivery networks or analytics providers.

### Stealth-Blocked

Requests listed here were deliberately blocked by content blockers in a stealthy way. This means although the request was initiated, it was not allowed through, and the webpage cannot detect this blocking behavior.

### Blocked

These domains had connection attempts that failed due to blocking or network errors. This can indicate outright blocks by content blockers or network issues.

<Tip>
Recognize that the same domain might appear in multiple categories if different types of requests have different outcomes.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Spotting Common Issues or Unexpected Results

### No Data or Empty Summary

- Verify the active tab is a webpage (not a browser internal page).
- Reload the tab and wait a few seconds for uBO Scope to capture network activity.

### Badge Count Does Not Change

- Ensure the page has third-party content.
- Verify other content blockers or privacy settings are not interfering with uBO Scope.

### Unexpected Domains Listed

- Some domains may belong to CDNs, legitimate analytic services, or infrastructure and not necessarily indicate tracking.
- Use the domain names to research and verify if they are expected or suspicious.

### Connections Not Reported

- If connections are invisibly blocked outside of the browser's `webRequest` API scope (e.g., by DNS filtering), they might not appear.

<Warning>
uBO Scope relies on browser APIs (`webRequest`) to observe requests. Some newer browser features or mechanisms might bypass these APIs, limiting visibility.
</Warning>

## 6. Step-by-Step Validation Example

Follow this workflow to confirm uBO Scope's correct operation:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Well-Known Website">
Navigate to a popular website with moderate third-party content, such as https://example.com.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Toolbar Badge">
Observe the badge number on the uBO Scope icon. It should show a numeric count (e.g., 5) representing connected third-party domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the toolbar icon to open the popup and view the detailed domain lists.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Domain Sections">
Look at the Not Blocked, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked domains sections. Verify domains look reasonable.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload the Page">
Refresh the page and confirm the badge updates and domain lists refresh accordingly.
</Step>
<Step title="Troubleshoot if Needed">
If the counts don't appear or look incorrect, see the Troubleshooting section for guidance.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope Results">
<Accordion title="No Badge or Popup Data Appears">
- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled in your browser.
- Reload the tab to initiate data capture.
- Check browser version compatibility.
- Disable conflicting extensions temporarily.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Number Stays Zero or Does Not Update">
- Visit a site known to load third-party content.
- Clear browser cache and reload.
- Ensure uBO Scope has all necessary permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains Are Unexpected or Suspicious">
- Use online tools to look up domains.
- Remember legitimate services often use multiple domains.
- Review your content blocker settings for additional blocking layers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth-Blocked Section Is Empty Despite Using Content Blockers">
- Some stealth blocking may not be detectable if the other blockers use network-level DNS filtering or proxying.
- uBO Scope reports events based on browser webRequest API visibility.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Next Steps

- After verifying that uBO Scope is tracking network requests correctly, explore [Interpreting the Popup Interface](/guides/getting-started/first-look-interpreting-the-popup) for deeper understanding.
- Learn how to audit third-party connections in detail: [Auditing Third-Party Connections](/guides/core-workflows/auditing-third-party-connections).
- Investigate how uBO Scope integrates with other content blockers: [Works with Your Current Content Blockers](/overview/use-cases-features/integration-with-blockers).
- If you encounter technical issues or errors, consult the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-use/troubleshooting).

## Summary of What You See in the Popup

```plaintext
+ Tab Hostname (main site domain)
+ Total number of third-party connected domains
+ Three sections:
   - not blocked (allowed connections)
   - stealth-blocked (connections blocked stealthily)
   - blocked (connections blocked outright)

Each domain lists the number of times it was contacted or connection attempted.
```

<Tip>
Use the summary and domain lists to quickly assess the privacy footprint of the current webpage.
