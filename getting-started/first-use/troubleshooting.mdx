# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide helps you diagnose and resolve the most frequent issues encountered during the installation or initial use of uBO Scope. Whether you notice a missing badge count on the toolbar icon, no statistics shown in the popup, or encounter permission errors, these practical steps will guide you to a swift resolution so you can trust and maximize the extension’s visibility into your browser's remote server connections.

---

## 1. Understanding Key Indicators of Proper Setup

Before diving into troubleshooting, first understand the key elements that confirm uBO Scope is working as expected:

- **Toolbar Badge Count**: The small number badge on the uBO Scope extension icon represents the number of distinct third-party domains with allowed network connections for the active tab.
- **Popup Statistics**: When clicking the toolbar icon, the popup window should display domains categorized by connection status: “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked.”
- **Permissions**: The extension requires permissions for `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` to function properly.

If any of these are not visible or updating, follow the steps below.

## 2. Troubleshooting Missing or Incorrect Badge Count

If the toolbar badge is missing or not updating:

### Step 1: Confirm Extension is Enabled

- Go to your browser's extensions page.
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and not disabled or in a paused state.

### Step 2: Verify Required Permissions

- uBO Scope requests the following permissions on install: `webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`, and host access (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
- Check in your browser’s extension permissions page that these permissions are granted.

<Tip>
Without the `webRequest` permission, uBO Scope cannot observe network requests, and the badge count will remain empty.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Check Host Permissions

- The extension must have permission to access the URLs you visit.
- For certain browsers or versions, explicit host access may be required.
- If browsing an internal or local URL, uBO Scope may not have permissions to monitor requests.

### Step 4: Refresh the Tab

- Sometimes badge updates may lag or not refresh.
- Reload the web page in the active tab to trigger fresh data collection.

### Step 5: Restart the Browser

- If issues persist, close and reopen your browser to reset extension service workers.

## 3. Troubleshooting No Stats in the Popup Window

If the popup shows “NO DATA” or suspiciously low counts:

### Step 1: Ensure Active Tab is a Webpage

- uBO Scope collects data per browser tab.
- If the active tab does not have network activity (e.g., about:blank, internal browser pages), no statistics will be available.

### Step 2: Wait a Moment

- Network request processing is asynchronous.
- After tab load, it may take a moment for the extension to process requests and update the popup.

<Tip>
Check multiple visited pages and see if statistics update for pages with network activity.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Confirm uBO Scope Is Not Blocked by Content Policies

- Verify that your browser or another security extension is not preventing uBO Scope from running.
- Some privacy/browser setups or restrictive content blockers may interfere with extension APIs.

### Step 4: Check for Console Errors

- Open the extension’s popup console (right-click the popup, Inspect).
- Look for error messages related to communication failures or permission denials.

### Step 5: Reinstall the Extension

- As a last resort, uninstall and reinstall uBO Scope from the official store to resolve corrupted installs.

## 4. Diagnosing Permission Errors

Permission errors can block core features.

### Step 1: Review Browser Version Compatibility

- uBO Scope requires recent browser versions:
  - Chromium 122 or later
  - Firefox 128 or later
  - Safari 18.5 or later

Outdated browsers may fail to grant requested permissions.

### Step 2: Verify Granted Permissions

- Check that uBO Scope has:
  - `webRequest`
  - `activeTab`
  - `storage`
  - Host permissions for HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs

### Step 3: Adjust Manifest Permissions (Developers Only)

- If building or sideloading, ensure your manifest correctly specifies permissions identical to official releases.

### Step 4: Browser-Specific Permission Quirks

- On Firefox and Safari, confirm that extension permission prompts were accepted.
- On Chromium browsers, inspect possible policy restrictions or security settings.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Using incognito mode without enabling uBO Scope**: The extension must be manually enabled to run in private windows.
- **Inspecting internal browser tabs or extension pages**: uBO Scope does not monitor these.
- **Expecting real-time updates immediately after installation or browser start**: The extension loads required data such as the Public Suffix List and session information asynchronously.

---

## 6. Quick Checks and Verification Commands

### Check Installed Extension Version & Permissions

- Open your browser’s extensions page.
- Find uBO Scope and review permissions and version.

### Reload Page and Observe Badge

- Navigate to a network-active page.
- Wait 5–10 seconds for the badge to update.
- Click the toolbar icon and verify if domain stats populate.

### Inspect Popup Console for Errors (Advanced)

- Right-click the extension popup, choose “Inspect”.
- Check for any runtime errors or warnings.

## 7. Getting Help and Reporting Issues

- If troubleshooting does not resolve your issue, visit the [uBO-Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) to report bugs or seek advice.
- Provide details about your browser version, OS, error messages, and steps to reproduce.

---

By following this structured approach, you will quickly identify and fix common setup issues, enabling you to rely on uBO Scope’s robust network connection visibility and make insightful privacy decisions.
