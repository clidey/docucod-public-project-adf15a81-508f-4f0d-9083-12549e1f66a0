# Launching the Extension & Basic Configuration

Welcome to the first hands-on experience with **uBO Scope**. This guide walks you through launching the extension popup, understanding the permissions that may be requested, recognizing toolbar icon and badge behavior, and navigating the initial user interface so you can gain immediate confidence using the tool.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

uBO Scope is designed to provide live, tab-specific insights into all third-party remote server connections your browser attempts. To access this information:

1. Locate the **uBO Scope extension icon** in your browser's toolbar. It appears as the extension's logo.
2. Click the icon to open the **popup panel**.

> The popup interface will automatically load the current active tab's connection data for your immediate review.

### What if you don't see the icon?
- In some browsers, if the icon is not visible, check the extensions overflow menu (usually a puzzle-piece icon).
- Pin uBO Scope to your toolbar for quick access.

<Note>
If you just installed uBO Scope, you may be prompted for permissions on first launch. See the next section for details.
</Note>

---

## 2. Understanding Permissions Prompts

On first use, uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions to function correctly. These include:

- **ActiveTab**: To read data from the active tab belonging to the current window.
- **webRequest**: To monitor network requests made during browsing.
- **Storage**: To save session data such as connection records.
- **Host Permissions**: To observe network requests to HTTP and HTTPS URLs.

When prompted:

- Review the permission request dialog from your browser.
- Approve the permissions to enable full extension functionality.

<Tip>
Permissions are necessary to ensure uBO Scope accurately reports network connections regardless of other blockers or DNS filtering in place.
</Tip>

## 3. Toolbar Icon and Badge Behavior

Once installed and granted permissions, the uBO Scope icon on your toolbar serves as a live indicator:

- **Badge Count**: Shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected to by the active tab.
  - A **lower badge count** typically indicates fewer third-party connections, which is generally preferable for privacy.
  - The badge dynamically updates as you navigate through different tabs or reload pages.

- **Icon Appearance**: Reflects the extension branding and serves as your entry point into the popup interface.

<Warning>
A blank badge or absence of a number means no third-party domains were detected for the active tab yet.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Initial Popup Interface Walkthrough

The uBO Scope popup is structured intuitively to display a clear summary followed by categorized domain lists:

### Key Components

- **Tab Hostname Display (Header)**
  - Shows the hostname of the current tab.
  - If the hostname differs from the domain, it separates the subdomain portion for clarity.

- **Summary Section**
  - Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains connected by the active tab.

- **Outcome Sections**
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains whose requests were allowed and succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains with requests that were redirected stealthily, typically by other blockers.
  - **Blocked**: Domains whose requests were blocked outright by content blockers.

Each section dynamically lists connected domains alongside a badge count of individual connections.

### Using the Interface

1. **Observe the domain lists and counts** to understand network connections for the active tab.
2. **Scroll or resize the popup** if the data exceeds visible space (popup resizing may be supported depending on browser).
3. **Reload the active tab and reopen the popup** to refresh the data view.

<Tip>
The popup interface only shows data for the active tab, giving you tab-specific precision for your network connection transparency.
</Tip>

## 5. Quick Validation Example

Try the following steps to confirm the extension is working as expected:

1. Open a new tab and navigate to a popular website (e.g., https://example.com).
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon.
3. Check the popup header to verify the tab hostname is displayed.
4. Look at the badge count and domain lists. You should see several third-party remote servers listed under the categories accordingly.
5. Switch to another tab or reload the page and observe changes in badge count and popup details.

<Check>
Successfully seeing domain names with connection counts means the extension is actively monitoring and collecting network request data.
</Check>

## 6. Common Questions and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Tips for First-Time Users">
<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty lists">
- Make sure you have granted all required permissions.
- Refresh the active tab after installing the extension.
- Confirm the extension is enabled in your browser's extensions/settings panel.
- Try opening a website that performs network requests (some pages may be too lightweight).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count doesn't update as expected">
- The badge updates based on network request lifecycle; try reloading the page.
- If multiple blockers are installed, they may affect visibility; uBO Scope reports what the browser API receives.
- Check for browser updates or extension conflicts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension asks for permissions repeatedly">
- This can happen if permissions are revoked or if using private/incognito mode without enabling the extension.
- Confirm extension permissions in your browser's settings.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
