# Quick Validation & Next Steps

Welcome to the final step of your initial uBO Scope setup journey. This page guides you in quickly validating that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browser's network connections using a real website. It also offers practical tips for exploring the extension’s features further and recommended best practices to maximize your privacy insights.

---

## 1. Quick Validation with a Sample Site

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
- You should see the popup panel showing information related to the currently active tab.

### Step 2: Visit a Popular Website

- Navigate to a well-known site like https://www.example.com or your favorite high-traffic site.
- Refresh or load the page fully.
- Click the uBO Scope icon again to open the popup.

### Step 3: Confirm Network Activity Captured

In the popup panel, check for the following:

- **Hostname and Domain Displayed:** The header should show the active tab's hostname and domain in a human-readable format.
- **Domain Counts:** Under “domains connected,” a non-zero number indicates uBO Scope detected third-party domains your browser connected to.
- **Categorized Domains:** You will see lists of domains categorized by their connection outcome:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains your browser successfully contacted.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were redirected or stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where the connection was explicitly blocked.

<Tip>
If the popup shows “NO DATA” or no domains, try reloading the page or visiting another site to ensure uBO Scope is collecting data. Check the troubleshooting guide if problems persist.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Observe the Toolbar Badge Count

- The toolbar icon badge shows the distinct count of third-party domains successfully connected.
- A number here lets you know the extension is actively tracking network requests.

<Check>
Seeing a non-empty badge count after loading a common website is your first success indicator that uBO Scope is set up correctly.
</Check>

## 2. Exploring uBO Scope Features Further

### Understanding the Popup Panel

- Domains are grouped by how the browser handled the connections.
- The count next to each domain shows how many network requests were observed.
- Hover or inspect to get more context on network activity (future updates will expand details).

### Browse Different Websites

- Test various sites to see how domain connection profiles change.
- Compare sites you trust with less familiar ones to gain insight into third-party activity.

### Use Cases

- Verify the effectiveness of your content blockers by comparing allowed vs blocked domains.
- Identify suspicious or unexpected third-party connections.

## 3. Recommended Best Practices

### Keep uBO Scope Updated

- Although updates will be infrequent, periodically check your extension version and update it when necessary.

### Pair with Content Blockers Thoughtfully

- uBO Scope works independently and compliments content blockers to provide visibility, not blocking.
- Use insights from uBO Scope to adjust your content blocker filters if needed.

### Learn Core Concepts

- Refer to the [Core Concepts & Terminology](./core-concepts-terminology) page to understand how outcomes and domain classifications are determined.

### Troubleshooting

- If you notice no network data:
  - Confirm the extension is enabled.
  - Verify browser permissions include access to relevant sites.
  - Reload tabs and restart your browser if necessary.
  - Check for conflicts with other extensions.

Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](./troubleshooting-setup) guide for detailed help.
