# Your First Use: Understanding Connections

Welcome to your first real interaction with uBO Scope. This guide walks you through opening a website, activating the uBO Scope popup, and reading the connection data presented. You will learn what the badge count represents and how to interpret the detailed domain listings, empowering you to immediately gain insight into your browser’s third-party network activity.

---

## What to Expect When Opening the Popup

After installing uBO Scope and navigating to any website, click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar. This action opens the popup panel, where you'll see a snapshot of network connections for the currently active tab.

The popup is organized into three main sections representing the outcomes of network requests:

- **Not blocked:** Domains to which your browser connected successfully.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains the browser attempted to connect to but were quietly redirected or filtered by stealth mechanisms.
- **Blocked:** Domains for which network requests failed or were explicitly blocked.

At the top, uBO Scope displays the combined hostname of the active tab and a summary showing how many distinct domains were connected.

<Tip>
The badge number over the extension icon always counts distinct third-party domains with successful connections (allowed). A lower number often indicates fewer third-party connections, which is generally better for privacy.

## Step-by-Step: Viewing Your First Connection Data

### Step 1: Open a Website

Navigate to any public website you want to inspect. For maximum insight, pick a site you frequently visit or one known to load resources from multiple external servers.

### Step 2: Click the uBO Scope Icon

Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar and click it. The popup panel appears, showing the domains associated with the currently active tab.

### Step 3: Understand the Hostname Display

At the top of the popup you will see two pieces:

- The **full hostname** of the current webpage (e.g., `subdomain.example.com`).
- The **base domain** extracted using the Public Suffix List (e.g., `example.com`).

If the full hostname and base domain differ, they are displayed distinctly so you can easily identify subdomains.

### Step 4: Review Domains by Outcome

Each outcome category (not blocked, stealth-blocked, blocked) lists domains connected or attempted, along with counts representing the number of requests for each domain.

- Domains are presented in Unicode to improve readability (e.g., for internationalized domains).
- Counts indicate how many requests involved the domain in the selected category.

### Step 5: Check the Total Distinct Domains Summary

Below the hostname, a summary line shows the total number of distinct domains your browser connected to during the tab session. This number corresponds exactly to the badge number on the extension icon.

## What the Badge Number Means

The badge number on the uBO Scope icon dynamically reflects the number of **unique third-party remote domains** that served content to the webpage you are currently viewing.

This count excludes first-party connections (same domain as the active tab) and counts only domains where a network request was allowed (not blocked or stealth-blocked).

<Note>
A high badge count is not inherently bad but indicates many third-party connections. Common legitimate third parties are content delivery networks (CDNs) or analytics providers. Understanding this helps you distinguish privacy-respecting sites from those with extensive tracking or ad infrastructure.
</Note>

## Example Scenario

Imagine you visit https://news.example.com and open the uBO Scope popup:

- The hostname displayed is `news.example.com` and the domain is `example.com`.
- The **not blocked** section lists domains like `cdn.example.com` and `analytics.tracker.com`, showing how many requests were successfully connected.
- The **stealth-blocked** section might include domains your content blocker tried hiding silently.
- The **blocked** section lists domains for which requests were successfully blocked.
- The summary says `domains connected: 4`, and the toolbar badge shows "4".

You now immediately see exactly which third parties your browser talked to, categorized by connection outcome.

## Tips for Interpreting Connection Data

- **Domain vs Hostname:** Remember, domains group multiple hostnames under a common base using the Public Suffix List, so you get a consolidated view of third parties.
- **Unicode Conversion:** Domains with international characters are converted to Unicode for clarity.
- **Counts:** A large count for a domain means many requests were made—indicating heavier resource use or tracking.

## Troubleshooting Common Initial Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Asked Questions">
<Accordion title="Why does the popup show NO DATA?">
Make sure you have a tab open with a page loaded that performs network requests. If no data is available, the popup shows "NO DATA". Refresh the page or switch tabs and try again.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is the badge count zero even on busy sites?">
The badge count shows unique connected domains. If all requests are blocked by your content blocker or DNS filters before networking occurs, the count can be zero.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I see all connections made by the browser?">
uBO Scope only shows connections related to the active tab. Background connections or browser-internal requests are not counted.
</Accordion>
