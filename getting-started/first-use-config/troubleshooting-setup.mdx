## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve frequent problems encountered during the installation or initial use of uBO Scope. Whether your extension's badge fails to appear, the popup shows no connection data, or you suspect permissions are missing, the instructions here will get you back on track.

---

### 1. Extension Icon or Badge Not Showing

If you cannot see the uBO Scope icon or its badge on your browser toolbar:

- **Verify Installation:** Confirm that uBO Scope is installed correctly from your browser's extensions page.
- **Check Toolbar Visibility:** Some browsers hide extension icons by default. Open your browserâ€™s extension or toolbar customization menu and ensure uBO Scope is pinned or visible.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Ensure you are using a supported browser and version:
  - Chrome 122 or newer
  - Firefox 128 or newer
  - Safari 18.5 or newer

---

### 2. Badge Does Not Update or Shows No Count

The badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected. If it remains empty or static:

- **Permissions:** uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor web requests. Verify the extension has the following permissions:
  - `webRequest`
  - `activeTab`
  - `storage`
- **Host Permissions:** Confirm that host permissions for the URLs you visit are granted (e.g., `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`). Without these, network events won't be captured.
- **Page Reload:** The badge updates after network activity; try reloading the current page to trigger updates.
- **Browser Restrictions:** Some browsers or privacy settings may limit extensions' access to webRequest APIs. Refer to your browser's documentation if you suspect these restrictions.

---

### 3. Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Empty Lists

When opening the uBO Scope popup, if you see 'NO DATA' or no domains listed:

- **Active Tab Check:** uBO Scope gathers data per active tab. Ensure you have an active tab loaded with network activity.
- **Wait a Moment:** Data collection may have a slight delay after page load. Wait a few seconds and open the popup again.
- **Reload the Tab:** Reload the tab to restart network monitoring and data collection.
- **Check for Private Browsing Mode:** Some browsers restrict extension activity in private/incognito windows unless explicitly allowed.

---

### 4. Extension Not Responding or Missing Features

If uBO Scope appears non-responsive:

- **Disable Other Extensions:** Conflicts with other extensions that heavily manipulate network requests can interfere. Temporarily disable other extensions and test.
- **Restart Browser:** A simple browser restart can resolve many transient issues.
- **Update Extension:** Make sure you have the latest version of uBO Scope installed from official sources.

---

### 5. Network Requests Not Captured Fully

If some network requests or connections are not shown:

- **WebRequest API Limitations:** uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API. Requests initiated outside this scope (e.g., some DNS-resolved or OS-level requests) cannot be observed.
- **Check Content Security Policies:** Some browsers or sites implement strict CSPs or permissions that might limit webRequest visibility.

---

### Quick Fix Checklist

1. Confirm extension is installed and enabled.
2. Check browser compatibility and version requirements.
3. Verify extension permissions and host permissions.
4. Reload tabs after installing or enabling the extension.
5. Test on a normal browsing window, not incognito/private, unless enabled.
6. Restart the browser if unexpected behavior persists.
7. Disable conflicting extensions as a troubleshooting step.
