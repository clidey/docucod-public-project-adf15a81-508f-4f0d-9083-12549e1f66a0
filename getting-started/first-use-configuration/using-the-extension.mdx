# Using uBO Scope for the First Time

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with uBO Scope! This guide will walk you through opening a website, checking the extension's toolbar badge, and inspecting the detailed popup interface. By the end, you'll understand how to interpret the number of unique third-party domains the extension tracks and what a successful operation looks like.

## 1. Open a Website and Observe the Toolbar Badge

uBO Scope works by monitoring the network connections your browser makes whenever you load web pages.

### Steps:

1. **Open your preferred browser** where uBO Scope is installed and enabled (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
2. **Navigate to any website** of your choice by entering the URL in the address bar and pressing Enter.
3. After the page loads, look at the **uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar**.

### What to Expect:
- The toolbar icon will display a **badge number**.
- This number represents the **count of distinct third-party domains** that your current page attempted or successfully connected to.

<Tip>
A lower badge number means fewer third-party connections, which often indicates a more privacy-friendly browsing experience.
</Tip>

### Verify:
- The badge should appear quickly after the page starts loading.
- If no badge appears, it might mean no third-party connections were made or the extension is not properly activated for this tab.

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface

The popup gives a detailed breakdown of all connections seen, categorized by their outcome.

### Steps:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open its popup window.
2. Wait a moment while the data loads and the popup updates.

### Popup Sections Explained:
- **domains connected:** Displays the total count of unique third-party domains that made connections.
- **not blocked:** Lists domains whose connections were successfully made without being blocked.
- **stealth-blocked:** Lists domains whose connections were stealth-blocked (requests that were redirected or blocked invisibly by a content blocker).
- **blocked:** Lists domains whose connections were explicitly blocked.

Each domain entry shows a count indicating how many network requests were observed for that domain.

<Tip>
Hovering over or clicking domain entries in future versions might provide even deeper insights into traffic and request details.
</Tip>

## 3. Interpreting the Badge and Popup Information

Understanding what the numbers and categories mean is key to unlocking uBO Scope's value.

- **Badge Count:** Reflects the number of distinct third-party domains connected *not blocked* — essentially, the actual external servers your browser talked with successfully.
- **Not Blocked:** These are the domains that delivered resources to your page.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** These connections were intercepted or redirected, meaning the requests existed but were muted by blockers.
- **Blocked:** Requests that were outright prevented from connecting.

<Tip>
Remember that not all third-party connections are harmful; legitimate services like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are often necessary for modern sites.
</Tip>

## 4. What Does Success Look Like?

After your first use, confirm the following to ensure uBO Scope works correctly:

- The **toolbar badge updates** in response to loading different websites.
- The **popup displays current, accurate domain counts** corresponding to your browsing.
- Domains appear categorized clearly under not blocked, stealth, and blocked sections.
- No persistent errors or blank popups occur.

<Check>
If any of these success criteria aren't met, verify your installation, permissions, and try refreshing your tab or restarting your browser.
</Check>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common First-Use Issues

- **No badge number appears:**
  - Confirm the extension is enabled for the active tab.
  - Try refreshing the webpage.
  - Ensure your browser supports `webRequest` API for tracking (see prerequisites documentation).

- **Popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty lists:**
  - Wait a few seconds and retry; loading data might take time.
  - Reload the page to trigger new network requests.

- **Badge number seems stuck or not updating:**
  - Close the tab and open a new website.
  - Restart the browser if necessary.

For detailed permission setup and troubleshooting, refer to the [First-Time Setup & Permissions](./first-time-setup-permissions) guide.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup title="FAQs">
<Accordion title="Why don't some sites show any domains in the popup?">
Some websites make very few or no third-party requests or use methods that bypass the webRequest API, so uBO Scope won’t detect connections. Refreshing or testing another site usually solves this.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if the badge number is zero but I know there are third-party connections?">
Possible reasons include permissions not granted fully or the browser blocking uBO Scope from monitoring requests. Double-check permissions and browser compatibility.
