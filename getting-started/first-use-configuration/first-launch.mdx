# First Launch and Extension Activation

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide will help you launch the extension for the first time, find its toolbar icon in your browser, and verify that it is properly enabled and actively monitoring your browsing sessions.

uBO Scope is designed to transparently report all remote server connections initiated by your browser tabs. To benefit fully from its features, ensure the extension is installed and enabled correctly.

---

## 1. Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

After installing uBO Scope from your browser's official extension store, you need to find its toolbar icon to begin using the extension.

### For Chromium-based Browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)

1. Look at the browser toolbar near the address bar.
2. Find the uBO Scope icon, which resembles a shield with a badge showing a count of distinct allowed third-party connections.
3. If you don't see the icon immediately, click the puzzle-piece icon (Extensions) and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar:
   - Click the puzzle icon.
   - Find 'uBO Scope' in the list.
   - Click the pin icon next to it to make it visible on the toolbar.

### For Firefox

1. Check the toolbar next to the address bar for the uBO Scope icon labeled 'uBO Scope' on hover.
2. If not visible, click the "overflow" arrow (>>) on the toolbar and drag the uBO Scope icon to a visible location.

### For Safari

1. In Safari’s toolbar, look for the uBO Scope icon.
2. If missing, enable the extension via Safari Preferences:
   - Go to `Safari > Settings > Extensions`.
   - Ensure the checkbox for uBO Scope is checked.

<Note>
The uBO Scope icon badge indicates the number of distinct third-party domains your browser tab has connected to. Fewer counts generally mean fewer third-party connections.
</Note>

## 2. Confirm Extension Activation

Ensuring the extension is enabled and active in your browser is crucial to get accurate real-time monitoring.

### How to Check Extension Status

- **Chrome and Chromium browsers:**
  1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in your browser.
  2. Locate uBO Scope and confirm the toggle switch is in the "on" position.

- **Firefox:**
  1. Open `about:addons`.
  2. Under Extensions, find uBO Scope and verify it is enabled.

- **Safari:**
  1. Open Safari Preferences > Extensions.
  2. Make sure uBO Scope is checked and enabled.

<Warning>
If the extension is disabled, it will not monitor network requests, and the badge count will not update, rendering uBO Scope ineffective.
</Warning>

## 3. Understanding uBO Scope's Monitoring Activity

Once the extension is activated, it immediately begins listening to network events on your active tabs, reporting the third-party servers contacted.

### How Monitoring Reflects in the Toolbar Icon

- The toolbar icon badge shows the **number of distinct allowed third-party domains** with connections during your current tab session.
- The count updates dynamically as you browse different websites.

### Accessing the Popup Panel

Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel. This interface provides detailed insights:

- **Tab Hostname Display:** Shows your current tab's hostname and domain.
- **Connection Summary:** Number of domains connected to.
- **Lists of Domains:** Divided into `Not Blocked`, `Stealth-Blocked`, and `Blocked` categories.

### Real Scenario

For example, while visiting a news website:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon.
2. View the number next to the icon showing distinct third-party domains.
3. Use the popup panel to see which domains were contacted and their status.

<Info>
You can use uBO Scope alongside your usual content blockers; it independently monitors network connections using browser APIs, providing an accurate third-party connection count regardless of blocker settings.

## 4. Troubleshooting First Launch Issues

### Extension Icon Missing

- Make sure the extension installation completed successfully.
- Check your browser’s extension management page to confirm uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- If hidden, pin or move the icon to the visible toolbar area.

### Badge Count Not Updating

- Ensure the extension is enabled.
- Refresh the active tabs or restart the browser.
- Check for browser version compatibility (see installation prerequisites).

### Browser Compatibility

- uBO Scope supports Chromium browsers with minimum version 122, Firefox 128, and Safari 18.5 or later.
- Verify your browser version meets these requirements.

## 5. Additional Tips for Seamless First Use

- **Refresh Tabs:** After installation and activation, reload any open tabs to allow uBO Scope to start monitoring.
- **Permissions:** The extension requires network monitoring permissions (activeTab, webRequest) which should be granted during installation.
- **Badge Count Interpretation:** A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, usually better for privacy.

## 6. Next Steps

Now that uBO Scope is launched and monitoring, explore the popup UI to understand your tab’s connection profile.
