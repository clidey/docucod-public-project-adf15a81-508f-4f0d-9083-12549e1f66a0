# Understanding the UI

Welcome to the heart of uBO Scope’s user experience: the popup interface. This page will guide you in interpreting the information presented when you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon. You'll learn how to read the domain connection listings, understand the badge count meaning, distinguish allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains, and uncover what these insights mean for your browsing privacy.

---

## 1. Overview of the Popup Interface

When you activate the uBO Scope extension by clicking its icon in your browser toolbar, a popup panel appears summarizing the third-party remote server connections related to the active browser tab.

### Key Elements:

- **Tab Hostname Display**: Shows the current page's hostname context.
- **Summary Count**: Total count of distinct connected third-party domains.
- **Domain Lists by Outcome**:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains with successful connections.
  - **Stealth Blocked**: Domains whose connections were stealthily blocked, meaning they were silently intercepted without outright failure.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where attempts to connect were explicitly blocked.

This layout delivers a transparent, concise view of your browsing tab's network interactions.


## 2. Interpreting the Domains Listing

### How Domains Are Grouped and Counted

- **Domains** are the base unit shown. These are distinct third-party domains derived from connection hostnames by stripping subdomains using the Public Suffix List.

- For each domain, a **count badge** indicates how many connection attempts (requests) occurred for that domain.

- Domains are sorted alphabetically within each connection outcome category for clarity.

### Domains Sections Explained:

| Section         | What It Represents                                  | User Value                            |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked     | Connections that succeeded without interference.   | Identifies live third-party servers currently communicating with the page. |
| Stealth Blocked | Connections silently blocked to protect privacy.   | Reveals invisible blocking activities affecting network traffic. |
| Blocked         | Explicitly blocked connection attempts by blockers.| Demonstrates network requests prevented from reaching domains. |

### Example:

If you see "cdn.example.com" listed under **Not Blocked** with a badge of 5, it means 5 requests to that domain succeeded for your current tab.


## 3. Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count

The badge number shown directly on the uBO Scope toolbar icon represents:

- The number of **distinct third-party remote server domains** with successfully allowed connections for the active tab.

- A **lower number is better**, indicating fewer third-party connections, which often means a reduced privacy risk.

- This count does not include blocked or stealth-blocked domains.

### Important Notes:

- The badge reflects unique domains, **not the number of requests**. Multiple requests to the same domain count as one.

- The badge updates in real-time as you navigate webpages.


## 4. What Are Stealth Connections?

Stealth blocking refers to network requests that were intercepted and prevented from loading in a way that the blocked resource might not be obvious to the webpage or user. 

- These connections show up in the **Stealth Blocked** section.

- They represent advanced blocking techniques that avoid outright errors or reloads, decreasing site breakage.

- Understanding stealth blocking is critical for privacy-conscious users who want to detect all subtle network filtering, not just overt blocks.


## 5. Reading the Tab Hostname and Domain

At the top of the popup, the extension displays:

- The **full hostname** of the active tab’s webpage, for example, `subdomain.example.com`.

- The page's **base domain**, derived by removing subdomains, e.g., `example.com`.

This distinction helps users see which exact website is being analyzed and understand connections within its domain hierarchy.


## 6. Workflow: Use Case to Interpret the UI

Follow these steps to explore network connections meaningfully:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar while on the page you want to inspect.
</Step>
<Step title="Scan the Badge Count">
Note the badge number on the icon to get a quick sense of the number of distinct allowed third-party domains the page communicated with.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domain Sections">
Within the popup:
- Look under **Not Blocked** to identify all domains supplying content or tracking.
- Check **Stealth Blocked** for silently blocked domains, a key privacy insight.
- Check **Blocked** for explicitly prevented connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Counts">
Observe the count badges next to domains to gauge the volume of connection attempts, which might indicate persistent tracking or heavy resource use.
</Step>
<Step title="Make Privacy Decisions">
Use this insight to decide whether a page is engaging many third-party servers and if your content blockers are working effectively without stealth leakage.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 7. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Regularly monitor the badge count to detect unusual spikes in third-party connections during browsing.
- Frequent domains showing up under **Stealth Blocked** may indicate your blockers are actively protecting your privacy beyond visible blocking.
- Use this UI as a diagnostic tool to verify if your content blockers and privacy settings are performing as expected.
- Understand that some third-party domains (like CDNs) are legitimate and necessary for a website’s fast performance.


## 8. Common Questions & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting and FAQs">
<Accordion title="Why is the badge sometimes empty even on active websites?">
If the badge number is empty or zero, it indicates no distinct allowed third-party domains were detected yet for the active tab. This may happen if the page hasn’t loaded any third-party content or if blocking prevented all requests.

Try refreshing the page to trigger network requests. If issues persist, verify the extension is correctly installed and has required permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some domains appear both in allowed and stealth-blocked sections?">
Domains can appear in multiple sections if multiple requests were made with different outcomes—a mix of allowed and stealth-blocked connections for subresources.

Each domain's counts reflect aggregate results.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does it mean if the stealth-blocked list is empty?">
An empty stealth list means no connections were blocked quietly or stealthily during your browsing session. Some users may have no stealth blocking configured or enabled.
</Accordion>
