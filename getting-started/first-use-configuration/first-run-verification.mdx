# Verifying First Run of uBO Scope

Welcome to the essential first step after installing uBO Scope: verifying that the extension is properly active and collecting connection data for your browser tabs. This guide will help you locate the uBO Scope icon, understand the badge count it displays, and perform a simple test by visiting a website to confirm normal operation.

---

## 1. Locating the uBO Scope Icon in Your Browser

After installing uBO Scope, you will find its icon in your browser’s toolbar. Depending on your browser and configuration, it might be visible immediately or hidden behind the extensions menu.

### How to find the uBO Scope icon:

- **In Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge):**
  1. Look at the top right of your browser window in the toolbar.
  2. The uBO Scope icon looks like a distinctive badge image (refer to the uBO Scope logos).
  3. If not visible, click the Extensions puzzle icon to open the menu and pin uBO Scope for easy access.

- **In Firefox:**
  1. The icon is usually in the toolbar at the top right.
  2. If hidden, click the extension overflow arrow (»), then drag uBO Scope to the toolbar.

- **In Safari:**
  1. The icon appears on the toolbar.
  2. If not visible, check Safari’s extension preferences and enable the toolbar button.

<Tip>
Pinning the uBO Scope icon to the toolbar ensures quick and easy access to its features.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Badge Count

The number on the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge represents the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser tab connected to. This is a **count of unique domains actively contacted** (allowed connections), not the number of blocked connections.

### What the badge count means:

- A **lower count is better** — it indicates fewer third-party connections.
- The badge updates in real-time as your active tab loads resources.
- If the badge is **blank (no number displayed)**, it means no third-party connections have been recorded for that tab.

<Info>
The badge count reflects only network requests visible to the browser's webRequest API. Connections not reported by this API won’t affect the count.
</Info>

## 3. Opening the uBO Scope Popup UI

Click the uBO Scope icon to access its popup interface. This panel shows detailed connection information for the active browser tab.

### Popup UI features:

- **Tab hostname and domain:** Displayed at the top to indicate the current webpage analyzed.
- **Domains connected count:** Total number of distinct domains contacted.
- **Sections for connection outcomes:**
  - **Not blocked:** Domains with allowed connections.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where stealth blocking occurred.
  - **Blocked:** Domains with blocked connections.
- Each domain entry lists the domain name and the number of requests made.

<Note>
The UI updates dynamically as the tab loads and contacts remote servers.
</Note>

## 4. Performing Your First Test

To verify uBO Scope is functioning properly, perform a simple practical test by visiting a website and checking the badge and popup for expected behavior.

### Step-by-step test workflow:

<Steps>
<Step title="Visit a Familiar Website">
Open a popular, content-rich website, such as https://example.com, in a new browser tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Toolbar Badge">
Watch the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge as the page loads. It should quickly update to show a non-zero count representing distinct third-party connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup UI">
Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup panel. You should see:
- The hostname and domain of the tab's main frame.
- A summary count of domains connected.
- Separate lists of domains under 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Data Displayed">
- **Not blocked:** Domains from which resources loaded successfully.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where connections were blocked silently.
- **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked.

Since uBO Scope monitors connections regardless of other blockers, expect some domains in each category.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Data Updates in Real Time">
Reload the page and confirm the badge and popup update accordingly, reflecting new or repeated domain connections.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the badge does not update or the popup shows 'NO DATA', ensure the extension is enabled and has the required permissions (see the installation and prerequisites guide).
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common First Run Issues

### uBO Scope Icon Not Visible
- Make sure the extension is installed and enabled in your browser’s extensions settings.
- Pin the extension icon to the toolbar for easier access.

### Badge Count is Always Zero or Blank
- Visit a website with known third-party content (e.g., news or multimedia sites).
- Disable other extensions that might interfere with network requests.
- Confirm the browser supports and permits the webRequest API.

### Popup Shows 'NO DATA'
- This can indicate no network requests tracked yet for the active tab.
- Reload the web page fully to generate network activity.
- Restart the browser if the problem persists.

### No Domain Lists in the Popup
- Ensure you are viewing the active tab.
- Check for browser or extension errors via the browser’s developer console.

<Warning>
Network requests made by the browser outside the reach of the webRequest API (such as some service workers or DNS-level filtering) will not appear in uBO Scope.
</Warning>
