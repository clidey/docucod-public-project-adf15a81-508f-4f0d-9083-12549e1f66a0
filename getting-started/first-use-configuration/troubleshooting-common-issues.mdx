# Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

This guide helps you overcome frequent roadblocks during the installation and initial use of uBO Scope. If the toolbar badge doesn’t appear, you see no connections reported, or the extension conflicts with others, follow these concise solutions to restore full functionality and privacy insights.

---

## 1. Toolbar Badge Not Displaying

The uBO Scope toolbar badge visually reports the number of distinct third-party remote server connections within the active tab. If this badge is missing:

### Steps to Fix

1. **Check Extension Icon Visibility**
   - Ensure the uBO Scope icon is pinned or visible on your browser toolbar.
   - For Chromium or Firefox, go to the Extensions menu and pin the uBO Scope extension.

2. **Verify Permissions**
   - Confirm uBO Scope has necessary permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`) during installation.
   - Reinstall if prompted to accept permissions.

3. **Reload or Restart Browser**
   - Sometimes the extension background script needs a refresh.
   - Restart your browser and check again.

4. **Ensure Supported Browser Version**
   - Make sure your browser meets minimum version requirements:
     - Chromium: 122 or later
     - Firefox: 128 or later
     - Safari: 18.5 or later

### Tip

If you recently updated the browser or extension, wait a moment for background initialization. The badge updates asynchronously based on network activity.

## 2. No Connections Are Reported in the Popup

Seeing no domains listed in the popup UI after visiting websites means uBO Scope isn’t collecting network data.

### Steps to Fix

1. **Test with a Popular Site**
   - Visit a site with known third-party connections, like https://example.com, to verify if connections appear.

2. **Confirm the Badge Count Updates**
   - The badge should show a numeric count reflecting distinct 3rd-party connections.
   - An empty badge indicates no network data is recorded.

3. **Check Other Extensions for Conflicts**
   - Disable other network-monitoring or privacy extensions that might interfere.
   - Especially content blockers that alter browser requests may conflict.

4. **Inspect Extension Background Activity**
   - Make sure uBO Scope's background script is running (in Chromium via `chrome://extensions/` -> Details -> Service Worker).

5. **Clear Browser Cache and Data**
   - Old cached data or corrupted session storage can cause issues.
   - Clearing the browser cache and restarting can resolve this.

6. **Verify `webRequest` API Availability**
   - Some browsers or profiles may restrict or disable this API.
   - Check browser settings or try a clean profile to isolate this.

## 3. Conflicts With Other Extensions

Due to the nature of capturing network requests, uBO Scope may experience interference from other extensions that modify, block, or observe web traffic.

### How to Resolve

1. **Identify Conflicting Extensions**
   - Temporarily disable all other extensions.
   - Re-enable them one-by-one to spot conflict.

2. **Whitelist uBO Scope in Content Blockers**
   - If you use other blockers (like uBlock Origin or privacy blockers), add uBO Scope as an exception or disable conflicting features.

3. **Avoid Using Multiple Network Monitoring Tools Simultaneously**
   - Running several similar extensions can cause competition for webRequest events.

4. **Use Official Store Versions Only**
   - Avoid running forked or modified builds of uBO Scope alongside other developer-build extensions.

## 4. Extension Not Collecting Data on Certain Websites

Sometimes the extension fails to detect connections on specific sites due to browser or website peculiarities.

### Fixes and Workarounds

1. **Refresh the Tab**
   - Reload the page to trigger fresh network monitoring.

2. **Disable Browser Features Like Proxy or VPN Temporarily**
   - Such features can mask requests and interfere with the extension.

3. **Confirm Website Doesn’t Use Private Network Isolation**
   - Some sites restrict cross-site tracking in ways that prevent data capture.

4. **Try Using a Different Browser User Profile**
   - Isolate if profile-specific settings block extension operations.

## 5. Extension Fails to Install or Enable

If the extension won’t install or activate:

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Verify Browser Compatibility and Version**
   - Confirm browser version is supported as per the official installation guide.

2. **Check for Browser Policies or Enterprise Restrictions**
   - Managed browsers or devices may block extensions or required permissions.

3. **Install from Official Stores**
   - Use links from the README or installation docs:
     - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
     - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

4. **Clear Conflicting Extensions or Older Versions**
   - Remove previous versions or similar extensions before installing.

5. **Restart Browser and Retry Installation**

---

## 6. General Troubleshooting Tips

- **Keep Browser Updated**: Browser updates often fix `webRequest` API bugs or permission changes.
- **Check Extension Background Logs**: Use browser developer tools to inspect logs and errors in the extension background.
- **Consult Related Documentation**: Guides on installation and UI understanding can offer additional insights.
