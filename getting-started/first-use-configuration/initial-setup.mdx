# First-Time Setup & Permissions

Welcome to your first interaction with uBO Scope. After installing the extension, the browser will prompt you to grant essential permissions. These permissions enable uBO Scope to operate fully—monitoring and reporting third-party network requests and providing accurate insights into your browsing connections.

This guide walks you through the permissions you need to authorize, explains their purpose, and reassures you about privacy and data usage.

---

## 1. Understanding the Permissions uBO Scope Requires

uBO Scope relies on specific browser permissions to observe and analyze network requests initiated by web pages. These permissions differ slightly depending on your browser but generally include:

- **Active Tab Access (`activeTab`)**: Allows the extension to access information about the currently active tab so it can present accurate, tab-specific connection details.

- **Storage Access (`storage`)**: Enables saving session data such as network request outcomes and user preferences within the extension.

- **Web Request Monitoring (`webRequest`)**: Provides the ability to listen to network request events in real time, which is critical for capturing attempted and successful connections to remote servers.

- **Host Permissions**: Grants the extension the right to observe requests made to all web domains (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`). This comprehensive access ensures that every third-party connection attempt is noticed.

### How Permissions Are Presented

After installation, your browser will show one or more permission prompts requesting approval for the above capabilities. This happens immediately or the first time the extension needs these permissions.

> **Example prompt text (varies by browser):**
>
> - "Allow uBO Scope to access your data on all websites?"
> - "Allow uBO Scope to monitor network requests?"


### Why These Permissions Are Necessary

uBO Scope cannot provide its core functionality—identifying all third-party connections and their outcomes—without these permissions. Specifically:

- Without **`webRequest`**, it wouldn't see network requests.
- Without **host permissions**, the extension would be blind to requests outside a narrow domain scope.
- Without **`activeTab`**, results couldn’t be matched to the tab you’re viewing.


<Tip>
Granting these permissions only empowers uBO Scope to alert you about network connections; it does not alter, block, or interfere with your browsing.

## 2. Step-by-Step: Granting Permissions after Installation

Follow these steps to ensure uBO Scope can function correctly from the start.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install uBO Scope">
Use the official browser extension store for your platform:

- **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge)**: Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- **Firefox**: Install from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- **Safari**: Install from the Mac App Store or Safari Extensions Gallery (Safari 18.5+)

Installation will automatically request basic permissions needed.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe Permissions Prompts">
Right after installation or first use, watch for the browser dialogs asking for permission:

- Read each prompt carefully.
- Accept all requested permissions to ensure full functionality.

<Warning>
Declining any of the requested permissions limits uBO Scope’s ability to detect network requests accurately.
</Warning>
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Permissions Are Active">
Once granted, confirm by:

- Clicking the extension icon to open the popup.
- Visiting a website and observing if domain connection data appears.
- Noticing the badge count on the toolbar icon, which should update with the number of distinct third-party domains connected.

If no data appears or the badge remains empty on pages with third-party content, verify permissions in your browser's extensions/settings panel.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Privacy and Data Usage Assurance

Users often worry about what data extensions collect. Here is what you need to know:

- **Local Processing**: uBO Scope runs entirely within your browser and does not send your browsing data to any remote server.

- **Data Storage**: All data about network requests are stored locally in browser storage scoped only to this extension.

- **No Network Modifications**: The extension does not alter, block, or manipulate web requests. It passively observes and reports.

- **Transparent Reporting**: The information you see reflects actual network behavior, helping you or privacy-conscious users observe potentially unwanted third-party connections.

<Tip>
You can review uBO Scope’s source code on GitHub ([uBO Scope Repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope)) to verify its behavior.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Permission Issues

If you encounter problems where uBO Scope doesn’t show connection data or the badge count stays at zero, consider the following:

<AccordionGroup title="Common Permission-Related Issues and Fixes">
<Accordion title="Permission Not Granted or Revoked">

- Check your browser’s extension settings and ensure all required permissions are enabled.
- Reinstall the extension to re-trigger the permission prompts.
- Some browsers allow you to manually grant or revoke host permissions; verify these are correctly set.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Browser Compatibility or Version Limitations">

- uBO Scope requires:
  - Chromium 122 or later
  - Firefox 128 or later
  - Safari 18.5 or later

- Verify your browser version meets these requirements.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Conflict with Other Extensions or Policies">

- Some security or privacy extensions may block access to `webRequest` APIs or host permissions.
- Enterprise or managed browsers might restrict extension permissions.
- Try disabling other extensions that may interfere or check your browser policies.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Next Steps After Granting Permissions

Once permissions are granted and uBO Scope is active:

- Explore the extension popup to see detailed reports of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.
- Observe the badge count on your toolbar as you browse to see live updates of third-party connections.
- For deeper understanding, read the [Using uBO Scope for the First Time](../first-use-configuration/using-the-extension) guide.
