# Quick Validation and Testing

Confirming that uBO Scope functions correctly after installation is crucial to ensure you gain accurate insights into your browser’s network activity. This guide walks you through a simple, practical browsing scenario to validate the extension’s operation, verify domain counts, and confirm it reports connections reliably regardless of other content blockers.

---

## 1. Prepare for Testing

**Ensure uBO Scope is Installed and Enabled**
- Confirm the extension is installed from your browser's official store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Safari Extensions).
- Locate the uBO Scope toolbar icon – it usually appears near the address bar as a badge with a number.
- The badge may initially be blank or show a `0` if no tabs have network activity yet.

**Close Conflicting Extensions Temporarily**
- For the cleanest test, temporarily disable other content blockers or privacy extensions that might interfere.
- Later, you will verify that uBO Scope still reports accurately even with other blockers enabled.

## 2. Run a Basic Browsing Scenario

Follow these steps to generate network activity that uBO Scope can monitor and report.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a New Browser Tab">
    Open a fresh browser tab to ensure no prior cached data influences the test.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visit a Popular Website">
    Navigate to a well-known website, for example, `https://example.com` or `https://news.yourfavorite.com`.

    - Observe the uBO Scope badge on the toolbar.
    - The badge number represents the distinct count of allowed third-party domains connected from that tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check the Badge Count">
    Note the number displayed in the uBO Scope toolbar badge.

    - A non-zero count means multiple third-party domains are connected.
    - A zero or blank badge indicates no third-party connections detected (which can happen if content blockers prevent all connections).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
    Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup UI.

    - Review the summary count of connected domains.
    - Explore the sections: **Allowed**, **Stealth-blocked**, and **Blocked** domains.
    - Confirm domains are listed logically corresponding to network activity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visit a Different Website">
    Open another new tab and navigate to a different website that usually loads third-party content, e.g., a social media site or an online store.

    - Observe the updated badge count for this new tab.
    - Open the popup to verify domain breakdowns again.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-enable Other Content Blockers">
    If you previously disabled other blockers, re-enable them now.

    - Repeat navigation and validation steps across Multiple tabs.
    - Confirm uBO Scope still reports third-party connection counts independent of other blockers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Verify Outcomes and Interpretation

- **Badge Count Consistency**: The badge shows the number of unique allowed third-party domains contacted from the active tab.
- **Popup UI Detail**: The popup displays domain names grouped by their connection status.
- **Independent Reporting**: uBO Scope reports network outcomes regardless of content blockers’ presence.

<Tip>
  A lower badge count typically signifies fewer third-party connections, which often equates to higher browsing privacy.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Pay attention to "Stealth-blocked" domains in the popup; these are connections redirected or suppressed by other blockers but still visible to uBO Scope as network events.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Testing Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues">
  <Accordion title="Badge Count Remains Empty or Zero After Browsing">
    - Ensure the extension is enabled and has the necessary permissions.
    - Refresh the page or open a new tab.
    - Verify your browser’s webRequest API is supported and not restricted.
    - Check for browser privacy settings that might block background extensions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Popup Shows 'No Data' or Blank Information">
    - Reload the popup by closing and reopening it.
    - Navigate to a website with active third-party connections.
    - Allow a few seconds for data to collect; network events are batched periodically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data Seems Inconsistent with Actual Connections">
    - Remember that uBO Scope COUNT reflects distinct third-party domains, not individual requests.
    - Other blockers or VPNs can influence data seen by the extension.
    - If using container tabs or profiles, verify extension is active within the container.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="uBO Scope Not Reflecting Changes After Filtering Rules Change">
    - uBO Scope tracks network requests via browser APIs and may cache session data.
    - Restart your browser to clear session.
    - Check if browser’s extension permissions need updating.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Next Steps

- Continue exploring websites to observe how different sites connect to various networks.
- Review the [Understanding the Toolbar and Popup UI](/getting-started/first-use-configuration/basic-usage) documentation to deepen your analysis skills.
- Consult [Troubleshooting Common Installation and Usage Issues](/getting-started/troubleshooting-support/common-issues) if you encounter problems.
- For a guided network scan, try the [Your First Network Scan](/guides/getting-started/first-run) guide.

## Additional Tips

- **Test Across Browsers**: If you use multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, Safari), test uBO Scope on each to ensure consistent operation.
- **Monitor During Normal Usage**: Leave uBO Scope enabled while you browse normally to get continuous insights.
- **Avoid Relying on External Blocker Metrics**: Use uBO Scope’s badge count as a privacy metric rather than block counts from other extensions.

With these steps, you will quickly know whether uBO Scope runs correctly and start understanding the actual network activity your browser engages in.
