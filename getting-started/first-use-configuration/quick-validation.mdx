# Quick Validation & Basic Troubleshooting

This guide helps you perform fast checks to verify that uBO Scope is up and running correctly after installation. It also addresses common issues such as missing badge counts, a non-responsive popup, or permission problems. By following these steps, you will gain confidence that the extension functions properly without confusion or frustration.

## 1. Verifying uBO Scope Is Active

uBO Scope operates unobtrusively in your browser's background, monitoring third-party remote connections. To confirm it is active:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Toolbar Badge">
  After visiting any website, look at the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It should display a number indicating the count of distinct third-party domains contacted during page load.

  - If you see a badge number (e.g., '3'), uBO Scope is tracking requests properly.
  - If the badge is blank or missing, proceed to the next verification steps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Popup and Inspect">
  Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.

  - The popup should display the hostname of the current tab and list domains under three categories: 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'.
  - If the popup says 'NO DATA' or fails to load, see the troubleshooting tips below.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reload the Webpage">
  Sometimes the extension needs a fresh page load to capture data:

  1. Reload the active tab.
  2. Observe the badge and popup for updated counts.
  3. If you still see no data, continue troubleshooting.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Common Troubleshooting Scenarios

### A. No Badge Number or Zero Count on Active Tabs

- **Confirm Supported Browser Version:** uBO Scope requires minimum versions:
  - Chromium 122+  
  - Firefox 128+  
  - Safari 18.5+

- **Ensure Permissions Are Granted:** The extension must have these permissions:
  - `activeTab`  
  - `storage`  
  - `webRequest`

  Without these, it cannot monitor requests properly.

- **Disable Conflicting Extensions:** Some other extensions may interfere with webRequest listeners.

- **Reload the Extension:** Try disabling and re-enabling uBO Scope or restart the browser.

### B. Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Domain Lists

- **Wait a Moment:** The popup data loads asynchronously after opening. Wait a few seconds then refresh by closing and reopening the popup.

- **Reload the Tab:** Network requests must happen after uBO Scope’s activation to be tracked.

- **Check for Browser Errors:** Open the browser’s developer console on the popup (`Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+I`) to check for JavaScript errors.

### C. Permissions Were Not Granted or Revoked

- **Reinstall or Reset Permissions:** Remove the extension and reinstall it from the official store to trigger permission requests.

- **Manually Grant Permissions:** Some browsers allow managing extension permissions through settings.

### D. No Updates in Badge or Popup Despite Page Reload

- **Inspect Browser Network and Console Logs:** There might be policy or network configuration preventing webRequest events.

- **Verify uBO Scope’s Background Service:** The background process must be running. Browser extensions with Manifest V3 use service workers that can unload unexpectedly; a page reload can help.

### E. In Safari Specifically

- **Minimum Version Required:** Safari must be 18.5 or higher.

- **Enable the Extension in Safari Settings:** Safari sometimes disables extensions after updates. Confirm uBO Scope is enabled.

## 3. Quick Validation Command

While uBO Scope runs invisibly, you can validate that it has data for the current tab using browser developer tools:

### For Advanced Users (Optional)

Open the browser Console on the popup window and check the badge count with this snippet:

```javascript
browser.runtime.sendMessage({ what: 'getTabData', tabId: (await browser.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }))[0].id })
  .then(data => console.log('uBO Scope tab data:', data));
```

You should see serialized data including counts for allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

---

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

- Always reload the webpage after installing or restarting your browser to let uBO Scope capture fresh network events.

- Use the popup interface regularly to understand the domain outcomes; the badge count offers a quick summary.

- If you change content blocker settings or install new blockers, validate uBO Scope's counts to see actual third-party connections.

- Keep your browser up to date to avoid compatibility issues.

---

## 5. When to Seek Help

If you have followed the above steps and uBO Scope is still not reporting expected data:

- Review the [Installation Guide](../getting-started/setup-introduction/installation.md) to confirm prerequisites.
- Verify permissions as described in the [First-Time Setup & Permissions](../getting-started/first-use-configuration/initial-setup.md).
- Consult the [How uBO Scope Works (Architecture Diagram)](../../overview/product-architecture-insight/architecture-diagram.md) to understand the internals.
- Visit the [Troubleshooting & Diagnosing Unexpected Connections](../../guides/advanced-troubleshooting-analysis/diagnosing-privacy-leaks.md) for advanced diagnostics.

If problems persist, you may report them at the project's [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/issues).

## 6. Summary

This page has guided you through simple, pragmatic steps to validate uBO Scope's operational status immediately after installation. It equips you to identify common pitfalls around badge visibility, popup responsiveness, and permissions. With this knowledge, you ensure uBO Scope works as intended, delivering trustworthy visibility into third-party connections.

---

<Check>
Ensure your browser version meets minimum requirements and that uBO Scope has all necessary permissions.
</Check>

<Check>
Always reload the browsing tab after installing uBO Scope to activate its monitoring.
</Check>

<Check>
Use the popup's domain lists and badge number as quick indicators of extension health.
</Check>

<Note>
If the popup or badge remains inactive after troubleshooting, consult linked documentation pages or open an issue for support.
</Note>
