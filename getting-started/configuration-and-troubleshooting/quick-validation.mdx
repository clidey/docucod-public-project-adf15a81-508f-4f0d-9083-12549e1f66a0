# Quick Validation Steps

Ensure uBO Scope is properly installed and actively monitoring your browser's network connections with this straightforward checklist. By following these steps, you will confirm the extension tracks network activity and displays accurate connection data in real time, maximizing your confidence in the tool.

---

## 1. Load a Popular Website

Start with a well-known, content-rich website such as `https://www.wikipedia.org` or `https://www.google.com`.

- Open a new browser tab and navigate to your chosen site.
- This action generates network requests uBO Scope will monitor.

<Check>
Choosing a popular site ensures numerous network connections for meaningful validation.
</Check>

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Extension Popup

Access the extension's popup panel to view live connection monitoring:

- Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar (a shield icon labeled 'uBO Scope').
- Click the icon to open the popup UI.

### What You Should See:
- The hostname of the current tab is shown at the top.
- A summary showing the number of unique connected domains (e.g., “domains connected: 125”).
- Three distinct sections listing domains by connection outcome:
  - **Not Blocked** (allowed connections)
  - **Stealth-Blocked** (redirected or stealth failures)
  - **Blocked** (explicit blocking detected)

<Note>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" and no domains, it indicates no monitored connections were detected, possibly due to network inactivity or extension malfunction.
</Note>

## 3. Interpret the Badge Count

The extension icon may display a numeric badge representing the count of unique domains allowed on the current tab.

- The badge number corresponds to the number of domains listed in the **not blocked** section.
- If the badge is empty (blank), it means no allowed connections have been registered yet.

<Info>
This count excludes stealth and blocked connections, offering a concise view of active third-party domains successfully connecting.
</Info>

## 4. Examine Domain Lists in the Popup

Explore each domain list to get a granular view of connection behavior:

- **Not Blocked:** Active third-party connections allowed by blockers or policies.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests silently redirected or stealthily blocked, indicating non-standard blocking outcomes.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked by content blockers.

Each domain entry includes a badge showing the number of requests made by that domain.

<Tip>
Domains are shown in a normalized format using the Public Suffix List to identify base domains, facilitating easy interpretation.
</Tip>

## 5. Confirm Live Tracking is Working

While browsing or refreshing the site:

- The badge count updates dynamically to reflect ongoing network requests.
- The domain lists in the popup change according to new allowed, stealth, or blocked connections.

<Check>
If these indicators update as you navigate or reload, uBO Scope is functioning correctly.
</Check>

## 6. Troubleshooting Quick Checks

If you encounter issues with data not appearing or badge counts not updating:

- Ensure the extension icon is visible and enabled in your browser.
- Verify the extension has permissions to access all URLs (check permissions in your browser's extensions page).
- Reload the extension or browser to reset any stale state.
- Confirm you are on a network-active page that initiates multiple requests.
