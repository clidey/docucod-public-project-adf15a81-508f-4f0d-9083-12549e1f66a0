# Configuring uBO Scope

uBO Scope is designed to provide transparent reporting of all browser network connections, including ones affected by content blockers or stealth mechanisms. This page guides you through the extension's settings, required permissions, default behaviors, and optional configurations you can adjust to optimize request tracking.

---

## 1. Understanding Extension Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network activity comprehensively:

- **`webRequest`**: Enables the extension to listen to and observe all network requests.
- **`activeTab`**: Allows interaction with the active browser tab for context-sensitive operations.
- **`storage`**: Facilitates saving and loading session and configuration data.
- **Host Permissions**: 
  - For Chromium: Access to all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
  - For Firefox and Safari: Access to `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` plus WebSocket URLs as applicable.

These permissions ensure uBO Scope can track outgoing network connections across virtually all visited websites.

### How to Check Permissions:

1. Open your browser's extension management page:
   - **Chrome**: `chrome://extensions/`
   - **Firefox**: `about:addons`
   - **Safari**: Safari Preferences &rarr; Extensions
2. Find uBO Scope in the list.
3. Verify that the permissions listed match those above.

<Tip>
If you notice insufficient permissions, uninstall and reinstall uBO Scope from the official store to ensure a correct installation.

## 2. Default Behavior and Automatic Configuration

uBO Scope operates mostly without requiring any user configuration out of the box. It starts tracking network requests immediately after installation with the following default behaviors:

- **Real-time Request Tracking**: Automatically monitors all network requests from webpages in the active browser tabs.
- **Badge Counts**: Updates the extension icon badge to show the count of distinct third-party domains successfully connected.
- **Domain Categorization**: Uses the Public Suffix List to accurately group requests by domain to avoid counting subdomains as separate entities.

The extension runs silently in the background, collecting request outcomes and categorizing them as:

- **Not blocked** — Requests allowed to connect.
- **Blocked** — Requests that failed or were blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked** — Requests redirected or otherwise stealthily blocked.

These distinctions help you understand your browsing exposure accurately.

## 3. Optional Configuration and Adjustments

Currently, uBO Scope does not expose many configurable settings in the user interface because its core mission is to deliver transparent data with minimal user intervention. However, you can affect behavior indirectly through browser settings or permissions:

- **Privacy/Security Settings**: Ensure your browser allows extensions to observe network activity; strict privacy settings or other blockers may interfere.
- **Extension Storage**: Data persistence relies on the browser's `storage` API, which is managed automatically.

As features expand, more options may become available. Keep an eye on official release notes for upcoming configurable settings.

## 4. Confirming Required Permissions and Functionality

To validate that uBO Scope has all necessary permissions and is functioning correctly:

1. **Verify Extension Permissions** as detailed in section 1.
2. **Load a Website and Open the uBO Scope Popup:**
   - Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. **Check Network Data Display:**
   - Domains connected count should update from '?' to a number representing distinct third-party domains contacted.
   - Lists under Not Blocked, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked should populate accordingly.

If the popup shows no data and badge counts remain blank:

- Confirm that the extension is enabled.
- Refresh the webpage or open a new tab.
- Ensure no other extensions or privacy settings block access to the `webRequest` API.

<Tip>
For the best experience, use browsers supported by uBO Scope (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+). Older versions may have limited or no support for the required APIs.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Permission and Configuration Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Not Tracking Any Requests">
If uBO Scope shows no activity:
- Check that the extension's permissions include `webRequest` and host permissions.
- Verify the extension is enabled in your browser.
- Disable any other content blockers temporarily to isolate conflicts.
- Restart your browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Displays Incorrectly or Not at All">
- The badge count reflects distinct third-party domains connected.
- Some pages may have zero third-party requests, resulting in no badge.
- Clear browser cache and reload the page.
- Restart the extension or browser if the badge stalls.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Fails to Load Domains">
- This can happen immediately after installation; wait a few seconds as network data is collected.
- Confirm that your current tab is a webpage and not a browser internal page.
- Try refreshing the tab or visiting a different website.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Best Practices for Configuration

- **Review Browser Permission Prompts Carefully:** Always grant the permissions uBO Scope requests during installation.
- **Keep uBO Scope Updated:** Updates may improve permission handling and introduce new configuration options.
- **Use in Conjunction with Browser Diagnostics:** Combine uBO Scope data with browser developer tools to validate network connections further.
- **Restart Browser Occasionally:** This helps ensure the extension's background processes are active and running smoothly.
