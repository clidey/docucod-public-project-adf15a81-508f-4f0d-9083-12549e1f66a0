# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide provides immediate remedies and actionable steps for common startup or installation issues encountered when using uBO Scope. Whether you face missing data in the popup, problems accessing the interface, browser support errors, or permission-related hurdles, this guide helps you diagnose and fix these issues swiftly.

## 1. No Data or "NO DATA" Message in Popup

If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or an empty state despite network activity in your browser:

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Confirm Extension Permissions**
   - uBO Scope requires the following permissions:
     - `activeTab`
     - `webRequest`
     - `storage`
   - Ensure the extension has been granted all permissions during installation.
   - To verify:
     - Open your browser’s extension page (`chrome://extensions` or `about:addons`).
     - Locate uBO Scope and check for permission prompts or warnings.

2. **Reload the Browser Tab**
   - Sometimes the extension does not capture existing tab activity until the page reloads.
   - Reload the active tab and then open the uBO Scope popup.

3. **Interact with the Extension Icon After Installation**
   - After installing, click the uBO Scope icon once to trigger initial data collection.

4. **Check for Conflicts**
   - uBO Scope runs independently but verify your other blockers or privacy extensions are not interfering.
   - Disable other extensions temporarily to isolate the issue.

5. **Restart the Browser**
   - Fully close and reopen your browser.
   - This ensures the background processes and service workers are started fresh.

6. **Update the Extension**
   - Verify your uBO Scope extension version is current (minimum version 1.0.1).
   - Update via the browser’s extension store or reinstall.

## 2. Popup Does Not Open or Shows Errors

If clicking the extension icon fails to open the popup or displays errors:

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Verify Browser Compatibility**
   - Supported browsers and minimum versions:
     - Chromium 122+
     - Firefox 128+
     - Safari 18.5+
   - Older browser versions may not support required APIs.

2. **Check Browser Console for Errors**
   - Open the browser’s developer tools in the popup context:
     - Right-click the uBO Scope icon → Inspect (or through extensions page).
   - Review errors for clues about missing files or permission issues.

3. **Clear Extension Cache**
   - Sometimes cached data corrupts the popup display.
   - Remove and reinstall the extension, or reset browser cache.

4. **Disable Conflicting Extensions**
   - Temporarily disable other extensions that might block scripts or interfere.

5. **Test in Private/Incognito Mode**
   - Enable uBO Scope for incognito mode if supported and test for conflicts.

## 3. Extension Not Functioning As Expected After Installation

### Common Causes

- Missing background script activation
- Permissions not granted
- Session data not loading properly

### Fixes

1. **Review Permissions in Browser Settings**
   - Ensure `webRequest` and `activeTab` are enabled.

2. **Manually Reset Session Data**
   - Corrupt session storage can cause stale or missing data.
   - Clear storage by:
     - Going to browser extension settings
     - Clearing site data for uBO Scope or performing a full extension reinstall

3. **Check Manifest and Host Permissions**
   - Extension manifest includes broad host permissions:
     - `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` depending on browser
   - Ensure these host permissions are granted.

4. **Reload or Restart Browser**
   - Restarting ensures background service worker or scripts are reloaded.

## 4. Permission Denied or Errors Related to Browsing Data

If you encounter permission errors related to accessing tab data or network events:

### Actions

1. **Grant Permissions Prompted by Browser**
   - Accept all permission requests at first extension launch.

2. **Check for Browser Privacy Settings**
   - Some privacy settings may restrict extensions’ ability to monitor network requests.
   - Temporarily relax these or whitelist uBO Scope.

3. **Verify Browser API Support**
   - Older or non-standard browsers may not implement required APIs, causing errors.

4. **Update Browser**
   - Keep your browser updated to latest stable version.
