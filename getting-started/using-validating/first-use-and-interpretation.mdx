# Your First Use: What to Look For

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with **uBO Scope**! This guide walks you through triggering your first network measurements, checking the toolbar icon badge, and interpreting the data displayed in the extension’s popup. By the end, you will confidently confirm that uBO Scope is working as designed and understand the meaning behind key indicators like third-party domain counts and popup categories.

---

## 1. Triggering Your First Network Measurements

uBO Scope automatically monitors and records network requests made by your active browser tabs. To start seeing data:

1. **Open a new browser tab**.
2. Visit any website that loads external content.

> As you browse, uBO Scope listens to network events and categorizes each connection attempt.

<u>Note:</u> You don’t need to configure anything to start measuring — the extension works out-of-the-box once installed.

---

## 2. Observing the Toolbar Icon Badge

The toolbar icon in your browser shows a badge count — this represents **the number of distinct third-party domains contacted by the active tab that were allowed**.

- A **lower count is desirable** as it indicates fewer third-party connections.
- The badge updates dynamically as network requests are made.

### How to check:

- Look for the uBO Scope icon near your browser’s address bar.
- The number displayed is the current count of allowed third-party domains.

<Note>
If the badge is **empty or zero**, it means no third-party connections were observed for the active tab yet.
</Note>

## 3. Opening and Understanding the Popup Interface

Clicking the toolbar icon opens the uBO Scope popup, where details about current tab connections are presented.

### What you will see:

- **Tab Hostname**: The main webpage’s hostname is prominently displayed at the top.
- **Domain Connection Summary**: Shows the total number of distinct domains connected.
- **Three Categories of Domains**:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains with network requests that succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections resulted in redirects or indirect blocking.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where network requests were explicitly blocked or failed.

Each category lists domains with a count badge indicating the number of requests made.

### Visual cues:

- Green background highlights allowed domains.
- Red backgrounds mark stealth-blocked and blocked domains.
- Rows alternate shading for readability.

## 4. Interpreting Third-Party Domain Counts and Categories

uBO Scope provides insight into which third-party domains your browser contacted and how those connections were handled.

### Key interpretation points:

- **Allowed Domains**: These third parties served content successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains**: Redirects or stealthy blocking usually mean some connections were circumvented or modified without direct blocking indication.
- **Blocked Domains**: Requests to these domains failed outright, indicating effective blocking.

> This triage helps you fully understand your web activity beyond simple block counts.

### Example scenario:

If you open a news website, you might see external domains such as content delivery networks or ad servers.
- Allowed domains show which external servers provided content.
- Blocked domains represent those that your content blocker or browser prevented.
- Stealth-blocked may indicate domains involved in redirection or filtered by stealth tactics.

## 5. Confirming Extension Functionality

Ensure uBO Scope is functioning correctly by verifying the following:

- The badge count on the toolbar icon updates as you load pages.
- When you open the popup, domain names reflect real third-party connections.
- The domain categories and counts change correspondingly based on browsing activity.

### Troubleshooting quick check:

- Visit a site known to have external resources (e.g., a popular news site or video platform).
- Refresh the tab and watch the badge number increment.
- Open the popup and check that the domains are populated and categorized.

<Tip>
If no data appears or badge remains empty after browsing, ensure the extension has the required permissions and is enabled in your browser. For more detailed troubleshooting, refer to the 'Troubleshooting Installation & Setup' guide.
</Tip>

## 6. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Refresh pages if data does not appear immediately; measurement occurs as requests are processed.
- Remember the badge count counts distinct domains, not total requests.
- Check for legitimate third-party domains (like CDNs) before assuming all third parties are unwanted.
- Use the popup info to identify stealth-blocked entries that may indicate evasive tracking techniques.

<Warning>
uBO Scope depends on your browser’s `webRequest` API. Certain browser settings or privacy modes might limit its ability to monitor some connections.
</Warning>
