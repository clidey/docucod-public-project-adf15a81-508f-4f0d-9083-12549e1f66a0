# Quick Validation Checklist

This guide helps you quickly verify that uBO Scope is properly working in your browser. By following this checklist, you will confirm that uBO Scope is effectively monitoring network connections and accurately reporting domain activity—regardless of other content blockers in use.

---

## 1. Navigate to a Website

1. Open your preferred browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
2. Visit a familiar, content-rich website (for example, https://example.com).

> Visiting a real-world site produces genuine network traffic across multiple domains, making it an ideal test.

---

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- The popup window should appear with domain connection details related to the current active tab.

---

## 3. Check Domain Counts and Categories

Observe the following in the popup report for the active tab:

- **Summary Section**: The total number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Outcomes Sections**: Domains grouped into three categories:
  - **Not Blocked** (allowed) — domains from which connections succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked** — domains where requests were redirected or quietly blocked.
  - **Blocked** — domains where requests failed and were explicitly blocked.

Verify that:

- You see some domains listed under "not blocked" (except on very isolated or offline pages).
- The allowed domains count matches the badge number on the toolbar icon.
- The stealth-blocked and blocked sections display domains if applicable.

---

## 4. Interpret the Toolbar Badge

- The badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected during web browsing.
- A non-zero count indicates uBO Scope is monitoring and reporting network connections effectively.
- Click the badge to open the popup and drill down into domain details.

> Remember, a lower badge count means fewer third-party connections, typically indicating better privacy.

---

## 5. Validate Monitoring Despite Other Content Blockers

- If you use other content blocking extensions or DNS-based filters, uBO Scope remains fully operational.
- Visit websites with known trackers or ads to see domains in the blocked or stealth-blocked sections.
- Confirm that uBO Scope reports these outcomes independently of other blockers.

---

## 6. Confirm Active Network Monitoring

To ensure uBO Scope is monitoring network activity reliably:

- Refresh or open multiple tabs with different websites.
- Observe popup data update accordingly with new domain connections.
- Close tabs and confirm domain data is cleared for those tabs.

---

## Troubleshooting Quick Checks

If you don’t see any data or the badge remains empty:

- **Check Permissions:** Ensure the extension has permissions for `activeTab`, `webRequest`, and `storage` (these are requested on first launch).
- **Supported Browser Version:** Verify your browser version meets minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- **Reload/uBO Scope Restart:** Try disabling and re-enabling uBO Scope from your extensions menu.
- **Network Activity:** Confirm the page you opened generates network requests (avoid completely blank or local files).

## Summary

This checklist ensures that uBO Scope is working as intended by guiding you through testing on real websites, inspecting domain outcomes, interpreting the badge, and verifying operation alongside other blockers. It enables quick confirmation of true network monitoring to help you trust uBO Scope’s data.

## Next Steps

- Explore the full [Popup Interface Guide](/getting-started/using-validating/exploring-popup) to understand detailed UI elements.
- Learn how to interpret network activity and badge counts in [Interpreting Network Activity](/guides/using-ubo-scope/interpreting-network-activity).
- Review [First Launch and Permissions](/getting-started/install-configure/first-launch) for setup validation.
- Visit [Installation Instructions](/getting-started/install-configure/installation) if uBO Scope is not yet installed.

# Practical Tips

- For the most realistic validation, visit sites with diverse content (news sites, blogs, shopping portals).
- The popup refreshes data only for the active tab. Switch tabs to check monitoring for each.
- The “stealth-blocked” section is often overlooked but important for understanding subtle request interceptions.

# Common Pitfalls

- Testing on ‘ad blocker test’ pages often results in misleading data — use real websites.
- An empty badge or no domain data does not always mean uBO Scope is broken; it may be a low-connection page.
- Make sure you are checking the popup for the active tab, as data is tab-specific.
