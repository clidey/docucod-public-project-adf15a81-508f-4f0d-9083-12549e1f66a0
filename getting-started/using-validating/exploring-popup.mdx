# Exploring the Popup Interface

Discover how to use uBO Scope's popup interface to visualize the network connections your browser has made for the current tab. This guide helps you understand the breakdown of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains, explains the significance of the badge count, and empowers you to interpret network activity confidently.

---

## 1. Overview of the Popup Interface

When you click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar, the popup window opens, summarizing network connections related to the tab you're currently viewing. This interface provides a clear, categorized snapshot of external domains your browser has interacted with during the tab's lifecycle.

Key elements include:

- **Domain Categories:** Visual sections showing domains grouped by how network requests were handled.
- **Badge Count:** A numeric indicator on the toolbar icon indicating the count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Hostname Display:** The main and subdomain of the active tab shown prominently.

---

## 2. Understanding the Domain Categories

The popup organizes domains into three distinct outcome categories based on network request results for the current tab:

### Allowed Domains ("not blocked")
- Domains from which network requests successfully fetched resources.
- Represent third parties that your browser connected to without interruption.
- Important to monitor as a high count may indicate many active third-party connections.

### Stealth-Blocked Domains ("stealth-blocked")
- Domains for which requests were redirected or handled stealthily by content blockers.
- These connections are blocked in a way that prevents detection by webpages.
- Helps you gauge the invisible blocking effectiveness.

### Blocked Domains ("blocked")
- Domains where network requests were explicitly blocked and failed.
- Shows the impact of your content blocker or other network defenses.

Each category lists domains with a count badge indicating the number of requests to that domain.

<Note>
The interface always shows the domain names using their Unicode representation for readability, even if originally encoded in Punycode.
</Note>

## 3. Interpreting the Badge Count on the Toolbar

The badge count shown on the uBO Scope browser action icon reflects:

- **The number of distinct third-party domains for which connections were allowed in the current tab.**

This count represents how many unique external servers your browser successfully communicated with on that page.

<Tip>
A lower badge count generally indicates fewer active third-party connections, which is often preferable for privacy and performance.
</Tip>

If the count is zero, no allowed third-party connections were detected for the active tab.

## 4. Step-by-Step: Viewing and Using the Popup Interface

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. The popup window appears, automatically loading data for the currently active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the Tab Hostname">
At the top, confirm the displayed hostname matches the tab you wish to investigate.

- The popup distinguishes between the full hostname and the main domain.
- Example: For "shop.example.com", "shop." is displayed separately from "example.com".
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domain Counts">
Look at the "domains connected:" summary.

- This count totals all unique allowed domains.
- Compare this number to the toolbar badge count for consistency.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Allowed Domains Section">
This section lists all domains from which your browser successfully retrieved resources.

- Each domain entry shows how many requests were made.
- Scroll through the list for detailed inspection.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Stealth-Blocked Domains Section">
Check this area to see domains blocked stealthily (without detection by webpages).

- Useful to assess stealth blocking effectiveness.
- Domains here are not directly accessible by the page.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Blocked Domains Section">
Review explicitly blocked domains where requests were stopped.

- Confirms your content blocking is actively preventing requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Data">
Use these lists to assess privacy exposure, third-party interactions, and your content blocker’s impact.

- Large allowed domain counts might indicate aggressive third-party tracking.
- A populated stealth section suggests subtle blocking in effect.
- A strong blocked domain list indicates active blocking patterns.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Refresh the popup data whenever you switch tabs** to get an accurate, real-time report on the selected tab’s network connections.
- **Remember the badge count reflects only distinct allowed third-party domains,** not total requests made.
- **Use the domain counts to identify potential unexpected trackers or CDNs.** Legitimate CDNs often contribute to allowed domains but generally represent minimal privacy concerns.
- **A high stealth-blocked listing is a good sign** of advanced content blocking working effectively.

<Warning>
The popup shows data for the active tab session only. It does not aggregate data across multiple tabs or browser windows.
</Warning>

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting Scenarios">
<Accordion title="Popup Displays 'NO DATA' or Blank">
- Ensure that you have at least one active tab open with network activity.
- Refresh the tab or reload the popup to force data refresh.
- Verify that the extension has necessary permissions: activeTab, webRequest, and storage.
- See the ‹Troubleshooting Common Issues› guide for detailed steps.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Doesn't Update Correctly">
- Badge counts may lag if network requests are delayed.
- Try reloading the active tab or waiting a moment for updates.
- Confirm no other extensions interfere with network events.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Lists Seem Incomplete">
- The extension relies on the browser’s webRequest API, which some network requests might bypass.
- Certain browsing modes or privacy shields may limit network tracking.
- Review browser compatibility and permission settings to ensure full data capture.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Next Steps

- After exploring the popup interface, deepen your understanding by reviewing the [Interpreting Network Activity and the Badge Counter](../../../guides/using-ubo-scope/interpreting-network-activity) guide.
- For troubleshooting in detail, visit the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../../../getting-started/using-validating/troubleshooting) page.
- Gain insight on the extension’s core concepts and key terminology in the [Key Terminology and Concepts](../../../overview/core-concepts-architecture/key-terminology) documentation.

Your exploration of the popup interface will give you direct insight into how your browser interacts with external servers, empowering you to make informed privacy decisions while browsing.

### Illustrative Example

If you visit a news website, clicking the uBO Scope icon might show:

- **domains connected:** 5
- Allowed domains include content delivery networks (CDNs) and necessary ad servers.
- Stealth-blocked domains show trackers silently prevented.
- Blocked domains list includes explicit ad or tracker domains you banned.

This empowers you to quickly judge the network footprint of your browsing session.
