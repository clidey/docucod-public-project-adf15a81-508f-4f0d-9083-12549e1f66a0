# Troubleshooting Installation & Setup

Discover practical solutions for the most common issues encountered during the installation and initial setup of uBO Scope. This guide will help you diagnose problems such as missing badge counts, unexpected browser permission requests, or an unresponsive extension user interface. Follow the checks and resolutions below to get uBO Scope running smoothly.

---

## 1. Verify Browser Compatibility and Version

uBO Scope relies on certain browser versions and APIs to function correctly.

### Check Your Browser Version

- **Chrome:** Version 122 or later
- **Firefox:** Version 128 or later
- **Safari:** Version 18.5 or later


#### How to Check:
1. Open your browser.
2. Go to `About` or `Help` menu (e.g., `chrome://settings/help` for Chrome).
3. Confirm the version meets or exceeds the required minimum.

<Tip>
Using an outdated browser can cause uBO Scope to malfunction or not appear. Always keep your browser updated to the latest stable release.
</Tip>


## 2. Confirm Extension Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network requests properly.

### Required Permissions:
- **activeTab** — Allows the extension to access information about the active tab.
- **webRequest** — Enables capturing and auditing network requests initiated by webpages.
- **storage** — Required for saving session data and settings.


#### How to Verify Permissions:
1. Open your browser’s extension management page.
2. Locate uBO Scope and check its permissions listed.
3. If any are missing, try disabling and re-enabling the extension, or reinstalling.

<Warning>
If permission prompts are declined, uBO Scope will not function correctly. Grant all requested permissions when installing.
</Warning>

## 3. Identify Badge and Popup Behavior Issues

### Scenario: No Badge Number Appears

- This indicates uBO Scope has not yet recorded any third-party remote server connections.
- **Steps to resolve:**
  1. Visit a website known to have third-party content (e.g., https://news.ycombinator.com).
  2. Wait a few seconds for the badge to refresh.
  3. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup and see detailed domain info.

<Tip>
Sites with minimal or no external connections (e.g., plain text pages) will naturally not generate a badge count.
</Tip>

### Scenario: Popup Is Unresponsive or Shows 'NO DATA'

- This usually means the extension failed to collect data for the current tab.

**Check:**
- Refresh the current webpage.
- Restart the browser to ensure background scripts reload.
- Temporarily disable other extensions that might interfere with uBO Scope's access.

<Note>
Interaction with other content blockers or privacy extensions might suppress some network request events that uBO Scope relies on.
</Note>

## 4. Common Causes and Fixes for Setup Problems

### Missing Badge or Empty Display

- **Cause:** The extension might not have permission to access tab data.
- **Fix:** Reinstall uBO Scope and accept all permission prompts during installation.

### Persistent Permission Dialogs

- **Cause:** The browser's security settings may restrict the extension.
- **Fix:** Adjust browser settings to allow extensions full activeTab and webRequest permissions.

### No Network Data Collected

- **Cause:** Sites accessed via protocols not monitored (e.g., FTP, file://) or browser features that bypass webRequest API.
- **Fix:** Test with HTTPS or HTTP URLs. Confirm the site causes network connections.

### Browser API Limitations

- Some browsers or versions may handle webRequest API differently, affecting data availability.

<Tip>
Consult the Supported Browsers & Requirements guide for detailed compatibility information.
</Tip>

## 5. Step-by-Step Diagnostic Checklist

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm Browser Version">
Check your browser version is up-to-date and meets uBO Scope requirements.
</Step>
<Step title="Allow All Permissions">
Ensure you granted all requested permissions to uBO Scope.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload Active Tab">
Refresh the webpage you want to analyze so the extension can capture data.
</Step>
<Step title="Check for Badge Count">
Look at the toolbar icon badge for a numeric count of connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Open Extension Popup">
Click the toolbar icon and check the popup for domain information.
</Step>
<Step title="Disable Conflicting Extensions">
Temporarily disable other extensions that might block or interfere with web requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Restart Browser">
Completely close and reopen your browser; this refreshes all extension processes.
</Step>
<Step title="Reinstall uBO Scope">
If issues persist, uninstall then reinstall uBO Scope from the official store.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Additional Troubleshooting Tips

- **Clear Browser Cache and Storage:** Old cached data or storage issues may cause stale or missing information.
- **Disable VPN or Proxy Temporarily:** Network routing may block or modify requests uBO Scope attempts to observe.
- **Test With Different Websites:** Some sites may have unusual network behaviors; testing multiple sites helps isolate the problem.
- **Check Browser Console Logs:** Developer tools may show errors related to extension scripts.

<Note>
If the extension popup loads but remains empty, waiting a few moments or interacting with the page may trigger data updates.
</Note>
