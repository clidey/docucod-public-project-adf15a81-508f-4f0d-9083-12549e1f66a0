# Validating Successful Installation of uBO Scope

Ensuring uBO Scope is correctly installed and running is critical to start gaining clear insights into third-party connections your browser makes. This guide walks you through practical, step-by-step actions to confirm that the extension is operational and accurately reporting remote server connections.

---

## 1. Understanding What to Expect

uBO Scope's main indicator is the badge count on its toolbar icon, representing the number of distinct third-party domains your current tab connects to. This count is your real-time privacy snapshot. The extension's popup interface further breaks down these domains by connection outcome: allowed (not blocked), blocked, and stealth-blocked.

By validating both the badge and popup contents on well-known websites, you can be confident that uBO Scope is functioning as intended.

<Check>
Be sure uBO Scope is installed according to the installation instructions specific to your browser (see the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/essentials-setup/installation-methods)).

## 2. Step-By-Step Validation Procedure

### Step 1: Open a Known Website

Choose a commonly used website that loads multiple third-party resources (e.g., a major news site or a social media homepage). This ensures network activity for uBO Scope to observe.

### Step 2: Observe the Toolbar Icon Badge

Look at the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
- The badge should display a number indicating distinct third-party domains connected.
- If no number appears, it means zero third-party connections were detected or the extension is inactive.

### Step 3: Open the uBO Scope Popup

Click the toolbar icon to open the extension’s popup interface.

### Step 4: Verify Tab Hostname Display

At the top of the popup, confirm the hostname of the current tab is shown. It should reflect the website domain you opened.

### Step 5: Review the Summary Count

Check the `domains connected:` count near the top summary section. This should match or be consistent with the badge number.

### Step 6: Examine Domain Lists by Outcome

The popup lists domains in three categories:
- **Not blocked (allowed):** Domains where connections were successful.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where connections were prevented stealthily.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections failed or were blocked normally.

Verify there are meaningful domains under at least one of these categories, demonstrating active monitoring.

### Step 7: Confirm Domain Names Make Sense

Compare the domains listed with your expectations for the website.
- Legitimate domains and common third parties (e.g., content delivery networks) should appear.
- Suspicious or unexpected domain lists warrant further investigation.

## 3. Tips and Best Practices

- **Reload the page** to refresh connection data before checking the popup.
- Test multiple websites to see varied connection profiles.
- Keep in mind that some minimal or privacy-conscious sites may legitimately show very few or no third-party connections.
- Having multiple content blockers active may affect the number and type of blocked domains seen.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Validation Problems">
<Accordion title="No Badge Number or Empty Popup">
- Confirm the extension is enabled and active in your browser’s extensions page.
- Verify the browser version meets minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Ensure you have visited a website that makes network requests, not a blank or internal page.
- Try restarting the browser.
- Check permissions granted to the extension, particularly site access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Unexpected Hostname">
- Reload the current tab and reopen the popup.
- Check if any other extensions interfere with webRequest API.
- Verify uBO Scope has permission to read the active tab.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Discrepancies Between Badge and Popup Counts">
- Badge reflects distinct third-party domains allowed.
- Popup shows granular detail; counts may differ due to stealth or blocked domains.
- Reload website and wait a few seconds for data to update.
</Accordion>

## 5. Verifying Installation With a Quick Check Example

1. Visit https://news.ycombinator.com/ (a website with multiple third-party requests).
2. Look at the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge. It should display a positive number.
3. Click the icon to open the popup.
4. Confirm the hostname at the top matches 'news.ycombinator.com'.
5. Review the 'domains connected' count and domain lists.

If these checks pass, uBO Scope is successfully monitoring network connections.

---

## 6. Understanding the Underlying Data

The popup’s domain lists categorize connections using the extension’s internal monitoring:
- Allowed connections are those which complete successfully.
- Blocked connections failed or were explicitly blocked.
- Stealth-blocked connections were silently prevented (often by stealthy content blockers).

Each domain entry shows the number of connections originating from that domain within the current tab.
