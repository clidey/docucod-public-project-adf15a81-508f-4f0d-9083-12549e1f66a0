# Troubleshooting Common Installation Problems

When installing uBO Scope, most users find the process smooth, but sometimes issues can arise that prevent the extension from working properly or appearing as expected. This guide walks you through the typical setbacks encountered during installation and provides clear, actionable solutions to get you up and running quickly.

---

## 1. Extension Does Not Appear After Installation

### Symptoms

- The uBO Scope icon does not show in the browser toolbar.
- The extension seems installed but is not accessible.

### Solutions

1. **Confirm Successful Installation**
    - Visit your browser's extensions page:
      - **Chrome/Chromium:** `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`
      - **Firefox:** `about:addons`
      - **Safari:** Safari menu > Preferences > Extensions
    - Verify that uBO Scope is listed and enabled.

2. **Show Toolbar Icon Manually**
    - Some browsers may hide extension icons by default.
    - **Chrome/Chromium:**
      - Click the puzzle piece icon near the toolbar.
      - Find uBO Scope and click the pin icon to keep it visible.
    - **Firefox:**
      - Right-click the toolbar, select "Customize Toolbar...", and drag the uBO Scope icon to the toolbar.

3. **Reload the Browser**
    - Restart your browser to ensure the extension loads properly.

4. **Check for Profile or User Issues**
    - Try creating a new browser profile and install uBO Scope there to isolate profile-specific problems.

## 2. Permissions Are Missing or Denied

### Symptoms

- The extension fails to monitor network connections.
- Popup shows "NO DATA" or stale data.
- Toolbar badge count remains empty despite browsing.

### Solutions

1. **Review Extension Permissions**
    - During installation, uBO Scope requests permissions such as `webRequest` and `storage`.
    - Denial of these permissions limits functionality.

2. **Grant Host Permissions**
    - The extension requests access to all HTTP/S and WebSocket URLs.
    - In some browsers, permissions need to be allowed on specific sites:
      - Go to the extensions management page and check "Site access".
      - Set it to "On all sites" or add exceptions where you want monitoring.

3. **Disable Conflicting Extensions Temporarily**
    - Some privacy or security extensions might block network access to uBO Scope.
    - Disable such extensions temporarily and test if uBO Scope works.

4. **Check Browser Policies and Enterprise Restrictions**
    - Managed or corporate environments may block extensions or restrict permissions.
    - Contact your administrator or test on an unmanaged browser installation.

## 3. Installation Blocked by Browser or Security Software

### Symptoms

- Browser refuses to install the extension.
- Security software or antivirus alerts or blocks the extension installation.

### Solutions

1. **Verify Browser Version Compatibility**
    - Supported minimum versions:
      - Chromium-based browsers: version 122 or above
      - Firefox: version 128 or above
      - Safari: version 18.5 or above
    - Upgrade your browser if below these minimums.

2. **Install from Official Stores Only**
    - Install uBO Scope only from these official sources:
      - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
      - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
      - Safari Extensions Gallery or via Safari preferences

3. **Whitelist or Allow Extension in Antivirus/Firewall**
    - Some security software flags extensions as suspicious.
    - Add uBO Scope to allowed lists or temporarily disable protection during install.

4. **Use Developer Mode Installation (Advanced)**
    - If official stores are inaccessible, advanced users can install manually in developer mode.
    - Follow browser-specific instructions for loading unpacked extensions with the project source.
    - *Note:* This method is recommended only for advanced users.

## 4. No Network Data Is Displayed in Popup

### Symptoms

- Badge count is blank or zero.
- Popup shows "NO DATA" or no domains connected.

### Solutions

1. **Ensure You Are Browsing HTTP/S or WebSocket Sites**
    - uBO Scope listens only to network requests matching configured host permissions (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
    - Visit common HTTPS websites with embedded third-party content to generate network activity.

2. **Verify Network Request Monitoring in Background Script**
    - Background service worker handles request logging; its failure can cause empty data.
    - Reload the extension or the browser to reset the background process.

3. **Check for Conflicting Content Blockers**
    - Some blockers with aggressive network filtering may prevent uBO Scope from receiving events.
    - Temporarily disable other blockers and test.

4. **Clear Browser Session Storage**
    - The extension stores session data that could become corrupted.
    - Remove stored session data from browser storage and restart.
