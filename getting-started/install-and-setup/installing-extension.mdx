## 2. Alternative: Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

For those who prefer control or need to sideload the extension (e.g., development, testing, or restricted environments), follow these platform-specific steps.

### Step 1: Download Source Package

Clone or download the latest release of uBO Scope from the official GitHub repository:

```bash
# Clone the repository
  git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
  cd uBO-Scope
```

### Step 2: Build the Extension Package (Linux/macOS)

Use the provided script to generate a build for your platform (chromium, firefox, safari):

```bash
./tools/make-package.sh chromium 1.0.1
```

> Replace `chromium` with `firefox` or `safari` as needed.
> The second argument sets the version string and is optional.

### Step 3: Load the Extension into Your Browser

#### Chrome

1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle in the top right.
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the generated build directory, e.g., `build/uBO-Scope.chromium`.
5. Confirm the extension loads and the icon appears.

#### Firefox

1. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Select the manifest file (e.g., `build/uBO-Scope.firefox/manifest.json`).
4. The extension is now active until Firefox closes.

#### Safari

Safari requires a different process due to security restrictions. Refer to the [official Safari extension development guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions).

## 3. Verification Post-Installation

After installing uBO Scope, verify that it is functioning correctly:

1. Open a website (e.g., your favorite news site).
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. You should see a popup summarizing third-party domain connections — divided into "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked".
4. The badge on the icon displays the count of distinct third-party servers connected during page load.

<Tip>
A badge showing a numerical count means uBO Scope is actively monitoring network requests. No badge or a blank badge suggests the extension is not yet active or lacks data.
</Tip>

## 4. Common Installation Tips & Best Practices

- **Browser Version Compliance:** Always update your browser to the stated minimum versions to ensure seamless operation.
- **Extension Permissions:** uBO Scope requires permissions including `webRequest`, `storage`, and access to all `http`/`https` URLs to monitor network requests accurately.
- **Restart Browser After Installation:** Some browsers need restart post-installation for full activation.
- **Pin uBO Scope Icon:** Keep the extension icon visible for quick access.

<Note>
If you use other content blocking extensions, uBO Scope will monitor connections regardless of those extensions’ activity, offering reliable network visibility.
