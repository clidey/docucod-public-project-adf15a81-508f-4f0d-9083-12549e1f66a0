# Requirements & Supported Browsers

This page provides a clear, practical summary of the essential prerequisites you need to use uBO Scope effectively. Before installing or launching the extension, confirm your system and browser meet the necessary criteria, including operating system compatibility, browser version requirements, and permissions needed for full functionality.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems and Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to work across major desktop and mobile platforms with support for the latest versions of popular browsers. Ensure your environment aligns with the following supported configurations:

| Platform      | Supported Browsers                        | Minimum Required Version           |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Windows, macOS, Linux Desktop | Google Chrome (Chromium-based)                  | Chrome 122 and above              |
|               | Mozilla Firefox                          | Firefox 128 and above             |
|               | Apple Safari                            | Safari 18.5 and above             |
| Android       | Mozilla Firefox for Android             | Firefox 128 and above (if available) |


<Info>
Compatibility covers both desktop and mobile variants where the browser supports the WebExtensions Manifest v3 API necessary for uBO Scope.
</Info>

## 2. Browser Permissions Required

The extension requires the following permissions to operate fully and deliver meaningful insights into network connections:

- **activeTab**: To access and associate network activity with the currently active browser tab.
- **storage**: To persist session data and the Public Suffix List securely within the browser.
- **webRequest**: To monitor and record network requests and their outcomes in real-time.
- **host_permissions**: Permissions covering `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and WebSocket protocols (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) are required to intercept network requests from all usual web protocols.

These permissions are declared explicitly in the browser extension manifests under the `permissions` and `host_permissions` fields.

## 3. System Requirements

While uBO Scope is lightweight and optimized, ensure your system meets general web browsing standards:

- Internet connection for initial Public Suffix List download and normal web browsing.
- Browser storage availability to cache settings and lists.
- Adequate system resources for smooth browser operation (modern machines with reasonable RAM and CPU).

## 4. Public Suffix List Handling

uBO Scope relies heavily on Mozilla’s Public Suffix List to correctly analyze domains and subdomains. This list is automatically managed:

- On first launch, the extension fetches the latest Public Suffix List from the official source (`https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat`).
- The list is stored locally in a serialized form to speed up subsequent operations.
- Unicode domain names are converted to ASCII using Punycode to ensure correct processing.

<Tip>
You do not need to manually install or update the Public Suffix List; this process is handled transparently.
</Tip>

## 5. Installation Compatibility Notes

- **Google Chrome (Chromium-based browsers)**
  - Requires Chrome version 122 or newer due to the use of Manifest v3 and modern APIs.
- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Requires Firefox version 128 or newer; legacy Firefox versions are unsupported.
- **Apple Safari**
  - Requires Safari 18.5 or newer with strict MV3 support.

<Warning>
Older browser versions will likely prevent proper installation or function due to lacking Manifest v3 or `webRequest` API support.
</Warning>

## 6. Summary of Browser Manifest Settings

Each supported browser platform declares essential metadata and permissions in its `manifest.json` configuration located under respective platform folders:

- `platform/chromium/manifest.json`
- `platform/firefox/manifest.json`
- `platform/safari/manifest.json`

These manifests ensure uniform behavior, authorize permissions, and specify background scripts and UI elements like toolbar icons and popup interfaces.

## 7. Next Steps

With your environment confirmed compatible and prerequisites met:

- Proceed to the **Installing uBO Scope** guide for step-by-step installation instructions.
- After installation, visit **First Launch & Activation** to learn how to activate and begin using uBO Scope.

## Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues & Resolutions">
<Accordion title="Extension installation fails or is blocked">
If your browser does not meet the minimum required version or restricts Manifest v3 extensions, installation may fail. Update the browser to the latest stable version and enable necessary permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions denied or restricted">
Ensure that you explicitly allow the extension to access requested permissions during installation or enable them in the browser’s extension management page.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Public Suffix List fails to load">
Verify internet connectivity on first launch, and that the URL `https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat` is reachable without firewall restrictions.
