## 1. Locating uBO Scope in Your Browser Toolbar

After installing uBO Scope through the Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons page, or Safari Extensions gallery, you need to find and access the extension’s icon in your browser's toolbar.

### Steps to Find and Pin uBO Scope:

1. **Check the Browser Toolbar:**
   - Look for the uBO Scope icon—a shield emblem with a badge counter. 
   - On browsers like Chrome and Firefox, the icon usually appears to the right of the address bar.

2. **Pin the Extension for Easy Access:**
   - In Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge):
     - Click the puzzle piece icon to view all installed extensions.
     - Find 'uBO Scope' and click the pin icon to place it permanently in the toolbar.
   - In Firefox:
     - Click the hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) > Add-ons and Themes > Extensions.
     - Alternatively, drag the icon into the toolbar area.

3. **Verify the Icon Appearance:** The icon should be visible without needing to open menus, ready for instant activity.

<Tip>
Pinning uBO Scope ensures rapid access to your connection insights on any webpage without hunting through menus.
</Tip>

## 2. Confirming the Extension is Enabled

Simply locating the icon doesn’t guarantee uBO Scope is active and ready. Verify its enabled state with the following steps:

1. **Inspect Browser Extension Flags:**
   - Open your browser’s extensions page:
     - **Chrome:** `chrome://extensions`
     - **Firefox:** `about:addons`
     - **Safari:** Preferences > Extensions

2. **Locate uBO Scope:** Scroll to find the entry for uBO Scope.

3. **Ensure the Toggle is ON:** The extension should be enabled (toggle switch active).

4. **Check for Any Warnings:** Be alert for permission warnings or errors around activation.

<Warning>
If the extension is disabled, uBO Scope will not monitor network requests or display any information.
</Warning>

## 3. Granting Necessary Permissions

uBO Scope operates by monitoring network requests via browser APIs, which require explicit permissions granted at install or upon first use. If permissions weren't granted during installation or if you need to review them, follow this process:

### How to Check and Grant Permissions:

1. **Review Permissions Requirements:** uBO Scope requires access to:
   - Active tab information
   - Storage access
   - WebRequest API usage (network request monitoring)

2. **Prompt for Permissions Automatically:**
   - On first activation, the browser should prompt you to accept these permissions.

3. **Manually Adjust Permissions if Needed:**
   - On Chrome and Edge, use the extensions page (`chrome://extensions`), click "Details" under uBO Scope, and ensure permissions are allowed.
   - In Firefox, check the Add-ons Manager and verify permissions are granted.

4. **Confirm Permissions Enable Full Network Listening:**
   - The extension requires permissions to monitor URLs that begin with `http://`, `https://`, `ws://`, and `wss://`.

<Note>
Without full permissions, uBO Scope will not report connection data accurately.
</Note>

## 4. Initiating Your First Run

Once uBO Scope is visible and enabled, perform these actions to observe it in action:

### Step-by-step First Operation

1. **Navigate to a Website:** Open any webpage in the current browser window.

2. **Click the uBO Scope Icon:** Click the toolbar icon to open the popup panel.

3. **View Connection Summary:** 
   - The popup shows the hostname of the current tab and a count of distinct third-party remote domains your browser has connected to through this page.
   - Details are grouped into three categories:
     - **Not Blocked:** Domains successfully connected.
     - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains redirected stealthily.
     - **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were blocked.

4. **Interpret the Badge:**
   - The numeric badge on the icon shows the count of distinct allowed remote domains.
   - A lower badge number is better, indicating fewer third-party connections.

<Tip>
Refresh the webpage several times or navigate to varied sites to watch how uBO Scope updates connection data live.
