# Post-Installation Configuration

Customize uBO Scope's settings to refine your insights into network activity. This guide walks you through understanding default behaviors, interpreting the toolbar badge, and adjusting optional preferences to tailor the extension for your needs.

---

## 1. Understanding Default Behaviors

uBO Scope comes ready to monitor and report remote server connections with minimal setup. By default:

- The extension tracks **distinct third-party remote servers** contacted by the active browser tab.
- Only network requests observable through the browser's `webRequest` API are reported.
- The toolbar icon badge displays the count of unique third-party domains with allowed connections (lower is better).

<Check>
Note: Not all third-party servers are inherently harmful; for example, legitimate Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are expected to appear with low counts.
</Check>

## 2. Toolbar Badge and Popup Interface Explained

The badge and popup provide your primary interaction and overview:

- **Badge Count**: Displays the number of unique third-party domains with **allowed** connections for the current tab.
- **Popup Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains from which resources loaded successfully.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains associated with connections that were redirected or stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked**: Domains with connections explicitly blocked (e.g., network errors).

### How to Access:

1. Click the **uBO Scope toolbar icon** in your browser.
2. Review the popup summary to see all tracked connections categorized by outcome.

## 3. Customizing Preferences

### Current Scope

uBO Scope does not expose a complex settings interface but offers key configurable options to tailor your experience:

- The extension maintains **per-tab session data**, automatically resetting on navigation or tab closure.
- No manual configuration files or environment variables are necessary.

### Tips for Optimizing Use

- **Monitor legitimate third-party servers by observing the "Not Blocked" section**, helping distinguish benign from suspicious connections.
- Use the badge count as an **immediate privacy indicator**: a sudden spike may hint at increased third-party tracking.
- Regularly **close and reopen tabs or reset the browser** if you want to clear network session data for fresh measurements.

## 4. Managing Permissions and Updates

### Permissions

Ensure appropriate permissions were granted during installation for:

- `webRequest` and `host_permissions` (http, https, ws, wss) — essential for observing network requests.
- `storage` — to save session and public suffix list data.

Check your browser’s extension management page if you need to adjust permissions post-installation.

### Updates

- uBO Scope is designed as a lightweight and stable tool with minimal updates.
- Feature improvements, especially those useful for filter list maintainers, will be rolled out progressively; keeping your extension updated ensures access to these.

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting & Tips">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Remains Empty or Stuck">
- Verify the extension has the required permissions and is enabled.
- Reload the active tab to initiate fresh monitoring.
- Confirm your browser version meets the minimum support (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Data in Popup on Active Tab">
- Make sure you are on a webpage with network activity.
- Some network requests might be invisible if initiated outside the scope of the browser’s `webRequest` API.
- Consider restarting the browser if the problem persists.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Understanding Badge Count Fluctuations">
- A high badge count could result from tracking scripts or CDNs loading many resource domains.
- Regular browsing of content-rich sites will naturally fluctuate these counts.
- Use uBO Scope as an observation tool rather than a strict blocking measure.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Best Practices for Effective Use

- Use uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blocker for **transparent awareness of network connections**, rather than blocking control.
- Regularly check the popup to assess the **number of distinct third-party domains connected** during sessions.
- Share insights with filter list maintainers or developers to help improve filtering without assumptions from block counts.
- Avoid relying on "ad blocker test" webpages, as they do not reflect real-world network behavior and can be misleading.
