# First Run & Minimal Configuration

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through what to expect on your first launch, how to access the extension’s popup interface, and the surprisingly minimal configuration needed to start gaining insight into your browser’s remote server connections immediately. 

---

## 1. Accessing the uBO Scope Extension Popup

The primary user interface for uBO Scope is a compact popup, accessible directly from your browser toolbar:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope Icon**
   - After installation, look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s extension toolbar. It usually appears next to the address bar.
   - The icon features the uBO Scope logo, as defined in the extension’s manifest.

2. **Open the Popup Panel**
   - Click the icon to open the popup window.
   - The popup displays real-time information about the current tab’s remote server connections.

3. **Understanding the Popup Data**
   - The popup lists distinct domains connected to by the webpage, categorized by whether connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
   - You can explore these categories to get immediate insight into how many third-party connections your browser made for the current tab.

<Tip>
You do not need any prior configuration to start getting data in the popup. The extension begins collecting and displaying connection data automatically as soon as the browser loads network requests.
</Tip>

## 2. What Happens on Your First Launch?

- **Automatic Background Monitoring**: Upon installation and first activation, uBO Scope’s background service worker starts monitoring all network requests relevant to your browser tabs.
- **No Manual Setup Required**: The extension uses built-in browser APIs (like `webRequest`) combined with internal tracking to record outcomes of network requests without any user intervention.
- **Instant Badge Updates**: You will notice the toolbar icon badge dynamically displaying the count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted from the active tab.
- **Popup Data Population**: As network data accumulates, the popup populated with categorized domain details reflects live connection outcomes—allowing you to assess the web page’s network footprint immediately.

<Info>
Browser permissions are requested during installation. These include access to webRequest APIs and activeTab, which are essential for uBO Scope to monitor network traffic effectively. No additional permission prompts occur during first use.
</Info>

## 3. Minimal to Non-Existent Configuration

uBO Scope is designed to "just work" out of the box. Here’s what you need to know about configuration:

- **No User Configuration for Basic Use**
  - You do not need to adjust settings, create rules, or configure filters to begin monitoring connections.
  - The extension automatically detects and processes network requests for all active tabs.

- **Permission Requirements**
  - The extension requires permission to observe network requests across HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS protocols.
  - These permissions are declared in the manifest and requested transparently when installing the extension.
  - Ensure your browser supports manifest version 3 and the relevant APIs (Chromium ≥ 122, Firefox ≥ 128, Safari ≥ 18.5).

- **Session Persistence**
  - uBO Scope maintains session data that includes recorded tab network activities.
  - This data is automatically loaded and saved by the background script, so no manual management is necessary.

<Note>
If you uninstall or disable uBO Scope, session data will be cleared or inaccessible until you reinstall and reactivate the extension.
</Note>

## 4. Toolbar Badge: Your Instant Status Indicator

The badge number visible on the extension icon provides a quick-glance summary:

- **What the Badge Shows**
  - Number of distinct third-party remote servers with allowed connections for the active tab.
  - A lower badge count typically means fewer third-party server communications, which may indicate better privacy.

- **Badge Updates**
  - The badge is updated automatically based on the recorded network request outcomes.
  - It reflects all network requests regardless of what content blocker is in place, including those blocked by DNS or other means outside extension control.

- **Interpreting the Badge**
  - A badge of zero means no remote third-party connections were allowed.
  - Higher numbers indicate more third-party servers communicated with, regardless of resource type or request purpose.

<Warning>
Do not assume a higher badge number means a content blocker is less effective. The badge only counts unique third-party remote servers contacted and does not distinguish between benign or malicious connections.
</Warning>

## 5. Verifying uBO Scope is Active and Functioning

To confirm the extension is working:

1. Open any website in a new tab.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
3. Observe the domains listed as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
4. Note the badge number, which should reflect the count of allowed third-party servers.

If the popup shows no data or the badge stays empty:
- Refresh the tab to reload network requests.
- Check browser permissions for the extension.
- Verify your browser version meets minimum requirements.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Initial Issues

<AccordionGroup title="First Run Troubleshooting"> 
<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA or Empty Results">
Check if the active tab is a valid webpage (not a blank tab or internal browser page). uBO Scope cannot monitor non-webpage tabs.

Reload the page to trigger network requests.

Ensure browser permissions are granted during extension installation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Toolbar Badge Is Not Updating">
Make sure the extension is enabled and properly installed.

Confirm the browser version meets or exceeds manifest requirements.

Try restarting the browser to reset extension state.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permissions Prompt Not Displayed During Install">
Permissions are requested upfront on installation. If you skipped or denied permissions, uBO Scope will not function correctly.

Reinstall the extension and accept all permissions.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Next Steps After First Run

- Explore the [Understanding the Popup Interface](/getting-started/first-use-and-validation/understanding-the-popup) to learn how to interpret connection data.

- Review [Validating Your Installation](/getting-started/first-use-and-validation/validating-installation) to confirm correct operation.

- If you encounter issues, consult [Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/troubleshooting-installation).

- For detailed conceptual understanding, see [Core Concepts and Terminology](/overview/getting-started-concepts/core-concepts-terminology).

<Tip>
uBO Scope requires no advanced configuration to start delivering value — your primary setup task is installation and granting permissions. After that, the extension quietly and reliably monitors your browser’s network connections.
