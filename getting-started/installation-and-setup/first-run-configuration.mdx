# First-Run Configuration

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through the essential steps to get your extension up and running for the very first time. You'll learn how the extension initializes, which permissions to accept, and how to verify it is actively monitoring network connections in your browser.

---

## 1. Understanding What Happens on First Run

When you install uBO Scope in your browser, it immediately begins tracking the network requests of each active tab. To function properly, it needs certain permissions and browser features to be enabled.

- **Permissions requested:**
  - Access to the active tab (`activeTab`)
  - Storage access to save its session data (`storage`)
  - Access to observe and process network requests via `webRequest` API (`webRequest`)

- **Initialization Steps:**
  - Loads the Public Suffix List (PSL) to correctly identify domains and subdomains.
  - Initializes session storage to keep track of network requests per tab.
  - Sets up listeners to monitor network request outcomes such as successes, redirects, and errors.

> _By categorizing network requests into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked, uBO Scope shows you how many distinct third-party domains are contacted from each tab._

## 2. Accepting Permissions During Installation

Follow these steps to ensure the extension obtains necessary permissions:

<Steps>
<Step title="Install uBO Scope from Browser Store">
- Navigate to the appropriate store for your browser:
  - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) for Chromium-based browsers
  - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) for Firefox
  - Safari Extension Gallery for Safari (minimum version 18.5)
- Click 'Add to browser' or equivalent to initiate installation.
</Step>
<Step title="Grant Permissions Prompted by the Browser">
- When prompted, accept the permissions uBO Scope requests.
- These permissions are essential for uBO Scope to:
  - Access the currently opened tab.
  - Monitor network requests for remote server connections.
  - Store session data locally.
- Refusing these permissions will prevent the extension from functioning correctly.
</Step>
<Step title="Wait for Initialization to Complete">
- After installation, the extension performs initial setup steps, including loading the Public Suffix List.
- This process happens in the background automatically without interaction.
- It typically completes within seconds; no action is required.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Verifying uBO Scope is Active

You want to confirm that uBO Scope is correctly monitoring your browsing activity. Here's how to check:

1. **Locate the Extension Icon**
   - The extension icon usually appears near your browser’s address bar.
   - The icon will display a numeric badge indicating the number of distinct third-party domains connected in the current tab.
2. **Open the Popup Dashboard**
   - Click the uBO Scope icon to open its popup.
   - The popup shows a detailed summary:
     - Number of domains connected.
     - Lists of domains categorized as 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'.
3. **Confirm Network Activity Display**
   - Browse a few websites.
   - Observe the badge count updating dynamically per tab.
   - The popup details should update to reflect these connections.

<Tip>
If you see 'NO DATA' or the badge is blank despite browsing, wait a few seconds and refresh the tab or browser. Some network activity takes time to register.
</Tip>

## 4. Understanding Permissions and Scope of Monitoring

- The extension's core functionality relies on browser APIs that report network requests.
- uBO Scope tracks connections to both HTTP and HTTPS endpoints, including WebSocket connections on Chromium and Firefox.
- The badge count only shows **distinct third-party domains** contacted from each tab, not the total number of requests.

<Warning>
Some browsers or privacy settings might restrict the `webRequest` API or block extensions from accessing certain network events. If uBO Scope is not functioning as expected, verify your browser settings and consider temporarily disabling conflicting extensions.
</Warning>

## 5. Typical User Flow During First Use

- **Install uBO Scope via the browser store and grant permissions.**
- **Browse various websites normally while uBO Scope silently monitors connections.**
- **Click the toolbar icon anytime to view an overview of third-party connections and their blocking status per active tab.**

This immediate feedback helps discover how many external domains websites connect to and reveals stealth or outright blocking done by your content blockers.

## 6. Troubleshooting First-Run Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues on First Run">
<Accordion title="The Extension Icon Does Not Appear">

- Restart the browser if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Badge Count or 'NO DATA' in Popup">
