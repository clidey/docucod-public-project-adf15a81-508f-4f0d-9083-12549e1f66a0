# Troubleshooting Installation

Ensuring uBO Scope installs and operates smoothly across supported browsers sometimes requires resolving setup or permission issues. This guide addresses the most common installation hurdles and empowers you to resolve them quickly, so you can begin monitoring your web connections without delay.

## 1. Common Installation Issues and Solutions

### 1.1 Marketplace or Store Installation Errors
If you encounter errors while installing from browser marketplaces such as the Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons site, or Safari Extensions Gallery, follow these steps:

- **Check Browser Version:**
  - Ensure your browser meets the minimum version requirements:
    - Chrome: version 122.0 or higher
    - Firefox: version 128.0 or higher
    - Safari: version 18.5 or higher
  
- **Confirm Network Connectivity:**
  - Verify your internet connection is stable and not blocking access to the marketplace.

- **Clear Browser Cache:**
  - Sometimes stale cache can cause installation failures. Clear browsing data and retry.

- **Use Official Links:**
  - Always install from trusted sources:
    - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
    - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

### 1.2 uBO Scope Icon Missing After Install
If you have installed uBO Scope but do not see its toolbar icon, perform the following checks:

- **Verify Extension Activation:**
  - Open your browser’s extensions or add-ons manager and confirm uBO Scope is enabled.

- **Pin the Extension Icon:**
  - Modern browsers may hide newly installed icons by default. Pin the uBO Scope icon to your toolbar manually.

- **Restart Browser:**
  - Restarting the browser will often refresh the UI and show all installed extensions.

- **Check Permissions:**
  - The extension requires permissions such as `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`. If permissions were not granted, the icon may not function properly.

### 1.3 Permission Denied or Not Prompted
For uBO Scope to function, it needs explicit permissions to monitor your network requests.

- **Grant Required Permissions on First Launch:**
  - When you first launch uBO Scope after installation, accept prompts for `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` access.

- **Manually Enable Permissions:**
  - If you missed prompts, go to your browser’s extension page, locate uBO Scope, and manually enable permissions.

- **Check Browser Policy Restrictions:**
  - Corporate or managed devices may restrict extension permissions. Contact your administrator if you cannot enable them.

## 2. Verification Steps After Installation

Once installed and permissions granted, verify uBO Scope is working properly:

- **Confirm Toolbar Badge Appears:**
  - Visit any website and look for a numeric badge on the uBO Scope icon indicating distinct third-party domains connected.

- **Open the Popup Panel:**
  - Click the toolbar icon to open the popup. It should display a summary of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains for the active tab.

- **Check Console for Errors:**
  - Open browser developer tools and verify there are no errors related to uBO Scope.

## 3. Troubleshooting Tips

### 3.1 Extension Not Tracking Connections
- Confirm you granted the `webRequest` permission.
- Refresh the active web page after permissions acceptance.
- Ensure no conflicting extensions interfere with network monitoring.

### 3.2 Badge Count Not Updating
- Close and reopen your browser tab.
- Restart the browser if the badge remains unchanged.
- Confirm the extension is properly enabled.

### 3.3 Extension Crashes or Freezes
- Disable other extensions temporarily to check for conflicts.
- Update your browser to the latest version.
- Reinstall uBO Scope if issues persist.

### 3.4 Platform-Specific Notes

- **Chrome / Chromium:** Requires minimum Chrome version 122.0 and has full WebRequest API support.
- **Firefox:** Minimum version 128.0 is required; permissions are managed via `gecko` manifest settings.
- **Safari:** Requires Safari 18.5 or higher; WebRequest is limited to HTTP(S) only, no WebSocket support.
