## 1. Extension Not Installed or Enabled

### Symptoms
- Toolbar icon for uBO Scope is missing
- No popup appears when clicked

### Resolution Steps
1. **Verify installation:**
   - Confirm you installed uBO Scope from the official source:
     - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) for Chromium-based browsers
     - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) for Firefox
     - Safari users must meet Safari 18.5 or newer requirements.

2. **Check extension status:**
   - Open your browser's extensions page:
     - Chrome/Chromium: `chrome://extensions/`
     - Firefox: `about:addons`
     - Safari: Preferences > Extensions
   - Make sure uBO Scope is installed and enabled.

3. **Enable extension if disabled:**
   - Toggle the extension on if it’s turned off.

4. **Browser restart:**
   - Sometimes a browser restart helps complete extension loading.

<Tip>
If you installed uBO Scope manually (e.g., for development), ensure it is loaded properly from your browser’s developer mode extensions page.
</Tip>

## 2. Missing Permissions

### Symptoms
- The extension installs but the badge never appears
- No network connection data shows in the popup

### Resolution Steps
1. **Check required permissions:** uBO Scope requires these permissions to operate:
   - `activeTab` — to access current tab details
   - `storage` — to store session data
   - `webRequest` — to observe network traffic

2. **Confirm permissions granted:**
   - Go to your browser’s extension permissions page and verify that uBO Scope has full permissions for `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` URLs.

3. **Reinstall extension:**
   - If permissions are missing, consider reinstalling uBO Scope through the official source to ensure all permission requests are properly presented.

<Warning>
Restrictive browser policies or privacy sandbox settings may block permission assignment. If you manage your environment centrally, check with your administrator.
</Warning>

## 3. Badge Count Not Appearing or Always Zero

### Symptoms
- The badge near the toolbar icon does not display any number
- You expect some badge count based on your browsing activity

### Resolution Steps
1. **Confirm browser support:**
   - uBO Scope requires recent browser versions:
     - Chromium 122 or higher
     - Firefox 128 or higher
     - Safari 18.5 or higher

2. **Verify webpage activity:**
   - Visit active websites that load third-party content (e.g., popular news sites).
   - uBO Scope relies on network events reported by the browser’s `webRequest` API. If you visit only static or local web pages, the count might be zero.

3. **Check user privacy or content blocking settings:**
   - Some browsers or privacy extensions may limit network event reporting, reducing uBO Scope’s visibility.

4. **Reload the tab:**
   - Refresh the active tab to trigger new network requests that uBO Scope can observe.

<Tip>
The badge displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted. A zero badge typically means either no such connections occurred or they were not observable.
</Tip>

## 4. Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Is Empty

### Symptoms
- Clicking the toolbar icon opens the popup but it shows “NO DATA” or no domain information

### Resolution Steps
1. **Check tab focus:**
   - The popup reflects network data from the currently active tab only. Make sure the active tab is a webpage making network requests.

2. **Allow page to load:**
   - The extension captures network activities after page load begins. Wait a moment before opening the popup.

3. **Check for conflicting extensions:**
   - Other privacy or content-blocking extensions may interfere with uBO Scope’s data collection.

4. **Reload the active tab:**
   - Reload the page to initiate new network connections.

5. **Browser logs:**
   - For advanced troubleshooting, check the browser extension console for errors.

<Warning>
If the popup is persistently empty across multiple sites, verify the extension is up to date and compatible with your browser version.
</Warning>

## 5. Browser Incompatibilities or Version Issues

### Symptoms
- Extension fails to install
- Unexpected errors or no network capturing

### Resolution Steps
1. **Check your browser version:**
   - Ensure your browser meets the minimum version requirements:
     - Chromium-based browsers: version 122+
     - Firefox: version 128+
     - Safari: version 18.5+

2. **Update your browser:**
   - Install the latest stable release to ensure compatibility.

3. **Use supported browsers:**
   - uBO Scope currently supports Chromium, Firefox, and Safari only.

4. **Report bugs:**
   - If issues persist after updating, file an issue at the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/issues) with details about your environment.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Do not trust third-party 'ad blocker test' pages**: These often do not reflect real-world network conditions and can mislead you about uBO Scope’s operation.

- **Understand the badge count meaning**: A higher block count does not necessarily mean better blocking; the badge shows distinct third-party servers actually connected.

- **Avoid manual tampering**: Altering extension files or permissions outside the official setup can break functionality.

- **Be patient**: Network request data accumulates over time; open the popup after browsing to sample sites for meaningful insights.
