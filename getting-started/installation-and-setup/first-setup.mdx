# Initial Configuration

Quickly configure uBO Scope after installation to grant the required permissions, interpret first-run prompts, and ensure the extension is ready to track remote connections from your browser tabs.

---

## 1. Understanding uBO Scope Permissions

uBO Scope relies on specific browser permissions to function correctly. These are requested at install time and include:

- **Active Tab**: Allows the extension to access the URL of the active tab so it can relate network connections to the current website.
- **Web Request**: Enables monitoring of network requests, including their outcomes (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked).
- **Storage**: For saving session data and settings locally.

Depending on your browser (Chromium, Firefox, Safari), these permissions are requested upon installation and must be granted for uBO Scope to fully operate.

<Tip>
If you accidentally deny any permission, revisit your browser's extension settings to manually enable permissions and restart your browser if necessary.
</Tip>

## 2. Responding to First-Run Prompts

On first launch after installation, uBO Scope may display permission prompts or require you to reload the page or browser to activate tracking fully.

### What to Expect:
- **Permission Requests**: Your browser will prompt you to allow uBO Scope access to monitor network requests.
- **No Additional Setup Screens**: uBO Scope does not require configuration beyond permission acceptance.

### Immediate Action:
- Accept all permission prompts.
- If prompted, reload the active tab or all tabs to activate tracking.

<Warning>
Blocking these permissions will prevent uBO Scope from monitoring any network connections. The extension will appear inactive.
</Warning>

## 3. Verifying uBO Scope is Ready

After permissions are granted, verify uBO Scope is properly initialized to track the connections originating from your browsing session.

### Step-by-Step Verification:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Extension Popup">
  Click the uBO Scope icon next to your browser's address bar to open the popup interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Observe the Hostname Display">
  At the top of the popup, you should see the active tab's hostname and domain displayed. If it shows 'NO DATA,' the extension is not tracking correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check the Domain Connection Summary">
  The 'domains connected' count at the summary section should update as you browse, indicating the number of unique third-party servers contacted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Allowed, Stealth, and Blocked Connections">
  Below the summary, three sections show domains grouped by their connection outcome: not blocked (allowed), stealth-blocked, and blocked. These lists populate as uBO Scope collects data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Browse different websites or reload tabs to trigger network activity and ensure data appears in the popup.
</Tip>

## 4. Adjusting Extension Permissions Manually

If you do not see data or the popup remains empty:

1. Open your browser’s extension settings (e.g., `chrome://extensions` in Chromium-based browsers).
2. Find uBO Scope in the list.
3. Ensure all required permissions, especially "Access your data on websites" or similar, are enabled.
4. Reload browser tabs or restart the browser.

## 5. What uBO Scope Tracks After Initial Configuration

- All network requests made by the active tab, categorized into:
  - **Allowed**: Successfully connected domains.
  - **Stealth-blocked**: Connections that were silently redirected or intercepted.
  - **Blocked**: Requests that failed due to blocking or network errors.

- The popup dynamically reflects the state of the active tab’s third-party connections.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Initial Configuration Issues">
<Accordion title="No Data or NO DATA Message in Popup">
- Verify all permissions are granted.
- Confirm the extension is enabled.
- Reload the active tab.
- Restart browser if issues persist.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Prompts Not Showing">
- Ensure your browser is at a supported version (Chromium v122+, Firefox v128+, Safari v18.5+).
- Reinstall the extension to retrigger prompts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- The badge reflects the number of unique third-party domains connected.
- Visit websites that perform network requests to trigger updates.
- Reload tabs if badge remains blank.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Next Steps

With initial configuration complete, you are set to monitor your browser’s remote connections in real-time.

## Appendix: Permissions in Browser Manifests

uBO Scope requires specific permissions declared in browser manifests to monitor requests effectively:

- **Host Permissions**: `http://*/*`, `https://*/*` and optionally `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` depending on browser.
- **API Permissions**: `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`.

These are pre-declared and handled by the browser on installation.
