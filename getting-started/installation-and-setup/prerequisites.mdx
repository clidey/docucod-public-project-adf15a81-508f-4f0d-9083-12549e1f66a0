# System Requirements & Prerequisites for uBO Scope

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to transparently reveal all network connections your browser makes to third-party servers. To leverage its capabilities fully, it requires a minimal set of system and browser features. This guide outlines the necessary requirements and permissions, ensuring you have a seamless installation and optimal operation experience.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope supports all major browsers with extensions manifest version 3 (MV3) compatibility and access to the `webRequest` API:

- **Firefox** 
  - Minimum version: **128.0**
  - Installation available via [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

- **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.)**
  - Minimum version: **122.0**
  - Installation available via [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)

- **Safari**
  - Minimum version: **18.5**
  - Support for Safari is present but limited to HTTP and HTTPS schemes.


<Note>
 uBO Scope requires **Manifest Version 3** extensions support, which aligns with modern browser extension standards. Older browsers lacking MV3 are not supported.
</Note>

## 2. Operating System Compatibility

As a browser extension, uBO Scope runs wherever the supported browsers run. It has been tested and verified on the following platforms:

- **Windows 10 and later**
- **macOS 11 and later**
- **Linux distributions running compatible browser versions**
- **Mobile OS for Firefox and Chromium-based browsers (Android), subject to browser extension support**

<Info>
Performance and UI behavior may vary slightly between desktop and mobile browsers due to differences in extension APIs.

## 3. Permissions and APIs Required

For precise operation, uBO Scope requests the following permissions:

- **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to interact with the currently active browser tab to gather data.
- **`webRequest`**: Core to monitoring all network requests made by web pages to remote servers, including those allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- **`storage`**: Required for reading and writing session and configuration data persisting across browsing sessions.
- **`host_permissions`** requesting access to all HTTP/S and WebSocket URL patterns:
  - `https://*/*`
  - `http://*/*`
  - `wss://*/*`
  - `ws://*/*`


These permissions enable uBO Scope to monitor network requests effectively without interfering with normal browser operation.

<Warning>
Because uBO Scope relies on the `webRequest` API, browsers must support it with full event details for HTTPS and WebSocket connections. If these APIs are limited or absent, uBO Scope cannot reliably report all connection outcomes.
</Warning>

## 4. Network and Environment Considerations

- **Internet Connectivity**: Not strictly required for uBO Scope itself to function, but needed to access external resources and websites for monitoring.

- **Firewall and Proxy Settings**: No special configuration is needed for uBO Scope, but existing network rules that block or modify browser web requests will affect results.

- **Content Blockers Compatibility**: uBO Scope operates independently and in passively observes network requests regardless of other content blockers or DNS-level filtering tools.

---

## 5. Limitations & Known Constraints

- **Network Requests Outside `webRequest` API Scope**: 
  - Requests initiated by browser components outside of the webRequest API (e.g., browser extensions running separately, system-level requests) cannot be tracked.

- **Safari Limitations**:
  - Currently, the extension only requests HTTP/S host permissions (no WebSocket permissions) due to platform restrictions.

- **Browser Beta and Dev Versions**:
  - Using cutting-edge browser versions may cause unexpected issues; stable releases are recommended.

Ensure you accept the required permissions (`activeTab`, `webRequest`, `storage`) during installation.
</Step>
<Step title="Ensure Network Access">
No restrictive firewall or proxy setup is interfering with your browser's network requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Supported Platforms">
Install and run uBO Scope on Windows, macOS, Linux, or compatible mobile browsers.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions on Requirements">
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope work with all versions of Chrome?">
It requires Chrome 122 or newer due to Manifest V3 and webRequest API requirements.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use uBO Scope on mobile browsers?">
Mobile support is limited. Firefox for Android may work if extensions are enabled and meet version requirements; Chromium mobile variants typically lack sufficient MV3 support.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are there performance considerations?">
uBO Scope is lightweight and passive, but monitoring numerous tabs with heavy traffic can slightly impact browser responsiveness.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Ensure you keep your browser updated to maintain compatibility and take advantage of security improvements impacting extensions.
