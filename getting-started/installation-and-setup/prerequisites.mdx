# Prerequisites & Supported Browsers

Ensure your environment meets the requirements to install and run uBO Scope smoothly. This page describes supported browsers, minimum versions, required permissions, and essential compatibility notes to prepare you for a hassle-free setup.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible across major browsers, with specific minimum version requirements to guarantee full functionality:

- **Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge):**
  - Requires **Chrome 122.0** or later.
  - Uses a service worker in Manifest Version 3 background.
- **Firefox (Desktop and Android):**
  - Requires **Firefox 128.0** or later.
- **Safari:**
  - Requires **Safari 18.5** or later.

These requirements ensure that uBO Scope can leverage the necessary browser APIs such as `webRequest` as intended.

<Note>
Older browser versions may lack required APIs or security frameworks needed by uBO Scope and will not operate correctly.
</Note>

## 2. Permissions Required

For uBO Scope to monitor and report remote connections effectively, it requests these permissions during installation:

- **`webRequest`** – to observe network activity directly.
- **`activeTab`** – to interact with the currently active tab for context.
- **`storage`** – to locally store session and configuration data.
- **Host Permissions** – to monitor network requests, uBO Scope requires access to all HTTP and HTTPS URLs:
  - `http://*/*`
  - `https://*/*`
  - For Firefox and Chromium browsers, also includes WebSocket protocols:
    - `ws://*/*`
    - `wss://*/*`

These permissions are vital to capture both typical HTTP/S requests and WebSocket connections, ensuring comprehensive visibility.

<Warning>
During installation, carefully review permissions to understand network data access. uBO Scope only observes and reports — it does not modify or block requests.
</Warning>

## 3. Compatibility Notes

- **Integration with other blockers:**
  uBO Scope works seamlessly alongside other content blockers like uBlock Origin or DNS-based blockers. It measures network activity regardless of whether those blockers allow or block requests.

- **WebRequest API Boundaries:**
  Network requests originating outside the browser context or bypassing the `webRequest` API (such as some WebSocket behaviors or browser internals) cannot be monitored by uBO Scope.

- **Platform-Specific Considerations:**
  - On Safari, due to its extension model and API limitations, uBO Scope requires at least version 18.5.
  - Firefox enforces extension signing and may prompt for additional permissions aligned with its policies.

## 4. System Requirements

uBO Scope itself is lightweight, but your device should meet these general criteria:

- A modern operating system supporting the aforementioned browser versions.
- Stable internet connection to fetch the extension and support data synchronization.
- Sufficient storage to hold session data, though it is minimal.

## 5. Preparation Checklist Before Installation

Follow these sequential steps for readiness:

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm Browser Version">
Check your browser version by navigating to `chrome://settings/help` for Chrome, `about:support` for Firefox, or Safari's About menu.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Required Permissions">
Understand and accept permissions for network monitoring and tab access.
</Step>
<Step title="Ensure Compatibility with Other Extensions">
If running other content blockers, no action is needed for compatibility; uBO Scope will integrate smoothly.
</Step>
<Step title="Disable Conflicting Extensions (if any)" hidden>
Rarely needed, but if you suspect conflicts, disable suspect extensions temporarily.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Compatibility and Permissions">
<Accordion title="My browser version is lower than the minimum required. What can I do?">
Upgrade to the latest browser release to ensure compatibility. Using outdated browsers may expose you to security risks and cause uBO Scope to malfunction.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I am not prompted to grant permissions during install. Is this expected?">
Yes. Browser stores prior permissions for re-installations. On first installs, you must grant the permissions. If permissions seem blocked, check your browser settings or policy restrictions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why does uBO Scope require such broad host permissions?">
This access is necessary to observe network requests across all sites you visit to provide complete visibility. The extension does not alter any traffic.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="uBO Scope does not show any network activity after installation.">
Ensure your browser is supported and meets the minimum version. Also, verify background scripts are running (browser extension icon should appear). Check for error messages in Developer Tools under Extensions.
