# Prerequisites and System Requirements for uBO Scope

Prepare your environment to ensure a smooth installation and optimal operation of uBO Scope. This page details the supported browsers, system environments, minimum browser versions, and essential permissions required to use uBO Scope effectively.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed to work as a browser extension compatible with major modern browsers that support Manifest Version 3 (MV3) extensions and the `webRequest` API.

| Browser       | Minimum Version | Notes                          |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------|
| Google Chrome | 122.0           | Supports full webRequest API   |
| Mozilla Firefox | 128.0          | Includes Firefox Android       |
| Safari        | 18.5            | Limited host permissions       |

> These versions reflect the earliest browsers where uBO Scope can operate reliably given its reliance on recent platform capabilities, including native MV3 support and webRequest permission models.


## 2. System Environment Requirements

- **Operating System:** Compatible with all OS platforms supported by the above browser versions, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android (Firefox only), and iOS (Safari only).
- **Browser Storage & APIs:** Requires browsers that support extension-local storage APIs (`storage.local` and `storage.session`) and provide access to the `webRequest` API for monitoring network activity.

## 3. Permissions Required

For uBO Scope to function properly, it needs specific browser permissions granted during installation:

- **Active Tab Access (`activeTab`):** Enables the extension to monitor and analyze network requests from the currently active tab.
- **Web Request Access (`webRequest`):** Allows uBO Scope to observe network requests made by web pages, including HTTP/S and WebSocket connections.
- **Storage Access (`storage`):** Required to persist session data and caching of public suffix lists that underpin domain parsing.

Additionally, uBO Scope defines host permissions to monitor requests across all HTTP(s) and WebSocket URLs:

- `http://*/*`
- `https://*/*`
- `ws://*/*` (except Safari)
- `wss://*/*` (except Safari)

> Note: Safari's host permission is limited to HTTP and HTTPS schemes due to platform restrictions.

## 4. Browser Compatibility Details

### Manifest Permissions

The extension uses Manifest Version 3 features:
- Service workers power background processing (`background.service_worker` or Safari's `background.scripts`).
- The extension's `host_permissions` cover wide URL patterns to observe network traffic.

### Special Notes:

- **Chrome:** Minimum version 122 is required because the extension specifies `minimum_chrome_version` as "122.0" in its manifest.

- **Firefox:** Requires version 128.0 or newer, including Firefox's Android builds, as indicated by `strict_min_version` set in the manifest.

- **Safari:** Set minimum version to 18.5. Safari does not support the WebSocket host permissions (`ws://` and `wss://`), so uBO Scope will only monitor HTTP and HTTPS requests.

## 5. Network & Security Considerations

- uBO Scope monitors network requests via browser APIs and does not itself block or modify requests.
- It requires no special network configuration but does rely on proper firewall and proxy settings to allow the browser network activity to be reported.

## 6. Verification Before Installation

Ensure your current browser version meets the requirements listed above before attempting to install uBO Scope. Attempting to run uBO Scope on unsupported browsers or versions will result in diminished or failed functionality.

## Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Compatibility Issues">
<Accordion title="Extension Not Installing">
- Verify your browser version meets the minimum.
- Confirm browser supports Manifest V3 extensions.
- Check that your browser allows extensions from the source where you install.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension Installed But No Badge or Data">
- Confirm uBO Scope has the permissions needed.
- Ensure the browser supports the `webRequest` API, which uBO Scope depends on.
- Verify you're visiting HTTP, HTTPS, or WebSocket pages for monitoring.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Limited or No WebSocket Monitoring (Safari)">
- Safari currently lacks WebSocket host permissions, so WebSocket traffic may not appear.
- For full WebSocket support, use Chrome or Firefox.
</Accordion>

## Next Steps

- Proceed to [Installing uBO Scope](../installation-and-setup/installing-ubo-scope) to learn how to install the extension on your supported browser.
- After installation, review the [Initial Configuration and Permissions](../installation-and-setup/initial-configuration) page to ensure uBO Scope operates with proper permissions.

<Tip>
Ensuring upfront that your browser meets the minimum requirements saves time and prevents confusion during installation. Always update your browser to the latest stable version for best security and compatibility.
</Tip>

<Note>
uBO Scope's power depends on browser-level APIs; no external software or special drivers are needed beyond your supported browser.
