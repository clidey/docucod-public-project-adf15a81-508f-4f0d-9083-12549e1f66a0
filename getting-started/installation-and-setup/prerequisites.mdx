# System Requirements & Prerequisites for uBO Scope

Before installing and using uBO Scope, ensure your system and browser environment meet the baseline requirements to guarantee full functionality and reliable operation. This guide details the supported browsers, required permissions, and relevant platform considerations.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with the following environments. Confirm you use one of these supported browsers and meet the minimum version requirements:

| Browser     | Minimum Version | Notes                                                          |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium    | 122.0           | Required minimum Chrome version for compatibility               |
| Firefox     | 128.0           | Includes desktop and Android versions supporting Manifest V3   |
| Safari      | 18.5            | Supports WebExtension Manifest Version 3                        |


> These stringent version requirements ensure uBO Scope can fully leverage the browsersâ€™ WebExtension Manifest Version 3 APIs, especially around service workers and enhanced webRequest support.


## 2. Required Permissions

During installation, uBO Scope requests several essential permissions to operate effectively. These must be granted for the extension to monitor and report network connections:

- **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to access the currently active browser tab, enabling focused tracking on user-initiated browsing activity.
- **`storage`**: Grants permission to store and retrieve session and configuration data locally, ensuring persistence of monitoring information.
- **`webRequest`**: This critical permission enables intercepting, observing, and logging network requests made by web pages across HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket protocols.


> The extension also requires **host permissions** for URLs matching:
> 
> - `https://*/*`
> - `http://*/*`
> - Chromium and Firefox additionally support WebSocket URLs:
>   - `wss://*/*`
>   - `ws://*/*`

These host permissions enable uBO Scope to listen to requests sent to any remote server, regardless of domain.


## 3. Platform Considerations

- **Browser Extensions Architecture**: Due to Manifest V3, the extension runs background scripts as service workers (Chromium) or modules (Firefox/Safari). Ensure your browser supports these features.

- **WebRequest API Reliance**: uBO Scope depends heavily on the WebRequest API to capture all network connections for reporting. Some browsers or versions might restrict these APIs. Operating on supported versions ensures accurate data capture.

- **Network Access**: The extension captures network requests only within the browser's webRequest event scope. Requests made outside this scope (e.g., native system apps, VPNs) cannot be monitored.


## 4. Security and Privacy

uBO Scope operates with high privileges to monitor all network activity via webRequest listeners. Ensure you download the extension only from trusted official sources like:

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

Do not grant permissions to unknown or unofficial builds to protect your privacy and security.


## 5. Verifying Your Environment

Before proceeding with installation, verify:

1. Your browser version meets or exceeds the minimum required version.
2. You have necessary permissions to install browser extensions.
3. Your browser is configured to allow WebExtension Manifest V3 extensions.

Use browser settings or `about:` pages to locate browser version information.


<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Version">
Open your browser and navigate to its 'About' or 'Help' section to confirm your version:

- Chrome: `chrome://settings/help`
- Firefox: `about:support` or `Help > About Firefox`
- Safari: `Safari > About Safari`
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Permissions">
Ensure you have permission to install extensions from the respective official marketplaces.
</Step>
<Step title="Network Requirements">
Confirm you have internet connectivity to download the extension from the official source.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 6. Common Pitfalls

- **Using outdated browsers**: Browsers older than the stated minimum versions will fail to support necessary WebExtension Manifest V3 APIs.
- **Restricted browser environments**: Some enterprise-managed or privacy-focused versions may limit webRequest API functionality.
- **Incompatible browser flavors**: uBO Scope does not support browsers outside Chromium, Firefox, and Safari ecosystems.
