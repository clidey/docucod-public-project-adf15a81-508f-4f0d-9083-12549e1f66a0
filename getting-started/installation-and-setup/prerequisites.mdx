# Prerequisites and Compatibility

Ensure you are ready for a smooth installation and operation of uBO Scope by confirming that your system and browser meet the necessary compatibility and prerequisite requirements. This page guides you through supported browsers, minimum version requirements, and preparatory considerations before installing uBO Scope.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Version Requirements

uBO Scope is designed to operate on modern web browsers that support the WebExtension Manifest Version 3 standard and provide access to the `webRequest` API.

| Browser  | Minimum Version  | Notes                                         |
|----------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Chromium | 122.0 or higher   | Includes Google Chrome and compatible browsers|
| Firefox  | 128.0 or higher   | Includes Firefox for desktop and Android      |
| Safari   | 18.5 or higher    | Strict minimum version enforced due to WebExtension support  |

<u>Details:</u>

- **Chromium**: uBO Scope’s Manifest requires minimum Chrome Version 122.0. Ensure your browser is updated to at least this version to guarantee compatibility.
- **Firefox**: The extension requires Firefox 128.0 or newer. Older versions lack necessary APIs for correct operation.
- **Safari**: Safari 18.5 or newer strictly mandated. Older Safari versions do not support Manifest V3 and associated background scripts.


### Why These Versions?

uBO Scope relies on the latest WebExtension Manifest V3 framework to operate efficiently and securely. It leverages the `webRequest` API and persistent service workers (or background scripts) which are only fully supported from these browser versions onward.


## 2. System and Network Considerations

Before proceeding, verify the following system conditions to avoid setup issues:

- **Operating System**: Any OS running supported browsers is acceptable (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android for Firefox).
- **Network Access**: Should allow the extension to monitor requests to HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs.
- **Firewall or Security Software**: Ensure these do not block or interfere with browser extensions or the browser’s `webRequest` API.


## 3. Permissions and Browser Capabilities

uBO Scope requires the following permissions, which are requested automatically during installation:

- `activeTab` — Access the current active browser tab.
- `storage` — Store and retrieve configuration and session data within the browser.
- `webRequest` — Listen and analyze network request events in real-time.


These permissions enable uBO Scope to monitor remote server connections precisely and display actionable summaries.


## 4. Browser Compatibility Details

### Chromium (and compatible browsers)

- Format: Manifest Version 3 service worker background.
- Host permissions for monitoring: `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`.
- Minimum Chrome version: 122.0.


### Firefox

- Uses background scripts compatible with Manifest V3.
- Host permissions include HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS schemes.
- Minimum Firefox version: 128.0.


### Safari

- Background scripts loaded as module type scripts.
- Limited host permissions: HTTP and HTTPS only (no WS/WSS permissions currently).
- Minimum Safari version: 18.5.


## 5. Preparing for Installation

Before starting installation:

- Confirm your browser is updated to at least the minimum supported version.
- Disable any conflicting extensions that restrict webRequest API (e.g., restrictive privacy add-ons).
- Verify you have permission to install browser extensions (especially important on managed or corporate devices).


## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting Tips

<Tip>
Always verify your browser’s version before installing uBO Scope to avoid compatibility issues. Attempting to install on unsupported versions will likely result in non-functional behavior or failure to install.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Network security software or browser privacy settings that block extension permissions to access webRequest events can cause uBO Scope to under-report connections or show no data. Adjust settings as needed.
</Warning>

<Note>
Safari’s restriction to HTTP and HTTPS host permissions means WebSocket connections (ws:// or wss://) monitoring may be incomplete. This is a browser limitation, not a fault of uBO Scope.
</Note>


## 7. Summary Table of Compatibility

| Platform   | Manifest Version | Background Type  | Minimum Browser Version | Supported Host Protocols              |
|------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Chromium   | MV3              | Service Worker   | 122.0                   | http, https, ws, wss                 |
| Firefox    | MV3              | Background Script | 128.0                   | http, https, ws, wss                 |
| Safari     | MV3              | Background Script | 18.5                    | http, https                         |

### Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Questions">
<Accordion title="Can I install uBO Scope on older browser versions?">
No. The extension requires Manifest V3 supporting browsers available only in Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, and Safari 18.5+. Installing on older versions will fail or cause malfunction.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if my firewall blocks extension permissions?">
Adjust your firewall or security software settings to allow your browser and its extensions to monitor web requests. Without this, uBO Scope cannot capture network activity correctly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope work on mobile browsers?">
Firefox for Android 128+ is supported. Chromium-based mobile browsers currently vary in MV3 support; check browser documentation for extension compatibility.
