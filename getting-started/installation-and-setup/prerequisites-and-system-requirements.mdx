# Prerequisites and System Requirements for uBO Scope

To ensure a smooth installation and optimal use of uBO Scope, verify that your environment meets the necessary system, browser, and permission requirements outlined below. This foundation allows you to reliably monitor and understand remote server connections made by your browser.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension available for the following browsers:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge) — minimum Chrome version 122.0
- **Mozilla Firefox** — minimum Firefox version 128.0
- **Apple Safari** — minimum Safari version 18.5


Each supported browser requires installation through its official extension/add-on store or manual side loading where applicable.


## 2. Supported Operating Systems

uBO Scope runs on any platform supported by the browsers listed above. This generally includes:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Android (Chromium, Firefox on Android)

There are no special OS requirements beyond those for the compatible browser versions.


## 3. Required Permissions

During installation, uBO Scope requests specific permissions to operate effectively. Ensure you allow the following:

- **Access to Browser Tabs (`activeTab`)**: Needed to identify and monitor the currently active tab.
- **WebRequest API Usage (`webRequest`)**: To observe and report all network requests initiated by web pages.
- **Storage Permissions (`storage`)**: To save session data such as browsing activity and public suffix lists for accurate domain analysis.
- **Host Permissions**: uBO Scope requires broad network access to track requests across all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs:
  - `https://*/*`
  - `http://*/*`
  - `wss://*/*`
  - `ws://*/*`


## 4. Network and Browser Requirements

- Your browser must support the **WebRequest API** which is essential for uBO Scope to measure network request outcomes.
- Disable or properly configure any browser settings or third-party software that may block or modify the extension’s ability to monitor all network requests.
- Network connectivity is required for initial public suffix list downloading, used to correctly categorize domains.


## 5. Additional Considerations

- The extension’s badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party domains contacted. Lower counts generally indicate fewer distinct external connections.
- uBO Scope does not block or modify network requests; it only measures outcomes regardless of other content blockers in effect.
- User accounts or external credentials are not needed for installation or operation.

## Troubleshooting Prerequisite Issues

- **Extension Won’t Install or Enable:**
  - Confirm browser version meets minimum requirements.
  - Check for conflicting extensions or restrictive browser policies.

- **Permissions Not Granted:**
  - Manually review extension permissions in the browser settings.
  - Reinstall extension if necessary to trigger permission prompts.

- **Network Monitoring Fails:**
  - Ensure no other software or settings block webRequest API.
  - Verify network connection stability.

## Next Steps

Once you have confirmed that your environment meets these prerequisites:

1. Proceed to the [Installation Instructions](../installation-and-setup/installation-instructions) page for step-by-step guidance.
2. After installation, review the [Initial Configuration](../installation-and-setup/initial-configuration) to customize and optimize uBO Scope.
3. For immediate feedback or issues, consult [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../../getting-started/first-steps-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-common-issues).
