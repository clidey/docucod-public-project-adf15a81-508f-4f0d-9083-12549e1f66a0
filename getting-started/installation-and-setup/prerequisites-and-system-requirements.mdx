# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Before installing and using uBO Scope, ensure your environment meets these baseline criteria to guarantee a smooth and fully functional experience. This page details the supported browsers, minimum version requirements, and essential permissions the extension needs to operate correctly.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is built with cross-browser compatibility in mind, supporting major browsers that implement Manifest Version 3 (MV3) extensions and the `webRequest` API. Compatibility details:

| Browser          | Minimum Version | Notes                          |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Google Chrome    | 122.0 or higher | Full MV3 support, icon badge, and network monitoring via `webRequest`.
| Mozilla Firefox  | 128.0 or higher | MV3 and `webRequest` supported; includes Android Firefox compatibility starting from this version.
| Safari           | 18.5 or higher  | MV3 support with slight API differences; permissions and manifest adjusted accordingly.

> The extension uses browser-specific manifests located under the `platform/` folder tailored to each supported browser.

## 2. Required Permissions

For uBO Scope to monitor network connections effectively and display results, the following permissions are essential:

- `activeTab`: Grants temporary access to the currently active tab for real-time monitoring.
- `storage`: Allows the extension to save session data such as monitored connection details and the public suffix list.
- `webRequest`: Enables listening to and analyzing network traffic events to detect allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.

Additionally, `host_permissions` must be granted to monitor network requests across all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs:

- For Chromium and Firefox: `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, and `ws://*/*`.
- For Safari: `https://*/*` and `http://*/*` (WebSocket protocols are not included due to platform restrictions).

These broad permissions ensure uBO Scope can observe all relevant network activity initiated by web pages.

## 3. System Requirements and Environment

- **Operating Systems**: Any OS capable of running a supported browser version (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android for Firefox).
- **Network Connectivity**: Internet access is required to fetch the public suffix list initially and allow normal browsing network activities.
- **Browser Settings**:
  - Extensions should be enabled.
  - Network request monitoring APIs must be supported and accessible.
  - No restriction from other extensions that may block or interfere with network event reporting.

## 4. Browser Customization and Privacy Settings

uBO Scope relies on browser APIs that expose network requests. Some privacy or security settings, or other content-blocking extensions, might limit or mask these APIs. For best results:

- Ensure that `webRequest` API access is not blocked or restricted.
- Be aware that network requests outside the scope of the `webRequest` API (e.g., browser internal requests or OS-level DNS blocking) will not be visible.

## 5. Permissions Confirmation

When installing uBO Scope, your browser will prompt you for necessary permissions. Confirm all requested permissions to ensure the extension operates without limitations.

<Tip>
Refusing or limiting permissions related to host access or network monitoring will impair the extension's ability to accurately report remote server connections.
</Tip>

## 6. Summary of Manifest & Key Metadata

The extension's manifest files define important metadata for each platform.

- **Name**: uBlock Origin Scope (`uBO Scope`)
- **Version**: 1.0.1
- **Author**: Raymond Hill
- **Manifest Version**: 3
- **Icons**: Provided at multiple sizes (16px to 128px) for toolbar and extension listings
- **Background Service Worker / Scripts**: Responsible for network event tracking
- **Default Popup**: `popup.html` provides the user interface showing connection results

More details about the manifest configuration can be found in the `platform/chromium/manifest.json`, `platform/firefox/manifest.json`, and `platform/safari/manifest.json` files.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues">
<Accordion title="Extension Fails to Monitor Web Requests">
This typically happens if the browser version is too old or the `webRequest` permission is denied.

**Action:**
- Update your browser to the minimum supported version.
- Verify that uBO Scope has the `webRequest` permission granted.
- Disable conflicting extensions that may interfere with `webRequest`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Browser Prompts for Missing Permissions">
Make sure to accept all required permissions during installation.

**Tip:**
You can check extension permissions in your browserâ€™s extension management page and adjust as necessary.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Badge or Data Displayed after Installation">
This may be due to the extension not being able to inject or run its background service worker.

**Check:**
- Browser version meets requirements.
- Extension was installed correctly.
- Network settings allow traffic and API calls.

Reload the browser or extension to restart the background service worker.
