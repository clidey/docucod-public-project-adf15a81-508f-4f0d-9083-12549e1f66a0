# Prerequisites and System Requirements

Before installing and using **uBO Scope**, ensure your environment meets the following prerequisites. This page will guide you through supported browsers, minimum versions, and essential requirements to guarantee a smooth installation and operation.

---

## Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with major modern browsers. Confirm you are using one of the following browsers and versions:

- **Chromium-based Browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.)**
  - Minimum version: **Chrome 122** or equivalent for other Chromium browsers
  - Manifest v3 compliant

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum version: **128**
  - Supports WebExtensions API and manifest v3

- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum version: **Safari 18.5**
  - Supports Safari Web Extensions with manifest v3


<u>Browser compatibility is critical.</u> Be sure to update your browser to at least these versions to ensure uBO Scope operates as expected.


## System Requirements

uBO Scope is lightweight and runs as a browser extension, so it has minimal system requirements:

| Requirement           | Description                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Operating System      | Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS (Safari), Android (Firefox) |
| Memory               | Minimal, typically less than 100MB RAM overhead |
| Disk Space           | < 10 MB for extension files  |
| Network              | Internet connectivity to fetch the Public Suffix List and update data |


## Permission and Access Requirements

To function correctly, uBO Scope requests the following browser permissions:

- **`activeTab`**: To access the active tab's URL for monitoring network connections.
- **`storage`**: To save session data and Public Suffix List cache.
- **`webRequest`**: To listen to network requests and capture connection outcomes in real-time.


### How Permissions Are Used

- `webRequest` permission enables uBO Scope to monitor network traffic filtered by the browser, regardless of content blockers in use.
- `storage` permission allows caching the Public Suffix List locally for efficient domain parsing.

You will be prompted to grant these permissions during installation. These are essential to deliver the core functionality of revealing remote server connections.


## Network Requirements

- **Allowed URLs in Host Permissions**:
  - For Chromium and Firefox, the extension requires access to all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket URLs matching:
    - `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`
    - `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` (Firefox supports WebSocket capture)

- **Firewall and Proxy Settings**:
  - Ensure your firewall or proxy does not block browser extension access to these URLs.
  - This enables uBO Scope to fully monitor network requests.


## Additional Requirements

- **Browser Extension/Addon Installation Capability:**
  - You must have the ability to install extensions/addons in your browser.
  - For corporate or managed devices, confirm that browser policies do not block extension installation or restrict `webRequest` permissions.


## Summary of Prerequisites

- Compatible browser installed and updated to required version
- Necessary extension permissions granted on installation
- Network environment allows monitoring of web requests

## Practical Tips Before Installation

- **Update your browser** to the latest stable release that meets the minimum version requirements.
- If using Firefox or Chromium browsers, verify you are on manifest v3 compatible builds.
- Disable conflicting extensions temporarily if you face issues where uBO Scope doesn't appear active.

<Tip>
For Safari users, ensure macOS and Safari are updated to support WebExtensions with manifest v3, as earlier versions are incompatible.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Make sure you have stable internet during installation since uBO Scope fetches and parses the Public Suffix List necessary for domain processing.
</Tip>

## Verifying Environment Compatibility

1. **Check Browser Version**
   - In Chromium browsers, navigate to `chrome://settings/help`
   - In Firefox, go to `about:support` and check the version
   - In Safari, use `About Safari` from the Safari menu

2. **Confirm Permissions**
   - Post-installation, verify the extension's permissions under your browser’s extensions panel.

3. **Test Internet Connectivity**
   - Confirm that your browser can access external websites without restrictions that could hinder network monitoring.
