Each browser store independently verifies extensions before publishing:

- **Chrome Web Store:** Google reviews for compliance with policies related to privacy and security. Approval can take hours to a few days.
- **Firefox Add-ons:** Mozilla performs automated and manual reviews for compatibility and security.
- **Safari Extensions:** Apple enforces a review aligned with macOS App Store guidelines, often taking longer.

## 5. Post-Installation Verification

Confirming a successful installation ensures uBO Scope is ready to deliver value.

### 5.1 Confirm Extension Presence

### 5.2 Access the Popup Dashboard

1. Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
2. The popup window opens showing network connections categorized as **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** domains.

- Click the icon to see detailed connection outcomes.

<Tip>
If no data appears after some browsing, ensure your content blockers or privacy settings do not restrict extension APIs that uBO Scope relies on. For details, see the [Prerequisites & Supported Browsers](../installation-and-setup/prerequisites) documentation.
