## Troubleshooting Installation

If you encounter issues during installation or the extension does not appear:

- **Check Browser Version:** Ensure your browser meets or exceeds the minimum version supported.
- **Verify Internet Connection:** A stable connection is necessary to download the extension.
- **Review Browser Settings:** Some browsers restrict extensions or have disabled add-ons. Enable them in settings.

## Security Considerations

uBO Scope requires permissions to access web requests and storage but operates with a focus on transparency and privacy:

- The extension reads network requests only as reported by the browser’s webRequest API.
- It does not block or modify connections; it reports what happens in real time
- Permissions requested are essential for functionality and are limited strictly to the extension’s scope

Always monitor permissions granted to extensions and remove any that no longer meet your security policies.
