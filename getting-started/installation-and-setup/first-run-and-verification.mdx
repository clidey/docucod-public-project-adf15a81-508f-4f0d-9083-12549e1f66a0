# First Run & Extension Verification

Get started with uBO Scope by verifying that the extension is properly installed, the toolbar icon is visible and active, and the extension is correctly tracking network connections on your browser tabs.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation and Icon Presence

When you install uBO Scope, the extension’s toolbar icon must appear in your browser’s toolbar area. This icon is your primary interaction point with the extension.

### Steps:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon resembling the extension logo (colored shield) on your browser’s toolbar.
2. If not visible, check your browser’s extension or add-on menu:
   - Chrome/Chromium: Click the puzzle piece icon and pin uBO Scope if it’s hidden.
   - Firefox: Open the "Extensions" panel and ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
   - Safari: Check the Extensions preferences pane.
3. Make sure the browser version meets minimum requirements:
   - Chrome 122+
   - Firefox 128+
   - Safari 18.5+

<Tip>
An inactive or missing icon usually indicates the extension is not installed correctly or disabled. Reinstall or enable it if necessary.
</Tip>

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup

The popup UI shows live data of third-party network connections per active tab.

### Steps:

1. Navigate to an open webpage in your browser.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in the toolbar.
3. The popup should open instantly, showing the current tab’s domain and connection details.

### What to Expect:

- The popup displays the main domain name at the top.
- Summary line shows the count of distinct connected third-party domains.
- Sections categorize domains into **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
- Each domain entry includes a badge count showing the number of connections.

<Note>
If clicking the icon does not open the popup or the popup remains blank with "NO DATA", verify that the page is fully loaded and that uBO Scope has permission to access the current URL.
</Note>

## 3. Verify Network Tracking on a Simple Webpage

To confirm uBO Scope is actively monitoring network activity, open a website known to request remote resources.

### Recommended test scenario:

- Open a common website with mixed third-party content (e.g., a news site or a content-rich homepage).
- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
- Observe the list of connected domains updating with counts.

### Success Criteria:

- The badge number on the toolbar icon reflects the count of distinct third-party domains allowed.
- The popup categorizes domains accurately under not blocked, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- Domains and counts update dynamically as you navigate or reload the page.

<Tip>
If no domains appear except your own, try refreshing the page. uBO Scope listens to real network events and needs time to collect data.
</Tip>

## 4. Understanding the Initial Popup Display

When uBO Scope has successfully started tracking, the popup shows:

- **Main Tab Domain**: The domain of the webpage you’re currently viewing.
- **Domain Connection Counts**: Number of third-party domains connected, signaling potential privacy exposure.
- **Connection Outcome Categories**:
  - **Not Blocked**: Connections allowed by your browser and content blockers.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections that were attempted but suppressed in stealth mode.
  - **Blocked**: Connections blocked outright by your blocker or browser.

This view gives immediate visual feedback about your browsing privacy footprint.
