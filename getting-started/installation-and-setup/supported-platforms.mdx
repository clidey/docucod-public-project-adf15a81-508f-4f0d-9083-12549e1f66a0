# Supported Browsers & System Requirements

Ensure uBO Scope runs flawlessly by verifying your browser and system meet the necessary compatibility and minimum requirements. This guide helps you quickly assess browser and OS support before installation, so you can start monitoring your network connections without surprises.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension leveraging the `webRequest` API available on select browsers. Currently, it supports:

- **Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers**
- **Mozilla Firefox (desktop and Firefox for Android)**
- **Safari (version 18.5 and above)**

These browsers provide the necessary APIs and permissions that uBO Scope needs to monitor and report network requests.

### Browser Versions & Requirements

| Browser               | Minimum Version       | Notes                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Google Chrome         | Latest stable        | Supports all Chromium-based browsers       |
| Mozilla Firefox       | 128.0+               | Includes Firefox for desktop and Android   |
| Safari                | 18.5+                | macOS and iOS Safari with MV3 support      |

<Note>
Older browsers or unsupported versions might miss critical functionality or fail to provide accurate connection data.
</Note>

## 2. Operating System Compatibility

Since uBO Scope is a browser extension, its operating system compatibility aligns with the supported browsers' platform coverage.

- **Windows / macOS / Linux**: Supported via Chrome, Firefox, and Safari (macOS only)
- **Android**: Supported on Firefox for Android (minimum version 128.0)
- **iOS / iPadOS**: Supported on Safari 18.5 and later

<Warning>
uBO Scope does not have standalone binaries or apps; it cannot run outside supported browsers.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Minimum System and Environment Requirements

Before installing, ensure your environment complies with the following:

- **Sufficient RAM**: At least 2 GB of system memory for smooth browser and extension operation
- **Disk Space**: Minimal disk space needed (less than 5 MB) for extension files; ensure available storage for browser extensions
- **Network Connectivity**: Active internet connection required for extension to monitor web traffic
- **Browser Permissions**:
  - `webRequest` and `webRequestBlocking` permissions enabled by the browser for the extension
  - Access to all URLs (`http://*/*` and `https://*/*`) via host permissions

The extension’s manifests for each browser require these permissions to capture and analyze network requests:

```json
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*"]
}
```

<Info>
Lack of necessary permissions will prevent uBO Scope from functioning properly.

## Appendix: Manifest Permissions Overview

The extension’s manifest for supported browsers requires the following critical permissions to function as intended:

```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "storage",
    "webRequest"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://*/*",
    "http://*/*"
  ]
}
```

These allow uBO Scope to monitor all HTTP/S web requests made in the browser, essential for full visibility.
