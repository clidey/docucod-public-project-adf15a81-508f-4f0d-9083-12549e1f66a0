# Installing on Safari

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions for installing and activating **uBO Scope** on macOS using the Safari browser. Whether you prefer installing from the Mac App Store or using the packaged ZIP file, follow the appropriate method below to get started with transparent monitoring of remote server connections.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

- **Operating System:** macOS with Safari version 18.5 or later.
- **Browser:** Safari 18.5+ (minimum version required for WebExtension MV3 support).
- **Permissions:** The extension requires permissions for `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`.

<Check>
Verify Safari version:

```bash
sw_vers
# or open Safari -> About Safari
```

Ensure your version meets or exceeds 18.5.
</Check>

<Note>
macOS machines with Safari 18.5 and later fully support Safari WebExtensions compatible with Manifest Version 3, which uBO Scope uses.
</Note>

## 2. Installation Methods

You have two primary options to install uBO Scope on Safari:

### Method A: Install from the Mac App Store (Recommended)

1. Open the Mac App Store.
2. Search for "uBO Scope" by Raymond Hill.
3. Click 'Get' or 'Install' to download and install the extension directly.

<Info>
The Mac App Store version ensures automatic updates and official support.
</Info>

### Method B: Manual Installation via ZIP Package

1. Download the Safari version build or ZIP package from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) or use the build script if you prefer building locally.
2. To create the package manually (for developers or advanced users), run the provided build script on a Linux environment:

```bash
./tools/make-package.sh safari
```

3. This will create a `uBO-Scope.safari.zip` file inside `build/uBO-Scope.safari`.
4. Extract the ZIP and follow Safari's instructions to load the unpacked extension for development or sideloading.

<Warning>
Manual loading of unpacked extensions may require enabling the “Allow Unsigned Extensions” option in Safari’s Develop menu.
</Warning>

## 3. Enabling uBO Scope in Safari

2. Go to the **Extensions** tab.
3. Locate **uBO Scope** in the list.
4. Check the box to enable the extension.
5. Confirm that the extension has permission to read your browsing data.

<Check>
Ensure the extension is active and the toolbar icon is visible.
</Check>

## 4. Verifying the Installation

To confirm uBO Scope is working correctly:
