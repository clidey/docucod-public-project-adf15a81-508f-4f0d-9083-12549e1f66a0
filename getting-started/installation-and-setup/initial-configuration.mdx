# Initial Configuration

Configure uBO Scope for your first use to gain deep visibility into the network connections that websites make from your browser. This guide walks you through the permissions uBO Scope requests during installation, their privacy implications, and explains the key user interface elements you'll interact with after setup, namely the extension's toolbar badge and popup interface.

---

## 1. Understanding Permissions and Privacy

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to function effectively. Knowing what each permission entails helps you understand how the extension works and what data it accesses.

### Permissions Requested

- **`activeTab`**: Enables uBO Scope to interact with the tab you are currently viewing. This allows it to gather network connection data relevant to the active page.

- **`storage`**: Allows the extension to store connection data and settings locally within your browser. This ensures data persists during your browsing session and across sessions as needed.

- **`webRequest`**: Grants access to the browser's `webRequest` API, which is essential for monitoring network requests. uBO Scope uses this to observe every attempted and completed connection made by web pages.

- **`host_permissions` (e.g., `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`)**: These permissions allow uBO Scope to monitor requests made to all web and WebSocket URLs, ensuring comprehensive coverage of network activity.

### Privacy Implications

uBO Scope does **not** collect or transmit your data externally. All network monitoring occurs locally in your browser. The extension simply reports the outcome of network requests to you without logging or sharing this information beyond your device. Understanding this helps users trust the extension while benefiting from its transparency.

<Tip>
You can inspect **exact domains** and **request outcomes** directly in uBO Scope without risking data leakage â€” all analysis is local.
</Tip>

## 2. The Toolbar Badge: Your Real-Time Privacy Indicator

After installation, you'll notice a badge on the uBO Scope toolbar icon. This badge shows a **count of distinct third-party remote servers** connected during a page load.

### What Does the Badge Count Represent?

- The number reflects unique third-party domains contacted by the active web page.
- A **lower number** means fewer third parties were contacted, which typically indicates better privacy and less tracking exposure.
- The badge updates dynamically as you navigate or reload pages.

### How To Use It

- Use the badge as a quick visual snapshot to assess privacy exposure on any site.
- Compare between sites or over time to understand third-party reach.

<Warning>
Do not confuse this with block counts from ad blockers; uBO Scope reports actual distinct connections, providing a more accurate view.
</Warning>

## 3. Accessing and Interpreting the Popup Interface

Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup interface. This popup gives you a detailed breakdown of network requests for the current active tab.

### Popup Interface Overview

- **Hostname Header**: Displays the domain of the currently monitored tab at the top.
- **Summary Section**: Shows the total number of third-party domains connected.
- **Outcome Sections**: The popup segregates domains by the outcome of the network request:
  - **Not Blocked** (Allowed): Domains for which connections were successful and allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains for which requests were stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked**: Domains for which requests were explicitly blocked or failed.

### Domain Rows

Each domain entry includes:
- The domain name.
- A badge with the count of connections made to that domain during the page load.

The interface is designed for quick scanning and understanding of which external services are contacted and whether connections were allowed or blocked.

<Info>
If a section has no domains, it will be hidden from the popup for clarity.

## 4. First-Time Setup Checklist

To ensure uBO Scope functions as expected right after installation, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Extension Installation">
    Make sure uBO Scope is installed from your browser's official extension store (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Permissions">
    Upon installation, your browser will request the needed permissions (`activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`). Approve these to enable network monitoring.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reload Active Tabs">
    After installation, reload or open new tabs in your browser to allow uBO Scope to start monitoring network requests.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Toolbar Badge">
    Look at the toolbar icon badge. You should see a number reflecting third-party domains connected on the active page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Popup for Details">
    Click the uBO Scope icon to view the popup showing detailed connection data per active tab.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup Issues and Solutions">
  <Accordion title="The Toolbar Badge Does Not Appear or Show a Number">
    - Ensure the extension was granted all necessary permissions during installation.
    - Reload the current tab to trigger fresh monitoring.
    - Check your browser version against minimum requirements (e.g., Chrome 122, Firefox 128, Safari 18.5). If outdated, update your browser.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The Popup Shows 'NO DATA'">
    - This means no network data has been captured for the active tab.
    - Reload the page you want to monitor.
    - Verify you have enabled uBO Scope in your browser's extension manager.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Extension Requests Excessive Permissions">
    - uBO Scope requires broad URL permissions to monitor all network connections transparently.
    - This is essential for its purpose and does not mean your data leaves your device.
    - Review the [Browser Store Listing](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) for verification.
  </Accordion>
