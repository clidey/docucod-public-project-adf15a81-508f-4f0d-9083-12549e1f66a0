# Initial Configuration of uBO Scope

Configuring uBO Scope properly right after installation ensures the extension can effectively monitor and report all network connections attempted by webpages you visit. This page guides you through understanding the default settings, verifying necessary permissions, and preparing the extension for reliable operation on your preferred browser.

---

## 1. What to Expect on First Launch

When you first add uBO Scope to your browser, it initiates with default permissions configured via its manifest file to monitor network requests across all web pages you visit. The extension leverages browser-native APIs and built-in capabilities without requiring manual adjustments from you in most cases.

- **Permissions Granted by Default:**
  - Access to the `webRequest` API
  - `activeTab` permission for tab-specific interactions
  - Access to browser `storage` for maintaining session and configuration data

- **Default Monitoring Scope:**
  All network requests using standard web protocols (`http`, `https`, `ws`, `wss`) made by any webpage are tracked by default.

The extension maintains session-based data such as tab details and domains accessed under the hood, storing this securely using the browser's session storage facilities.

---

## 2. Ensuring Necessary Permissions

uBO Scope depends on explicit permissions declared in its manifest to function correctly. Here's how to verify that these permissions are in place:

### 2.1 Permissions Required

- **`webRequest`**: Needed to listen and record all network requests initiated by browser tabs.

- **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to interact with the currently active browser tab for real-time data presentation.

- **`storage`**: Enables saving of session data between page reloads and browser sessions.

### 2.2 Verifying Permissions in Your Browser

**For Chrome and Chromium-based browsers:**

1. Click on the extension icon in the toolbar.
2. Choose 'Manage Extensions'.
3. Scroll to the Permissions section.
4. Confirm `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` are listed.

**For Firefox:**

1. Open the Add-ons Manager (`about:addons`).
2. Click on uBO Scope.
3. Review the permissions listed under the extension details.

**For Safari:**

1. Go to Safari Preferences > Extensions.
2. Select uBO Scope.
3. Verify permissions and ensure the extension is enabled.

<Tip>
If any permission appears missing or disabled, reinstalling the extension from the official store or enabling the permissions manually (if supported) will be necessary for full functionality.
</Tip>

## 3. Default Settings and Behavior

### 3.1 Automatic Session Data Management

From launch, uBO Scope automatically:

- **Loads the Public Suffix List**: This critical list enables it to group network requests by domain and subdomain accurately.

- **Tracks tab-specific network activity**: It maintains a live map of network requests per browser tab.

- **Updates the toolbar badge**: Showing a count of distinct connected third-party domains per active tab.

### 3.2 No Manual Configuration Needed Initially

The initial configuration assumes no user intervention is required; it is designed to be immediate plug-and-play. Users can open the extension popup at any time to inspect connection details for the active tab.

However, advanced users monitoring filter lists or wanting granular control may explore deeper configuration options in other documentation sections.

## 4. Preparing uBO Scope for Your First Use

To ensure smooth operation from the start, follow these sequential steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Browser Compatibility and Version">
Ensure your browser version meets the minimum supported requirements:

- Chrome: Version 122 or higher
- Firefox: Version 128 or higher
- Safari: Version 18.5 or higher

This guarantees API support required by the extension.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Permissions Are Granted">
Check that uBO Scope has `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` permissions as outlined above.
</Step>
<Step title="Allow Network Access in Your Firewall/Network">
If applicable, confirm your firewall or network security settings do not block browser extensions from monitoring web requests.

This is particularly relevant in enterprise or highly secured environments.
</Step>
<Step title="Restart the Browser (Optional but Recommended)">
Restart your browser after installation to ensure all components including the background service worker or scripts are fully initialized.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Extension and Confirm Basic Functionality">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon on any active webpage. The extension popup should present connection counts and domains without errors.

If you see ‘NO DATA’, try navigating to a new page or refreshing the current page.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
You are ready to use uBO Scope once the popup displays connection data corresponding to the active tab, and the badge count updates as you browse websites.
</Check>

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting Tips

- **The badge remains empty or shows ‘0’ on sites with multiple third-party connections:**
  - Ensure `webRequest` permission is granted and enabled.
  - Verify that no other extensions or browser settings interfere with `webRequest` API.
  - Refresh the webpage to allow uBO Scope to capture recent requests.

- **No data in the popup interface:**
  - Reload or navigate to a different site.
  - Restart the browser.
  - Confirm the extension is enabled and active.

- **Incorrect domain grouping or display:**
  - The Public Suffix List loads automatically in session; network delays can cause initial misgrouping that self-corrects shortly afterward.

<Tip>
If issues persist, consult the [Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues](/getting-started/getting-first-results/troubleshooting-common-issues) guide for detailed solutions.
