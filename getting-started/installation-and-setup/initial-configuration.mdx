# Initial Configuration Guide for uBO Scope

After successfully installing uBO Scope, you're just a few quick steps away from starting to monitor all remote server connections made by webpages. This page guides you through the minimal configuration required to get uBO Scope up and running with its core features.

---

## 1. Granting Required Permissions

uBO Scope is designed to work seamlessly out-of-the-box with minimal setup, but it requires specific permissions to monitor network connections accurately across all pages. These permissions are requested automatically during installation, but it's important to verify they are granted:

- **Active Tab Access**: Allows uBO Scope to interact with the currently active browser tab.
- **Storage Access**: Enables extension to save and retrieve session data.
- **Web Request Monitoring**: Monitors outgoing network requests to report connection status.
- **Host Permissions**:
  - For **Chromium** and **Firefox**: `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, and `wss://*/*` to capture all HTTP, HTTPS, and websocket traffic.
  - For **Safari**: `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` (websocket monitoring depends on browser capabilities).

### How to Verify Permissions
1. Open your browser's extensions/add-ons page.
2. Locate uBO Scope.
3. Check the _Permissions_ section.
4. Confirm the permissions listed above are present.

<Tip>
If permissions look incomplete or are denied, remove the extension and reinstall it from the official store to ensure full permission grant.
</Tip>

## 2. Pin the Extension for Visibility

To make your monitoring experience effortless, pin uBO Scope to your browser's toolbar for easy access and visibility.

### How to Pin uBO Scope

- **Chromium (Chrome, Edge, etc.)**:
  1. Click the puzzle-piece (Extensions) icon on the toolbar.
  2. Find uBO Scope in the list.
  3. Click the pin icon next to it. The icon will appear in the toolbar.

- **Firefox**:
  1. Click the menu button and select _Add-ons and themes_.
  2. In the Extensions tab, find uBO Scope.
  3. Click the three-dot menu next to it and choose _Pin to Overflow Menu_.

- **Safari**:
  1. Go to Safari → Settings → Extensions.
  2. Ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
  3. Enable Show in Toolbar if available.

<Note>
Pinning the extension makes its badge visible, which displays the active count of distinct remote connections per tab.
</Note>

## 3. Understanding Badge Behavior on Your First Site Visit

Once installed and pinned, uBO Scope displays a numeric badge on its toolbar icon reflecting the number of distinct third-party remote servers your current tab connects to successfully.

1. **Visit any website** (e.g., https://example.com).
2. Observe the badge on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon:
   - A **number** indicates how many distinct third-party domains successfully connected.
   - No number means either there are no third-party connections or the extension isn’t monitoring properly.

3. **Click the extension icon to open the popup UI:**
   - See detailed categorization of connection outcomes as **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked**.
   - Domains are displayed with counts representing how many requests were made.

<Tip>
A **lower badge count is better**, as it means fewer third-party remote servers are involved, often reflecting fewer trackers or ads.
</Tip>
