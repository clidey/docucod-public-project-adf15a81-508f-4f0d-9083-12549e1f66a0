# Initial Configuration

After installing uBO Scope, it's essential to complete a few basic configuration steps to enable the extension to start monitoring and revealing remote server connections effectively. This document walks you through the initial setup process, clarifying how browser permissions affect uBO Scope, and explains how to access its user interface so you can quickly gain actionable insights without confusion.

---

### 1. Understanding Necessary Permissions

uBO Scope depends on specific browser permissions to function correctly. Understanding these permissions helps ensure the extension collects the data you need:

- **`webRequest` permission:** Enables uBO Scope to monitor network requests made by the browser, including allowed, blocked, and redirected connections.

- **Host permissions:** The extension requests broad host permissions such as `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, and WebSocket equivalents (`wss://*/*`, `ws://*/*`). These permissions allow uBO Scope to observe requests targeting virtually any remote server.

- **`activeTab` permission:** Allows the extension to access the current active browser tab's context for displaying relevant data.

- **`storage` permission:** Used to save session data and settings locally within your browser.

<Tip>
If you see permission-related notifications during installation, allow these permissions to ensure uBO Scope works correctly in tracking network activity.
</Tip>

### 2. Confirming Extension Installation and Permissions

Before starting with uBO Scope, verify that your browser has granted the extension the needed permissions:

1. **Check the extension’s installed permissions:**
   - In Chromium-based browsers, go to `chrome://extensions/`, find uBO Scope, and click 'Details'. Under 'Permissions', confirm that "Access to URLs" and "Access your data for all websites" are enabled.
   - In Firefox, navigate to `about:addons`, select uBO Scope, and review permissions.

2. **Reload your browser or the extension page if necessary** to apply any permission changes.

3. **Close and reopen the browser after installation** to ensure any background scripts initialize with appropriate permissions.

### 3. Accessing and Using the uBO Scope Interface

uBO Scope provides its insight primarily through its popup interface and the badge on the browser’s toolbar:

- **Toolbar icon badge:** Displays the count of distinct third-party remote domains connected from the active tab. A lower count indicates fewer external connections.

- **Popup panel:** Access the detailed connection report for the active tab by clicking the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.

Steps to open the popup:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar (you will see the uBO Scope logo).
2. The popup displays four sections:
   - **Hostname header:** Shows the current tab's domain.
   - **Summary:** Displays the number of domains connected.
   - **Details:** Divided into three categories:
     - *Not blocked* (allowed connections),
     - *Stealth-blocked* (connections blocked stealthily by content blockers),
     - *Blocked* (connections fully blocked).

<Tip>
If the popup says 'NO DATA', this means uBO Scope has not yet recorded any network requests for the current tab. Reload the page or navigate to a new one to start seeing data.
</Tip>

### 4. Verifying Initial Configuration Functionality

Ensure the extension is correctly configured and operating by following these verification steps:

1. **Open a popular website (e.g., https://example.com).
2. Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. Confirm you see a badge count indicating the number of third-party domains connected.
4. Open the popup and verify the connection details for allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked remote domains populate accordingly.

<Tip>
If the badge does not update or the popup remains empty, check browser permissions or restart your browser to reinitialize the extension.
</Tip>

### 5. Troubleshooting Common Permission & Access Issues

<u>Issue:</u> _uBO Scope displays 'NO DATA' or badge count does not update_

- Verify you have granted all required permissions during installation.
- Reload or restart the browser to ensure background scripts are running.
- Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Check that no other extensions or browser settings are blocking network requests that uBO Scope monitors.

<u>Issue:</u> _Popup does not open or the toolbar icon is missing_

- Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser's extensions page.
- Try removing and reinstalling the extension.

<u>Issue:</u> _Unexpected behavior with stealth or blocked connections_

- Remember that these categories reflect the network request outcomes reported by the browser's `webRequest` API. Some stealth blocking by content blockers may not always be perfectly categorized.

### 6. Best Practices

- **Keep uBO Scope enabled when auditing content blockers** to get real-time insights on network connections.
- **Use the popup regularly** to understand third-party connections on different sites.
- **Combine with content blockers cautiously;** uBO Scope does not interfere but simply observes.
