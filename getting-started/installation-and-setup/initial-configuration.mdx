# Initial Configuration & Permissions

This guide walks you through the essential first steps after installing uBO Scope. It covers the permissions the extension requires, their purposes, and how to set up the extension for optimal functionality on your browser.

---

## 1. Understanding Required Permissions

uBO Scope needs specific permissions to monitor and report on your browser's network requests accurately. During the first launch, your browser will prompt you to grant these permissions.

### Permissions uBO Scope Requests:

- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to access details of the active browser tab to display relevant network connection data.
- **storage**: Enables saving session data and configuration settings within your browser’s storage.
- **webRequest**: Grants access to intercept and observe network requests your browser initiates.
- **host_permissions**: Allows access to monitor network requests made to all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket (ws), and secure WebSocket (wss) URLs.

These permissions empower uBO Scope to track outgoing connections efficiently, categorizing them as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

<Note>
These permissions are transparent and solely used for monitoring network traffic to provide you with insightful information about external server connections your browser makes.
</Note>

## 2. First Launch Flow: Granting Permissions and Enabling uBO Scope

On installing uBO Scope, follow these steps to ensure it is correctly configured and enabled:

### Step 1: Grant the Requested Permissions

1. Upon first activation, your browser will prompt for the permissions listed above.
2. Carefully review and accept these permissions to allow uBO Scope to operate.

### Step 2: Confirm the Extension is Activated

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The extension is active when the icon is visible and clickable.

<Tip>
If you do not see the icon, check your browser’s extensions menu or toolbar customization to pin or enable uBO Scope.
</Tip>

## 3. How Permissions Are Used by uBO Scope

- **webRequest** monitors all outgoing network requests matching the host permissions (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
- The extension hooks into three key network request events:
  - `onBeforeRedirect`: Detects when a request is redirected.
  - `onErrorOccurred`: Captures failed requests.
  - `onResponseStarted`: Recognizes successful network responses.

uBO Scope maintains an internal session data map keyed by tab IDs, where it aggregates the requests observed, distinguishing allowed connections, stealth-blocked, and blocked ones for your active tabs.

### Key Points About Permission Usage:

- Your browsing data is processed locally within the extension's background service worker or script; no data is sent outside your browser.
- Permissions facilitate **real-time** monitoring without interfering or blocking network requests.

<Warning>
Revoking these permissions after first use will disable the extension’s core functionality.
</Warning>

## 4. Configuring for Optimal Operation

Although uBO Scope does not require complex configuration, the initial setup involves:

### Step 1: Allow Host Access

Ensure the extension has host access to all URLs (HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS schemes) to comprehensively monitor network traffic.

### Step 2: Verify Storage Availability

Check that your browser allows the extension to use local and session storage. This is necessary for maintaining session data and the public suffix list, which helps the extension accurately group hostnames into domains.

### Step 3: Using the Extension Popup

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- The popup shows domains connected from the current tab categorized into:
  - **Not Blocked (allowed)**
  - **Stealth-blocked**
  - **Blocked**

This helps you quickly understand what connections your browser is making or blocking.

## 5. Verifying Permissions and Configuration

After granting permissions and opening the popup:

- Confirm that domains and connection counts reflect your current tab’s activity.
- The toolbar badge shows the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.

<Tip>
If the popup shows no data or the badge is blank, try refreshing the page or switching to a different tab and back. uBO Scope updates its data dynamically with your browsing.
</Tip>

## 6. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Permission and Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or No Connections">
- Ensure you have granted all permissions during the initial launch.
- Refresh the active tab or browse a new website to generate network requests.
- Confirm browser storage is enabled for the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Toolbar Badge Does Not Update">
- Check that the extension is enabled and the icon is visible.
- Make sure the active tab is fully loaded and network activity has occurred.
- Restart the browser if issues persist.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Browser Blocks Extension Permissions">
- Some browsers restrict extensions from accessing certain URLs or data.
- Verify host permissions in your browser extension settings.
- Manually grant the extension access to all sites if prompted.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API. Browsers or versions that limit this API’s functionality will restrict what the extension can monitor.
</Warning>
