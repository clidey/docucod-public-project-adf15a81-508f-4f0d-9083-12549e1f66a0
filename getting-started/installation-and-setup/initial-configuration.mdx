# Initial Configuration and Permissions

After installing uBO Scope, this guide will help you complete the essential post-installation setup. You will learn how to grant the necessary permissions and apply recommended initial settings to ensure the extension captures network requests immediately and reliably.

---

## 1. Understanding Required Permissions

uBO Scope operates by monitoring network requests made by webpages via the browser's `webRequest` API. To enable this, the extension requires specific permissions granted by the browser:

- **`webRequest`**: Enables interception and analysis of all network requests.
- **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to access data on the currently active browser tab.
- **`storage`**: Stores session data and configuration persistently.
- **Host Permissions**: Covers all HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`), enabling network request monitoring across all reachable web domains.

These permissions ensure uBO Scope can track connections effectively and update its interface in real-time.

<Note>
Without these permissions, uBO Scope cannot observe network activity properly, leading to incomplete or missing data in the popup interface.
</Note>

## 2. Granting Permissions After Installation

Follow these steps after installing uBO Scope from your browser's official store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari Extensions Gallery):

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Extension Installation">
- Locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser's toolbar.
- Ensure the icon appears without any warning overlays indicating permission issues.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Permissions Prompt">
- Upon first use, your browser may prompt you to grant permissions for uBO Scope.
- Carefully approve these permissions for the extension to function fully.
</Step>

<Step title="Manually Grant Site Access (If Required)">
- Some browsers (like Chrome) may require manual site access permission after installation.
- Right-click the uBO Scope icon and select "Manage extension".
- Under "Site access", choose "On all sites" or "On specific sites you visit" to allow the extension to monitor network requests.
</Step>

<Step title="Reload Your Browser Tabs">
- After granting permissions, refresh your open tabs to allow uBO Scope to start capturing network requests from those pages.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Best Initial Settings

uBO Scope requires no complex configuration to start capturing network data; however, adjusting initial settings optimizes its effectiveness and usability.

### Recommended Practices:

- **Keep the extension enabled at all times**: Disable only if you want to pause monitoring.
- **Allow host permissions on all sites**: This ensures full visibility rather than restricting to only some domains.
- **Check browser version compatibility**: Confirm you are using a supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

### What to Expect:

- The **toolbar badge** will show a count of distinct third-party domains connected during browsing.
- Clicking the extension icon opens the popup panel summarizing the current tab's network connections categorized as **allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked**.

</Info>

## 4. Troubleshooting Permissions Issues

If you notice that the extension popup shows 'NO DATA' or the toolbar badge remains empty after browsing:

- Confirm you have accepted all permission prompts.
- Check if your browser has disabled the extension or restricted access.
- For Chrome, verify if "Site access" is set incorrectly.
- Restart the browser to ensure sessions refresh correctly.

<Tip>
Make sure no other extensions are interfering with network request monitoring or limiting permissions for uBO Scope.
</Tip>

If issues persist, consult the [Troubleshooting Common Installation & Setup Issues](#) page.

## 5. Confirming Setup Success

To verify that uBO Scope is properly configured and capturing network connections:

1. Open a new browser tab.
2. Navigate to a website that loads external resources (e.g., a news site with ads).
3. Click the uBO Scope icon.
4. The popup should display the number of connected domains under “domains connected.”
5. Three sections should be visible listing allowed, stealth, and blocked domains.
6. The toolbar badge displays a numerical count reflecting these connections.

<Check>
Successful operation is indicated by live data appearing in the popup and a non-zero badge count reflecting network activity.
</Check>

By following this guide, you will ensure uBO Scope has the appropriate permissions and initial setup to start monitoring all relevant remote server connections immediately upon browsing.


## Appendix: Permissions in Manifest Files

For reference, uBO Scope's permissions are declared per browser in its manifest files:

```json
"permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
"host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*", "wss://*/*", "ws://*/*"]
```

This is consistent across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari platforms.


# Interface Behavior Post-Permissions

Once permissions are granted, and browsing activity starts, uBO Scope:

- Listens to network events such as redirects, successful responses, and errors.
- Tracks each unique domain contacted per active tab.
- Updates the extension icon badge with the number of distinct allowed domains.
- Reflects data live in the popup view when opened.

Maintaining permissions and having the extension enabled continuously is essential for real-time accurate network visibility.
