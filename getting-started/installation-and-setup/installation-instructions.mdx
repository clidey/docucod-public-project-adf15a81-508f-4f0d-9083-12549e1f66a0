## 5. Essential Permissions During Installation

uBO Scope relies on specific permissions to monitor and report network requests accurately. These permissions are requested during installation and include:

- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to access the current active tab's data.
- **webRequest**: Enables monitoring of HTTP/S and WebSocket requests made by websites.
- **storage**: Saves session and configuration data securely in browser storage.

<Tip>
Do not deny these permissions; uBO Scope’s core functionality depends on them. Without these, connection monitoring will not be possible.
</Tip>

## 6. Verification After Installation

Once installed, verify that uBO Scope is ready to use:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
2. The popup panel should load showing connection counts and domains.
3. If no data appears immediately, load any website and then click the icon again to see live connection data.

<Check>
If the popup remains empty or shows "NO DATA," try refreshing the page or restarting the browser.
</Check>
