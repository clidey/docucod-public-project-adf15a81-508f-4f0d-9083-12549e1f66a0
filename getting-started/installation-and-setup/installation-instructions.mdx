## 3. Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

If you prefer to build and install uBO Scope manually or need to test developer versions, follow the instructions below. This requires a Linux environment.

### 3.1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the uBO Scope repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
cd uBO-Scope
```

### 3.2. Build the Extension Package

Use the provided shell scripts to package the extension for your target browser.

| Browser         | Script to Run                           | Output Package Location         |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Firefox         | `./tools/make-firefox.sh [version]`   | `build/uBO-Scope.firefox.xpi`   |
| Chromium        | `./tools/make-chromium.sh [version]` | `build/uBO-Scope.chromium.zip`  |
| Safari          | `./tools/make-safari.sh [version]`    | `build/uBO-Scope.safari.zip`    |

- The optional `[version]` argument sets the extension version in the manifest.

Example to build for Firefox:

```bash
./tools/make-firefox.sh 1.0.1
```

<Tip>
Ensure you have the required tools installed for running scripts and zipping files (e.g., `bash`, `zip`).
</Tip>

### 3.3. Manual Installation in Browser

#### Firefox

- Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`.
- Click **This Firefox** (or **This Nightly**).
- Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
- Select the `build/uBO-Scope.firefox.xpi` file.

#### Chromium-based Browsers

- Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
- Enable **Developer mode** in the top-right corner.
- Click **Load unpacked**.
- Browse to and select the folder: `build/uBO-Scope.chromium/`.

#### Safari

- Open Safari.
- In **Preferences > Advanced**, enable `Show Develop menu`.
- In the **Develop** menu, select **Show Extension Builder**.
- Add the unpacked folder `build/uBO-Scope.safari/` as a new extension.

<Tip>
Manual installation through unpacked or temporary loading is recommended only for development or testing purposes. For regular use, the official store installation is safer.
