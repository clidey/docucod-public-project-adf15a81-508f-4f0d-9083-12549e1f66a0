</Tip>

## Required Permissions

uBO Scope needs the following browser permissions for full network request monitoring and data persistence:

- **`webRequest`**: To observe, classify, and report network requests your browser processes.
- **`storage`**: To save session data locally within the browser and recall it across sessions.
- **`activeTab`**: To access data specific to the current browser tab, enabling precise network connection attribution.

These permissions are essential and automatically requested during installation.

<Note>
Without these permissions, uBO Scope cannot track remote connections accurately or persist any findings, impairing its primary function.
</Note>

---

## Baseline System Prerequisites

Before installing, confirm the following system conditions for optimal operation:

- **Operating System**: Any modern OS supporting the above browsers (Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile OSes supporting compatible browser versions).

- **Internet Connectivity**: Required for downloading the extension and for uBO Scope to fetch the Public Suffix List (PSL), a crucial component used to classify domains correctly.

- **Browser Settings**:
  - Enable support for browser extensions.
  - No conflicts with other extensions that disable or block `webRequest` API (note this is rare).

- **Storage Availability**: Sufficient browser storage space to hold session information and data snapshots.

<Warning>
Browsers or environments that restrict the `webRequest` API may limit the extension's functionality, please verify your environment allows access.
</Warning>

## How uBO Scope Uses These Requirements

- The `webRequest` permission allows uBO Scope to receive detailed events about network requests, enabling it to distinguish between requests that were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked by filters or network conditions.

- The Public Suffix List is downloaded once and cached to correctly attribute hostnames to their registrable domains â€” essential for accurate counting and categorization.

- Storage permissions ensure that ongoing tab network data is maintained during browsing sessions and cleaned up when tabs are closed.

This setup guarantees that the toolbar badge count and popup information reflect real-time and historical connection data per tab.

## Verification Checklist Before Installing

Follow these steps to validate compatibility and readiness:

1. **Verify Browser Version**

   - Open your browser and check its version.
   - Update if below the minimum version listed.

2. **Confirm Required Permissions**

   - During installation, ensure the requested permissions match: `webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab`.

3. **Check Network Access**

   - Ensure your firewall or network settings do not block web extension APIs or network monitoring features.

4. **Confirm Storage Availability**

   - Confirm your browser settings permit extensions to use local storage.

<Tip>
If you plan to use uBO Scope on a restricted or corporate-managed device, confirm with your IT policy that such permissions are allowed.
</Tip>
