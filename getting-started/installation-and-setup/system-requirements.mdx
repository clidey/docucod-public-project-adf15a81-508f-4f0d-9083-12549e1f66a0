# System Requirements for uBO Scope

Ensure you have the right environment before installing and running uBO Scope to experience its network connection reporting capabilities seamlessly.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with the latest versions of major browsers that support Manifest Version 3 (MV3) extensions. Below are the explicit minimum browser versions required:

| Browser       | Minimum Version | Notes                         |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Google Chrome / Chromium** | 122.0           | Supports MV3 with service workers |
| **Mozilla Firefox**           | 128.0           | Supports MV3 with module background scripts |
| **Safari**                   | 18.5            | Requires Safari 18.5 or later (MV3 support) |

### Notes:
- Browsers must support the `webRequest` API as uBO Scope depends on it to monitor network requests.
- Mobile versions of Firefox from version 128.0 are supported, while mobile Chrome is not explicitly supported.

## 2. Operating System Compatibility

uBO Scope operates through the compatible browser on these platforms:

| Operating System | Browser Availability                      | Compatibility Notes           |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Windows**      | Chrome, Firefox                         | Full support                  |
| **macOS**        | Chrome, Firefox, Safari                 | Full support; Safari requires macOS versions supporting Safari 18.5+ |
| **Linux**        | Chrome, Firefox                         | Full support                  |
| **Android**      | Firefox (Android, version 128.0+)      | Supports MV3, limited by platform capabilities |
| **iOS / iPadOS** | Safari                                | Browser extension support on iOS limited; Safari 18.5+ required |

<u>Note:</u> Running uBO Scope requires the browser's `webRequest` API to reliably report network requests, which may have limitations on some mobile platforms.

## 3. Required Permissions & Capabilities

To function correctly, uBO Scope requires certain permissions as declared in the browser extension manifest. These permissions enable uBO Scope to observe and report network connections from within the browser environment.

### Permissions Required

- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to access the current tab's context for accurate reporting.
- **storage**: Enables persistent storage of session data and settings.
- **webRequest**: Critical for monitoring network requests made by webpages.

### Host Permissions

uBO Scope requires broad host permissions to observe network requests over HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket protocols:

```
- http://*/*
- https://*/*
- ws://*/* (Chrome, Firefox)
- wss://*/* (Chrome, Firefox)
```

On Safari, only HTTP and HTTPS are permitted as `webRequest` for WebSockets is not supported.

---

## 4. Compatibility Considerations

- **Manifest Version 3 Compliance**: uBO Scope is built using Manifest Version 3 standards, leveraging service workers (Chrome) or module background scripts (Firefox, Safari). Ensure your browser supports MV3 extensions.
- **WebRequest API**: uBO Scope depends heavily on the browser’s `webRequest` API for network connection monitoring. Some browsers or versions may restrict this API.
- **Third-Party Extensions & Blocking**: Extensions altering browser networking may impact uBO Scope’s accuracy. Use uBO Scope alongside blockers cautiously.

---

## 5. Practical Tips Before Installation

- Verify that your browser is updated to at least the minimum required version.
- Confirm that extensions you have do not restrict network monitoring APIs needed by uBO Scope.
- On Safari users, ensure you are running Safari 18.5 or later.
- On Firefox, check that you have version 128.0 or later which fully supports MV3.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Environment Issues

If uBO Scope does not work as expected after installation:

- **Browser Version Check**: Confirm again that your browser meets the minimum version requirement; outdated browsers block MV3 extensions or `webRequest` APIs.
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure uBO Scope has been granted all requested permissions.
- **Conflicting Extensions**: Disable other network-related extensions temporarily.
- **Browser Profiles**: Test uBO Scope in a fresh browser profile to rule out profile corruption.

For detailed troubleshooting guidance, see the [Troubleshooting Installation](../troubleshooting/troubleshooting-install.md) page.

## 7. Where to Next?

Once you've verified your system meets these prerequisites, proceed to the [Installing uBO Scope](../installation-and-setup/installing-extension.md) guide to get started. After installation, refer to [First Launch and Permissions](../installation-and-setup/first-launch.md) to ensure uBO Scope is configured properly for monitoring.

---

## 8. Summary

uBO Scope requires a modern browser supporting MV3 and the `webRequest` API, specifically:

- Chrome 122.0+
- Firefox 128.0+
- Safari 18.5+

It supports Windows, macOS, Linux, and limited mobile support on Android Firefox and iOS Safari. Permissions for tab access, storage, and network monitoring are essential.

Preparing your environment accordingly ensures a smooth installation and accurate visibility into your browser's third-party connections.
