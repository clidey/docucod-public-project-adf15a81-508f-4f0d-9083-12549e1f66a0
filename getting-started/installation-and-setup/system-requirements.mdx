# Prerequisites & System Requirements

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to provide real-time visibility into remote server connections initiated by webpages. To ensure a smooth experience, it's essential to understand the supported platforms, minimum browser versions, and required permissions needed for the extension to operate effectively.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is compatible with the three major browser families where extension APIs allow monitoring of network requests through the `webRequest` API. Below are the platforms and minimum version requirements:

- **Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.)**
  - Minimum Chrome version: 122.0
  - Uses a Service Worker-based background script
  - Permissions and capabilities consistent with Manifest Version 3

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum Firefox version: 128.0
  - Supports `webRequest` API with appropriate host permissions

- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum Safari version: 18.5
  - Implements background scripts via module-style JavaScript files

> The extension will not function properly on browsers or versions that do not support Manifest Version 3 or the required APIs.


## 2. Permissions Required

uBO Scope requires explicit permissions to monitor and report network activities fully. These permissions ensure the extension can observe all webpage connections, including those potentially blocked or stealthily handled by other content blockers.

- **activeTab**: Grants the extension limited access to the active browsing tab to send and receive messages for real-time data display.

- **storage**: Allows persistence of session data and the public suffix list to maintain accurate and updated domain parsing.

- **webRequest**: Core permission that enables interception and observation of all network requests made by webpages, including HTTP and WebSocket connections.

- **host permissions**:
   - Permissions for all HTTP(s) URLs: `http://*/*` and `https://*/*`
   - For Firefox and Chromium: additionally `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*` to track WebSocket communications.

Without these permissions, uBO Scope cannot reliably detect or report remote server connections.


## 3. Technical Requirements

- **Network Access**: The extension relies on your browser's ability to report network requests via the `webRequest` API. It cannot track requests made outside this scope, such as DNS-level filtering that bypasses browser network APIs or network activity by other applications.

- **Public Suffix List**: uBO Scope uses the public suffix list to correctly determine domain boundaries. This list is downloaded and cached internally on first use or after a significant period.

- **Storage Availability**: The extension utilizes local and session storage to cache data and session details efficiently. Ensure your browser's storage APIs are enabled and functioning properly.


## 4. Summary of Browser Compatibility and Extension Requirements

| Browser Family      | Minimum Version | Required Permissions                   | Background Model        |
|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Chromium (Chrome)   | 122.0           | activeTab, storage, webRequest, host permissions (http, https, ws, wss) | Service Worker          |
| Mozilla Firefox     | 128.0           | activeTab, storage, webRequest, host permissions (http, https, ws, wss) | Background Module Script|
| Apple Safari       | 18.5            | activeTab, storage, webRequest, host permissions (http, https)         | Background Module Script|


## 5. Important Considerations

- **Keep Your Browser Updated**: To leverage the latest API improvements and security patches, ensure your browser runs a supported version.

- **Permission Prompts**: When installing uBO Scope, your browser will request the permissions above. Granting them is mandatory for the extension to function as intended.

- **Limitations**:
   - Network requests made outside the browser's `webRequest` scope (such as some system-level services) will not be visible.
   - DNS-level content blocking that prevents the browser from issuing requests will still be reported (i.e., you will see blocked or stealth requests appropriately).

- **Browser-Specific Behaviors**:
   - Safari has stricter extension permissions and API support; ensure compatibility before using uBO Scope.
   - Firefox supports the widest range of `webRequest` events, including WebSocket tracking.


## 6. Verification

After installing uBO Scope, verify the extension is active and properly reporting by:

1. Viewing the toolbar icon badge count reflecting the number of distinct third-party remote servers your active tab communicates with.
2. Clicking the uBO Scope icon to open the popup interface showing categorized connection data.

If no data appears or the badge remains empty even on active sites:

- Confirm the extension has the necessary permissions.
- Check your browser version is supported.
- Review any conflicting content blockers or browser settings that might interfere with `webRequest` API.


## 7. Next Steps

Once prerequisites are confirmed, proceed to the [Installation: Browser Guides](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/installing-on-your-browser) to install uBO Scope. Then return to this guide if you encounter setup issues or need to troubleshoot.


<Check>
Ensure your browser meets the minimum version requirements and that uBO Scope has all required permissions before proceeding with installation.
</Check>

<Note>
The accuracy of connection data depends on your browser's support for the `webRequest` API and proper extension permissions. uBO Scope complements, and does not replace, existing content blockers and network filters.
