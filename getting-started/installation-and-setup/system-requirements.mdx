# System & Browser Requirements for uBO Scope

To ensure uBO Scope functions correctly and provides accurate real-time reporting of remote server connections, it's essential to verify your environment meets the following system and browser compatibility criteria. This page helps you confirm that your setup supports uBO Scope before you proceed with installation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed for modern browsers supporting Manifest Version 3 extensions and the necessary WebExtension APIs.

| Browser        | Minimum Version | Notes                          |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------|
| Google Chrome  | 122.0           | Supports Manifest V3 extensions and required permissions.
| Mozilla Firefox| 128.0           | Requires strict MV3 compliance.
| Safari         | 18.5            | Supports Safari Web Extensions built on MV3.

> The extension uses the `webRequest` API and `action` properties available in these versions.

## 2. Operating System Considerations

uBO Scope is a browser extension and therefore runs on any OS supported by the compatible browsers. This includes:

- Windows 10 and newer
- macOS 12 Monterey and later (required for Safari 18.5)
- Linux distributions compatible with Chrome or Firefox
- iOS and Android in browsers that support extensions (limited and varies by platform)

> Since uBO Scope does not require any additional native software, OS requirements are minimal and dictated by browser support.

## 3. Necessary Permissions and Browser Features

uBO Scope requires explicit permissions to monitor network requests fully:

- `webRequest`: To observe remote server connection attempts.
- `storage`: To save session data and the public suffix list.
- `activeTab`: To interact with the active browser tab.

These permissions are requested and configured in the extension manifest and must be accepted during installation.

## 4. Network and Security Requirements

- The extension requires access to HTTP and HTTPS URLs across all domains (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`), as well as WebSocket and Secure WebSocket protocols (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) for full coverage of network activity.

- Firewall or antivirus software should allow browser extension activity and not block these network permissions.

- uBO Scope does not transmit your data externally; it passively monitors connections locally within the browser environment.

## 5. Verification Steps Before Installation

Follow these steps to verify system compatibility:

### Step 1: Check Browser Version

- Open your browser.
- Navigate to:
  - Chrome: `chrome://settings/help`
  - Firefox: `about:support`
  - Safari: `Safari > About Safari`
- Confirm the version meets or exceeds the minimum version listed above.

### Step 2: Confirm WebExtension Support

All supported browsers in the required versions have full WebExtension MV3 support. If in doubt, check browser release notes or official documentation.

### Step 3: Review Permissions

Ensure you are comfortable granting uBO Scope the necessary permissions at install time, as detailed above.

## 6. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

- If your browser version is lower than required, upgrade to the latest stable release.

- For browsers that do not currently support Manifest V3 or the `webRequest` API fully (including some derivative or older versions), uBO Scope will not function correctly.

- On Safari, verify that you are running at least version 18.5 to meet the strict MV3 requirements.

- Any firewall or proxy interference with browser extension network permissions may disrupt uBO Scopeâ€™s ability to monitor connections.

## 7. Additional Notes

- uBO Scope is cross-browser but must be installed separately from the respective official browser stores or using the appropriate distribution package for each platform.

- The extension includes up-to-date domain and public suffix data refreshed as part of its background session management to accurately identify and categorize domains.

- Always install uBO Scope from trusted sources such as the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) or the corresponding browser extension stores.

For detailed installation guidance, please visit the [Installing uBO Scope](./installing-ubo-scope) page in the Installation & Setup section.

For understanding system architecture, permissions, and integration considerations, see the [Integration & Compatibility](../../overview/architecture-features/integration-overview) document.

Use the [System Architecture](../../overview/architecture-features/system-architecture) page for insight into how uBO Scope interacts with the browser APIs.

### Example: Checking Chrome Version

```plaintext
1. Open Chrome.
2. Click the three-dot menu in the upper-right corner.
3. Select 'Help' > 'About Google Chrome'.
4. The version number displayed should be 122.0 or higher.
```

### Example: Permissions Shown at Install Time (Chrome)

When you add uBO Scope from the Chrome Web Store, the following permission prompt appears:

```plaintext
- Read and change your data on all websites
- Display notifications
- Access browser tabs
```

These permissions are mandatory for uBO Scope to monitor network connections transparently.

<Tip>
Running an unsupported browser version is the most common cause of installation failure or extension malfunction. Always verify your browser version before installation.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Safari users: Extensions require Safari 18.5 or newer, or the extension will not load due to strict MV3 requirements imposed by Apple.
</Warning>

<Info>
For privacy-conscious users, uBO Scope only monitors network requests locally and does not send data to external servers.
