## 3. Post-Installation Configuration

uBO Scope requires minimal configuration after installation. It is designed to work out-of-the-box.

### Background Permissions & Automatic Setup

- Upon installation, the extension registers its background script which listens to network events asynchronously.
- It automatically loads the required public suffix list to properly resolve domains and initializes session data.

### Optional Tweaks

- While no direct user configurations are required, you should verify:
  - **Browser Permissions:**
    - Go to `about:addons` > uBO Scope > Permissions and ensure all necessary permissions are enabled.
  - **Toolbar Badge:**
    - The badge on the toolbar icon shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected by the active tab.

## 4. Verifying Successful Installation

A quick way to confirm uBO Scope is functioning correctly involves checking network request data and observing the badge count.

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope Popup

- Navigate to any active website tab.
- Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
- The popup will display:
  - The main domain of the tab.
  - Counts of connected third-party domains categorized by:
    - Not blocked
    - Stealth-blocked
    - Blocked

### Step 2: Confirm Network Monitoring

- The badge on the extension icon should display a non-zero number, indicating active third-party connections.
- If visiting a new tab or a fresh page, this number updates dynamically as connections are detected.

<Check>
If no data appears or badge count remains empty:

- Try refreshing the tab.
- Confirm permissions are correctly granted.
- Restart Firefox if necessary.
</Check>
