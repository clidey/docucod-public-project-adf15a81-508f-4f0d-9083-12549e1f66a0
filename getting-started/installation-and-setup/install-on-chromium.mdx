## 2. Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to install uBO Scope efficiently:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Chrome Web Store">
Navigate to the official uBO Scope listing on the Chrome Web Store by clicking or copying the following URL into your chromium-based browser:

```
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp
```

This page hosts the latest official version of uBO Scope.
</Step>

<Step title="Add uBO Scope to Your Browser">
Click the **Add to Chrome** button on the store page.

A confirmation pop-up will appear requesting permission confirmation. These include permissions to access network requests (`webRequest`) and storage access necessary for the extension to monitor network connections.

Click **Add extension** to proceed.
</Step>

<Step title="Wait for Installation to Complete">
Once added, the browser will download and install the extension automatically.

You will see the uBO Scope icon appear on the toolbar at the top-right corner of your browser.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the Installation">
Confirm that uBO Scope was successfully installed by:

- Locating the uBO Scope icon (a small shield-like logo) in the toolbar area.
- Clicking the icon should open the uBO Scope popup window.

Alternatively, open the Extensions page (chrome://extensions) and verify uBO Scope is enabled.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the uBO Scope icon is not visible, click the puzzle piece icon to open your extensions list and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar for easy access.
</Tip>

## 3. Initial Browser Configuration

After installation, a brief setup step ensures uBO Scope functions optimally:

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm Required Permissions">
At first use, your browser might prompt to confirm uBO Scope's access to certain sites or network information.

Accept these prompts to allow full monitoring capability.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Toolbar Badge">
The extension icon displays a badge count representing the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser has connected to.

Upon first install, this count will update as you browse websites.
</Step>

<Step title="Test the Extension with a Webpage">
Navigate to a trusted website like https://example.com.

Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.

You should see the domain connections categorized under “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked.”
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The badge count reflects distinct third-party servers. A lower count indicates fewer external connections, which typically means higher privacy.
</Note>

## 4. Verifying a Successful Installation

To confirm uBO Scope is active and capturing network data:

1. Visit a website with third-party content, such as https://nytimes.com.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. The popup displays the number of connected domains in the summary section.
4. You should see lists of domains categorized by whether they were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

If these details appear, uBO Scope is working correctly.

<Warning>
If no data is displayed or the badge is always zero, ensure you are browsing with webRequest-enabled sites and that your browser version is Cromium 122+. Some internal or local pages may not generate network events.
</Warning>

## 5. Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep Your Browser Updated:** uBO Scope requires Chromium 122 or newer to function correctly.
- **Pin the Extension Icon:** For quick access and continuous visibility of network connection counts.
- **Combine with Content Blockers:** uBO Scope complements existing blockers to reveal real network activity.
- **Interpret Badge Counts:** Use badge counts as a privacy indicator, not as a pass/fail metric.
