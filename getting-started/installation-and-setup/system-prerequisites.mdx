# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Ensure your environment meets the following system and browser requirements to successfully install and run uBO Scope, a browser extension designed to monitor all third-party network connections during your browsing sessions.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers & Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is compatible with major browsers that support the `webRequest` API under Manifest Version 3. Note the specific version requirements per browser:

| Browser     | Minimum Supported Version |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Google Chrome / Chromium-based browsers | 122.0                 |
| Mozilla Firefox            | 128.0                 |
| Safari                    | 18.5                  |

> These versions ensure that the extension benefits from full functionality, including reliable network request tracking and badge updates.


## 2. Operating System Compatibility

uBO Scope supports all operating systems compatible with the above browser versions:

- Windows (latest and supported versions)
- macOS (including the version supporting Safari 18.5 and above)
- Linux distributions supporting Chrome/Firefox latest versions
- iOS / iPadOS (for Safari with version 18.5+, respecting Apple’s extension ecosystem limitations)


## 3. Required Browser Permissions

During installation, uBO Scope requests the following permissions to operate effectively:

- `webRequest`
  - Enables listening to all network requests the browser makes, essential for monitoring connections.

- `activeTab`
  - Allows the extension to interact with the active browser tab for accurate session data retrieval.

- `storage`
  - Used for storing session data persistently, including domain mapping and connection status.

- `host_permissions`
  - Necessary to monitor requests across `http`, `https`, and WebSocket protocols (`ws`, `wss`) on all sites.


> **Important:** These permissions are critical for uBO Scope to provide transparency on remote third-party connections unaffected by content blockers or DNS filtering.


## 4. Network Requirements

To achieve accurate monitoring, the browser must support the `webRequest` API and allow uBO Scope to receive events for all network requests, including WebSocket connections.

- The extension monitors URLs matching:
  - `https://*/*`
  - `http://*/*`
  - `wss://*/*` (for Firefox and Chromium variants)
  - `ws://*/*` (for Firefox and Chromium variants)



## 5. Key Prerequisites & Notes

- **Browser Compatibility:** If you use an unsupported browser or an older version than those specified, uBO Scope installation may fail or function incompletely.

- **Privacy & Security:** The extension requires elevated permissions to track network calls. It does not block or modify any traffic but reports on all connections, offering critical insights into third-party activity.

- **Persistent Storage:** Session data are stored locally within browser storage to maintain connection information between page loads.

- **Third-Party Domains Recognition:** uBO Scope relies on the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/list/) for accurate domain extraction and classification.

  This list is bundled and automatically updated by the extension for precise identification of registrable domains.


## 6. Summary of System Requirements

| Requirement              | Details                                                  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Browser                 | Chrome/Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+          |
| OS                      | Any OS supporting the above browsers                     |
| Permissions             | `webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`                      |
| Network URLs Monitored  | HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS protocols                            |
| Storage                 | Browser local storage for session persistence             |

## Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

If you encounter problems during installation or use, consider the following:

- **Extension Not Installing:** Verify your browser version meets or exceeds the minimum requirement.

- **No Network Data Captured:** Check that the browser supports `webRequest` and that no other extensions or browser policies block this.

- **Permissions Denied:** Ensure the extension is granted the requested permissions. Some browsers might require manual approval after installation.

- **Limited WebSocket Support:** Safari’s manifest does not include WebSocket host permissions, so monitoring WebSocket traffic may be limited.

- **Data Persistence Issues:** Confirm browser’s storage settings allow extensions to save data.
