## 3. Confirming Installation Success

Once installed, you should see the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. Here’s how to verify:

- **Icon Presence:** Look for an icon resembling a shield or the uBO Scope logo in your browser’s toolbar next to the address bar.

- **Tooltip Check:** Hover over the icon to see the tooltip "uBO Scope".

- **Popup Test:** Click the icon. A popup panel should open (initially showing "NO DATA" if no active tab data) with sections titled **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

If all these are in place, the extension is installed and ready for configuration.

## 4. Permissions and Automatic Setup

Upon installation, uBO Scope requests the following permissions to function correctly:

- **activeTab:** To monitor the currently active browser tab.
- **storage:** To save session and configuration data.
- **webRequest:** To listen to web requests and their outcomes.

Modern browsers will prompt you to approve these during installation. Accepting these permissions ensures full functionality.

## 5. Troubleshooting Installation Issues

If you do not see the uBO Scope icon or the popup does not open, try the following:

- **Restart Browser:** Close and reopen the browser to apply the extension installation.
- **Check Extension Status:** Visit your browser’s extension/add-on management page and ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
- **Version Compatibility:** Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements.
- **Network Restrictions:** Some corporate or protected networks restrict extension installation.
