# First Run & Onboarding

Welcome to **uBO Scope**! This guide helps you navigate your first experience launching the extension. It walks you through accessing the interface, understanding the initial information shown, and setting you up to immediately track your browser's network connections with confidence.

---

## 1. Launching uBO Scope for the First Time

After installing uBO Scope from your browser's official extension store (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari), follow these steps to get started:

### Step 1: Locate the Extension Icon
- Find the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It usually appears near the address bar or alongside other extensions.
- The icon includes a badge displaying a number — this count represents the number of **distinct third-party remote servers** your current browser tab has connected to.

### Step 2: Open the Popup Interface
- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup window.
- The popup presents detailed information about network connections for your active tab, categorized by connection outcome.

<Tip>
If you don’t see any data upon first launch, try reloading the active webpage or navigating to a site with network activity to allow uBO Scope to gather connection details.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface

The popup window organizes network connection data into clear, user-friendly sections:

### Header — Tab Hostname
- Displays the hostname and domain of the current browser tab.
- The display correctly handles internationalized domain names, converting them to a human-readable Unicode format.

### Summary Section
- Shows the total count of **distinct domains** connected from this tab.
- Remember, a **lower number is better**, indicating fewer third-party connections.

### Outcome Sections
The connections are grouped into three categories:

| Outcome          | What It Means                                                      | Explanation                                    |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**  | Domains that were allowed and successfully connected to           | These are the visible connections your tab made.
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Redirected connections or those blocked stealthily, not openly denied | Stealth blocking often means the requests were intercepted silently.
| **Blocked**      | Domains for which network requests were explicitly blocked or failed | These connections were prevented by content blockers or network errors.

Each section lists domains along with the count of requests made.

### Domain Rows
- Each domain row shows the domain name and a badge indicating how many times this domain was contacted in the current tab.
- Domains are displayed in alphabetical order for easy scanning.

---

## 3. Interpreting Initial Data

When you open uBO Scope for the first time or on a newly navigated page, here's what to expect:

- The active tab’s hostname and domain appear prominently at the top.
- The summary count updates dynamically to reflect the distinct third-party connections.
- Domains populate into allowed, stealth, or blocked categories as network requests are recorded.

<Tip>
Because uBO Scope relies on browser APIs that snapshot traffic dynamically, slight delays in populating the data are normal. Wait a few seconds or reload the tab to refresh the report.
</Tip>

<Tip>
The badge on the toolbar icon always shows the count of unique third-party domains allowed —
this number helps you quickly understand your exposure at a glance.
</Tip>

## 4. Common First-Run Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Badge Count or Empty Popup
- Ensure the page you are on is actively making network requests.
- Reload the page to trigger connection recording.
- Verify you have granted permissions if prompted during installation.

### Scenario 2: High Badge Count
- Remember, some websites use multiple third-party services such as CDNs and analytics.
- A high count may indicate multiple legitimate third-party connections, not necessarily a problem.
- Use the details in the popup to investigate which domains are involved.

### Scenario 3: Blocked Domains Present
- Seeing blocked domains means your content blocker or browser security is preventing connections.
- This is expected behavior and confirms active filtering.

---

## 5. Tips for Early Success

- **Reload Tabs Often:** The popup updates based on active tab data; reload pages to refresh.
- **Navigate Different Sites:** Explore diverse websites to see how connection profiles vary.
- **Use Badge as Quick Indicator:** Monitor the badge for quick privacy assessment as you browse.
- **Be Mindful of Legitimate Connections:** Not all third parties are harmful; some are essential CDN or service providers.
