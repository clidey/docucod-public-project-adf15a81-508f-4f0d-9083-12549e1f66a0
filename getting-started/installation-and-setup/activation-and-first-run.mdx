# Activation and First Run

Welcome to your first experience with uBO Scope. This page will guide you through launching the extension for the very first time, accessing its popup interface, and verifying that network data is being correctly collected and displayed. By the end of this guide, you'll understand how to activate the extension, what to expect from the user interface, and how to interpret the badge counter on your browser toolbar.

## 1. Launching uBO Scope for the First Time

Starting uBO Scope is effortless. Once installed, the extension activates automatically in your browser background and begins monitoring network requests.

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Icon

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It typically appears as the extension's logo next to the address bar.
- If the icon is hidden, check your browser's extension menu or customize your toolbar to pin it for quick access.

### Step 2: Observe the Badge Counter

- The badge on the uBO Scope icon displays the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** contacted by the active web page.
- A **lower badge number indicates fewer remote connections**, which is often desirable.
- Initially, when you open a new tab or a page with no recorded traffic yet, the badge may be empty or show zero.

<Tip>
The badge count updates dynamically as you navigate webpages and network connections are detected. This gives you real-time insight into remote server connections per tab.
</Tip>

## 2. Accessing the Popup Interface

The popup UI is your window into detailed information about network connections categorized by their outcomes.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup dialog will appear showing summarized data about the current active tab's network activity.

### What You Should See

- **Tab Hostname Header**: Displays the active web page's hostname and domain.
- **Summary Section**: Shows the total count of unique domains connected.
- **Outcome Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains with requests that were allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where stealth blocking occurred (connections attempted to be hidden).
  - **Blocked**: Domains for which network requests were blocked.

Each domain listed includes a count of connection attempts observed.

<Tip>
If the popup shows ‘NO DATA’ or no domains listed, this means no network data has been collected for the current tab. Make sure you are on an active webpage with network activity before opening the popup.
</Tip>

## 3. Verifying Network Data Collection

Ensuring uBO Scope is correctly capturing data is critical to relying on its insights.

### Quick Verification Steps:

1. Open a webpage that actively loads external resources (images, scripts, fonts).
2. Observe the toolbar badge count on uBO Scope's icon. It should display a number reflecting distinct third-party domains contacted.
3. Click the icon to open the popup and verify the domain lists populate accordingly.

### Example Scenario:

- Visit a popular news site.
- The badge might show a number like “5” indicating five distinct third-party remote hosts.
- The popup will list these domains under the "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," or "blocked" categories depending on their network request outcomes.

<Check>
If the badge remains empty despite network activity:
- Confirm the extension is enabled in your browser.
- Refresh the page after opening uBO Scope.
- Check permissions and your browser’s extension settings to verify the extension has `webRequest` permissions.
</Check>

## 4. Understanding the Badge Counter

The badge counter is the quickest way to gauge remote connections on the current tab.

- It **counts distinct third-party domains contacted** — not total requests.
- The count disables the need to interpret raw request logs by surfacing the key insight directly.
- The value changes as you navigate to new pages or interact with the webpage.

<Note>
The badge count does not reflect blocking effectiveness but rather informs about the number of third-party connections that were attempted or succeeded.
</Note>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Activation Issues

| Issue                        | Cause                                  | Solution                                   |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Badge never appears          | Extension might be disabled or missing required permissions | Ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled. Check browser permissions. |
| Popup shows “NO DATA”        | No network activity captured for the active tab | Navigate to an active webpage and refresh. Open popup again. |
| Unexpected badge counts      | Cached session data or delayed updates | Wait a few seconds after page load for updates. Refresh page if needed. |

<Tip>
Removing and reinstalling the extension can resolve persistent issues.
</Tip>
