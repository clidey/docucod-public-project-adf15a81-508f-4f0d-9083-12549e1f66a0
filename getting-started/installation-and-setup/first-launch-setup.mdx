# First Launch & Initial Configuration

Welcome to the first setup guide for **uBO Scope**, a browser extension designed to transparently report all remote server connections your browser makes. This page guides you through opening the extension after installation, granting any necessary permissions, and verifying that the popup UI displays expected domain information. It also explains how to interpret the toolbar badge on your browser, so you start your privacy monitoring journey with confidence.

## 1. Opening uBO Scope for the First Time

After installing uBO Scope from your browser's extension store or by manual installation, you'll want to launch the extension to ensure it’s active and functioning properly.

### How to Open the Extension Popup

- Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. This icon displays the uBO Scope logo.
- Click on the icon to open the popup UI.

The popup window shows network connection summaries and categories:

- **Domains connected:** The total count of distinct remote third-party domains your current tab has connected to.
- Categorized sections:
  - **Not blocked:** Domains your browser connected to without interference.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains blocked in a way that is not directly visible to the webpage.
  - **Blocked:** Domains that were actively blocked from connecting.

### What You Should See Initially

On a fresh tab or new site visit, the popup will show:
- The main hostname of the current tab at the top.
- The counts of connected domains, usually starting at zero or low numbers on a fresh page load.

If you see ‘NO DATA’ or question marks instead of domain information, it means no network data has been captured yet for that tab or there is a delay in receiving information.

<Check>
Clicking the toolbar icon successfully opens the popup. The hostname matches the active tab’s URL. Counts and domain lists are populated as network requests occur.
</Check>

## 2. Granting Required Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network activity effectively. These are requested automatically upon installation, but there are circumstances where you may need to grant or verify permissions manually.

### Permissions Needed

- Access to network web requests (`webRequest`) to observe connections.
- Storage access to save session data.
- ActiveTab permission to identify the current tab.

### Ensuring Permissions Are Granted

- Upon installing uBO Scope, your browser should prompt for these permissions.
- If permissions were not granted or were later revoked, uBO Scope may not collect or display connection data.

#### How to Check Permissions

- Open your browser’s extension management page (e.g., `chrome://extensions`, `about:addons` in Firefox).
- Locate uBO Scope.
- Verify that requested permissions appear as granted.
- If not, re-enable or reinstall the extension.

<Warning>
Without these permissions, uBO Scope cannot function as intended and will not display network connection data.
</Warning>

## 3. Understanding and Using the Toolbar Badge

The toolbar badge on the uBO Scope icon provides a quick at-a-glance metric of your current tab’s network activity.

### What the Badge Count Indicates

- The number displayed is the count of **distinct third-party remote server domains** your browser has connected to during the current tab session.
- A lower count signals fewer third-party connections, which generally implies better privacy.

### Badge Behavior on First Launch

- When opening a new tab or visiting a new site, this badge count usually starts empty or zero.
- As network requests are detected, the badge updates automatically to reflect new allowed connections.

### Common Badge Interpretations

- **No number shown:** No third-party connections detected yet or the extension is not capturing requests.
- **Number increases:** New third-party servers are contacted by the browser.

<Tip>
Keep in mind that content blockers or DNS-level blocking can affect this count, so a higher badge count doesn't necessarily mean worse privacy unless confirmed by connection outcomes.
</Tip>

## 4. First Operation: Viewing Domain Summaries

Once uBO Scope is running and permissions are in place, conduct a typical browsing session to see network monitoring in action.

### Steps to Run Your First Operation

1. Navigate to a website of your choice in a new browser tab.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
3. Observe the following:
   - The hostname at the top should display the main domain of the website you opened.
   - The **domains connected** count should reflect third-party connections detected so far.
   - Domains will be categorized under **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** based on how your browser and content blockers handled these connections.

### Interpreting the Popup Data

- **Not blocked:** These are servers your browser contacted successfully.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections blocked in a way that's hidden from the web page.
- **Blocked:** Connections actively prevented.

Clicking on the domain names inside the popup is not currently supported for further details, but domain counts help you understand which third parties load resources.

<Note>
You can refresh the page and reopen the popup to see domain counts update dynamically as new network connections occur.
</Note>

## 5. Tips for a Smooth First Launch

- **Reopen the popup:** Sometimes network data takes a moment to populate; waiting a few seconds and reopening helps.
- **Reload your tab/page:** This triggers new network requests, which uBO Scope will monitor.
- **Check browser version:** uBO Scope requires minimum versions (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+) to operate correctly.
- **Confirm extension is enabled:** Make sure uBO Scope is active in your browser extensions list.

- Try refreshing the page to reload network requests.
- Confirm that uBO Scope is enabled and has required permissions in the browser's extension page.
- Check that your browser version meets minimum requirements.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Toolbar badge does not update or is missing">
- Reload the page you are browsing.
- Confirm that no other security or privacy extensions block webRequest API access.

## 7. Next Steps

Now that uBO Scope is successfully launched and configured:

- Explore the [Navigating the uBO Scope Popup](../guides/group-getting-started/page-navigating-popup-ui) guide to learn how to interpret network results in more depth.
- Visit [Quick Validation: Is uBO Scope Working?](../getting-started/usage-validation-and-troubleshooting/quick-validation) for verification steps.
- Consult the [Supported Browsers & System Requirements](../getting-started/introduction-and-requirements/supported-browsers-and-requirements) to ensure your environment is optimal.

If you encounter installation or permission issues, head to the [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](../getting-started/usage-validation-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-common-issues) page.
