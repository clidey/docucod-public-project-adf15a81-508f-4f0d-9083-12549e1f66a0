# Install uBO Scope on Your Browser

Easily install uBO Scope on your preferred browser — Chrome, Firefox, or Safari — by following these precise, browser-specific instructions. This guide provides official store links, verification tips to confirm proper installation, and highlights important platform-specific nuances that ensure a smooth setup experience.

## 1. Supported Browsers & Requirements

Before proceeding, confirm your system supports uBO Scope:

- **Chrome**: Version 122.0 or later.
- **Firefox**: Version 128.0 or later (including Firefox for Android).
- **Safari**: Version 18.5 or later.

<u>Note</u>: Installing uBO Scope on unsupported versions may cause errors or incomplete functionality.


## 2. Install from Official Browser Extension Stores

Installing uBO Scope through your browser’s official extension store guarantees you receive the latest secure release.

### Chrome Installation

1. Open your Chrome browser.
2. Navigate to the [Chrome Web Store uBO Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
3. Click **Add to Chrome**.
4. Confirm by selecting **Add extension** in the prompt.

### Firefox Installation

1. Open your Firefox browser.
2. Visit the [Firefox Add-ons uBO Scope page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
3. Click **Add to Firefox**.
4. Approve installation when prompted.

### Safari Installation

1. Open your Safari browser (macOS 13 Ventura or later).
2. Open the [Safari Extensions Gallery](https://apps.apple.com/app/ubo-scope/idyourapplestoreid) or the Mac App Store entry for uBO Scope (link will be published / updated).
3. Click **Install** or **Get** and authenticate if required.

> **Note**: Safari’s extension platform may require enabling uBO Scope under Safari → Settings → Extensions after installation.

## 3. Post-Installation Verification

Validating the successful installation of uBO Scope ensures the extension is active and functioning correctly.

### Visual Confirmation

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar. It uses the characteristic uBlock Origin blue shield icon.

- In Chrome and Firefox, the icon may be hidden inside the extensions menu (puzzle piece icon).

- Safari shows installed extensions via its toolbar or menu bar icon.

### Badge and Popup Verification

1. Click the uBO Scope icon.
2. Confirm the popup displays “domains connected: ?” shortly after loading a web page.
3. The count updates dynamically to reflect third-party remote servers contacted by the page.

### Permissions Check

- uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor network requests (`webRequest`) and access active tabs.
- These permissions are granted automatically on install but can be verified in the browser’s extension management page.

## 4. Platform Nuances and Tips

### Permissions and Host Access

- uBO Scope requests permissions to monitor web traffic on all HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket URLs.
- Because permissions involve sensitive data access, some browsers may require manual approval after install.

### Background Service Behavior

- In Chromium browsers, uBO Scope runs a background service worker for monitoring.
- Firefox and Safari use background scripts with specific API behaviors.

### Browser-Specific Notes

| Browser  | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Chrome   | Minimum version is 122. Supports full webRequest API needed by uBO Scope.
| Firefox  | Supports full webRequest API from version 128. Android support included.
| Safari   | Limited to HTTP/HTTPS host permissions; WebSocket monitoring unavailable. Requires enabling in settings.
