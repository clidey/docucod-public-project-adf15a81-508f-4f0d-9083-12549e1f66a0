# Prerequisites & System Compatibility

Ensure your environment fully supports uBO Scope before proceeding with installation. This guide details the minimum system requirements, supported browsers, necessary permissions, and network considerations to guarantee optimal functionality and a smooth user experience.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers & Versions

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to work across major browsers with support for the WebExtensions API, specifically leveraging the `webRequest` API for monitoring network connections.

| Browser  | Minimum Version   | Notes                                   |
|----------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Chromium | 122.0 and above  | Requires Manifest V3 support and service worker background scripts |
| Firefox  | 128.0 and above  | Supports Manifest V3 with module background scripts |
| Safari   | 18.5 and above   | Supports Safari Web Extension Manifest V3 with module background scripts |


### Why These Versions?

These minimum versions ensure compatibility with Manifest V3 requirements and reliable access to the `webRequest` API, which uBO Scope uses to observe all network requests made by webpages.

<Check>
Verify your browser version before installation. Older versions lack necessary APIs and won't function correctly with uBO Scope.
</Check>

---

## 2. System Requirements

uBO Scope is a lightweight extension with modest system demands. However, to ensure reliable operation, check the following:

- **Operating System:** Compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux, and supported mobile OS versions that run the above browser versions.
- **Memory:** Minimum 512 MB RAM recommended to support browser and extension multitasking.
- **Disk Space:** Less than 10 MB needed for installation.
- **Network:** Active internet connection for installing the extension and loading external resources during browsing.

<Note>
Minimal hardware resources required; focus on correct browser and permissions instead.
</Note>

---

## 3. Necessary Permissions

When installing uBO Scope, the extension requests the following browser permissions to function as intended:

- **`webRequest` Permission:** Allows the extension to observe and collect real-time network request data as webpages load.
- **`activeTab` Permission:** Grants temporary access to the current active tab's data, enabling the popup UI to display domain connection summaries.
- **`storage` Permission:** Uses persistent storage for session data such as aggregated connection details and the Public Suffix List.

<Warning>
Granting these permissions is essential. Without `webRequest`, uBO Scope cannot monitor network connections, negating its core purpose.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Supported URL Patterns

uBO Scope declares broad host permissions to cover all common web protocols:

- `http://*/*`
- `https://*/*`
- `ws://*/*`
- `wss://*/*` (Chromium and Firefox only; Safari limits to http/https)

This ensures coverage of standard HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket connections.

---

## 5. Browser Configuration Notes

### Network Privacy Tools Compatibility

uBO Scope detects network requests independently of content blockers or DNS-based filtering. Ensure your browser's network privacy or security extensions do not block or obfuscate requests in a way that hides them from the `webRequest` API.

### Content Blocking & WebRequest API

uBO Scope will report request outcomes regardless of other content blockers applied, including blocked or stealth-blocked requests.

## 6. Access & Permissions Checklist Before Installing

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Your Browser Version">
Make sure your browser meets the minimum supported version for uBO Scope (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Browser Permissions Support">
Confirm that the browser supports Manifest V3 and the `webRequest` API, as these are mandatory for uBO Scope's functionality.
</Step>
<Step title="Prepare to Grant Permissions at Installation">
Get ready to allow uBO Scope access to `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` when prompted during installation.
</Step>
<Step title="Ensure Network Access">
Confirm your device has active internet connectivity and no firewall or security tool restricts browser extensions.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 7. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Using Outdated Browsers:** Older versions may silently fail without obvious errors, causing uBO Scope to show no data.
- **Restrictive Security Policies:** Enterprise or custom browser policies might block necessary extension permissions.
- **Conflicting Extensions:** Some privacy or security extensions intercept or modify network requests in a way that bypasses the `webRequest` API.

<Warning>
If uBO Scope shows static or empty data despite browsing, revisit system compatibility and browser permissions.
</Warning>

## 9. Verifying Compatibility After Installation

Once installed, uBO Scope will place an icon in your browser toolbar. Upon visiting any website, you should observe:

- A real-time badge count showing the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- A popup panel listing domains under "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" categories.

If these elements load and update, your system is compatible and the extension is fully operational.
