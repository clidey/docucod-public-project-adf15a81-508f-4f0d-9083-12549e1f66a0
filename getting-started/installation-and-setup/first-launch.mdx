# First Launch Experience

Welcome to your first interaction with uBO Scope! This guide walks you through what to expect immediately after installing the extension, how to open and navigate the popup interface, and a simple checklist to confirm the extension is working correctly. You'll also learn how the badge count functions and where to find detailed connection data.

## 1. Accessing uBO Scope

After installing uBO Scope, you will notice its icon in your browser's toolbar. The icon serves as your primary access point to the extension's data and features.

### Steps to Open the Popup Interface:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope Icon:**
   - Find the extension icon (a shield with "uBO Scope") on your browser's toolbar next to the address bar.

2. **Click the Icon:**
   - A popup window will appear, displaying network connection data for the current active tab.

3. **Observe Initial Loading:**
   - The popup may briefly display a loading state while it fetches data for the active tab.

4. **View Network Connection Summary:**
   - See the list of third-party domains your current webpage has connected to, categorized into three sections:
     - **Not Blocked:** Connections allowed.
     - **Stealth Blocked:** Connections blocked stealthily.
     - **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked.

### Important Notes:
- The popup automatically updates with data pertaining to the active tab.
- If no data is available, the popup will indicate "NO DATA".

## 2. Understanding the Badge Count

The badge count on the uBO Scope icon provides a quick summary:

- **What It Represents:** The number shown is the count of distinct third-party remote domains for which the current webpage has successfully connected.
- **Why It Matters:** A lower badge count generally indicates fewer third-party connections—which is typically more desirable from a privacy standpoint.

### How the Badge Updates:
- The badge updates dynamically as your active tab makes new connections.
- It only counts unique third-party domains with successful connections, not all network requests.

### Troubleshooting Badge Display:
- If the badge remains blank, no third-party distinct connections have been recorded yet for the current tab.
- If the badge does not update when navigating pages, try clicking the icon to refresh the popup.

## 3. Exploring Connection Data in the Popup

Once the popup is open, you will see detailed connection information:

### Popup Sections:
- **Host Information:** Displays the hostname and domain of the current active tab.
  - The domain (last part of the hostname) is shown prominently.
  - The subdomain, if any, is shown beside the domain.

- **Domains Connected Summary:** Indicates the total number of distinct domains connected.

- **Not Blocked:** Lists allowed third-party domains with connection counts.

- **Stealth-Blocked:** Lists third-party domains where connections were stealthily blocked.

- **Blocked:** Lists third-party domains where connections were explicitly blocked.

### Interaction:
- Each domain entry shows how many times it was connected or blocked.
- Domains are presented sorted alphabetically within each category.
