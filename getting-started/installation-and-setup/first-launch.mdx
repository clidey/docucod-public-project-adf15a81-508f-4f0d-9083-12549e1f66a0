# Initial Launch & Configuration

Welcome to your first step with **uBO Scope**! This guide walks you through launching the extension for the first time, ensuring it is properly configured, and understanding the core user interface of the popup. By the end, you'll confidently verify that uBO Scope is active and begin exploring the network connections your browser tabs make.

---

## 1. Launching uBO Scope for the First Time

After you have successfully installed uBO Scope from your browser's official extension store (see the Installation guide), follow these steps to launch and configure the extension:

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Icon">
Once installed, find the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar. It uses the distinctive uBO Scope logo in various sizes (16x16 to 128x128 pixels).

If you do not see the icon, check your browser’s extension or add-on menu and pin it for quick access.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the Extension Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon. This action opens the extension’s popup window (`popup.html`) where network connection data will be displayed.

The popup initially shows a loading state with a placeholder 'NO DATA' message, as it prepares to gather network request information for the active tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Grant Permissions Automatically">
uBO Scope operates silently in the background using browser permissions granted during installation. There is no manual prompt after installation for additional permissions.

Permissions used include access to active tabs, local storage, and the `webRequest` API to monitor network connections.

If you encounter permission issues, please check your browser extension settings to ensure these are enabled.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Tip
uBO Scope requires browser version 128+ for Firefox and versions 122+ for Chromium browsers for full functionality. Confirm your browser is up to date to avoid compatibility problems.

## 2. Understanding the Popup UI Basics

The uBO Scope popup provides a concise summary of remote server connection activity in the current browser tab.

### Popup Sections and Their Meaning

- **Tab Hostname Header**: Displays the domain name of the current active tab for context.

- **Summary Section**: Shows the total number of distinct domains connected to (those not blocked).

- **Outcome Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains successfully contacted without obstruction.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where requests were redirected or stealth-blocked.
  - **Blocked**: Domains for which connection requests failed or were explicitly blocked.

Each section lists domains accompanied by a badge count indicating the number of requests.

### Real Scenario
For example, on a news article webpage, you may see a few CDN domains listed under 'Not Blocked' and possibly some trackers under 'Blocked' or 'Stealth-Blocked,' providing real-time transparency about network activity.

## 3. Verifying the Extension Is Active and Monitoring

You can validate that uBO Scope is running correctly by following these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Reload the Active Tab">
Refresh the webpage you want to inspect. Network requests triggered on reload provide data for uBO Scope to analyze.

Waiting a few seconds allows uBO Scope to collect and display updated connection information.
</Step>

<Step title="Check the Toolbar Badge">
Look at the uBO Scope icon’s badge count on the toolbar. This number represents the distinct third-party domains your active tab connected to.

A non-empty badge count confirms the extension is actively monitoring network events.
</Step>

<Step title="View the Popup Details">
Open the popup for the active tab and compare the domains listed in each outcome category.

If domains appear under 'Not Blocked' or 'Blocked,' uBO Scope is actively reporting.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Badge counts reflect third-party remote servers connected, so a lower count is generally better from a privacy perspective. Remember, legitimate domains like CDNs may appear and are not necessarily harmful.
</Note>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common First-Run Issues

If you do not see any data or the badge count remains empty, try the following:

<AccordionGroup title="First-Run Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Extension Icon Not Visible">
- Confirm the extension is enabled in your browser’s extension/add-on settings.
- Pin the extension to your toolbar if hidden.
- Restart the browser if changes don’t appear immediately.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Connections Reported After Reload">
- Verify you are on a website that triggers network requests (some pages like blank tabs have no connections).
- Wait a few seconds after reload for data to populate.
- Clear browser cache and try reloading.
- Check browser version matches minimum requirements (Firefox ≥128, Chrome ≥122).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permissions Issues or Errors">
- Ensure uBO Scope has required permissions (`activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`).
- Disable other extensions that might interfere with network monitoring.
- Inspect browser console or extension logs for error messages.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
