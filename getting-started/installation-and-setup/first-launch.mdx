# First Launch and Permissions

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through what to expect and do immediately after installing the extension—focusing on granting necessary permissions, understanding the popup interface, and verifying that the extension is active in your browser.

---

## 1. Granting Necessary Permissions

uBO Scope depends on specific browser permissions to function correctly. Without these permissions, the extension cannot monitor network requests or report the data you need.

### Permissions Required

- **webRequest**: Enables uBO Scope to listen to and analyze network requests your browser makes.
- **activeTab**: Allows temporary access to the current tab's URL and data.
- **storage**: Manages configuration and session data persistently across browser restarts.

These permissions are requested automatically at installation. However, your browser may prompt you to review or approve them on first use.

### What You Should Do

1. After installation, watch for any browser prompts asking you to allow permissions.
2. Approve all permissions requested to ensure full functionality.
3. If a permission is denied, uBO Scope cannot properly monitor network connections, and the UI will show limited or no data.

<Tip>
If you inadvertently deny permissions, you can revisit your browser’s extension settings to grant them manually.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface

Clicking on the uBO Scope toolbar icon opens a **popup interface** designed to provide at-a-glance insights into third-party network connections for the active tab.

### Popup Key Sections

- **Hostname Display**: Shows the current tab’s primary hostname and domain. This identifies the website you are monitoring.
- **Domains Connected**: Displays the count of distinct third-party domains with which connections have been made or attempted.
- **Connection Categories**:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains where network requests were successful.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where network requests were redirected stealthily by other content blockers.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where network requests were explicitly blocked.

Each category lists the domains involved, along with the number of requests observed, allowing you to assess exposure at a glance.

### How Data Loads

- When you open the popup, it queries the background processing script to retrieve up-to-date data about network requests for the current tab.
- The interface updates dynamically, showing you counts and domains.

<Note>
If the popup shows "NO DATA", it may mean the tab has not yet made network requests since uBO Scope was installed or permissions have not been granted.
</Note>

## 3. Verifying uBO Scope Is Active

After installation and permission granting, confirm the extension is running correctly by following these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Toolbar Icon Badge">
Look for a number badge on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon. This badge indicates the number of distinct third-party domains connected to on the active tab. A non-empty badge confirms the extension is tracking network requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Open Popup and Inspect Data">
Click the toolbar icon to open the popup. Confirm the hostname displays correctly and that lists in each connection category (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked) populate with domains and counts.
</Step>
<Step title="Browse Known Websites">
Visit a few websites with known external resources (e.g., news sites with ads or third-party analytics). Watch if the badge count updates and popup displays domain data accordingly.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The badge count tends to be low for privacy-conscious websites with minimal third parties, and may increase on sites with multiple external resources.
</Tip>

## 4. Common Pitfalls and Tips

- **No Badge or "NO DATA" in Popup**:
  - Verify that all required permissions were accepted.
  - Ensure you are using a supported browser version meeting system requirements.
  - Reload the tab or restart the browser to initiate network request tracking.

- **Permissions Revoked or Restricted**:
  - Some browsers may restrict permissions post-installation. Check your extension settings and re-enable permissions.

- **Multiple Clicks Without Updates**:
  - The popup updates on opening, so closing and reopening the popup refreshes live data.

- **Browser Compatibility**:
  - uBO Scope fully supports modern versions of Chromium-based browsers (Chrome 122+), Firefox 128+, and Safari 18.5+. Ensure your browser is up to date.
