# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

This page outlines the supported browsers, operating systems, and any prerequisites necessary to install and run uBO Scope effectively. Ensuring your environment meets these requirements guarantees a smooth installation and reliable performance from the extension.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to work with multiple modern browsers. Confirm that you are using one of the supported browsers listed below before proceeding:

- **Google Chrome / Chromium-based browsers**
  - Minimum version: 122.0 or higher
  - Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum version: 128.0 or higher
  - Install from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum version: 18.5 or higher
  - Available through the Safari Extensions Gallery or Apple App Store



## 2. Operating System Compatibility

uBO Scope supports all major desktop operating systems supported by the above browsers including:

- Windows 10 and later
- macOS 11 Big Sur and later
- Linux distributions with compatible versions of Chrome or Firefox

Mobile support is **not available** at this time.


## 3. Browser Permissions Required

uBO Scope operates by monitoring network activity through browser APIs and requires the following permissions:

- **`webRequest`**: To observe network requests dispatched by webpages
- **`storage`**: To save session data such as tracking connection details per tab
- **`activeTab`**: To interact with the currently active tab for providing live insights

During installation, the extension will request these permissions. Ensure you grant them to enable full functionality.


## 4. Network Access Requirements

Since uBO Scope monitors network requests, it requires:

- Unrestricted access to HTTP and HTTPS URLs (`http://*/*` and `https://*/*`)
- WebSocket protocols (`ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*`) where applicable (depending on browser support)

No additional firewall or proxy configuration is typically necessary. However, ensure network filtering tools do not block these protocols for the extension to work properly.


## 5. Prerequisites Before Installation

Before installing uBO Scope, verify the following:

- You have a compatible supported browser installed at the required minimum version or newer.
- Your browser allows installation of third-party extensions.
- You are able to grant the required permissions mentioned above.


## 6. Important Notes

- uBO Scope depends on your browser's `webRequest` API to detect network connections. Any network activity outside this API (such as certain browser internal requests or requests blocked at the DNS or network level without browser notice) will not be visible.
- The extension is independent of content blockers but works well alongside them for additional visibility.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
If your browser version is below the minimum required, update your browser to the latest version available from the official site or your OS package manager.

- In Chrome, go to `chrome://settings/help` to check for updates.
- In Firefox, go to `about:preferences#general` then "Firefox Updates".

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Not Granted">
If you accidentally denied required permissions during installation:

1. Open your browser's extensions page.
2. Find uBO Scope and click `Details`.
3. Enable the requested permissions manually or remove and reinstall the extension.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Requests Not Showing">
If uBO Scope shows no data despite being installed correctly:

- Check if your browser or network setup restricts `webRequest` API access.
- Confirm that the URLs you visit permit monitoring (some internal pages or incognito modes may limit access).
- Disable conflicting extensions that may interfere with network monitoring.
