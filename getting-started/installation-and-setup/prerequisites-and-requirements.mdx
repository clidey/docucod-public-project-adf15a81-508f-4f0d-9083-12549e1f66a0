# Prerequisites and System Requirements for uBO Scope

Before you install and start using uBO Scope, ensure your environment meets the following requirements and permissions. This section helps you verify compatibility and understand the essential permissions needed for a smooth setup.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a lightweight companion extension to uBlock Origin that monitors and reports network connections directly in your browser.

Ensure you are using one of the following supported browsers with the minimum required version:

| Browser   | Minimum Version |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Chromium  | 122.0           |
| Firefox   | 128.0           |
| Safari    | 18.5            |


> These minimum versions reflect the browser capabilities needed to support Manifest V3 extensions and allow uBO Scope to listen to network requests effectively.


### Browser Notes

- **Chromium-based browsers:** Including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and others that support Manifest V3.
- **Firefox:** Official support starts at version 128.0 due to the required APIs.
- **Safari:** Requires Safari 18.5 or higher with Manifest V3 support.


## 2. System and Environment Requirements

uBO Scope has minimal system demands, operating as a browser extension. However, to ensure uninterrupted performance:

- You should have sufficient free disk space for installing extensions (typically under 10 MB).
- An active network connection for loading web pages and extension components.
- Operating System: Compatible with OS versions that support the specified browser version.


## 3. Required Permissions

uBO Scope requires the following browser permissions to function correctly:

| Permission  | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `webRequest` | Allows uBO Scope to observe network traffic made by the browser to report connection outcomes, including allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked requests. |
| `activeTab`  | Enables interaction with the currently active browser tab to gather and display data relevant to that page. |
| `storage`    | Permits saving session data locally for tracking connection information persistently during browser sessions. |
| Host Permissions (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) | Grants access to monitor network requests across all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and Secure WebSocket protocols. |


> These permissions are required by the extension by design and will be requested automatically when installing uBO Scope.


## 4. Important Pre-Installation Considerations

- **Content Blockers:** uBO Scope works alongside any content blocker. It reports network requests regardless of content blockers in use, whether they allow, block, or stealth-block requests.
- **Network Request Scope:** The extension can only observe network requests reported by the browser's `webRequest` API. Requests made outside this scope, for example by native apps or certain protocols, will not be visible.


## 5. Security and Privacy

uBO Scope collects and analyzes network request metadata to provide transparency about remote connections your browser makes. It does not access or transmit your personal data outside the extension context.


## 6. Summary of Essential Checks Before Installation

Follow these steps to confirm your setup is ready:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Browser Version">
Check your browser’s version and ensure it meets the minimum requirements above.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Extension Permissions Availability">
Make sure your browser allows installation of extensions with the `webRequest` and `storage` permissions.
</Step>
<Step title="Network Access">
Verify your device has network connectivity and no restrictive firewall rules blocking web traffic.
</Step>
<Step title="Browser Compatibility">
Ensure you are not using unsupported browsers or environments (e.g., mobile browsers without Manifest V3 support).
</Step>
</Steps>


## 7. Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Prerequisites Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">

If you receive errors about incompatible browser versions, update your browser to the latest stable release.

- **Chromium:** Go to settings › About Chrome and update
- **Firefox:** Use the menu › Help › About Firefox
- **Safari:** Upgrade macOS to the latest supported version

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Not Granted">

When installing, ensure you accept all requested permissions. If you reject `webRequest` or host permissions, the extension's functionality will be limited or non-functional.

To reset permissions:

- Remove and reinstall the extension
- Allow permissions when prompted
- Restart your browser

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Blocked or Restricted">

If your network environment restricts outbound web traffic, uBO Scope may not receive request data properly.

Check firewall or proxy settings restricting HTTP, HTTPS, or WebSocket traffic.
