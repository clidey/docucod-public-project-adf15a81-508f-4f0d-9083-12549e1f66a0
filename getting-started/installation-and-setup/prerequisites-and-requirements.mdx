## 3. Extension Store Access

To install uBO Scope safely and receive automatic updates, download the extension from your browser’s official extension store:

<Warning>
  Avoid installing uBO Scope from unverified third-party sources to protect your privacy and security.
</Warning>

## 4. Permissions and Configurations

Before installation, verify the following to ensure the extension functions accurately:

- **Browser Permissions:**
  - uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor network requests, specifically the `webRequest` permission.
  - Access to active tab data and storage is needed.
- **Network Settings:**
  - The browser must allow uBO Scope access to all HTTP(S) and WebSocket URLs.
  - Firewalls or network proxies should not block these connections.

<Check>
  Typically, default browser and network settings support these permissions, but environments with strict corporate policies may require adjustments.
</Check>

## 5. Browser Configuration Tips

- Ensure your browser extensions are enabled and allowed to run on all websites for accurate network monitoring.
- Confirm that any existing content blockers or privacy tools do not prevent extensions from gaining network analytics access.

<Tip>
  Installing uBO Scope alongside popular content blockers like uBlock Origin is supported, as uBO Scope monitors independently.
</Tip>
