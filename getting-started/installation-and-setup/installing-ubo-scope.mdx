## 3. Verification After Installation

Once installed, confirm uBO Scope is working correctly:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon (a small badge) in your browser toolbar. The icon resembles the extension’s logo.
2. Click the icon to open the popup window.
3. Load any website. The popup should display the number of connected domains and categorize network requests.

<Tip>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or is empty initially, try reloading the active tab to allow uBO Scope to collect network requests.
</Tip>

## 4. Tips for Smooth Installation

- **Permission Prompts:** uBO Scope requires permission to monitor network requests (`webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab`). Approve these when prompted; without them, the extension cannot function properly.

- **Browser Compatibility:** Ensure your browser supports Manifest Version 3 extensions, as uBO Scope uses this modern format.

- **Incognito Mode:** If you want to use uBO Scope in incognito/private windows, you must explicitly enable the extension for that mode via browser extension settings.

- **Updates:** Automatic updates are handled by browser stores. To update manually, reinstall the extension from the store.
