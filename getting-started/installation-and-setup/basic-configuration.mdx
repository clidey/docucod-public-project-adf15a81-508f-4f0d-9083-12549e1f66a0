# Basic Configuration

Welcome to the first step in familiarizing yourself with **uBO Scope**. This guide will walk you through opening the extension for the first time, exploring its user interface, enabling necessary permissions, and completing initial setups to ensure smooth operation.

---

## 1. Opening uBO Scope for the First Time

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension that runs quietly in the background but provides valuable insights through its popup interface.

### How to open the uBO Scope popup:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon** in your browser's toolbar (usually near the address bar). The icon resembles a stylized shield.
2. **Click the icon** once to open the popup panel.

> The popup displays connection statistics and domain details related to the currently active browser tab.

### If you don't see the icon:

- Ensure the extension is installed correctly using the [Installation Instructions](../installation-and-setup/installation-instructions).
- Check if the extension is hidden behind the browser's extension menu (puzzle piece icon) and pin it to the toolbar for quick access.

## 2. Familiarizing Yourself with the Interface

The popup interface offers a clear snapshot of your current tab’s network connections:

- **Hostname Header:** Displays the domain of the active tab, splitting host-specific and base domain parts for easy recognition.
- **Summary Section:** Shows the count of distinct third-party domains successfully connected to.
- **Connection Outcome Sections:** Three zones categorize domains based on network request outcomes:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains where connections were successful.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were blocked invisibly (without webpage indication).
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly blocked by a content blocker or browser.

Each domain listing includes:

- The domain name (decoded to Unicode where applicable) for clarity.
- A badge showing how many times connections were made to that domain in the current tab session.

**Tip:** Hover over or click domains (depending on browser support) to see detailed connection information if/when this feature is supported in future releases.

## 3. Enabling Permissions and Ensuring Access

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to operate correctly. These permissions are typically granted during installation but verifying them ensures the extension can access necessary browser APIs.

### Key permissions uBO Scope needs:

- **`webRequest` permission:** To monitor all network requests and their status.
- **Host permissions:** Access to all HTTP(S) and WebSocket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` depending on your browser).
- **Storage permission:** To save session data between browser sessions.

### How to check and enable permissions:

1. Open your browser’s extensions management page.
2. Locate uBO Scope in the list.
3. Review the permissions section. If permissions are disabled or missing, enable them or reinstall the extension as needed.

<Warning>
Without these permissions, uBO Scope cannot accurately track or report connection outcomes.
</Warning>

## 4. Completing Your First-Time Setup

uBO Scope is designed to work with minimal manual configuration.

### Recommended actions for your initial setup:

- **Check your browser's extension settings** to ensure uBO Scope is *enabled* and *allowed* to run on all websites.
- **Pin the uBO Scope icon** to your toolbar for quick access to connection insights.
- **Open the popup after navigating to a webpage** to see live connection data.

### Viewing your first results:

- Visit a website with typical third-party content (e.g., news or blogs with ads) to see how many third-party domains are contacted.
- Open the uBO Scope popup and verify domain lists populate under "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and/or "blocked" categories.

<Check>
Seeing a numeric badge count on the extension icon and domain lists in the popup confirms you have successfully completed the basic configuration.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

uBO Scope relies heavily on browser-provided APIs and permissions. If connection data does not appear as expected, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

### Problem: Popup shows "NO DATA" or no domains

- **Verify permissions:** Confirm `webRequest` and host permissions are granted.
- **Refresh the tab:** Network requests are recorded per tab; reloading the page triggers fresh data collection.
- **Check browser compatibility:** uBO Scope supports Chromium-based browsers (Chrome 122+), Firefox 128+, and Safari 18.5+. Using outdated browser versions may block features.
- **Disable conflicting extensions:** Some security or privacy extensions might interfere with uBO Scope’s ability to monitor network requests.
- **Restart your browser:** This refreshes background processes and service workers.

### Problem: The badge count does not update

- **Confirm network activity:** The badge reflects the number of unique third-party domains contacted. If your browsing is limited to first-party or no network connections, the badge may be blank.
- **Reload the active tab:** Forces update of connection data for the tab.
- **Update the extension:** Verify you have the latest extension version.

## 6. Next Steps

After completing this basic configuration, you’re ready to:

- Explore [Using the Extension for the First Time](../getting-your-first-results/using-the-extension-for-the-first-time) to understand how to interpret connection data.
- Dive into [Installation Instructions](../installation-and-setup/installation-instructions) or [Prerequisites and System Requirements](../installation-and-setup/prerequisites-and-system-requirements) if you need to revisit setup details.
- Learn [How to Use the Toolbar Badge Count Effectively](../../guides/getting-started-essentials/using-the-badge-count) for quick network monitoring.
