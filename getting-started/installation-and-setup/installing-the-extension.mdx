Make sure your browser is up to date to ensure full compatibility and smooth operation.

## Step 1: Choose Your Browser Store

| Browser | Official Store |
|---------|----------------|
| Chrome  | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |

*Safari users should locate uBO Scope directly from the Safari Extensions Gallery or the Mac App Store running Safari 18.5 or newer.*

## Step 2: Installing uBO Scope

Follow these steps to install the extension for your browser:

### For Google Chrome:

1. Open the [Chrome Web Store page for uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
2. Click the **Add to Chrome** button.
3. In the confirmation popup, click **Add extension**.
4. Wait a moment for the installation to complete.

### For Mozilla Firefox:

1. Navigate to the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Click the **Add to Firefox** button.
3. Confirm any prompts and wait for the extension to install.

### For Safari:

1. Open Safari, then go to the Safari Extensions section in the App Store.
2. Search for 'uBO Scope'.
3. Click **Get** or **Install**.
4. Verify the installation through Safari's Extensions preferences pane.

<Tip>
If you encounter any difficulties finding uBO Scope in Safari, ensure your macOS and Safari versions meet the minimum requirement of Safari 18.5 or higher.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Verifying Installation

After installing, confirm uBO Scope is active:

1. Look for the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser’s toolbar. It uses the uBO logo style and will typically appear near the address bar.
2. The extension badge will show a numeric count representing the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted on the active tab. This number may initially be zero.
3. Clicking on the extension icon opens a popup providing detailed network connection insights for the current webpage.

<Callout>
If the icon does not appear, check your browser's extensions or add-ons settings to ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
</Callout>

## Step 4: First-Time User Guidance

Once installed, here's what to expect:

- The badge number indicates unique third-party domains with network connections.
- Lower badge counts suggest fewer third-party connections, which often correlates with better privacy.
- The popup interface categorizes connections as:
  - **Not Blocked**: Connections allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections blocked discreetly.
  - **Blocked**: Explicitly blocked connections.

<Tip>
Because uBO Scope works alongside content blockers, your results reflect combined network request outcomes, helping you better understand your actual third-party network exposure.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Installation Issues

<Accordion title="I can't find uBO Scope in my browser store"> 
Make sure your browser version meets the minimum requirements:
- Chrome 122.0+
- Firefox 128.0+
- Safari 18.5+

If your browser is up to date and the extension still doesn't appear, check your region or store restrictions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The extension icon isn't visible after installation">
1. Verify uBO Scope is enabled in your browser's extensions/add-ons manager.
2. Look in the browser’s overflow or extensions menu if your toolbar is full.
3. Restart your browser to refresh extension loading.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge shows '0' or no data after visiting sites">
- The badge only counts distinct third-party remote servers contacted; some pages naturally have zero third-party connections.
- Visit larger, content-rich sites to see active badge updates.
- If it remains zero across popular sites, refer to the [Validating Extension Activity](../first-run-and-troubleshooting/validating-extension-activity) guide.
</Accordion>
