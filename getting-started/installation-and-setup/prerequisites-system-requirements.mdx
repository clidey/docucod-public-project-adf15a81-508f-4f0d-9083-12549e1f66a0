# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure your system and browser meet the necessary prerequisites to allow seamless operation and accurate reporting of remote server connections.

---

## 1\. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a lightweight browser extension compatible across mainstream browsers. Confirm compatibility with your browser version as follows:

- **Google Chrome (or Chromium-based browsers)**
  - Minimum Version: 122.0 or later
  - Installation via Chrome Web Store

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum Version: 128.0 or later
  - Installation via Firefox Add-ons site

- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum Version: 18.5 or later
  - Installation via Safari Extensions Gallery or manual sideloading


> These version requirements ensure that uBO Scope leverages APIs and browser features (such as Manifest v3 compliance and webRequest permissions) available only in recent browser releases.

---

## 2. Required Permissions and Access

To effectively monitor network connections from web pages, uBO Scope requests specific permissions during installation:

- **Active Tab Access**: Grants the extension permission to read data about the currently active tab, essential for tab-specific network request reporting.

- **Storage Access**: Enables saving session data and configuration temporarily or persistently.

- **WebRequest API Permission**: Critical for monitoring outbound network requests, including those that are allowed, blocked, or redirected. This is foundational for the extension’s core function.

- **Host Permissions**: Access to URLs matching the following patterns:
  - `https://*/*`
  - `http://*/*`
  - `wss://*/*`
  - `ws://*/*`

  These broad host permissions allow uBO Scope to observe all standard HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and secure WebSocket outbound connections.


<Note>
These permissions are requested upfront and must be reviewed carefully. They are necessary to provide full visibility into network activity by the extension.
</Note>

## 3. System Requirements

uBO Scope places minimal resource demands on your system but requires:

- **Operating System**
  - Compatible with any OS supported by the selected browser (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.)

- **Memory and Storage**
  - Minimal RAM impact since it performs lightweight monitoring and summary reporting
  - Sufficient disk space for storing session data and extension files, typically negligible (&lt;10MB)

- **Network Connectivity**
  - Unrestricted network access to allow the browser and extension to monitor web traffic
  - No firewall or proxy configuration blocking the browser’s `webRequest` API

<Warning>
On highly restrictive corporate or privacy-centric networks, firewall or DNS-level filtering may affect uBO Scope's ability to see certain blocked requests. Ensure the browser's APIs are not disabled or restricted.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Browser Extension Installation Considerations

- Make sure you install uBO Scope from official stores to guarantee authenticity and integrity.

- Verify browser settings allow third-party extensions and that no conflicts with other security or privacy extensions prevent uBO Scope from working properly.

- Browser extensions run with their own sandboxed permissions; therefore, uBO Scope does not require external installations beyond the browser.

<Check>
If installing in developer mode (especially in Firefox or Chromium), follow your browser's guidelines to load unpacked extensions carefully.
</Check>

---

## 5. Network and API Compatibility

uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API, which:

- Supports detailed filtering and event listeners for outgoing network requests

- Provides data on request successes, errors, redirects, and statuses

- Does **not** capture requests outside the browser context (e.g., system processes, or apps outside the browser)



---

## Troubleshooting Prerequisites

If uBO Scope does not operate as expected:

- Confirm browser version meets minimum requirements

- Verify all listed permissions are granted and enabled

- Check for other extensions or policies that might block `webRequest` APIs

- Ensure no network policies or firewall rules interfere with browser network events


---

## Summary

Meet these prerequisites to ensure a smooth installation and effective use of uBO Scope. The extension runs fully inside your browser for low-impact, real-time monitoring of third-party connections.
