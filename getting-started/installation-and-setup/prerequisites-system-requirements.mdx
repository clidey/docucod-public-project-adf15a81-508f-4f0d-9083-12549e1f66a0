# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Prepare your device and environment for a smooth installation and usage of uBO Scope by verifying browser compatibility and system requirements. This ensures you can take full advantage of its powerful network request visibility without interruptions.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is available as a browser extension compatible with major browsers supporting Manifest Version 3. Confirm you are using one of the following browsers with the specified minimum versions:

- **Google Chrome (or Chromium-based browsers like Edge, Brave, Opera):** Minimum version 122.0
- **Mozilla Firefox:** Minimum version 128.0
- **Safari:** Minimum version 18.5

> These minimum versions align with the extension's usage of modern web extension APIs and Manifest Version 3 standards.

### How to check your browser version:

- **Chrome:** Go to `chrome://settings/help`.
- **Firefox:** Go to `about:support` or `about:preferences`.
- **Safari:** Click `Safari` > `About Safari` from the menu bar.

---

## 2. Operating System Compatibility

uBO Scope supports any operating system that can run the supported browsers listed above. These include:

- Windows 10 and later
- macOS versions supported by the compatible Safari, Chrome, or Firefox versions
- Linux distributions that support Chrome or Firefox with the required minimum versions


---

## 3. Essential Browser Permissions

During installation, uBO Scope requires the following permissions to operate effectively:

- **Access to tabs (`activeTab`)**: To monitor and report network activities per tab.
- **Storage (`storage`)**: To save session data and maintain state between browser sessions.
- **Web Request Monitoring (`webRequest`)**: To observe all network requests made by webpages you visit.

These permissions enable uBO Scope to track third-party connections accurately and show them in the popup interface.

> Permissions are requested upfront during installation; ensure you accept these to guarantee full functionality.

---

## 4. Network Requirements

uBO Scope listens to your browser’s network events and requires the browser to report network requests through its `webRequest` API.

- **Ensure the browser network stack is not heavily modified or restricted** by other software that may block or alter network requests at the system or network level in ways invisible to the browser.
- The extension supports monitoring of HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS protocols where the browser exposes these.

> Note: Network requests made outside the browser’s purview (e.g., by standalone apps) cannot be monitored by uBO Scope.

---

## 5. Additional Recommendations

- **Browser Extensions:** If you use other content blockers or privacy extensions, uBO Scope can still monitor network requests and show actual outcomes regardless of those blockers.
- **Keep your Browser Updated:** To avoid compatibility issues and ensure security, keep your browser updated to at least the minimum required version.
