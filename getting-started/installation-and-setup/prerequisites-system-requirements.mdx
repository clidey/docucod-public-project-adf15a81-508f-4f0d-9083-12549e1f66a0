# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Ensure your environment meets the requirements below to run uBO Scope smoothly and access its full functionality. This page details supported browsers, minimum version thresholds, permissions the extension needs, and important system considerations.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope has tailored versions for Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari. To ensure compatibility and stable operation, use only supported browser versions.

| Browser         | Minimum Version | Notes                             |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| **Chromium**    | 122.0 or higher | Includes Chrome, Edge, Brave, and other Chromium-based variants. |
| **Firefox**     | 128.0 or higher | Desktop and Firefox for Android.  |
| **Safari**      | 18.5 or higher  | Requires Safari’s latest web extension support. |


### Why Minimum Versions Matter

uBO Scope relies on modern WebExtension APIs (such as `webRequest`, `storage.session`, and Manifest V3 features), which some browsers only support starting from these specified versions.

Using versions below these may cause installation failures or limited extension functionality.

---

## 2. Required Permissions

To function correctly, uBO Scope requests the following permissions during installation:

- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to access data about the currently active tab to monitor network requests.
- **storage**: Enables storing session data and persistent settings securely within the browser.
- **webRequest**: Grants the ability to observe (but not block) network requests, critical to measuring connection outcomes.

Additionally, the extension requires **host permissions** for HTTP and HTTPS URLs to monitor outgoing connections:

- Chromium & Firefox: `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, plus websocket URLs for Firefox.
- Safari: `http://*/*`, `https://*/*` (websocket support is limited).


<Tip>
Make sure your browser allows these permissions at installation; otherwise, uBO Scope cannot track network connections accurately.
</Tip>

---

## 3. System and Network Considerations

- **Operating System Compatibility**: uBO Scope works on any OS that supports the specified browsers (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android for Firefox).

- **Network Connectivity**: The extension monitors outgoing requests using browser APIs, so it requires an active internet connection to observe network activity.

- **Firewall and Security Software**: Ensure that no firewall rules or security software block browser extensions or the network activity uBO Scope monitors.


<Warning>
Because uBO Scope operates by passively observing network requests, it does not modify or block any traffic. If your security software aggressively interferes with browser extensions, this may prevent uBO Scope from recording accurate data.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Access and Execution Requirements

- **Browser Extension Installation**: You need the ability to install browser extensions from the official stores or manually.

- **Session Storage Access**: uBO Scope uses session storage for temporary data to maintain state between browser tabs and sessions; denying storage access will disable proper tracking.

- **Background Execution Support**:
  - Chromium: Uses a service worker background script.
  - Firefox & Safari: Use background scripts with module support.

These are handled automatically when installing through official channels.

---

## 5. Verifying Your Environment

Follow these steps to confirm your system meets requirements:

1. **Check Browser Version**:

   - Chromium: Go to `chrome://settings/help` or corresponding page in your Chromium browser.

   - Firefox: Go to `about:support`.

   - Safari: Use `About Safari` in the app menu.

2. **Inspect Extension Permissions**:

   - Ensure uBO Scope requests and is granted `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` permissions.

   - Confirm host permissions cover the URLs you visit.

3. **Verify Network Access**:

   - Confirm no firewall or antivirus is blocking browser extensions.

4. **Install Using Official Sources**:

   - Chrome Web Store for Chromium.

   - Firefox Add-ons site for Firefox.

   - Safari Extensions Gallery or appropriate Mac App Store entry.


---

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Tips

- **Using Outdated Browsers**: Installing uBO Scope on unsupported versions will typically fail or cause malfunction.

- **Blocked Permissions**: Denying any of the required permissions during install or runtime will disable core features.

- **Private/Incognito Modes**: If you use extensions in private modes, enable uBO Scope explicitly in your browser’s extension settings for Incognito.

- **Network Restrictions**: Devices on strict networks or VPNs may alter observed connections and shouldn’t be mistaken for extension faults.

- **Browser Profiles**: Ensure you install the extension in the profile where you monitor network requests.


<Tip>
Keep your browser updated regularly to ensure you continue to receive full support and security for uBO Scope.
</Tip>

## 7. Next Steps

Once your environment meets the above prerequisites, proceed to the [Installing uBO Scope](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/installing-ubo-scope) guide to get the extension installed and configured.

For additional context on why these requirements matter, see the [Overall System Architecture](/overview/core-concepts-arch/system-architecture) documentation.
