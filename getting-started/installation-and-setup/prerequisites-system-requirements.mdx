# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Prepare your environment for a smooth and effective installation of uBO Scope by reviewing the supported browsers, operating systems, system requirements, needed permissions, and network considerations specific to the extension.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension to transparently display all network connections initiated by your browser tabs. It currently supports the following browsers with minimum required versions:

| Browser       | Minimum Version | Notes                                       |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.) | 122.0           | Note the requirement on manifest version and service worker|
| Firefox       | 128.0           | Including Firefox for Android                |
| Safari        | 18.5            | macOS and iOS Safari support                  |

<u>Why these minimums?</u> These versions provide required WebExtension APIs, including permission models and WebSocket support, for uBO Scope's network monitoring features.

<Info>
Ensure your browser is updated to at least these versions before installation to guarantee full functionality.
</Info>

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

Because uBO Scope is a browser extension, system compatibility relies on browser support:

- **Windows:** Supports Windows 10 and later through Chromium or Firefox browsers.
- **macOS:** Supports macOS 11+ via Safari, Chromium, or Firefox browsers.
- **Linux:** Common distributions are supported through Chromium or Firefox browsers.
- **Android:** Firefox for Android (version 128.0 minimum) supported.

<u>Platform-specific nuances:</u> Safari extensions require macOS or iOS Safari, and their installation is subject to Apple's App Store rules.

## 3. Basic System Requirements

uBO Scope is lightweight but depends on the host browser's capabilities.

- **Memory:** Minimal (typically under 50 MB while running), as it mainly listens to network events.
- **Disk space:** Less than 100 MB for files and cached data.
- **CPU:** No special requirements; standard modern CPUs are sufficient.

<Note>
The extension is optimized for low overhead to avoid impact on browsing speed or device performance.
</Note>

## 4. Required Browser Extension Permissions

To function, uBO Scope requests the following permissions in the browser:

- **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to access the currently active tab for gathering connection data.
- **`storage`**: Enables local data caching and user preferences storage.
- **`webRequest`**: Allows monitoring of all HTTP(s) and WebSocket network requests from the browser.
- **Host permissions:**
  - Chromium and Firefox versions request permissions for all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
  - Safari requests only HTTP and HTTPS host permissions.

<Tip>
These permissions are necessary for uBO Scope to detect and report all remote server connections accurately.
</Tip>

## 5. Network and Connectivity Considerations

- **Firewall/Proxy:** Ensure your system firewall or network proxy doesn't block the browser’s WebExtensions API from accessing network events.
- **WebSocket restrictions:** Chromium and Firefox support WebSocket monitoring; Safari’s restrictions may limit this feature.

<Warning>
If network requests are filtered or blocked by other security software before reaching your browser, uBO Scope may not detect them.
</Warning>

## 6. Installation Environment Suggestions

- Use the latest stable version of your supported browser.
- Close unnecessary browser tabs and applications to reduce noisy network data.
- Consider installing alongside, not replacing, content blockers like uBlock Origin, as uBO Scope complements them.

## 7. Permissions Overview by Browser Platform

| Platform   | Host Permissions               | Additional Permissions    | Min Version   |
|------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Chromium   | http://*/*, https://*/*, ws://*/*, wss://*/* | activeTab, storage, webRequest | 122.0         |
| Firefox    | http://*/*, https://*/*, ws://*/*, wss://*/* | activeTab, storage, webRequest | 128.0         |
| Safari     | http://*/*, https://*/*       | activeTab, storage, webRequest | 18.5          |

## 8. Verification Before Installation

Confirm:

1. Browser version meets or exceeds the stated minimum.
2. You have sufficient permissions in your browser to install extensions.
3. No restrictive policies (enterprise or parental controls) block needed permissions.

<Check>
If unsure about your browser's version, navigate to the "About" section in settings to confirm.
</Check>

# Troubleshooting Tips

- **Extension installation fails:** Verify browser version and that permissions are allowed.
- **uBO Scope not showing connection data:** Check that "activeTab" and "webRequest" permissions are granted; also verify no other security tool is interfering.
- **WebSocket requests missing (especially in Safari):** WebSocket monitoring is limited on Safari; consider using Chromium or Firefox for full feature access.
