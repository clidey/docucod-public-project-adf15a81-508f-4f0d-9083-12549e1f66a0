# First Launch & Extension Activation

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide will walk you through confirming your installation, understanding what happens when you first launch the extension, and how to activate uBO Scope on webpages to start seeing network connection insights immediately.

---

## 1. Confirming Installation Success

Before interacting with uBO Scope, ensure that the extension is installed correctly and ready to function.

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

- After installation, look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's extension toolbar. The icon resembles the uBO Scope logo and is available in various sizes (16x16, 32x32, etc.) depending on your browser.
- If you don’t see the icon immediately:
  - **Chrome/Chromium**: Click the extension puzzle icon near the top-right corner and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.
  - **Firefox**: Open the hamburger menu ☰ > Customize Toolbar > Drag uBO Scope to the visible toolbar.
  - **Safari**: Ensure in Safari’s preferences the extension is enabled in the Extensions tab.

### Step 2: Verify Browser Permissions

Upon first run, your browser may prompt you to grant permissions required by uBO Scope. These include:

- Access to monitor network requests (`webRequest` permission).
- Storage access to save session data.
- Access to the active tab to collect and visualize per-tab network info.

Grant these permissions to ensure full functionality.

<Tip>
If you accidentally deny permissions, you must manually enable them in your browser’s extension management page.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Open the Extension Popup

- Click the uBO Scope icon.
- The popup will load, initially showing “NO DATA” if no webpage activity has been recorded yet.

This indicates uBO Scope is installed and ready.


## 2. Understanding First Launch Behavior

When you first activate uBO Scope, it immediately begins observing network requests across tabs and windows using the browser’s `webRequest` API.

### What Happens Behind the Scenes?

- The background script listens to network events such as redirects, errors, and successful connections.
- Bag of domain aggregations by category (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked) starts accumulating per tab.
- Badge count on the toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct third-party domains connected successfully for the active tab.
- Session data is loaded from previous browsing sessions if available, continuing tracking seamlessly.

<Tip>
uBO Scope is passive once installed — it does not block connections but reveals what your browser connects to, helping you understand real network activity.
</Tip>


## 3. Activating uBO Scope on a Webpage

To view network connection information for any webpage:

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Desired Webpage

- Simply browse to any website.
- uBO Scope automatically observes network requests from that page and associated resources.

### Step 2: Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon while on the tab you want to investigate.
- The popup interface will display:
  - The **tab’s main hostname and domain**, with Unicode support for internationalized domains.
  - Counts and lists of connected domains categorized as:
    - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
    - **Stealth-Blocked**
    - **Blocked**

### Step 3: Interact with the Popup

- Scroll through the domain lists to identify third-party connections.
- Use the domain counts to grasp the scope of connectivity.


## 4. Confirming Active Monitoring

To verify that uBO Scope is actively monitoring:

- Check the badge count on the toolbar icon. A number indicates distinct third-party domains connected to on the active tab.
- The popup shows detailed breakdowns of domains by connection outcome.

<Tip>
If the badge count stays empty or no data appears, try refreshing the page or visiting a different site. Ensure that no content blocker or browser setting is completely preventing webRequest API access.
</Tip>


## 5. Troubleshooting First Launch Issues

### Issue: No Badge or Data Appears

- Confirm extension icon is visible and enabled.
- Refresh the active tab to trigger network events.
- Check browser permissions; re-allow `webRequest` and storage permissions if denied.
- Disable other content blockers temporarily to test if they interfere.

### Issue: Permissions Prompt Does Not Appear

- Some browsers require manual permission adjustment after installing.
- Visit your browser’s extensions page and verify permissions are granted for uBO Scope.

### Issue: Extension Does Not Appear in Toolbar

- Pin the extension via your browser’s extension management interface.
- Restart your browser to reload extensions.


## 6. Best Practices for a Smooth Start

- Always keep uBO Scope updated to the latest version to ensure compatibility with your browser’s latest APIs and permission models.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blocker to gain independent insights into network connections, not as a blocker itself.
- Familiarize yourself with the badge count meanings and popup information by reviewing the [Understanding the Badge Count](../guides/core-workflows/understanding-the-badge-count) and [Interpreting Network Outcomes](../guides/advanced-usage-patterns/interpreting-network-outcomes) guides.
