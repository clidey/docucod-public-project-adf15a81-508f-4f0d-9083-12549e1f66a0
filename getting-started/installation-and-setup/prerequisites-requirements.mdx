# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure your environment meets the necessary requirements. This guarantees smooth installation and optimal extension functionality.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with multiple modern browsers. Your browser must meet the minimum version to enable full functionality, especially network request monitoring using the `webRequest` API.

| Browser   | Minimum Version | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Google Chrome (Chromium-based) | 122.0           | Uses Manifest V3 service worker architecture. |
| Mozilla Firefox                  | 128.0           | Includes Firefox for Android with the same minimum version. |
| Apple Safari                   | 18.5            | macOS and iOS Safari support with stricter version requirements. |

❗ **Important:** Versions prior to the specified minimums do not support the necessary APIs or manifest features that uBO Scope requires. Attempting to install on unsupported versions will result in failure or degraded extension behavior.

## 2. System Platforms

uBO Scope runs where the supported browsers are available, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS platforms that run compatible browser versions.

## 3. Required Permissions

The extension requests several browser permissions essential for its operation:

- **Active Tab (`activeTab`)**: Grants temporary access to the currently active tab to collect detailed network event data.
- **Storage (`storage`)**: Used to save session data and persistent state for accurate tracking of network requests.
- **Web Request (`webRequest`)**: Core permission that allows uBO Scope to intercept, monitor, and analyze network traffic related to remote server connections.

⚠️ **Security Note:** These permissions are mandatory for uBO Scope to gather network connection data independently, even in presence of other content blockers or DNS filtering. The extension only reports connections that the browser’s `webRequest` API exposes.

## 4. Network Access Requirements

Since uBO Scope monitors all HTTP(S) and WebSocket requests to remote servers, the extension requires host permissions to match and listen to network requests:

- **Host Permissions (varies slightly by browser):**
  - For Chromium and Firefox:
    - `http://*/*`
    - `https://*/*`
    - `ws://*/*`
    - `wss://*/*`
  - For Safari:
    - `http://*/*`
    - `https://*/*`

These permissions allow uBO Scope to track nearly all web traffic your browser makes.

## 5. User Account or Access Requirements

No special user account, login, or cloud service access is required. uBO Scope operates entirely locally within your browser.

## 6. Installation Environment Requirements

- Ensure your browser allows installation of extensions from official stores:
  - Chrome Web Store for Chromium-based browsers.
  - Firefox Add-ons site for Firefox.
  - Safari Extensions Gallery or App Store for Safari.

- Disable or configure other security or privacy tools that might block extension installation.

- Ensure you have administrative or appropriate user permissions on your device to install browser extensions.

## 7. Additional Technical Notes

- The extension requires Manifest V3 support, which is integrated into the browser versions specified.
- uBO Scope uses background scripts as a **service worker** on Chromium, while Firefox and Safari use background scripts with module type.
- The extension icons and UI assets are packaged to support various display sizes.

## Troubleshooting Prerequisites

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Extension Fails to Install or Enable:**
  - Confirm browser version meets the minimum stated.
  - Verify you are installing from the official store to avoid unsigned or incompatible builds.
  - Restart your browser after upgrade before attempting installation.

- **Permissions Not Requested or Extension Not Functioning:**
  - Check that your browser is configured to allow requested permissions.
  - Some enterprise policies or privacy tools may block extensions’ network access—review browser and system policies.

- **Network Requests Not Being Reported:**
  - Make sure uBO Scope has permission to access the active tab.
  - Confirm browser supports the necessary `webRequest` API features.
