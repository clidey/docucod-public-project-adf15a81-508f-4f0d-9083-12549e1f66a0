# Initial Configuration

After installing uBO Scope, the next important step is to verify and adjust its basic settings. This ensures the extension operates immediately with correct permissions and default behaviors suited for seamless monitoring of your browser's third-party network connections.

---

## 1. Verify Extension Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions to function effectively. Confirm these permissions to prevent any disruptions:

- **Active Tab Access:** Allows the extension to query the currently active browser tab.
- **Storage Access:** Enables saving and retrieving session data and preferences.
- **WebRequest API:** Essential for monitoring network requests to remote servers.

### How to Check Permissions

1. Open your browser's extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions` in Chrome).
2. Locate uBO Scope.
3. Inspect the listed permissions under it.

The extension manifest mandates the following permissions:

```json
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"]
}
```

<Tip>
Without these permissions, uBO Scope cannot capture network requests or persist session information. If permissions are missing or were declined, re-enable them from your browser.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Understand Badge Behavior

The uBO Scope toolbar icon badge displays the **number of distinct third-party remote servers connected during browsing**. This number represents connections allowed by your browser to external services.

- A **lower badge count** typically indicates a tighter network footprint and potentially better privacy.
- The badge updates in real-time per active browser tab based on all network requests observed.

### What the Badge Reflects:

- **Allowed Domains:** Third-party domains your browser successfully connected to.
- **Blocked Domains:** Domains where connections were blocked (do not increase the badge count).
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains:** Connections blocked stealthily by other content blockers (also do not increase badge count).

<Tip>
Focus on the number of connected third-party domains rather than block counts from other tools to understand your true network exposure.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Session Data and Management Defaults

uBO Scope maintains session data internally to provide accurate per-tab connection summaries:

- **Session Storage:** Network requests and domain connection outcomes are stored in browser session storage.
- **Tab-Life Bound:** Data for each tab persists only while the tab is open.
- **Automatic Clean-up:** Closing a tab removes its session data automatically.

### What This Means for You

- You can open and close tabs without manual data management.
- The extension's session data refreshes automatically every time you navigate to a new main frame (a new website) in a tab.

<Tip>
No configuration required here. This design ensures you always have up-to-date connection data tied strictly to active browsing sessions.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Adjusting Basic Settings (If Available)

uBO Scope is purposefully minimal with limited user configuration needs. However, you can verify or adjust the following through your browser extension management UI if applicable:

- **Badge Display:** Confirm the badge is enabled and visible on the toolbar.
- **Popup Access:** The popup UI (accessed by clicking the icon) should be enabled to view detailed per-tab network connection data.

If you encounter unexpected behavior, you may consider disabling/re-enabling the extension or reinstalling it.

---

## 5. Checking Initial Operation

Once permissions and defaults are confirmed, make sure uBO Scope is actively monitoring:

### Steps:

1. Navigate to a popular website, such as https://example.com.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. Verify the popup shows the domain name of the current tab at the top.
4. Review the summary badge count—this should reflect the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
5. Explore the three sections in the popup:
   - **Not Blocked:** Domains where connections succeeded.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections blocked silently by other tools.
   - **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked connections.

### Success Criteria:

- The popup shows real data for the current tab.
- Badge count updates in accordance with the page's third-party connections.

<Tip>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or zero domains unexpectedly, ensure you have permitted the extension to access network request data and that you are on an active tab with web content.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Initial Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Is Missing or Not Updating">
- Verify extension permissions for `webRequest` and `activeTab`.
- Reload the current tab or restart the browser.
- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled and not disabled or in conflict with another extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Blank">
- Refresh the tab to trigger a new session data capture.
- Make sure you clicked the icon on a tab with loaded web content.
- Check browser console logs for extension errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Session Data Is Not Persisting Across Tabs">
- This behavior is by design; session data is tab-specific and discarded when closed.
- Open multiple tabs with different sites to compare data per tab.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Next Steps

Congratulations — your basic configuration is complete. To gain immediate value:

- Explore detailed network connection breakdowns via the popup UI.
- Proceed to [Your First Session: Checking Connections](../../getting-started/first-use-and-validation/first-use) for hands-on guidance with live data.
- Review the [Core Concepts & Terminology](../architecture-core-concepts/core-concepts-terminology) for better interpreting the connection outcomes.
