# First-Time Configuration

Welcome to the initial configuration of **uBO Scope**. This guide helps you activate the extension after installation and optimize key settings for accurate, real-time tracking of network connections initiated by webpages.

---

## 1. Understanding Initial Activation

When you first install uBO Scope, it requires specific permissions to monitor network connections effectively. These include the ability to observe web requests and access active tab information.<br>Without these, the extension cannot report accurate connection data.

### Key Permissions Requested

- **`webRequest`**: Allows the extension to listen to and analyze all HTTP and WebSocket requests, including their outcomes.
- **`activeTab`**: Grants access to information about the currently active browser tab to contextualize connection data.
- **`storage`**: Enables saving configuration and session data for persistent and efficient operation.

<u>Note:</u> These permissions are essential for uBO Scope’s operation and are requested during installation or when you first activate the extension.

---

## 2. Completing Extension Setup

Follow these concrete steps to ensure uBO Scope is fully activated and ready to provide detailed connection insights.

### Step 1: Grant Permissions

1. After installing uBO Scope, your browser will prompt you to approve the permissions listed above.
2. Approve these permissions promptly to enable the extension functionality.

<Tip>
If you accidentally deny permissions, you can manually enable them in your browser’s extension settings. Look for "Permissions" or "Site access" sections.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Configure Recommended Settings

uBO Scope works optimally with default settings; however, depending on your browser:

- **Chrome and Firefox**: Permissions include monitoring HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket connections.
- **Safari**: Support requires version 18.5 or later. Permissions are slightly more restrictive but sufficient for core functionality.

Currently, no manual configuration of settings is required beyond granting permissions. Future versions may expose additional options.

---

## 3. Automatic Background Initialization

Once permissions are granted, uBO Scope automatically initializes background processes:

- Loads the public suffix list for accurate domain parsing.
- Reads any saved session data to maintain continuity across browser sessions.
- Begins monitoring network requests through listeners tied to your permitted host URLs (http, https, ws, wss).

This ensures a seamless experience with no further manual steps.

---

## 4. Recommended Best Practices for Optimal Tracking

To maximize the value of uBO Scope's network connection reporting:

- **Keep your browser updated**, especially to the minimum required versions:
  - Chromium-based: ≥122.0
  - Firefox: ≥128.0
  - Safari: ≥18.5

- **Maintain unrestricted host permissions** to allow the extension to observe all web traffic. Restricting permissions may lead to incomplete or inaccurate reports.

- **Avoid interfering with extension permissions** after setup, as this will disable real-time capture of connections.

- **Restart your browser or reload the extension** if you alter permissions or settings to refresh data capture.

---

## 5. Verifying Activation and Initial Operation

After permissions are granted and the extension initializes:

1. Open a webpage.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. The popup UI will display:
   - The count of distinct third-party domains connected.
   - Lists of connections marked as 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'.

If data appears as expected, uBO Scope is active and monitoring efficiently.

### What to Do If No Data Appears

- Ensure you have granted all required permissions.
- Confirm you are browsing active tabs supported by your browser and the extension.
- Refresh the webpage and revisit the popup.
- Restart the browser if the issue persists.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common First-Time Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting First-Time Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Extension Permissions Not Granted">
- If the extension prompt was dismissed or denied, manually re-enable permissions via your browser’s extensions page.
- For Chrome: Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`, locate uBO Scope, and click "Details" to adjust permissions.
- For Firefox: Visit `about:addons`, then "Manage Extension Permissions".
- For Safari: Go to Safari Preferences &gt; Extensions &gt; uBO Scope to check permission status.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Network Requests Are Captured">
- Confirm that you are browsing HTTP, HTTPS, or WebSocket sites covered by the extension’s host permissions.
- Make sure no other browser settings or extensions are blocking uBO Scope from accessing web requests.
- Try disabling other extensions temporarily to isolate conflicts.
- Reload the extension or restart the browser to re-establish listeners.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
- The badge reflects distinct allowed third-party domains. If allowed connections are low or none, the badge may be empty.
- Refresh the current tab or open new tabs with heavy web activity to test.
- Verify that the extension’s background service worker is running (browser dependent tool).
</Accordion>

These will help you unlock the full potential of uBO Scope.

---

## Summary

You have now activated uBO Scope, granted necessary permissions, and confirmed it is ready to monitor web connections.

While default settings are optimal, ensure you use a supported browser version and grant full host permissions for best results.

If you encounter issues, refer to the troubleshooting tips in this guide or consult the related documentation pages.
