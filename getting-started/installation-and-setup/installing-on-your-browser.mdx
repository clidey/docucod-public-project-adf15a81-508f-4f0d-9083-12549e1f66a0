## 3. Granting Necessary Permissions

For uBO Scope to monitor all remote connections accurately, it requires explicit permissions during installation:

- Accept permission requests for access to websites (host permissions).
- Allow access to the browser’s tabs for data retrieval.

If permissions are denied or restricted, uBO Scope will not report network connections as expected.

<Warning>
If you encounter permission prompts after installation, grant them promptly to ensure the extension works fully.
</Warning>


## 4. Verifying Installation

Confirm the extension is installed and ready:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon on the browser toolbar.
2. Click the icon to open the popup interface.
3. Visit any website; the badge on the icon will update to reflect the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected.
4. Clicking the icon displays a categorized summary of connections: not blocked, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

<Tip>
If the icon does not appear immediately, restart your browser or check your extension manager to ensure the extension is enabled.
