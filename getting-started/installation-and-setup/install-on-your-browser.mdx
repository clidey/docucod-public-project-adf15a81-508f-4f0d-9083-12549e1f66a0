## 2. Download and Install uBO Scope

You can install uBO Scope directly from the official browser extension stores. This guarantees the latest stable version and ensures automatic updates.

### 2.1 Install from Official Stores

### 2.2 Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

1. **Clone or download** the project source code from [uBO Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
2. **Select your target platform folder** inside the `platform/` directory:
   - `chromium` for Chromium browsers
   - `firefox` for Firefox
   - `safari` for Safari
3. **Build the extension package** if required using the provided scripts or instructions.
4. **Load the unpacked extension** in your browser following the browser-specific developer extension loading steps:

   - **Chromium**:
     - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
     - Enable 'Developer mode' (top right)
     - Click 'Load unpacked' and select the folder containing the unpacked extension files

   - **Firefox**:
     - Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
     - Click 'Load Temporary Add-on'
     - Open the `manifest.json` file from the extension folder

   - **Safari**:
     - Safari requires packaging extensions with Xcode for development.

## 3. Confirm Extension Installation and Toolbar Presence

After installing uBO Scope, it's critical to verify the extension is active and visible in your browser toolbar.

### 3.1 Chromium Browsers

- Look for the uBO Scope icon (a stylized shield) near the address bar.
- If not visible, open the extensions menu (puzzle icon) and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar for easy access.

### 3.2 Firefox

- Check the toolbar for the uBO Scope icon.
- If missing, click the menu button (**☰**), then go to `Add-ons and Themes > Extensions` and enable or pin uBO Scope.

### 3.3 Safari

- Open `Preferences` > `Extensions` and ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
- You may need to add the extension button to the Safari toolbar via customization options.


<Check>
If you do not see the uBO Scope icon after installation, restart your browser and check again.
</Check>

## 4. Verify Installation Correctness

To check that uBO Scope is installed properly and functioning:

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup.
2. The popup should display:
   - The hostname of your current active tab.
   - Counts of connected domains under categories: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

3. Browse to a website and observe the badge on the uBO Scope icon. This badge indicates the number of unique third-party remote servers your browser has connected to for the current tab.


> A badge count greater than zero means uBO Scope is actively tracking network connections.

## 5. Platform-Specific Notes and Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions necessary for its core functionality:

- `activeTab`: To access the current tab information
- `storage`: To save session data
- `webRequest`: To listen to network requests and report connection outcomes

For specific browsers, uBO Scope manifest files define platform nuances:

| Browser  | Notes                                                                                                                    |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium | Requires minimum Chrome version 122.0 due to manifest v3 and webRequest API usage                                        |
| Firefox  | Uses manifest v3 with background scripts and requires Firefox 128.0 or newer                                            |
| Safari   | Requires Safari 18.5 or newer and follows web extension strict min version; uses background scripts instead of service workers |


<Warning>
Ensure that browser permissions are accepted during install to allow uBO Scope to track network connections correctly.
</Warning>

## 6. Troubleshooting Installation Issues

If you encounter problems while installing or the extension does not appear:

- **Verify browser version** meets or exceeds minimum requirements.
- **Check that permissions** for webRequest and activeTab are granted.
- **Restart your browser** after installation to refresh extensions.
- **Disable conflicting extensions** that could interfere.
- For Safari, follow Apple-specific steps to enable developer mode and sign extensions.
