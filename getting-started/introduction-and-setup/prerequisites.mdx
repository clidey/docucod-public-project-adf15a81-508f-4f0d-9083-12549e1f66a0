# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Ensure your system and browser environment meet the essential requirements to enable uBO Scope to run smoothly. This guide helps you verify compatibility and understand necessary permissions before installation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers & Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed to work as a modern browser extension and supports the following browsers with the specified minimum versions:

| Browser        | Minimum Version | Notes                                                      |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Google Chrome / Chromium** | 122.0          | Requires Manifest V3 support and service worker background |
| **Mozilla Firefox**           | 128.0          | Includes Desktop and Android Firefox, MV3 compliant        |
| **Safari**                   | 18.5           | Safari Web Extensions with strict minimum version policy   |


> These versions correspond to the extension's manifest settings ensuring all functionalities and APIs used by uBO Scope are available and behave consistently.

## 2. Required Permissions

As a browser extension analyzing network requests, uBO Scope requires a set of fundamental permissions granted during installation:

- **`webRequest`**: Access to observe and analyze HTTP and WebSocket network requests.
  - Enables detection of requests categorized as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- **`storage`**: Persistent storage to save session data and public suffix lists.
  - Ensures extension state is maintained across browser sessions.
- **`activeTab`**: Access to active tab information for accurate per-tab network tracking.
- **Host Permissions**:
  - Access to HTTP(S) and WebSocket URL patterns (e.g., `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
  - Needed to monitor relevant network requests initiated from webpages.

> Permissions are explicitly declared in the platform-specific manifest files and must be accepted by the user during the extension setup.

---

## 3. System Requirements

Though uBO Scope is lightweight, meeting basic system requirements ensures optimal performance:

- **Operating System**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux (for Chromium and Firefox), and macOS for Safari.
- **Memory and CPU**: Any modern computer with at least 1 GB RAM; extension has minimal CPU usage.
- **Internet Connectivity**: Required at installation and for fetching updated public suffix lists internally.

---

## 4. Network Considerations

uBO Scope operates by monitoring network requests through the browser's webRequest API, which requires:

- **Unrestricted network access by the browser**: Firewall or network policies must not block browser extensions from observing traffic.
- **Access to public suffix list resource**: On first run, the extension fetches the public suffix list used to categorize domains.

> Ensure your firewall or antivirus software does not interfere with browser extensions inspecting network activity.

---

## 5. Permissions & User Consent Experience

During installation, your browser will prompt you to grant the permissions described above.

### Best Practices:
- Review requested permissions carefully to understand what access uBO Scope seeks.
- Know that permissions are essential for the extension's core purpose: network connection visibility.

### Common Pitfalls:
- Denying any permissions will prevent the extension from functioning correctly.
- Some browsers may delay or hide permission prompts; verify permissions via browser extension settings if you notice incomplete functionality.

---

## 6. Verification

After installation, verify that your environment meets the prerequisites:

1. Confirm browser version meets or exceeds the minimum version listed.
2. Visit your browserâ€™s extension manager and verify that uBO Scope has permissions granted.
3. Open the extension popup to check if the badge count and domain data appear. Lack of data often indicates permission or compatibility issues.

<Tip>
If the extension shows 'NO DATA' or doesn't populate network connection info, verify the permissions granted and the browser version.
</Tip>

## Summary

uBO Scope requires a recent version of Chrome (122+), Firefox (128+), or Safari (18.5+) along with explicit permissions for webRequest, storage, and active tab access. Meeting these prerequisites ensures the extension can deliver comprehensive network connection insights reliably.
