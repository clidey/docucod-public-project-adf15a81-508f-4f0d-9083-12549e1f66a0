# What is uBO Scope?

Discover the core purpose and guiding principles of uBO Scope, a browser extension designed to reveal every network connection—whether successful or attempted—originating from your browser tabs. This insight is essential for enhancing privacy, gaining transparency on web traffic, and evaluating content blockers' effectiveness.

---

## Introduction

Every website you visit connects to multiple servers, ranging from the main site to various third-party domains delivering scripts, ads, trackers, or content. Understanding this network footprint is vital, especially for privacy-conscious users and those managing content blockers. uBO Scope empowers you by exposing all these network connections, providing clarity and control.

## Core Purpose of uBO Scope

- **Reveal Every Connection:** Unlike many tools limited by the content blockers in place, uBO Scope reports all network connections attempted or established by web pages in your browser.
- **Transparent Network Insight:** It shows connections irrespective of blocking mechanisms like DNS-based blocking or browser extensions, as long as the underlying browser webRequest API reports these.
- **Debunk Misconceptions:** It clarifies common misunderstandings around block counts and ad blocker test sites, which often mislead users on actual content blocker effectiveness.

## Why Does This Matter?

Understanding the complete network activity of your browser tabs opens up several critical advantages:

- **Privacy Enhancement:** Identifying all third-party servers involved helps users gauge potential tracking or data leakage.
- **Content Blocker Evaluation:** Instead of relying on arbitrary block counts, uBO Scope shows how many distinct third-party servers were allowed or blocked, offering a precise metric for blocker performance.
- **Filter List Maintainers' Tool:** It serves as a streamlined utility on devices with limited access to deeper browser developer tools, aiding maintainers in their analysis.

## How uBO Scope Works at a Glance

uBO Scope uses the browser’s `webRequest` API to listen to network request events:

- It records requests as **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked**.
- Distinct domains are extracted, categorized, and displayed per browser tab.
- The extension's toolbar badge shows how many unique third-party domains were connected to and allowed, encouraging users to maintain a low count for better privacy.

## Key Concepts Highlighted

- **Third-Party Domains:** Domains not part of the main browsing context's domain; these often serve ads, analytics, or trackers.
- **Allowed vs Blocked:** Differentiates between connections that were permitted by the browser/extensions and those that were blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that are blocked in a way that webpages cannot detect.

## Common Myths Debunked by uBO Scope

### Myth 1: "Higher Block Count Means Better Blocking"

A higher number of blocked connections does not necessarily mean your content blocker is better. In fact, blocks may be on trivial or non-unique requests, while allowing connections to numerous distinct third-party servers, increasing exposure.

### Myth 2: "Ad Blocker Test Pages Reflect Real Blocking"

Test sites used to benchmark ad blockers can be misleading since they simulate artificial requests not representative of normal browsing, and many blockers apply stealth techniques abstracts these, which tests fail to see.

## Real User Scenario

Imagine browsing a news website with multiple ads, trackers, and content delivery networks (CDNs). Without uBO Scope, you may not know exactly how many third-party servers are contacted and which ones are blocked. With this extension, just click its icon to open the popup panel that neatly lists all domains contacted, grouped by outcome (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked), providing immediate and actionable insights.

## Visualizing Connection Outcomes

The popup panel groups domains with counts of connection attempts into three clear categories:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains from which connections succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains whose requests were blocked but remain undetectable by websites.
- **Blocked:** Domains whose requests were explicitly blocked and are detectable.

This straightforward classification helps you rapidly understand your browsing profile.

## What uBO Scope Does NOT Do

- It does not block or interfere with requests.
- It does not replace content blockers but complements them.
- It does not gather data outside the browser’s webRequest API scope.

## Summary

uBO Scope is a powerful companion tool for anyone wanting complete transparency on the network activity happening behind the scenes in their browser. It empowers you to measure and validate connections across all tabs in a way that no content blocker badge or ad block test can reliably provide.

```
+------------------------------------------+
| uBO Scope: domains connected: 12         |
|------------------------------------------|
| not blocked                             8 |
| stealth-blocked                        2 |
| blocked                               2 |

<Tip>
For privacy-focused browsing, keep an eye on the "not blocked" count, since a lower number generally means fewer third-party entities have access during your session.
</Tip>

<Note>
The badge on the toolbar icon always reflects the count of distinct, allowed third-party domains for the active tab.
</Note>

<Warning>
This extension requires that the browser supports the `webRequest` API and may not work as expected if the browser restricts this capability.
</Warning>
