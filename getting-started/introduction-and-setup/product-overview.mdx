# What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to reveal **all actual network connections** that webpages attempt or successfully make to remote servers. Unlike typical content blockers that focus on filtering content, uBO Scope transparently reports the true network activity visible within your browser session, offering unrivaled insight into third-party connections—allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.

This tool is essential for privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers who want a clear, objective view of the online connections happening behind the scenes while browsing. It provides factual data regardless of which content blocker or DNS-level filtering you use.

## Core Purpose and Unique Value

uBO Scope’s core mission is straightforward: to expose all remote server connections your browser initiates, providing a trustworthy gauge of your exposure to third-party servers. It does this by integrating directly with the browser’s native `webRequest` API, independently of any content blocking logic.

- **Complete transparency:** It reports all network requests that the browser knows about, including those that other blockers attempt to hide or filter.
- **Objective insight:** It counts **distinct third-party remote servers**, crucial for gauging actual privacy exposure.
- **Compatibility:** Works alongside any content blocker without interference, as it listens to network requests at the browser level.


## Why uBO Scope Matters to You

Many users rely on block counts or test sites to assess content blocker effectiveness, but these are often misleading. uBO Scope helps clarify this by showing the true number of distinct third-party connections:

- A **lower count** means fewer third-party connections (usually better for privacy).
- A **higher block count** does not always mean better blocking—it can indicate more allowed connections to other servers.

This transparency debunks common myths and offers real-time insights into the effectiveness of your filter lists and blockers.


## How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Workflow

- Upon installation, uBO Scope adds an icon to your browser toolbar with a badge showing the count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted in the current tab.
- Clicking the icon opens a **popup UI** that lists these connections grouped by their outcome:
  - **Allowed:** Connections allowed through.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Connections blocked but detected stealthily by your blocker.
  - **Blocked:** Connections fully blocked.

This detailed breakdown empowers you to investigate which domains are communicating in your browsing session and make informed decisions about privacy and filtering.


## Practical Example Scenario

Imagine you visit a news website. Normally, your content blocker filters many ad-related or tracking requests. With uBO Scope, you can see exactly which third-party servers the page tried to connect to—including those that slipped through or were stealth-blocked—giving you a real picture of your privacy exposure for that session.

## Getting Started with uBO Scope

To begin benefiting from uBO Scope’s insights, follow these immediate next steps:

1. **Install uBO Scope** from your browser’s official extension store ([Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)).
2. **Open a new tab** and browse any website.
3. **Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon** to open the popup and view detailed connection data for the active tab.

## What uBO Scope Does NOT Do

- It is **not** a content blocker itself; it does not modify or block network traffic.
- It does **not provide detailed logs** of the exact requests beyond domain-level aggregation.
- It does **not detect or clean malware or phishing attempts;** it simply reports connection attempts.

Understanding these limits helps you use uBO Scope as a tool for clear network connection insight alongside your choice of blockers.
