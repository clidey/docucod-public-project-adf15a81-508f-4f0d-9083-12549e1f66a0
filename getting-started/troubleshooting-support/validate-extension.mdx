# Quick Validation Steps

Verify that uBO Scope is correctly capturing network requests in your browser by following these straightforward checks. These steps focus on confirming proper permissions, ensuring the extension is active, and validating that network events are being recorded as expected.

---

## 1. Confirm Browser Compatibility and Permissions

uBO Scope must have the necessary browser permissions and version support to function fully.

- **Browser Version Requirements:**
  - Chromium-based browsers: Chrome 122.0 or later
  - Firefox: Firefox 128.0 or later
  - Safari: Safari 18.5 or later

- **Extension Permissions:**
  uBO Scope requires the following permissions to monitor network requests:
  - `activeTab`
  - `storage`
  - `webRequest`

- **Host Permissions:**
  The extension must have access to all web and websocket URLs:
  - `https://*/*`
  - `http://*/*`
  - `wss://*/*` (Chromium and Firefox only)
  - `ws://*/*` (Chromium and Firefox only)

<Tip>
Check your browser’s extensions or add-ons page to verify that uBO Scope shows these permissions granted. Without them, the extension cannot observe network traffic.
</Tip>

## 2. Verify Extension Installation and Enabled State

Ensure uBO Scope is installed and actively running in your browser.

- Open your browser’s extensions manager:
  - **Chrome/Chromium:** `chrome://extensions/`
  - **Firefox:** `about:addons`
  - **Safari:** Safari > Preferences > Extensions

- Confirm that **uBO Scope** is installed and the toggle switch is set to **enabled**.

- Check the browser toolbar for the uBO Scope icon (default icon shown below):

<Note>
If the icon is missing or disabled, reinstall or enable the extension.
</Note>

## 3. Check the Browser Action Badge for Network Connection Count

The badge on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon shows the number of distinct third-party remote domains successfully connected to on the current tab.

- Visit a webpage with external content (e.g., a popular news or social media site).

- Observe the badge count number:
  - A **non-zero badge** indicates that uBO Scope is tracking network connections.
  - An **empty or zero badge** can mean no third-party connections were detected or the extension isn’t capturing events.

<Tip>
Try navigating to a webpage known to load external resources if the badge is zero after initial testing.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Open the Extension Popup to Inspect Recorded Network Data

uBO Scope provides detailed information on third-party connections within its popup window.

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.

- Confirm that the popup displays:
  - **Allowed domains:** Third-party domains from which resources loaded successfully.
  - **Blocked domains:** Domains that were blocked or failed to connect.
  - **Stealth domains:** Domains involved in redirects or uncertain status.

<Check>
A populated list inside the popup confirms active monitoring.
</Check>

---

## 5. Validate Extension Activity Through a Test Website

For a controlled check, visit a test page designed to generate third-party network requests.

- Visit a known test webpage with multiple external resource connections or simply open any content-heavy site.

- Confirm the badge updates and popup shows network domains accordingly.

- If you want to manually confirm network activity:

  1. Open your browser’s Developer Tools (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`/`Cmd+Option+I`).

  2. Navigate to the **Network** tab.

  3. Refresh the page and monitor the external requests.

  4. Compare these to the domains listed in uBO Scope’s popup.

<Tip>
If discrepancies appear, verify that your content blockers or privacy settings are not preventing uBO Scope from receiving network events.
</Tip>

---

## 6. Review Permissions and Network Request Capture if Validation Fails

If the above steps show no activity, perform these troubleshooting checks:

- **Extension Permissions:**
  - Ensure the browser did not block granting permissions on install.
  - Reinstall if permissions appear missing.

- **Browser-specific Restrictions:**
  - Safari, for example, restricts `webRequest` access on some versions.
  - Confirm your Safari version and uBO Scope version compatibility.

- **Private Browsing or Incognito Mode:**
  - Some browsers restrict extension access in private windows.
  - Enable uBO Scope to run in incognito if needed.

- **Other Extensions:**
  - Conflicts with other content blockers may affect uBO Scope’s ability to observe requests.
  - Temporarily disable other blockers to test.

---

## Summary

By following these quick validation steps, you confirm that uBO Scope is:

- Properly installed and enabled with required permissions.
- Actively monitoring and counting distinct third-party domains.
- Providing visible, meaningful data through the badge and popup.

Successful validation primes you to dive deeper into using uBO Scope to monitor network connections responsibly and effectively.
