# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve frequent problems encountered during installing or initially using the uBO Scope extension. If you find that the extension does not appear in your browser toolbar, the badge count does not update, or permission issues block full functionality, follow the steps below to restore proper operation.

---

## 1. Extension Not Visible in Toolbar

If you have installed uBO Scope but cannot see its icon or popup in the browser toolbar:

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Check Installation Status:**
   - Open your browser's Extensions or Add-ons page.
     - In Chrome/Chromium: `chrome://extensions/`
     - In Firefox: `about:addons`
     - In Safari: Preferences > Extensions
   - Verify that uBO Scope is installed and enabled.

2. **Pin the Extension to Toolbar:**
   - Some browsers hide extensions by default.
   - In Chrome/Chromium, click the puzzle icon and pin uBO Scope for easy access.

3. **Restart the Browser:**
   - After installation, restarting the browser ensures the extension loads correctly.

4. **Verify Compatibility:**
   - Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements:
     - Chromium 122+
     - Firefox 128+
     - Safari 18.5+

### Troubleshooting Tips
- If the extension disappears after restart or update, check if policies or other management tools restrict extensions.

## 2. Badge Count Not Updating or Showing Unexpectedly

The toolbar badge indicates the number of distinct third-party domains with network connections. If this number does not update or seems incorrect:

### Steps to Diagnose and Fix

1. **Verify Necessary Permissions:**
   - The extension requires these permissions:
     - `webRequest` - to monitor network requests
     - `activeTab` and `storage` for UI and data persistence
   - Check permissions on the extensions page.
   - Some browsers may require explicit user confirmation for these permissions.

2. **Allow Host Requests Permissions:**
   - The extension requires access to URLs using HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS schemes.
   - Ensure you have not denied access to such sites.

3. **Test on Popular Websites:**
   - Visit commonly used sites known to trigger network connections.
   - After loading the site, click the extension icon to see connection data.

4. **Check for Conflicting Extensions:**
   - Other extensions may interfere with uBO Scope’s ability to monitor network requests.
   - Temporarily disable other extensions and observe if the badge updates correctly.

5. **Reload or Reinstall the Extension:**
   - Remove and reinstall the extension via official stores.

### Common Gotchas
- The badge count reflects distinct third-party domains contacted, not simply the number of blocked requests.
- If other content blockers use stealth blocking techniques, uBO Scope still counts network connections accurately.

## 3. Permissions Issues

uBO Scope relies on browser extension APIs that require permissions to function correctly. Issues here may prevent the extension from collecting data or displaying information.

### How to Verify and Fix

1. **Review Permission Settings:**
   - On the browser extensions page, check for any alert regarding permissions.
   - Re-enable any deselected permissions.

2. **Browser-Specific Notes:**
   - **Chromium:** Minimum required version 122. Ensure you have granted requested permissions.
   - **Firefox:** Minimum required version 128. Confirm that uBO Scope is properly enabled and granted host permissions.
   - **Safari:** Minimum required version 18.5. Permissions may be managed through macOS privacy settings.

3. **Clear Extension Data:**
   - Sometimes stale data causes issues. Clear storage related to the extension (if supported).

4. **Reset Browser Settings:**
   - Network or privacy settings may block the extension’s APIs. Consider resetting or reviewing these settings.

## 4. uBO Scope Popup Shows "NO DATA"

If opening the extension popup displays no data under the domain or connection counts, it means uBO Scope is not receiving network event data for the active tab.

### Steps to Check and Remedy

1. **Check Active Tab Focus:**
   - Ensure you have an active tab with a loaded website.

2. **Reload the Webpage:**
   - uBO Scope captures requests starting from page load. Reload the page to initiate network tracking.

3. **Verify WebRequest API Accessibility:**
   - Some privacy or security addons and browser settings can block the WebRequest API.

4. **Check for Browser or System Restrictions:**
   - Corporate or managed devices might restrict extension APIs.

## 6. Additional Tips & Best Practices

- **Use Supported Browsers Only:** Unsupported or outdated browsers will cause failures or no data.
- **Avoid Blocking Your Own Extension:** Some privacy tools may block requests by extensions themselves.
- **Regularly Reload Pages:** uBO Scope tracks session data per tab load, so ensure pages are freshly loaded to catch new activity.
- **Understand Badge Count Meaning:** High badge counts represent many distinct third-party connections — a potential privacy impact.
