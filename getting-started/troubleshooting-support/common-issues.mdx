# Troubleshooting Installation and Startup

Welcome to the troubleshooting guide for uBO Scope installation and startup. This page helps you identify and resolve the most frequent issues you may encounter when installing uBO Scope or launching it for the first time. It covers common installation pitfalls, permission problems, and browser compatibility snags, ensuring a smooth onboarding experience.

## 1. Common Installation Pitfalls

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension that requires installation from the official stores for Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, or Safari. Follow these tips to avoid common mistakes during installation:

### 1.1 Verify Browser Compatibility
- **Chromium-based browsers**: Requires Chrome version 122 or later.
- **Firefox**: Requires Firefox 128 or later.
- **Safari**: Requires Safari version 18.5 or later.

Installing on unsupported browser versions can cause the extension not to install or malfunction.

### 1.2 Installation Source
- Always install uBO Scope directly from official browser stores:
  - Chrome Web Store: [uBO Scope on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - Firefox Add-ons: [uBO Scope on Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
  - Safari Extensions Gallery

Installing from unofficial or third-party sources may lead to outdated versions or security risks.

### 1.3 Browser Permissions
- uBO Scope requires the following permissions to function correctly:
  - Access to active tabs
  - Storage access
  - WebRequest API permissions to monitor network requests

Be sure to grant these permissions when prompted. Without these, the extension cannot detect connections or update the badge count.

### 1.4 Network URL Access
- The extension requires host permissions on URLs with these schemes:
  - `https://*/*`
  - `http://*/*`
  - `wss://*/*`
  - `ws://*/*`

Blocking these URLs in browser settings or network policies will restrict uBO Scope’s ability to monitor requests.

## 2. Permission and Privacy Settings Troubleshooting

### 2.1 Extension Disabled or Blocked
- Ensure that the extension is enabled in your browser's extensions/settings page.
- Some privacy modes or strict site permissions may disable extensions by default; check browser profiles or guest mode settings.

### 2.2 WebRequest API Availability
- The extension depends on the WebRequest API, which might be restricted or disabled by certain browser policies or enterprise configurations.
- Verify that content blocking or privacy settings have not restricted extension API access.

### 2.3 Storage Quota Issues
- Browser storage quota limits might prevent session data saving, affecting functionality.
- Clear unused extension data or browser cache if you encounter inconsistent behavior.

## 3. Browser Compatibility Concerns

### 3.1 Chromium-Based Browsers
- Minimum version 122 is required.
- Check your browser version via `chrome://settings/help` or `edge://settings/help`.
- If outdated, update your browser for compatibility.

### 3.2 Firefox
- Needs Firefox 128 or later.
- Use `about:support` or browser menu > Help > About Firefox to verify.

### 3.3 Safari
- Supports Safari version 18.5 and above.
- Older Safari versions may lack necessary extension APIs.

### 3.4 Unsupported Browsers
- uBO Scope is not supported on browsers that don’t support Manifest V3 or required extension APIs.

## 5. Advanced Troubleshooting Tips

### 5.1 Clearing Extension Data
If you encounter inconsistencies or stale data in the popup:

1. Go to your browser's extension management page.
2. Locate uBO Scope and clear its local storage if the option exists.
3. Restart the browser.

### 5.2 Disable Conflicting Extensions

- Temporarily disable other content blockers to check if uBO Scope starts reporting correctly.

### 5.3 Network and Firewall Settings
