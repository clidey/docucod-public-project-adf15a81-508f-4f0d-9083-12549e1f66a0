# Troubleshooting Common Installation and Usage Issues

This guide addresses frequent setup challenges and operational hiccups encountered when installing and using **uBO Scope**. If the extension does not appear in your browser toolbar, the badge count does not update, or expected domains are not reported, follow these steps to diagnose and resolve common problems.

---

## 1. Extension Not Appearing in the Browser Toolbar

If after installation **uBO Scope** does not show its icon in the toolbar, perform the following checks:

### Step 1: Confirm Installation
- Verify that you have installed uBO Scope from the official marketplace for your browser:
  - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
  - Safari Extensions Gallery (for Safari 18.5 and above)

<Tip>
Installing from unofficial sources may cause the extension to malfunction or not appear. Always use official channels.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Check Browser Compatibility and Permissions
- Ensure your browser meets the minimum required version:
  - Chromium-based browsers: Chrome 122 or higher
  - Firefox: Version 128 or higher
  - Safari: Version 18.5 or higher

- Confirm that `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` permissions are granted during installation.

### Step 3: Enable or Pin the Extension
- In Chrome/Chromium:
  - Click the extensions puzzle icon, then pin the uBO Scope extension to the toolbar.
- In Firefox:
  - Use the extension panel and pin uBO Scope for easy access.
- In Safari:
  - Enable the extension in Safari Preferences under Extensions.

<Tip>
Some browsers hide newly installed extensions behind menus; pinning ensures visibility.
</Tip>

## 2. Badge Count Not Updating or Incorrect

The toolbar badge reflects the number of distinct third-party allowed domains connected by the active tab. If the badge does not update or shows zero despite browsing activity, try the following:

### Step 1: Reload the Current Tab
- Refresh the active tab to trigger the extensionâ€™s network monitoring.

### Step 2: Verify Extension is Active
- Check for any browser alerts or blocked permissions.
- Confirm uBO Scope is not disabled or conflicting with other extensions.

### Step 3: Check Browser API Limitations
- uBO Scope relies on the browser `webRequest` API to monitor network requests.
- Certain browsers or modes (e.g., incognito/private mode without explicit permission) may limit this API. Make sure the extension has permission to run in incognito/private windows if needed.

<Tip>
Browser API changes may cause limitations; stay updated on browser release notes.
</Tip>

## 3. Domains Not Being Reported in the Popup UI

If the popup does not show connected domains or shows incomplete data:

### Step 1: Open the Popup After Navigating
- The popup data reflects logged activity for the current tab. Ensure you open the popup after loading or reloading a website.

### Step 2: Allow Time for Processing
- uBO Scope batches network events; wait a few seconds for the popup to update after navigation.

### Step 3: Verify Browser Network Reporting
- Some network requests may happen outside the `webRequest` API scope and cannot be reported.
- Examples include non-http/https protocols or network requests from browser internals.

### Step 4: Clear Browser Data and Reinstall
- Corrupted extension data or cache may cause issues. Try removing uBO Scope and reinstalling it.

---

## 4. Browser Permissions and Security Settings

Incorrect or insufficient permissions can block uBO Scope from functioning fully.

### Step 1: Confirm Host Permissions
- Check that the extension has access to all relevant URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` depending on browser).
- Some browsers require explicit host permission enabling in extension settings.

### Step 2: Grant Web Request Permissions
- The `webRequest` API permission is essential for monitoring all network connections.
- Verify this is accepted during installation.

### Step 3: Check Content Security Policies (Corporate or Managed Browsers)
- Enterprise or managed environments may restrict extension permissions.
- Work with IT administrators to ensure uBO Scope is allowed.

<Tip>
Browser security models differ; review your browser's extension permission policies if you face persistent issues.
</Tip>

## 5. Diagnosing Initial Setup Snags

Follow this checklist if uBO Scope seems installed but does not monitor or report effectively:

- **Step 1:** Disable other content blockers temporarily to ensure no conflict.
- **Step 2:** Open the browser's developer console and look for extension-related errors.
- **Step 3:** Check that the extension's background process/service worker is running (varies by browser).
- **Step 4:** Visit multiple websites with known third-party content to trigger network events.
- **Step 5:** Confirm that badge numbers increase or popup UI updates accordingly.

<Tip>
Regularly update your browser and uBO Scope extension to benefit from bug fixes and compatibility improvements.
</Tip>

## 6. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Assuming badge count equals blocked connections:** The badge counts distinct allowed third-party domains, not blocked ones.
- **Using ad-blocker test websites to assess accuracy:** These sites often generate fake requests and do not reflect real-world browsing.
- **Expecting all network requests to be visible:** Some protocols or browser internals bypass the monitoring API.

## 7. Getting Help and Reporting Issues

- Visit the official GitHub repository for updates and issues: [uBO-Scope on GitHub](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope)
- When reporting a problem, include:
  - Browser and version
  - uBO Scope extension version
  - Description of the problem
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Screenshots or console logs if applicable

<Tip>
Before opening an issue, review existing issues to avoid duplicates.
</Tip>

## Appendix: Verifying Installation Status

To ensure uBO Scope is properly installed and monitoring:

### Step 1: Navigate to a site with multiple third-party connections (e.g., news or social media site).

### Step 2: Observe the toolbar badge count; it should reflect the number of distinct third-party domains allowed.

### Step 3: Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup UI.
- Confirm the displayed domains are categorized under allowed, blocked, or stealth.

### Step 4: If no data appears, reload the page and wait a moment.

<Tip>
The badge indicator only counts distinct allowed third-party domains encountered on the active tab.
</Tip>
