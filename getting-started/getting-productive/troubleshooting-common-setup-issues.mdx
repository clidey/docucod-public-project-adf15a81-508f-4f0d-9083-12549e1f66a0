# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide addresses the most frequent challenges users face during or after installing uBO Scope. These issues often stem from missing permissions, browser compatibility constraints, or the extension not displaying any network activity. Each troubleshooting scenario is paired with clear, actionable solutions to help you resolve problems quickly and get uBO Scope working as intended.

---

## 1. Missing Permissions or Improper Permissions Configuration

### Problem:
After installation, uBO Scope does not display any network connections or the badge count remains blank despite browsing activity.

### Cause:
The extension requires specific permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`) to monitor network requests across web pages. Without these permissions granted by the browser, it cannot collect or show network data.

### How to Fix:
1. **Check Extension Permissions:**
   - Open your browser’s extensions settings page.
   - Locate uBO Scope and open its permissions or details.
   - Ensure that the permissions for `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` are enabled.
   - Confirm that the extension has host permissions (e.g., `https://*/*` and `http://*/*`), which allow it to monitor HTTP(s) and WebSocket requests.

2. **Manually Re-enable Permissions (If Needed):**
   - In some browsers, you may need to explicitly allow access to all sites or configure specific site access.
   - Adjust the settings so uBO Scope can operate on all relevant sites.

3. **Restart Browser or Reload Extension:**
   - After adjusting permissions, restart the browser or reload uBO Scope to ensure changes take effect.

### Tips:
- Some browsers may restrict permissions for extensions installed from outside official stores; always install uBO Scope from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) unless you are testing custom builds.

## 2. Browser Compatibility and Minimum Version Requirements

### Problem:
The extension fails to install or installs but does not function properly, such as no badge updates or no popup data.

### Cause:
uBO Scope requires a minimum browser version to support the necessary WebExtension APIs, especially the `webRequest` API and manifest version 3 compliance.

### How to Fix:
1. **Verify Your Browser Version:**
   - Chrome: Minimum version 122.0 or later
   - Firefox: Minimum version 128.0 or later
   - Safari: Minimum version 18.5 or later

2. **Update Your Browser:**
   - Update your browser to the latest stable version to ensure full compatibility.

3. **Check the Platform-Specific Host Permissions:**
   - Firefox and Chromium require host permissions for HTTP(s) and WebSocket URLs.
   - Safari limits support to HTTP(s) only (no WebSocket permissions).

### Tips:
- Visit the [Prerequisites & System Compatibility guide](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/prerequisites-and-system-compatibility) to confirm support and requirements.

## 3. No Network Activity Visible or Badge Count Stays Empty

### Problem:
You navigate websites, but the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge remains blank, and the popup shows “NO DATA”.

### Cause:
- The extension did not capture network requests for the current tab.
- Network requests may not be passing through the monitored APIs (e.g., requests made outside `webRequest` reach).

### How to Fix:
1. **Confirm Extension is Activated on the Tab:**
   - Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
   - Check if there is any indication of active monitoring or domains shown.

2. **Reload the Tab:**
   - The extension captures network events from page load onwards.
   - Reload the tab fully (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R) to trigger a fresh capture.

3. **Try on Different Websites:**
   - Some pages may have no network requests or use network APIs that are not reported.
   - Test on common sites like `https://example.com` or popular news sites.

4. **Check Other Installed Extensions:**
   - Some extensions or custom browser settings may interfere with network request reporting.
   - Temporarily disable other privacy extensions or network filters and retest.

5. **Verify Host Permissions:**
   - Ensure uBO Scope has permissions to read network requests on the domains you visit.

### Tips:
- uBO Scope counts distinct third-party remote servers. If websites load only first-party resources, the badge count might logically remain low or zero.

## 4. Extension Icon or Popup Not Responding

### Problem:
uBO Scope icon shows but clicking it does not open the popup or it hangs on loading.

### Cause:
Issues with extension initialization, browser glitches, or corrupted extension state.

### How to Fix:
1. **Reload the Extension:**
   - Open your browser’s extensions page.
   - Disable and then re-enable uBO Scope.

2. **Clear Extension Storage:**
   - Sometimes stored data can get corrupted.
   - Clear local storage by disabling the extension, then removing stored data or resetting the extension if your browser allows.

3. **Restart the Browser:**
   - A simple restart often resolves transient glitches or stuck service workers.

4. **Reinstall the Extension:**
   - Remove uBO Scope and reinstall from the official source to ensure a clean state.

5. **Check for Browser Updates:**
   - Compatibility issues are often resolved in newer browser versions.

## 5. Special Considerations for Network Request Visibility

### Important Notes:
- uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API for capturing network requests.
- Any network request made outside the reach of this API (for instance, certain native apps running in the browser or heavily sandboxed network requests) will not be reported.
- Content blocking performed outside the browser or in DNS servers still allows uBO Scope to report the outcome if the browser reports it through `webRequest`.

## 6. Additional Resources and Getting Help

- **Visit the [Validating the Extension Works](https://example.com/getting-started/getting-productive/validating-extension-works) guide** to confirm the extension is monitoring and displaying data correctly.
- Review the [Prerequisites & System Compatibility](https://example.com/getting-started/installation-and-setup/prerequisites-and-system-compatibility) if you encounter compatibility issues.
- Check the [Installation Instructions](https://example.com/getting-started/installation-and-setup/installing-ubo-scope) to ensure correct installation.

If the problem persists, consider raising an issue on the project's GitHub repository: [https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
