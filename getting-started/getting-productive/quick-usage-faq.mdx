# Quick Usage & FAQ

This page addresses common questions and key information you'll want to know when first exploring uBO Scope's extension popup. It helps you interpret the numbers and visuals you see, understand what the badge counts mean, and quickly contextualize the data about network requests for your active browser tab.

---

## Understanding the Popup Panel

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup panel shows a snapshot summary of remote connections made by the currently active tab. Here’s how to make sense of it:

### Popup Sections Explained

- **Tab Hostname Header**: Displays the hostname and domain of the webpage in the active tab. It shows the full hostname and the registered domain separately for clarity.

- **Summary Line**: Displays the total number of unique domains connected during the page load.

- **Outcomes by Category**:
  - **Not Blocked (allowed)**: Domains where network requests succeeded and were allowed.
  - **Stealth-blocked (stealth)**: Domains connected through redirections, often hidden or stealthy.
  - **Blocked (blocked)**: Domains where network requests failed or were actively blocked.

Each category lists domains alongside a badge displaying how many times requests were recorded for that domain.

### Badge Count Meaning

The toolbar icon badge shows **the number of distinct third-party domains from which at least one connection was allowed**. This is a precise count of unique remote domains contacted, excluding blocked or stealth connections.

> **Tip:** A lower badge count typically indicates fewer third-party connections, which usually means better privacy.

## Interpreting Reported Numbers

### What Does "Domains Connected" Mean?
This number reports how many unique domains have had network connections initiated or attempted by the active webpage.

### How Are Domains Grouped?
The extension uses an up-to-date public suffix list to intelligently parse hostnames and derive registered domains — this helps group different subdomains under one main domain, providing cleaner summaries.

### Why Are Domains Categorized Into Allowed, Stealth, and Blocked?

- **Allowed**: Requests that succeeded and were loaded.
- **Stealth (Redirected)**: Requests that were redirected, often used by trackers or scripts trying to bypass blocking.
- **Blocked**: Requests that failed due to errors or explicit blocking.

This categorization helps you see not just what was blocked, but also what got through or was stealthily redirected.

## Common First-Run Questions

### Q1. Why Is My Badge Count Not 0 on a New Tab?
Because many websites load resources from third-party services like CDNs, analytics, or advertising networks. uBO Scope reports these third-party domain connections, so seeing a count greater than zero is normal.

### Q2. Does a Higher Badge Count Mean More Ads or Trackers?
Not necessarily. The badge count is about distinct third-party domains connected, not the total number of requests or ads blocked. Some third-party domains may be legitimate services.

### Q3. Why Do Some Domains Appear in Multiple Categories?
Each category reflects the outcome of connection attempts. A domain might appear as both "allowed" and "stealth" if some requests succeeded while others were redirected.

### Q4. What Does Stealth-Blocked Mean?
It refers to connections that were redirected—where your browser was silently directed from one domain to another, possibly evading simple blocking methods.

### Q5. Can uBO Scope Detect All Network Requests?
uBO Scope listens to `webRequest` API events and reports all requests visible through this API. Some network activity outside this scope, such as certain HTTPS encryptions or extensions, may not be reported.

## Quick Tips For First Use

- Always look at the badge count in the toolbar as a quick privacy health indicator.
- Open the popup to check which domains are allowed versus blocked.
- Use the categorization to notice stealthy redirects, which can indicate sophisticated tracking.
- Remember a few connections to known CDN domains are normal and not inherently bad.

---

## Troubleshooting Quick Insights

### If the Popup Shows "NO DATA"
- Refresh or reload the active tab. uBO Scope needs a page load event to gather data.
- Verify the extension permissions and that it is enabled for the site.
- The badge count will be empty if no third-party domains have connected yet.

### If the Badge Count Seems Incorrect
- Make sure you're viewing the active tab where uBO Scope is monitoring.
- Sometimes network requests are delayed; wait a moment and click the popup again.
- Confirm other extensions or browsers are not interfering with network requests.

### If Domains Are Missing
- Remember uBO Scope reports only connections seen by the browser’s `webRequest` API.
- Some local or non-network resources won’t appear.

## Understanding the Extension's Value

uBO Scope helps you get immediate insight into the network footprint of websites you visit by clearly reporting third-party domains contacted and how your content blockers interact with these connections. This transparency enables informed privacy decisions beyond just relying on opaque block counts or unreliable test webpages.

## How Data is Sourced Behind the Scenes (Optional Technical Insight)

- uBO Scope uses browser `webRequest` API to listen to all network requests matching the tab.
- Outcomes for requests (allowed, blocked, redirected) are tracked and summarized per domain.
- The extension leverages a public suffix list to extract effective domains from hostnames.
- Results are presented in the popup panel, with clear separation by outcome.
- The toolbar icon badge displays the total count of distinct allowed domains.

This design ensures you get accurate, real-time visibility into your browser's third-party network connections.
