# Validating the Extension Works

This guide will help you confirm that uBO Scope is correctly monitoring your browser's network connections. You'll learn simple, real-world checks using the toolbar badge and the popup interface to ensure the extension is active and providing accurate network visibility.

---

## 1. What You Should See When uBO Scope Is Active

Once uBO Scope is installed and enabled, it continuously observes network requests made by your browser and summarizes remote server connections per active tab. The two primary user-visible indicators are:

- **Toolbar Badge Count:** Displays the number of distinct third-party domains with network connections.
- **Popup Panel:** Shows categorized domains with connection outcomes such as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

These indicators provide instantaneous feedback that the extension is working as intended.

<Callout title="Tip">
Always keep in mind that a *lower* badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, which is generally preferable for privacy.
</Callout>

## 2. Checking the Toolbar Badge Count

The badge on the extension's toolbar icon is your first quick check to verify uBO Scope's activity.

### Steps:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope Icon:**
    - It appears in your browser's toolbar with the uBO Scope logo.

2. **Observe the Badge Count:**
    - The badge number reflects the count of distinct third-party domains with which your browser connected.
    - If the badge is blank, it means zero distinct third-party connections have been observed for the active tab.

3. **Navigate to Different Tabs or Websites:**
    - As you switch tabs or visit new webpages, watch how the badge updates.
    - A changing badge count confirms real-time monitoring.

<Warning>
If the badge count remains empty or static during normal browsing on sites known to load third-party resources (e.g., news sites, content-rich portals), ensure the extension is enabled and allowed to run.
</Warning>

## 3. Using the Popup to Inspect Network Connections

The popup is your detailed view into actual network connections detected by uBO Scope.

### Steps:

1. **Open the Popup:**
    - Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
    - The popup displays three sections:
      - **Not Blocked:** Domains where connections were allowed.
      - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains blocked in a stealthy manner (e.g., via redirects).
      - **Blocked:** Domains where connections failed or were explicitly blocked.

2. **Review Domain Lists:**
    - Each section lists domains contacted, along with the number of requests.
    - The **domains connected** summary indicates total distinct domains contacted.

3. **Interpret What You See:**
    - A populated **not blocked** section signals that connections were successfully made.
    - Domains in the **blocked** or **stealth-blocked** sections indicate requested connections were prevented.

4. **Verify Domain Names:**
    - Domain names are normalized using the Public Suffix List to show frontend-friendly labels.
    - Unicode domain names are displayed in human-readable form.

<Check>
If the popup displays "NO DATA" or no domains, try revisiting some websites or refreshing the page to ensure network activity is captured.
</Check>

## 4. Real-World Validation Scenario

Use this quick test to verify that uBO Scope sees network activity:

1. **Navigate to a Content-Rich Site:**
    - Open a well-known news or social media website (e.g., https://www.bbc.com).

2. **Look at the Toolbar Badge:**
    - You should see a positive number indicating third-party domains.
    - It may typically range between a few to a dozen depending on the site.

3. **Open the Extension Popup:**
    - Confirm the listed domains reflect familiar or expected third-party domains such as content delivery networks (CDNs) or analytics services.

4. **Switch to a Known Clean Tab:**
    - Open a blank tab (e.g., about:blank).
    - The badge count should clear or drop to zero.

This flow validates that uBO Scope actively monitors and correctly differentiates network connections per tab.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Validation Issues">
<Accordion title="Toolbar Badge Not Updating">
If the badge does not update:
- Verify the extension is enabled in your browser's extension manager.
- Refresh the webpage or navigate to a different site.
- Check for browser permissions; uBO Scope requires `webRequest` and `activeTab` permission.
- Make sure you are using a supported browser version (Chrome >=122, Firefox >=128, Safari >=18.5).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA or Empty Lists">
- Try closing and reopening the popup.
- Reload the active tab to generate new network activity.
- Ensure that no conflicting privacy or security extensions are blocking uBO Scope.
- Restart your browser to reset extension states.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Remains Empty Despite Browsing">
- Confirm you're browsing webpages that load external resources.
- Disable any other extensions that might interfere with webRequest API.
- Check browser settings that may block background service workers or extensions.
- Review logs in the extension debug console (for advanced users).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Understanding What Validation Confirms

By following these steps, you ensure:

- uBO Scope is actively monitoring network requests.
- Badge counts reflect accurate, per-tab connection summaries.
- The popup gives a reliable breakdown of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.

This direct feedback allows you to trust the extension’s output and proceed with further privacy analysis or debugging using uBO Scope.

## 7. Next Steps

After you have validated that uBO Scope is working:

- Explore [Understanding the Badge Count](../guides/core-workflows/understanding-the-badge-count.md) to learn how to interpret variations.
- Use [Monitoring Domain Connections in Real Time](../guides/core-workflows/monitor-domain-connections.md) for active browsing insights.
- Refer to [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../../getting-started/getting-productive/troubleshooting-common-setup-issues.md) if you encounter persistent problems.
