# First Run & Accessing the Extension

Welcome to your first interaction with **uBO Scope**, a precise browser extension that reveals the domains your browser connects to while you navigate the web. This guide walks you through launching the uBO Scope popup panel, understanding the toolbar badge, and interpreting your initial domain-level connection report.

---

## 1. Opening uBO Scope

uBO Scope is implemented as a browser extension accessible via the toolbar.

### Steps to Access the Popup Panel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Icon">
    Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It features a distinctive badge count representing the number of distinct third-party domains connected from the active tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the Extension Icon">
    Click the toolbar icon to open the **popup panel**. This panel provides a snapshot of the connection activity for the current active tab.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Notes on Access

- If you do not see the uBO Scope icon, ensure it is enabled in your browser extension management page.
- On some browsers, toolbar icons may be hidden by default; you might need to pin or drag the icon to the toolbar.

<Tip>
Clicking the uBO Scope icon fetches live data reflecting all remote server connections attempted or completed by the current webpage. This helps you understand the network exposure of any page you visit.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The small number displayed on the uBO Scope icon is more than just a count; it communicates your current tab’s exposure to third-party servers.

- The badge number indicates **the number of distinct third-party remote servers from which network connections were allowed**.
- A **lower number** is desirable, signaling fewer third-party connections.

### What This Number Tells You

- **Blocked connections are not counted here.** The badge reflects connections that successfully connected or were allowed.
- Connections counted exclude first-party domains, focusing on third-party domains that may impact privacy or performance.

<Info>
Remember: A high badge count does not necessarily mean a better or worse content blocker; it simply reflects the number of distinct remote domains connected.
</Info>

## 3. Exploring the Popup Panel Interface

Once opened, the popup panel shows a categorized breakdown of your page’s network connections:

- **Top Section – Hostname Display**
  - Shows the active tab's hostname and domain, resolved to Unicode if needed.
- **Summary**
  - Presents the total count of distinct domains connected.
- **Outcome Sections**
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains where connections were allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were stealthily blocked or redirected.
  - **Blocked:** Domains for which connections were explicitly blocked.

### Step-by-Step First Look

1. Open the popup panel by clicking the icon.
2. View the hostname at the top — this identifies the page you're analyzing.
3. Review the **"domains connected"** count below the hostname summary.
4. Examine the list of domains grouped by connection outcome.

Each domain row includes:
- The domain name (in readable Unicode form).
- A count indicating the number of requests to that domain within the tab.

<Tip>
Domains are listed with counts sorted to help you quickly identify the most contacted domains.
</Tip>

## 4. First Operation: Analyzing a Webpage's Remote Connections

Using your newly opened popup panel, try this practical example:

1. Navigate to any website you usually visit (news site, social platform, etc.).
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
3. Observe the number of domains connected and how these are categorized.

### What to Expect

- You will see several domains under **not blocked** indicating which third-party servers your browser connected to.
- If your content blocker or browser blocks some requests stealthily, those will appear under **stealth-blocked**.
- Fully blocked domains appear in the **blocked** category.

### Interpreting Results

Use this information to assess your network exposure, understand which third parties are active, and verify content blocking effectiveness beyond just the badge number.

---

## 5. Tips for Effective First Use

- Refresh the webpage after installing uBO Scope to gather fresh connection data.
- Check multiple tabs to compare third-party connections.
- Use the domain counts to discover any surprising or unexpected connections.
- Remember that some third parties, such as CDNs, are common and generally benign.

<Warning>
If you see no data in the popup panel:
- Ensure you clicked after the webpage fully loaded.
- Reload the tab and open the popup again.
- Verify that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (see Installation and Prerequisites documentation).
</Warning>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common First Run Issues

### Popup Panel Shows "NO DATA"
- This occurs if uBO Scope has not yet recorded any network requests for the active tab.
- **Solution:** Reload the tab and reopen the popup panel.

### No Badge Number Appears
- The browser may not support required APIs or permissions may be missing.
- Check that uBO Scope is enabled and given access to all websites.

### Popup Panel Fails to Open
- Try restarting your browser.
- Confirm uBO Scope installation completed successfully.

<Tip>
For persistent issues, consult the [Extension UI & Data Problems](https://docs.ubo-scope/getting-started/troubleshooting-common-issues/extension-ui-data-problems) page or the installation troubleshooting guide.
