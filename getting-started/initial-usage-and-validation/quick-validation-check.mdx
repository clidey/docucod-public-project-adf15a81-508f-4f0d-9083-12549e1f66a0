# Quick Validation: Is uBO Scope Working?

This guide helps you quickly confirm that the uBO Scope extension is properly installed and actively reporting on your browser’s network connections. By following these simple steps, you will verify that uBO Scope is capturing and displaying data as expected in its popup interface.

---

## 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It usually appears next to the address bar.
2. Click the icon to open the popup panel.

> The popup panel is the interface where uBO Scope presents all the network connection data it has gathered for the current active tab.


## 2. Understand What You Should See

When uBO Scope is working correctly:

- The main header shows the domain of the active tab.
- The section **"domains connected"** displays the number of *distinct third-party domains* your browser connected to while loading the page.
- Below, the connections are categorized under three sections:
  - **Not blocked** — domains from which connections were successfully made.
  - **Stealth-blocked** — domains redirected or blocked stealthily (such as through redirects).
  - **Blocked** — domains where network requests were explicitly blocked.

Each domain entry shows its Unicode form and the count of requests observed.


## 3. Perform a Simple Test

To verify live data:

1. Open any website that loads multiple third-party resources (e.g., a news site or a site with ads).
2. Wait a moment for the popup panel to update.
3. Check that:
   - The domain header updates to the site's domain.
   - The count under **domains connected** reflects a non-zero number (varies based on the site).
   - Entries appear in the allowed, stealth, or blocked domain lists.


## 4. Common Signs uBO Scope May Not Be Working

- The popup shows "NO DATA" or the domain header is empty.
- The domain count stays at zero on sites that normally have multiple third-party connections.
- Sections remain empty even after visiting content-rich webpages.


## 5. Troubleshooting Tips If Data Is Missing

<Tip>
- **Refresh the active tab:** Sometimes the extension needs to detect network activity on page reload.
- **Check browser permissions:** Ensure uBO Scope has permissions to access active tabs, webRequest, and storage.
- **Verify extension is enabled:** In your browser's extensions manager, confirm uBO Scope is enabled.
- **Review supported browser and versions:** uBO Scope requires modern browsers (see [Prerequisites & System Requirements](./prerequisites-system-requirements)).
- **Restart the browser:** Occasionally, a restart can resolve activation issues.
</Tip>


## 6. Additional Validation

If you want deeper confirmation that uBO Scope is capturing network requests:
- Open the browser’s developer tools (usually F12 or right-click > Inspect).
- Navigate to the Network tab.
- Compare the number of third-party domains in developer tools to the count shown in uBO Scope.

While exact per-domain counting may vary due to extension filtering logic, a significant mismatch might indicate a problem.


## 7. Where to Go Next

Once confirmed that uBO Scope is working:
- Explore the **First Run & Accessing the Extension** guide to understand the popup UI in detail.
- Refer to **Core Features & Benefits** for interpreting connection outcomes.
- Visit the **Troubleshooting Installation & Setup Issues** if you encounter errors or unclear results.

## Visual Reference of the Popup Panel

Below is a simplified layout of what you would see when the popup is loaded correctly:

```text
+------------------------------------------+
| example.com                             |
| Domains connected: 15                    |
+------------------------------------------+
| not blocked                            |
| - cdn.example.net    (9)                |
| - fonts.gstatic.com  (2)                |
+------------------------------------------+
| stealth-blocked                       |
| - redirector.example.org (1)           |
+------------------------------------------+
| blocked                              |
| - ads.example.com      (3)              |
+------------------------------------------+
```

This allows you to immediately grasp your browser’s third-party network exposure for the active webpage.
