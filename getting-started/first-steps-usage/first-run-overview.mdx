# Your First Run: What to Expect

Welcome to your first run with **uBO Scope**. This guide walks you through what happens after enabling the extension, how to open and interact with the popup, and how to interpret the badge count on your browser’s toolbar. Understanding these elements ensures you get immediate value by seeing the network connections your browser makes for each tab.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Extension

Once you have installed and enabled uBO Scope in your browser, you can access it anytime using the toolbar icon:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope Icon**
   - It appears near your address bar as a small icon with the uBO Scope logo.

2. **Click the Icon**
   - Clicking it opens the popup panel displaying connection data for the current active tab.

3. **Popup Behavior**
   - The popup dynamically updates to show information about the active tab you’re viewing, reflecting the network activity it has observed.


## 2. Understanding the Badge Count

The badge count on the uBO Scope icon gives you a quick snapshot of network connections:

- **What It Means:**
  - The number represents the count of **distinct third-party domains** your browser connected to for the current active tab.
  - A **third-party domain** is any domain different from the domain of the webpage you are visiting.

- **Value of the Count:**
  - A lower count generally indicates fewer external connections, which often aligns with better privacy.
  - The number does **not** count blocked attempts explicitly but reflects allowed or stealthed connections detected.

- **When It Updates:**
  - The badge count refreshes as you browse and new connections are made.
  - It resets when you close a tab or navigate to a new main frame.

<Tip>
Remember, the badge count is not a block count. Instead, it helps you see how many distinct external domains your current tab is communicating with.
</Tip>

## 3. What You See in the Popup Panel

The popup is divided into clear sections, summarizing the third-party connections observed for the active tab:

### a. Tab Hostname Display

- At the top, you’ll see the hostname and domain of the active tab in two parts:
  - The subdomain prefix (if any) on the left.
  - The registered main domain on the right.

### b. Summary Section

- Shows the total number of **distinct third-party domains** connected during the lifespan of this tab.

### c. Outcomes & Domains Sections

The popup organizes connection outcomes into three groups, helping you quickly understand how connections were handled:

| Section           | Description                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**   | Domains with connections that were allowed                  |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains where requests were redirected or stealth-blocked  |
| **Blocked**        | Domains where requests failed or were explicitly blocked    |

- Each section lists the domains with a count of requests made to them.
- Domains are presented in Unicode format for readability.

<Tip>
If no data appears, ensure you have visited a web page and given uBO Scope permission to observe network requests.
</Tip>

## 4. How uBO Scope Collects This Information

Behind the scenes, the extension listens to your browser’s network events for each tab:

- It tracks **network request outcomes** — whether requests succeed, fail, or get redirected.
- It classifies domains based on these outcomes into allowed, stealth, or blocked categories.
- The count badge and popup reflect the real-time aggregated data to keep you informed.

This means uBO Scope provides an **accurate picture of what actually happened** on the network layer for your browsing session, independent of which content blocker you use.

## 5. Tips for Your First Use

- **Browse Normally First:** Navigate to any website you want to inspect; connections will start appearing in the popup.

- **Check Domains and Counts:** Use the popup’s domain lists to understand where your browser talks to external servers.

- **Watch the Badge:** The badge number updates as connections occur. A sudden increase might indicate multiple third-party calls from the page.

- **Popup Updates:** Switching tabs and refreshing pages will update the data displayed based on fresh network activity.

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues on First Run">
<Accordion title="No Badge Number or Empty Popup">
Ensure the extension has the necessary permissions and you are viewing a webpage (not a browser internal page).
Try refreshing the tab or revisiting after some browsing to accumulate data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Number Seems Too Low or Zero">
This means the current tab has minimal or no third-party network connections. Check your browsing activity or try visiting complex webpages with known third-party resources.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Not Updating with Tab Switches">
Close and reopen the popup by clicking the icon again after switching tabs.
Browser performance or delays in event processing can affect real-time updates.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
