# Launching & Understanding the Extension

This guide walks you through how to open the uBO Scope extension popup, interpret the connection summaries displayed within it, and understand the significance of the badge count shown on the browser toolbar. By the end of this guide, you will confidently navigate the extension’s core interface and gain practical privacy insights from your browsing activity.

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

uBO Scope integrates seamlessly into your browser toolbar after installation. To inspect network connection details for your active tab:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It displays a badge count representing third-party remote connections.
2. Click the extension icon to open the **uBO Scope popup**. This popup presents a summary of all remote domains connected by the page currently loaded in your active tab.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the extension icon, verify you have installed uBO Scope correctly, and that it is enabled in your browser's extension manager.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface

Upon opening, the popup offers an immediate snapshot of the network connections related to the active tab.

### Key Components of the Popup:

- **Hostname Header**: Displays the full hostname of the current tab at the top of the popup.
    - The header typically shows the subdomain portion and the main domain separately.
    - If no data is available for the tab, it shows 'NO DATA'.

- **Domains Connected Summary**: Shows the total number of unique domains connected by the active tab.

- **Connection Outcome Sections**: The popup segregates remote domains into three connection outcomes:

  | Section           | Description                                         |
  |-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
  | **Not Blocked**   | Domains to which requests were allowed (successful connections). |
  | **Stealth-Blocked** | Connections that were redirected stealthily, often masked or hidden by content blockers. |
  | **Blocked**       | Domains for which requests were explicitly blocked by content blockers or errors. |

Each section lists domains with a count badge indicating the number of requests related to that domain.

### Visual Example (Simplified):

```
[example.com] subdomain

domains connected: 7

not blocked
 - cdn.example.com  5

stealth-blocked
 - tracker.xyz     3

blocked
 - ad.server.net   2
```

### Practical Insights:

- A **lower count** in the `not blocked` section generally implies fewer third-party connections, which can be beneficial for privacy.
- Stealth-blocked entries indicate requests that were redirected or modified silently to preserve your privacy.
- The blocked section shows what was actively prevented, helping you audit your content blocker's effectiveness.

<Note>
You may see punycode domains converted to internationalized domain names (IDNs) in Unicode, making them human-readable.
</Note>

## 3. The Badge Count on the Toolbar Icon

The numerical badge overlays the uBO Scope icon and reflects **the number of distinct third-party domains for which there were connections during page load**.

- **What it represents:** The count does not measure the number of blocked requests but the distinct allowed third-party domains.
- **Why this matters:** A higher badge count means your browser connected to more unique third-party servers, which can indicate less privacy or more tracking.

<Tip>
Avoid using badge counts from other content blockers for a comparison since a higher block count might sometimes mean more third parties were contacted overall. uBO Scope focuses on distinct origins actually connected, enabling clear and unbiased insights.
</Tip>

## 5. Best Practices & Tips

- Visit multiple web pages to compare badge counts and understand how various sites connect to third-party domains.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to audit its effectiveness and see what is truly allowed vs blocked.
- Look for stealth-blocked entries to appreciate redirections or stealth measures your blocker applies to protect your privacy.
- Keep tabs closed and reopened to refresh connection data, ensuring the popup reflects current tab activity.

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Popup and Badge Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty">

- This means uBO Scope has not recorded connection data for the current tab yet.
- Try refreshing the tab or navigating to a different page.
- Ensure the extension has necessary permissions and your browser supports the `webRequest` API.
- Check if another content blocker or privacy tool is interfering with uBO Scope.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count is zero or unexpectedly low">

- This can occur if the page did not initiate any third-party connections.
- Some pages are simple and don’t load external resources.
- Verify that uBO Scope has permissions and is active.
- Reload the page and observe if counts update.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains list is too long or confusing">

- Large sites with many resources might list many domains.
- Focus on domains you recognize or those unfamiliar to assess possible privacy risks.
- Use information from the 'stealth-blocked' and 'blocked' sections to evaluate the effectiveness of your content blockers.
