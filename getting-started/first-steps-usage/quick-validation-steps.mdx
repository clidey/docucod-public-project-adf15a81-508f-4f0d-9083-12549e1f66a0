# Quick Validation Checklist

Ensure that uBO Scope is installed correctly and actively monitoring network requests by following this concise checklist. This guide empowers you to confirm the extension is operational right after installation, giving you immediate confidence in its core function.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation

- Open your browser's extensions page:
  - **Chrome/Chromium**: `chrome://extensions/`
  - **Firefox**: `about:addons`
  - **Safari**: Preferences > Extensions

- Verify that **uBO Scope** appears in the list and is enabled.

- If the extension is disabled or missing, install or enable it via the official store or developer mode (see [Installing uBO Scope](/getting-started/installation-setup/installing-extension)).


## 2. Check Toolbar Badge Appearance

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.

- The badge on the icon should show a numeric count representing the number of distinct third-party domains connected during your browsing session.

- A blank badge means no connections have been detected yet.


## 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup panel.

- The popup shows:
  - The current tab's hostname and domain.
  - A total count of connected domains labeled "domains connected".
  - Lists of domains under three categories:
    - **Not Blocked** (allowed connections)
    - **Stealth-blocked** (requests blocked silently without browser-level indication)
    - **Blocked** (requests blocked visibly by content blockers)

- The domain lists display each domain alongside how many connection requests occurred.


## 4. Trigger Network Activity

- Navigate to a few popular websites (for example, news or shopping sites known for third-party content).

- Refresh the active tab to generate network requests.

- Observe the badge count increase on the toolbar icon.

- Reopen the popup to verify the domain counts update accordingly.


## 5. Validate Badge and Popup Data Consistency

- Ensure that the badge count matches the total number of unique allowed third-party domains shown in the **Not Blocked** section of the popup.

- Confirm that domain names displayed are valid and correspond to known external domains.

- Domains should be listed in Unicode format when applicable.


## 6. Confirm Permissions & Initialization

- Confirm the extension has necessary permissions granted as prompted during installation (activeTab, webRequest, storage).

- If prompted by the browser for permissions, accept to ensure full monitoring.

- If the popup or badge data do not update, try disabling and re-enabling the extension or restart the browser.
