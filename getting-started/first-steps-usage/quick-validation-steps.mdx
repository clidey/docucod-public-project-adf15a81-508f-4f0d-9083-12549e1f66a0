# Quick Validation: Is uBO Scope Working?

Confirming your uBO Scope installation is monitoring network activity correctly is the fastest way to ensure you gain full visibility into your browser’s remote server connections. This guide walks you through a simple test: visiting a website, opening uBO Scope’s popup panel, and verifying that network connections are reported as expected.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you start, verify the following:

- **uBO Scope is installed**: Confirm the extension appears in your browser toolbar. It is available for Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari (minimum versions listed in the installation docs).
- **Browser Tab Active**: Have a browser tab open on a website known to make network requests, such as `https://www.example.com`.

<Tip>
If you have not installed uBO Scope yet, please see the [Installing the Extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) page or the specific installation guide for your browser in the documentation.
</Tip>

## 2. Performing the Quick Validation

Follow these clear, actionable steps to check uBO Scope functionality:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Webpage with Active Network Requests">
Navigate to any popular website that normally loads content from different servers, such as news, social media, or e-commerce sites. Example: https://www.wikipedia.org
</Step>

<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup panel.

  - The popup panel is the main interface for viewing current tab network activity.
  - It will display the hostname of the active tab prominently at the top.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Connection Reporting">
Check the main UI sections inside the popup:

- **Domains Connected Count**: Displays the number of unique third-party domains your browser connects to while loading the page.
- **Not Blocked Section**: Lists allowed connections by domain and how many requests were successful.
- **Stealth-Blocked Section**: Shows redirected or stealth-blocked network requests.
- **Blocked Section**: Lists requests blocked due to errors or failures.

Each domain will show a count of connection attempts in badges.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Data Appears as Expected">
Ensure the popup panel is populated with domain names and counts rather than indicating 'NO DATA' or empty lists.

  - The tab hostname at the top should convert punycode domains into unicode for clear readability.
  - At least some domains should appear under 'not blocked' or other sections for an active website.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or remains empty, it indicates uBO Scope may not be tracking connections for this tab. Try refreshing the page or visiting a different website.
</Note>

## 3. Understanding the Popup Panel Summary

• **Hostname Display**: Clearly shows the current tab's hostname and domain.

• **Domains Connected**: The badge count summarizes unique domains your browser contacted.

• **Connection Categories**:

- **Not Blocked**: Requests completed successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Requests redirected but captured (indication of stealth blocking).
- **Blocked**: Requests that were blocked or ended in errors.

This information confirms uBO Scope is actively monitoring and classifying connections.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you do not see expected connection data, try these steps:

- **Reload Active Tab**: Sometimes data collection begins only after a reload.
- **Check Extension Permissions**: Ensure uBO Scope has permissions to monitor active tabs and web requests.
- **Verify Browser Compatibility**: Confirm your browser version meets the minimum requirements (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- **Disable Conflicting Extensions**: Some privacy or security extensions may interfere with data reporting.
- **Restart Browser**: Close and reopen your browser to reset extension state.

If problems persist, consult the [Troubleshooting Installation Issues](/getting-started/first-steps-usage/troubleshooting-installation-issues) guide.

## 5. Next Steps

Once you confirm uBO Scope is working:

- Explore the detailed domain lists in the popup to understand your browser’s external connections.
- Refer to [Your First Look: Using the Popup Panel](/getting-started/first-steps-usage/your-first-look) for in-depth UI exploration.
- Learn how to interpret badge counts and detailed reports in [Understanding Badge Counts and Reports](/getting-started/introduction-overview/understanding-badge-and-reports).

## Appendix

### Popup Panel Layout Overview

- **Hostname Header**: Shows the active tab's hostname with unicode conversion for readability.
- **Summary Section**: Number of domains contacted in current tab session.
- **Connection Outcomes Sections**:
  - Not Blocked
  - Stealth-Blocked
  - Blocked

Each section dynamically populates with domain rows displaying domain name and count badges.

### Tips for Successful Verification

- Use busy websites with diverse content to generate visible network activity.
- Visit multiple tabs or reload pages if initial data is sparse.
- Remember uBO Scope operates independently and will report connections irrespective of your content blockers.

<Tip>
The popup automatically processes data for the active tab using browser APIs and serializes session data locally for accuracy and speed.
