# First Run & Quick Validation

Welcome to your first session with **uBO Scope**! This guide helps you quickly verify that the extension is functioning correctly by inspecting its toolbar badge, accessing the popup panel, and interpreting domain connection statuses. Follow these practical steps to confidently confirm your setup and understand immediate results.

---

## 1. Confirming the Extension is Active

Before diving into connection data, first ensure that uBO Scope is installed and actively monitoring your browser traffic.

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Badge

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It displays a **badge count** indicating the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted on the active tab.
- The badge's number updates dynamically as network activity occurs.

### What the Badge Means

- The **badge count** shows how many unique third-party domains your current tab has connected to.
- A **blank** or **empty badge** means no third-party connections were observed yet.

> <Info> The badge count is independent of any content-blocking extensions and reflects all detected network activity reported via the browser's `webRequest` API.


## 2. Opening and Inspecting the Popup Panel

The popup panel offers a detailed breakdown of connections by their outcome categories.

### Step 2: Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
- The popup shows:
  - **Domains Connected** summary count
  - Three outcome sections labeled:
    - **Not Blocked** (allowed) — third-party servers your browser successfully connected to
    - **Stealth-Blocked** — connections that were purposefully redirected or stealthily blocked
    - **Blocked** — network requests that were explicitly blocked or encountered errors

### Step 3: Understand Domain Breakdown

- Under each outcome section, domains are listed alongside a count badge.
- Each count indicates how many connections to that domain occurred during your current tab session.
- Domains appear sorted alphabetically within each category for easy scanning.

> <Tip> Hover over or visually inspect domains to recognize familiar CDNs or trackers. Seeing legitimate services here is normal; high counts or unknown domains could highlight costly or privacy-sensitive connections.


## 3. Typical First Session Walkthrough

This flow helps you get real-world feedback from your first active use.

### Step 4: Load a Website

- Visit a website that loads multiple resources (e.g., a news site or popular platform).

### Step 5: Watch the Badge Update

- Observe the badge number on the uBO Scope icon increasing as third-party remote connections get recorded.

### Step 6: Open the Popup and Review

- Click the badge to open the popup panel.
- Confirm that the domains connected correspond to typical third-party providers such as content delivery networks, analytics, or advertising servers.

### Step 7: Interpret Connection Outcomes

- Check the categories:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: These connections completed successfully.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: These often involve redirections or subtle blocking done by other extensions or network configurations.
  - **Blocked**: These requests failed or were explicitly blocked.

> <Warning> Some connections can shift categories during a session as resources are redirected or blocked dynamically. This is normal behavior.


## 4. Interpreting Immediate Results

You've now seen your first visual summary of third-party connections. Here’s how to make the most of it.

- The **'Domains Connected'** number in the summary reflects total distinct third-party domains contacted.
- The **Not Blocked** section highlights active third-party servers supplying content.
- **Stealth-Blocked** domains suggest filtered or redirected connections, which are useful for privacy insight.
- **Blocked** domains are typically those stopped by your browser or other security tools.


## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Refresh your current tab to see the badge count reset and connection data update.
- Compare connections across different websites to understand which sites call out to more third parties.
- Use this insight to assess your exposure footprint and guide potential content blocking choices.


## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting First Run Issues">
<Accordion title="Badge Not Appearing or Not Updating">
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled in your browser extension settings.
- Confirm you have granted required permissions.
- Reload the active tab or restart the browser to reinitialize.
- Verify your browser version meets minimum compatibility requirements.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Panel Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Sections">
- Make sure you have active network activity on the tab.
- Try navigating to a new site to trigger connections.
- Check that no other extensions are preventing uBO Scope from accessing the `webRequest` API.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected High Domain Counts or Unknown Domains">
- Some sites include many third parties; this is expected on modern web pages.
- Look for domains you recognize (e.g., typical CDNs or service providers).
- For unfamiliar entries, consider using additional privacy tools or lists to identify trackers.
- Use related documentation on reading popup panel data for deeper analysis.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
