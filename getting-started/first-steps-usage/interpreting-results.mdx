# Interpreting the Toolbar Badge and Popup

Understanding how uBO Scope presents its network connection data through the toolbar badge and popup interface is essential to leverage its full privacy and security insights. This guide explains what the badge count represents, how to interpret the detailed domain lists in the popup, and common misconceptions regarding connection counts and content blockers.

---

## 1. What the Toolbar Badge Count Means

The badge count visible on the uBO Scope toolbar icon is a direct measure of **the number of unique third-party remote servers** your browser has connected to from the currently active tab.

- **Third-party remote servers** refer to domains that are different from the main website you are visiting.
- Each number in the badge represents a distinct third-party domain for which connections were **allowed**.

### Why This Matters

- A **lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections**, generally implying better privacy.
- Not all third parties are inherently bad; many are content delivery networks (CDNs) or legitimate services required for proper website functionality.
- High badge counts warrant inspecting the connections, as they signal more tracking or external resource loading.

<Tip>
Always treat the badge count as a high-level privacy indicator rather than a judgment on every individual domain.
</Tip>

## 2. The Popup Panel: Detailed Connection Outcomes

Clicking the toolbar badge opens the popup panel, revealing a categorized list of domains with connection counts for the active tab.

### Popup Sections Explained

- **Domains Connected** (Summary): Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections.
- **Not Blocked**: Lists third-party domains your browser successfully connected to and that uBO Scope reports as allowed.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Shows domains where connection attempts have been stealth-blocked by content blockers or browser mechanisms. These requests are hidden to prevent detection by websites.
- **Blocked**: Contains domains whose connection attempts were blocked outright by content blockers or network conditions.

Each domain entry shows the domain name and the number of connection requests made to it.

## 3. Reading and Understanding the Domain Counts

- The **count per domain** indicates how many separate network requests your browser made to that domain during the active tab session.
- Domains may appear in one of the three categories (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked) but never in multiple categories simultaneously.
- The total badge count corresponds to the number of domains listed in the **Not Blocked** section.

### Real-World Example

If you visit a news website and see a badge count of 10:
- The popup may show popular third-party domains like analytics providers, ad servers, or CDN domains.
- If many domains are listed under "Blocked," these are connection attempts stopped by your content blocker, indicating its active filtering.
- "Stealth-blocked" domains indicate hidden filtering, often used by advanced blockers to avoid detection.

## 4. Common Misunderstandings Debunked

<u>Myth 1: A higher block count means better blocking.</u>

- The block count shown in some blockers or tests can be misleading.
- A block count alone does not confirm better privacy; what matters is how many unique third-party domains were *not* blocked, which uBO Scope reports.

<u>Myth 2: Ad blocker test pages reflect real-world blocking.</u>

- Ad blocker test pages create artificial network requests that don't mirror typical browsing behavior.
- uBO Scope focuses on actual network activity during your browsing session, offering honest visibility into connections.

<Tip>
Use the badge count and popup data to verify your content blocker’s effectiveness in reducing exposure to third-party domains.

## 5. How uBO Scope Measures and Displays Data

- The extension listens to network requests via browser webRequest APIs.
- It classifies each request outcome into **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked** categories.
- Counts are aggregated by domain (based on public suffix analysis) and presented accordingly.

## 6. Practical Steps to Use the Popup Data

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Popup">
    Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon while on a webpage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the Summary">
    Look at the &quot;domains connected&quot; number at the top for a quick privacy snapshot.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore the Not Blocked Section">
    Identify which third-party domains are reached and how often.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Stealth-Blocked and Blocked Areas">
    See which domains your content blocker is actively hiding or blocking.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze Domain Purpose">
    Use your browser’s search or domain lookup tools to understand suspicious or unknown domains.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 7. Troubleshooting and Best Practices

- If the popup shows "NO DATA," ensure the extension is enabled and has the required permissions (see configuration guides).
- Domain names are decoded from Punycode to Unicode for readability, which can help identify internationalized domains.
- Reload the webpage if the counts seem outdated or mismatched.
- Keep your browser updated to maintain compatibility with the webRequest API.

<Warning>
The extension cannot track network requests made outside the browser’s webRequest API, such as those by native apps or some specialized browser internals.
</Warning>
