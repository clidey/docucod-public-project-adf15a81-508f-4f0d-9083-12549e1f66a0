# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This page helps you quickly identify and resolve the most frequently encountered issues during the setup and initial use of uBO Scope. From missing badges and data not displaying to unexpected behaviors, you will find practical remedies and diagnostic tips to get uBO Scope working smoothly and reliably.

---

## 1. Missing or No Toolbar Badge

The badge on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected by the current tab. If this badge is missing or empty, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Confirm uBO Scope Is Installed and Enabled

- Verify the extension is installed in your browser:
  - **Chromium-based browsers:** Check via `chrome://extensions`.
  - **Firefox:** Check via `about:addons`.
  - **Safari:** Check Extensions under Safari Preferences.
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled (toggle switch is on).

### Step 2: Check Permissions

uBO Scope requires the following permissions to work correctly:

- `webRequest` permission to listen to network events.
- `activeTab` and `storage` permissions are also necessary.

If permissions were not granted during installation, you may need to reinstall or re-enable the extension.

### Step 3: Confirm Supported Browser Version

- Verify that your browser version meets the minimum requirements:
  - Chromium version 122.0 or newer.
  - Firefox version 128 or newer.
  - Safari version 18.5 or newer.

### Step 4: Disable Other Conflicting Extensions

- Some extensions may interfere with uBO Scope’s ability to access network data.
- Temporarily disable other content blockers or privacy-related extensions and reload a webpage.

### Step 5: Refresh or Reopen Tab

- Close and reopen the active tab or navigate to a different webpage to trigger network monitoring.

<Note>
If after these steps the badge remains missing, try reinstalling uBO Scope from the official stores:
- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
</Note>

## 2. No Data or Empty Popup Panel

When you click the uBO Scope icon, the popup panel should display a summary with: 
- The current tab's hostname and domain
- Counts of domains connected (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked)

If this data is missing or shows "NO DATA":

### Step 1: Ensure Network Requests Are Present

- Visit a site that loads external resources (images, scripts, etc.). uBO Scope tracks network activity related to remote third-party servers.

### Step 2: Check if the Network Requests Are Visible to the Extension

- Some browsers or network configurations block extensions' access to network requests.
- Verify that your browser supports extension `webRequest` API properly.

### Step 3: Verify uBO Scope Background Script is Running

- In browser developer tools, check if uBO Scope’s background script/service worker is active.
- Reload the extension or browser if necessary.

### Step 4: Refresh the Popup

- Close the popup and click the toolbar icon again to force data refresh.

### Step 5: Check for Errors in Browser Console

- Open browser console (`Ctrl+Shift+J` or equivalent) and look for error messages related to uBO Scope.

<Warning>
Certain network requests made outside the scope of the browser's `webRequest` API cannot be monitored by uBO Scope, which may result in incomplete data.
</Warning>

## 3. Badge Count Not Updating or Stuck

If the badge number does not update as expected:

### Step 1: Reload the Page

- Reload the webpage to trigger new network requests.

### Step 2: Close and Reopen the Tab

- This forces a reset of session data for the tab.

### Step 3: Confirm that You Are Viewing the Active Tab

- uBO Scope maintains per-tab monitoring, so check you have the correct tab selected.

### Step 4: Check for Extension Storage Issues

- uBO Scope uses browser local/session storage for persistence.
- Clear browser cache and storage related to uBO Scope if needed (note this removes previous data).

### Step 5: Restart the Browser

- Restarting can clear service worker or background script glitches.

---

## 4. Unexpected Behavior or Data Inconsistency

If you observe unexpected counts or results, consider the following:

### Step 1: Ensure Latest Version is Installed

- Use version 1.0.1 or later.
- Check the GitHub repo or browser store for updates.

### Step 2: Understand Badge Counting Logic

- The badge shows count of distinct third-party domains with successful connection attempts.
- Counts do not represent number of blocked or stealth-blocked requests.

### Step 3: Verify Compatibility with Other Content Blockers

- uBO Scope reports network outcomes regardless of content blockers in use but might be affected if requests are entirely hidden from the `webRequest` API.

### Step 4: Check Browser Compatibility Notes

- Some minor differences exist in `webRequest` API behavior across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari.

### Step 5: Review the Extension’s Permissions

- Incomplete or revoked permissions could cause data inaccuracies.

<Tip>
For filter list maintainers, uBO Scope is a reliable tool for auditing distinct third-party domains but not for measuring absolute block counts.

## 5. Diagnosing Setup Problems

Follow this simple checklist to diagnose and resolve setup issues:

| Problem                 | Diagnostic Step                          | Suggested Action                |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Badge missing           | Check extension enabled and permissions | Reinstall and enable           |
| Empty popup panel       | Visit resource-rich sites; reload popup | Reload tab; restart browser    |
| Stuck badge count       | Clear extension storage/cache           | Restart browser; reload tab    |
| No data after reinstall | Verify browser version                   | Update browser to latest       |
| Conflicting extensions  | Disable other blockers/extensions        | Test uBO Scope alone           |
