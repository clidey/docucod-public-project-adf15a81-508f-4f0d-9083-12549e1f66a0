# Configuration & Initial Setup

Welcome to the first step in using uBO Scope — this guide walks you through the minimal configuration required to begin monitoring remote server connections effectively. uBO Scope operates seamlessly out-of-the-box with no complex setup; your focus will be verifying the extension is active and familiarizing yourself with the initial interface and indicators.

---

## 1. Understanding uBO Scope's Default Operation

uBO Scope is designed for simplicity and transparency. Upon installation, it immediately starts tracking your browser’s network requests to third-party remote servers. There are no user-configurable options required to begin; the extension collects data passively based on permissions granted during installation.

- **Automatic Monitoring:** The background service worker listens to network events (`webRequest`) and classifies connection attempts as 'allowed', 'stealth-blocked', or 'blocked'.
- **Session Persistence:** Connection data per browser tab is stored in session storage to provide accurate and up-to-date information until the tab closes.
- **Public Suffix List Integration:** Uses an up-to-date public suffix list to precisely identify and group domains, ensuring clarity in reports.

<Tip>
You don't need to configure anything before seeing results. The extension starts collecting connection data automatically as soon as it is installed and your browser is restarted or the extension is reloaded.
</Tip>

## 2. Verifying uBO Scope is Active

To confirm that uBO Scope is operational, follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Extension Icon and Badge">
Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It displays a badge with a number representing the count of distinct third-party domains contacted in the active tab.

- If the badge is blank or empty on a tab with network activity, the extension may not be monitoring connections properly.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the extension icon to open the popup panel. The panel summarizes connection data for the current tab, showing:

- Total connected domains
- Domains by outcome categories: not blocked, stealth-blocked, or blocked

You should see data update dynamically as you browse.
</Step>
<Step title="Test with a Known Website">
Visit a website with typical network activity (e.g., a news site or a popular web app). Open uBO Scope popup and observe the connection details and badge number gradually update.

If no data appears, reload the page and ensure network requests are not restricted by other extensions or browser settings.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If the extension icon does not appear or the popup shows 'NO DATA', check your browser’s extension management page to verify uBO Scope is enabled and authorized with required permissions (including `webRequest` and `storage`).
</Warning>

## 3. Initial Settings and What You Can Review

Although uBO Scope requires no mandatory configuration, understanding its initial status helps you get the most out of its transparency.

### 3.1 Permissions Review

Upon installation, uBO Scope requests the following permissions:

- `webRequest`: To monitor all network connection attempts.
- `storage`: To persist session data.
- `activeTab`: To detect and analyze requests per browser tab.

Ensure these permissions are granted; otherwise network monitoring is not possible.

### 3.2 Session and Data Persistence

- The extension automatically retains tab-specific connection data in session storage.
- Data resets when a tab closes, ensuring fresh tracking for new tabs.

### 3.3 Domain Groupings and Badge Updating

- Domains are identified using the public suffix list for precise aggregation.
- The toolbar icon badge shows the count of distinct third-party domains allowed per tab.

### 3.4 User Interface Elements to Note

- Popup shows three connection outcomes: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
- Domains listed in each category have a count of requests.

<Tip>
The popup's simple, upfront interface means you don't need advanced knowledge to start interpreting visibility into your browsing connections.
</Tip>

## 4. Best Practices for Initial Setup

- **Keep uBO Scope Enabled:** Ensure the extension remains active for accurate data.
- **Avoid Restrictive Configurations Early:** Avoid other network filtering or privacy extensions during initial setup to verify base functionality.
- **Use Common Websites for Testing:** Start by browsing popular websites with diverse embedded resources.

## 5. Troubleshooting Initial Setup

If you encounter issues such as missing connection data or an empty toolbar badge:

- Confirm all required permissions are granted.
- Restart your browser and reload the extension.
- Disable conflicting extensions that may interfere with network monitoring.
- Verify your browser version meets uBO Scope’s minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

Refer also to [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-steps-usage/troubleshooting-common-issues) for detailed guidance.

## 6. What’s Next?

Once you confirm uBO Scope is actively monitoring connections and you are comfortable with the popup interface appearance:

- Proceed to [First Run & Quick Validation](/getting-started/first-steps-usage/first-run-and-quick-validation) to learn how to interpret your first connection reports.
- Explore [Reading the Popup Panel Data](/guides/interpreting-results/reading-popup) for in-depth understanding of connection categories and domain data.

<Tip>
Remember, uBO Scope is primarily an observational tool. The actionable insight comes from understanding how many and which third-party domains your browser reaches, helping you assess your privacy exposure.
