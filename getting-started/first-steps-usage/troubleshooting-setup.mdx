# Troubleshooting Setup Issues

The **Troubleshooting Setup Issues** page equips you with practical solutions to overcome common blockers you may encounter when installing or running uBO Scope. Whether you notice that the badge on the toolbar icon doesn't appear, the popup panel fails to open, or the extension shows missing or incomplete data, this guide will help you resolve these issues quickly so you can start benefiting from real-time network connection insights.

## 1. Badge Not Appearing on Toolbar

The badge count on the uBO Scope toolbar icon indicates the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser has connected to for the current tab. If the badge does not show up, follow the steps below to identify and fix the problem.

### Step-by-Step Solutions

1. **Confirm Extension Is Installed and Enabled**
    - Verify uBO Scope appears in your browser's extensions list.
    - Ensure the extension is enabled (not disabled or hidden).

2. **Check Browser Compatibility and Version**
    - uBO Scope supports Chromium browsers version 122 and above, Firefox 128 and above, and Safari 18.5 and above.
    - Refer to the [System Requirements](/getting-started/installation-setup/system-requirements) page to confirm your environment.

3. **Reload the Browser and Re-activate uBO Scope**
    - Sometimes the browser needs a restart for the extension to properly initialize.

4. **Verify Permissions Granted**
    - On first install, uBO Scope requests permissions for `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
    - Check your browser's permission settings to ensure these are granted.

5. **Navigate to a Supported Website**
    - The badge updates only for tabs with web activities (network requests).
    - Visit a common website that loads network requests (e.g., `https://www.example.com`) and see if the badge updates.

6. **Check for Conflicting Extensions**
    - Other extensions may interfere with uBO Scope’s background processing. Try temporarily disabling other content blockers or network monitoring extensions.

7. **Clear Browser Cache and Data**
    - Corrupted extension data may cause issues. Clearing cache or reinstalling uBO Scope can help.

### Verifying Badge Appearance

- When working correctly, the badge shows a number indicating the count of unique third-party domains connected per tab.
- No badge or an empty badge means zero connections recorded or a setup issue.

## 2. Popup Not Opening or Loading Incomplete Data

The popup panel, launched by clicking the extension icon, provides a categorized breakdown of domains connected (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked). If the popup does not open or shows "NO DATA", try these fixes.

### Step-by-Step Solutions

1. **Check Browser Popup Permissions and Blockers**
    - Ensure the extension is allowed to open popups.
    - Some browsers block popups by default—whitelist uBO Scope.

2. **Confirm Extension Initialization
    - Wait a few seconds after opening a tab before clicking the popup; data collects asynchronously.

3. **Reload the Tab**
    - Refresh the active tab to trigger network recording for that tab.

4. **Test with Different Websites**
    - Some pages may not generate network connections the extension can register.

5. **Inspect for Errors in Browser Console**
    - Open the developer tools console (F12) in the popup view (accessible via browser extension debug) to check for script errors.

6. **Update the Extension**
    - Using the latest extension version ensures bug fixes and compatibility improvements.

7. **Disable Other Extensions**
    - Conflicts with other extensions can cause the popup panel not to update or open.

## 3. Missing or Incomplete Data in Popup

If the popup opens but shows stale, incomplete, or missing connection data, the root causes often relate to how network requests are captured or stored.

### Step-by-Step Solutions

1. **Verify Network Activity**
    - Confirm the active webpage is loading content.
    - uBO Scope tracks network connections via the browser's `webRequest` API.

2. **Check Extension Permissions**
    - Permissions for `webRequest` and `activeTab` are essential for proper data capture.

3. **Ensure the Extension Is Not Suspended**
    - Browsers may suspend background service workers to save resources.
    - Try to interact with the extension icon or reload the active tab to reactivate the service.

4. **Clear Stored Session Data**
    - Old or corrupted session data can block new information.
    - You may need to disable and re-enable the extension or clear extension data from your browser settings.

5. **Confirm Browser API Support**
    - The extension relies on `webRequest` to observe requests.
    - Some browsers or configurations may limit API signal availability.

6. **Observe for Network Errors or Redirects**
    - Redirects and network errors are captured differently (under "stealth-blocked" or "blocked" categories).
    - Incomplete network requests (without IP or status code) might be marked as errors internally.

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

- Always keep your browser and uBO Scope extension updated to the latest stable versions.
- After installation or troubleshooting, reload your active tabs to refresh data collection.
- Understand that a badge count of zero does not necessarily mean no connections—it can also indicate setup issues.
- Use a mix of browsing sessions to test the extension’s effectiveness.
- Regularly clear stored session data if you notice persistent stale popup content.

## 5. When to Get Help

<Tip>
If you experience intermittent issues, try toggling the extension off and on again, and restart your browser to refresh extension state completely.
</Tip>

<Warning>
uBO Scope relies on your browser’s webRequest API. Some browsers and configurations might limit or block this API, causing incomplete reports. This is not a failure of the extension but reflects browser platform limitations.
</Warning>

<Note>
Missing badge or data does not always indicate a problem with uBO Scope but can result from browsing in browser modes like Private/Incognito unless explicitly allowed.
</Note>
