# Quick Validation Checklist

Quickly confirm that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browser's network requests by following this concise validation checklist. This page ensures you see live updates on the badge count and domain categories as you navigate the web.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation & Activation

1. Verify uBO Scope is installed in your browser. The extension icon should be visible in the toolbar.
2. The icon's badge should display a numeric count when you browse websites (indicating the number of distinct third-party domains connected).

<Tip>
If the icon or badge does not appear, ensure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions management page and that the browser version meets the required minimum (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
</Tip>

## 2. Browse a Website and Watch for Badge Count Updates

1. Open a new tab and visit a well-known website (for example, <https://example.com>).
2. Observe the uBO Scope icon badge: it should quickly update to show the number of distinct third-party domains contacted as the page loads.
3. Navigate to different pages or refresh the current page to see the badge count update dynamically.

<Note>
A badge count of zero or an empty badge means no third-party remote servers were contacted, which is possible on simple pages or if strong blocking is in place.
</Note>

## 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface

1. Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
2. Check that the `domains connected` count matches or closely aligns with the badge number.
3. Inspect the domain lists under the three categories:
   - **Not blocked:** Domains for which connections were allowed
   - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains associated with redirects or stealth-blocked connections
   - **Blocked:** Domains for which connections were blocked or in error

## 4. Confirm Domain Categories Populate While Browsing

1. Visit various websites with diverse third-party content (e.g., news sites, ecommerce).
2. In the popup panel, observe domain entries populate under each category in near real-time or shortly after page load.
3. Ensure that domains appear sorted and counts next to domains update accordingly.

<Tip>
If the domains do not appear or the popup shows “NO DATA”, try refreshing the page and reopening the popup. Confirm browser permissions allow uBO Scope to observe web requests.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Quick Validation Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Badge Not Updating or Missing">
- Verify the extension is not disabled.
- Check for required permissions in your browser's extension settings.
- Confirm you are using a compatible browser version.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Empty">
- Refresh the current webpage to trigger new network requests.
- Close and reopen the popup.
- Ensure no other extensions or browser settings are blocking webRequest API access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Match Popup Counts">
- Understand that the badge count reflects only **allowed** third-party domains.
- The popup shows separate categories to explain all outcomes, including blocked and stealth-blocked.
- Differences in counts are expected and indicate detailed monitoring.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Additional Tips

- The badge number represents the number of **distinct third-party remote servers** your browser connected to on the current tab, not total requests.
- Watching these counts change live as you browse helps confirm that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your network.
- Use this checklist soon after installation to avoid confusion and ensure full functionality.

## Verification Outcomes

By following these steps, you will know that uBO Scope:

- Is installed and active in your browser.
- Successfully updates the badge count while browsing.
- Displays categorized domain connections in the popup interface.
- Correctly tracks network requests made by your browser.
