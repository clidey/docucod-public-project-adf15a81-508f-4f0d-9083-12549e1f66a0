## 1. Accessing uBO Scope

uBO Scope is designed to stay at your fingertips, ready to show you detailed insights about your browser’s network connections.

### Steps to Open uBO Scope

1. **Locate the uBO Scope extension icon** in your browser’s toolbar. The icon looks like the uBO Scope logo, a distinct shield symbol.
2. Click the icon. This action opens the **uBO Scope popup panel**, providing a summary of network connections tied to the active browser tab.

> <Check> If you don’t see the icon immediately, check your browser’s extensions menu or pin it to the toolbar for quick access.

## 2. Exploring the Popup Interface

Upon opening uBO Scope’s popup, you see a concise but detailed summary of the connections made by the active tab.

### Key Sections in the Popup Window

- **Tab Hostname Header:** 
  - Displays the hostname and domain currently active in the tab.
  - Hostname might include subdomains, while the domain refers to the registered base domain. 
  - Example: If the URL is `news.example.com`, the hostname shows `news` and the domain shows `example.com`.

- **Domains Connected Summary:**
  - A numeric count labeled “domains connected” indicates how many distinct third-party domains your browser has interacted with on this tab.

- **Connection Outcomes:** These categorized lists break down network requests by their outcome:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains to which connections were allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains whose connections were blocked silently (stealth-blocked). 
  - **Blocked:** Domains for which connections were actively denied.

- **Domain Rows:**
  - Under each outcome section, domains are listed along with a badge showing the frequency of connection attempts.

### Using the Popup:

1. Review the **hostname and domain** at the top to confirm you're viewing the correct tab.
2. Check the **domains connected count** to get a quick grasp of how many unique third-party domains your tab touched.
3. Explore the **connection categories** to understand which connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
4. Each domain entry helps you identify which external servers your browser communicated with and how often.

> <Tip> Hover or tap domains for insights (in future versions) or use this list to help identify potentially unwanted connections.

## 3. Understanding the Badge Count on the Toolbar Icon

Right on your browser's toolbar, the uBO Scope icon displays a **badge number**. This number is a realtime tally of the unique third-party domains that have had allowed (successful or redirected) network connections from the active tab.

### What the Badge Number Means

- The count represents **distinct third-party remote servers** for which your browser successfully established a connection.
- A **lower badge count is generally better**, indicating fewer third-party connections (often a privacy goal).
- The badge **excludes stealth-blocked and fully blocked** connections.

### Why This Count Matters

- It gives you transparency into the actual number of remote servers your browser communicates with across all content blocking scenarios.
- Helps debunk common myths about blockers by focusing on distinct third-party connections, not just connection attempts or blocking counts.

> <Note> The badge updates dynamically as pages load and connections are made or blocked.
