# Troubleshooting Installation Issues

This guide addresses common problems encountered during the installation and initial use of uBO Scope. If you find the extension icon missing, the badge count not updating, or the popup panel not showing expected data, follow the practical troubleshooting steps below to resolve these issues quickly and get uBO Scope working as intended.

---

## 1. Confirm Basic Installation

### Step 1: Verify the Extension Is Installed and Enabled
- **For Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave):**
  1. Open `chrome://extensions` in your browser.
  2. Locate 'uBO Scope' in the list.
  3. Ensure the toggle is set to **on**.

- **For Firefox:**
  1. Navigate to `about:addons`.
  2. Select **Extensions** and find 'uBO Scope'.
  3. Confirm it is enabled.

- **For Safari:**
  1. Open Safari Preferences > Extensions.
  2. Locate 'uBO Scope' and make sure it is checked.

<Tip>
If the extension is not present, please follow the [Installing the Extension](https://docs.uBO-Scope/getting-started/installation-setup/installing-the-extension) guide for your browser.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Check Browser Compatibility

- uBO Scope supports only the latest browser versions with minimum requirements:
  - **Chrome/Chromium:** Version 122 or later.
  - **Firefox:** Version 128 or later.
  - **Safari:** Version 18.5 or later.

Ensure your browser meets these prerequisites.

<Tip>
Older browser versions may silently block or prevent installation of extensions using Manifest V3, causing uBO Scope to not function.
</Tip>

## 2. Troubleshooting Icon and Badge Issues

### Issue: Extension Icon Does Not Appear in Toolbar

1. **Check Browser UI Settings:**
   - Chrome/Edge/Brave may hide extension icons under the "Extensions" puzzle piece icon. Click it and pin uBO Scope for visibility.
   - Firefox may require customizing the toolbar via `Customize Toolbar` to expose the extension icon.
2. **Restart the Browser:**
   - Completely close and reopen your browser to refresh extension state.
3. **Reinstall the Extension:**
   - Remove and reinstall uBO Scope to clear corrupt states.

### Issue: Badge Count Not Updating or Showing

1. **Verify Permissions:**
   - uBO Scope requires the `webRequest` and `activeTab` permissions. Check that these are granted and not blocked by your browser or other security software.
2. **Conflict with Other Extensions:**
   - Some extensions that heavily modify web requests or block webRequest API (e.g., aggressive content blockers) might interfere. Try disabling other extensions temporarily.
3. **Check Network Activity:**
   - Open the popup panel and visit different websites to trigger network connections; the badge updates only when network requests are recorded.
4. **Reload Extension or Browser:**
   - Reload the extension from your browser's extensions page or restart the browser.

## 3. Resolving Popup Panel Problems

### Issue: Popup Does Not Open or Shows "NO DATA"

1. **Wait for Data Collection:**
   - The popup displays data for the currently active tab and needs network activity on that tab to show results.
   - Visit popular websites with external resources (e.g., news sites, CDNs) to generate data.
2. **Reload the Page:**
   - Sometimes page reload refreshes tracked network requests.
3. **Check Console for Errors:**
   - Open developer tools (F12) and check the popup console for errors related to message passing or data deserialization.
4. **Close and Reopen Popup:**
   - Close the popup and reopen it to refresh content.

### Issue: Popup Shows Outdated or Static Data

- **Cause:** uBO Scope stores session data in browser session storage; closing the tab or browser may clear or reset tracked data.
- **Solution:** Reload the page to generate fresh network events; open the popup anew.

## 4. Additional Tips and Best Practices

- **Use Supported Browsers Only:**
  - Ensure you avoid browsers or versions without `webRequest` support required for accurate tracking.

- **Check Host Permissions:**
  - The extension requires permissions to monitor HTTP/S and WebSocket requests on all pages (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
  - Confirm these permissions are given at install and actively enabled.

- **Avoid Incognito Mode or Private Browsing if Disabled:**
  - Some browsers disable extensions automatically in incognito/private mode. Check extension settings if using private browsing.

- **Keep Extension Updated:**
  - Periodically check for extension updates to ensure compatibility and bug fixes.

- **Avoid Relying on Block Counts:**
  - Refer to the [Understanding Badge Counts and Reports](https://docs.uBO-Scope/getting-started/introduction-overview/understanding-badge-and-reports) guide for insights on interpreting badge values correctly.
