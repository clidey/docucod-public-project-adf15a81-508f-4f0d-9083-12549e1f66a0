# Quick Validation Steps

This page guides you through a fast and effective workflow to verify that **uBO Scope** is actively monitoring network connections as you browse. By following these steps, you will confirm that the extension is properly observing connections, updating its badge count, and reporting correct details via its popup.

---

## What to Expect

uBO Scope tracks and reports connections to third-party remote servers for each browser tab. Its toolbar icon badge displays the **number of distinct allowed third-party domains** a page connects to. The popup interface provides a detailed breakdown of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked remote domains per tab.

A successful validation means you see the badge update when browsing regular websites and can review detailed connection outcomes in the popup.

## Step-by-Step Validation Workflow

### 1. Confirm Extension Is Installed and Enabled

- Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
- If it is not visible, ensure the extension is installed and enabled by visiting your browser's extensions or add-ons page.

### 2. Open a Test Website

- Navigate to a commonly used website (e.g., https://www.wikipedia.org or https://www.example.com).
- Wait for the page to fully load.

### 3. Observe the Toolbar Badge Count

- Look at the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- The badge should display a **number** indicating how many distinct third-party domains the page connected to.

  - If the badge shows no number, this may mean there were no third-party connections tracked for this page.
  - A higher badge number typically means more third-party connections were made.

### 4. Open the Extension Popup for Details

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
- Review the displayed domains under three categories:
  - **not blocked**: Third-party connections that successfully loaded.
  - **stealth-blocked**: Connections silently redirected or blocked stealthily.
  - **blocked**: Explicitly blocked connections.

- Confirm that the **domains connected** count in the popup matches or is consistent with the badge number.

### 5. Verify Live Updates on Navigation

- Navigate to a different website and observe:
  - The badge count should update to reflect the new page's third-party connections.
  - The popup details should refresh to show domain outcomes related to the new tab content.

### 6. Final Confirmation

- If the badge count updates appropriately and the popup shows connection details as expected, uBO Scope is functioning correctly.

## Best Practices for Validation

- Use well-known websites to get meaningful connection data.
- Allow sufficient time for pages to load completely to capture all network events.
- Open the popup soon after the page loads to see up-to-date statistics.
