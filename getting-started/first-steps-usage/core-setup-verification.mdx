# Basic Setup & Quick Validation

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with **uBO Scope**! This guide walks you through a simple process to verify that uBO Scope is actively measuring your browser's network connections accurately. By following these steps, you will generate web activity, observe domain counts updating, and confirm that the toolbar badge and popup panel display trustworthy data.

---

## 1. Ensure uBO Scope is Installed and Enabled

Before validation, confirm that uBO Scope is installed from your browser’s official extension store and is enabled.

- For Chromium-based browsers, visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
- For Firefox, use the [Firefox Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
- For Safari 18.5+, install as per the official instructions.

<Check>
Make sure uBO Scope's icon appears in your browser’s toolbar and is enabled.
</Check>

## 2. Generate Web Activity

To confirm uBO Scope is properly recording network connections, you need to stimulate typical browsing activity that involves loading web pages with external resources.

### Steps:

1. Open a new browser tab.
2. Navigate to a well-known, content-rich website such as [https://news.ycombinator.com/](https://news.ycombinator.com/) or [https://www.wikipedia.org/](https://www.wikipedia.org/).
3. Wait a few seconds as the page and all associated resources (scripts, images, stylesheets) load.
4. Browse a few additional pages on the site to cause more network requests.

<Tip>
Choose websites that load content from multiple third-party domains (such as images, embedded videos, or ads) to better test uBO Scope’s visibility.
</Tip>

## 3. Observe the Toolbar Badge Update

The badge on the uBO Scope icon reflects the number of unique third-party remote servers your browser successfully connected to.

### What to expect:

- The badge count should increase from zero to a positive number reflecting third-party domains detected.
- If the count remains zero or blank, refresh the page or try a different site to generate more network activity.

<Check>
A non-empty badge number means uBO Scope is actively tracking allowed connections.
</Check>

<Warning>
A higher badge count indicates more third-party connections. While this is normal for complex pages, a lower count generally means fewer third parties fetched, which could indicate better privacy or blocking.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup interface, which provides a detailed breakdown of all detected remote domains categorized by their connection outcomes.

### Key components you will see:

- **Domain count summary:** Shows the total number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Not blocked:** Domains from which connections were successful.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where blocking was stealthy.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were actively blocked.

### Validate data accuracy:

- The numbers in each category should reflect meaningful counts related to your browsing session.
- Domains should be familiar or logically related to your current website.

<Tip>
If no data appears, wait a moment and refresh the popup or try performing more browsing activity.
</Tip>

## 5. Verify Consistency Between Badge and Popup

Ensure the badge count matches the total of domains shown in the **Not blocked** category of the popup panel.

### How to verify:

- Badge displays count X.
- Popup's "Not blocked" section shows a total of X distinct domains.

They must be identical because the badge reflects only domains where network connections were allowed successfully.

<Warning>
If counts differ, reload the page, refresh the popup, and retry generating activity to rule out a temporary sync issue.
</Warning>

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **No badge or blank badge:** Confirm uBO Scope is enabled and has necessary permissions; try reinstalling if issue persists.
- **No data in popup:** Refresh the page to generate a new browsing session or check browser compatibility.
- **Unexpectedly low or high counts:** Remember that complex sites may load numerous third-party domains; mismatch may indicate content blockers affecting results.
