## 1. Extension Not Showing Up in Browser Toolbar

If uBO Scope does not appear in your browser toolbar after installation, here are the steps to resolve:

### Step 1: Confirm Installation
- Open your browser's extensions or add-ons page:
  - **Chrome**: Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
  - **Firefox**: Navigate to `about:addons`
  - **Safari**: Go to Preferences > Extensions
- Verify that **uBO Scope** is listed and enabled.

### Step 2: Pin uBO Scope to Toolbar
- In browsers like Chrome and Firefox, installed extensions may be hidden.
- Click on the "Extensions" icon (puzzle piece) near the toolbar.
- Find uBO Scope and choose the option to "Pin" or show it on the toolbar.

### Step 3: Restart the Browser
- Sometimes, restarting the browser is necessary to complete installation.
- Close all browser windows and open it again.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Disable and re-enable the extension to trigger a refresh.
- Check for browser updates and install the latest version.
- Ensure you installed the correct version for your browser (see [System Requirements & Supported Browsers](./prerequisites)).

## 2. Popup Fails to Open or Shows 'No Data'

The popup is the primary interface to view connection details. If it does not open or shows 'NO DATA', try these steps:

### Step 1: Verify Browser Permissions
- uBO Scope requires permissions for `webRequest`, `storage`, and access to active tabs.
- Check permissions on your browser's extension management page and ensure none are blocked.

### Step 2: Confirm Active Tab Selection
- The popup only shows data for the currently active tab.
- Ensure you have navigated to a website that makes network requests.

### Step 3: Reload the Tab
- Reload the webpage in the active tab to trigger network activity.
- Wait a moment for the extension to collect connection data.

### Step 4: Clear Extension Data
- Sometimes stale or corrupted session data prevents proper display.
- Go to your browser's extension storage (`chrome://extensions/` > Details > Storage) and clear data, or restart the browser.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Disable other conflicting extensions that might block the `webRequest` API.
- Check the browser console for errors related to uBO Scope.

## 3. Badge Count Not Updating or Showing Zero

The toolbar icon badge indicates the number of distinct third-party domains connected. If it shows zero or does not update:

### Step 1: Confirm Extension is Active
- Ensure the extension is enabled and permissions are granted.

### Step 2: Check Site Activity
- The badge updates only after network requests on the active tab.
- Visit websites known to load external resources (e.g., popular news sites).

### Step 3: Wait for Network Request Processing
- uBO Scope batches network request processing every secondâ€”allow time after navigating or reloading a page.

### Step 4: Verify Network Permissions
- For Firefox and Chromium, ensure permissions cover all relevant URL schemes (`http`, `https`, `ws`, `wss`).
- See your browser's manifest file to confirm permissions.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Disable other content blockers to verify if they interfere with network reporting.
- Reinstall the extension if persistent display issues occur.

## 4. Extension Installation Issues

Problems encountered during installation can derail your onboarding process:

### Step 1: Browser Version Compatibility
- Make sure your browser meets minimum version requirements:
  - Chrome 122.0 or higher
  - Firefox 128.0 or higher
  - Safari 18.5 or higher

### Step 2: Install From Official Sources
- Install uBO Scope only from trusted browser stores:
  - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- Avoid third-party downloads to prevent corruption or malware.

### Step 3: Network and Firewall Settings
- Your network or firewall settings may block downloading extensions.
- Ensure that ports and URLs related to your browser's store are accessible.

### Step 4: Complete Required Permissions
- During installation, accept all requested permissions.
- Without active WebRequest permission, uBO Scope cannot monitor connections.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Try installing in a new browser profile.
- Temporarily disable antivirus or firewall software that might block extensions.
