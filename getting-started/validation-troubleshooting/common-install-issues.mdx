## 1. Extension Icon Missing or Not Visible

The uBO Scope extension icon should appear in your browser’s toolbar once installed. If it does not:

### Steps to Fix

1. **Verify Installation**
   - Confirm that uBO Scope is installed: 
     - *Chrome/Chromium*: Go to `chrome://extensions` and ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
     - *Firefox*: Visit `about:addons` and check if uBO Scope is listed and enabled.
     - *Safari*: Check Safari’s Extensions preferences.

2. **Pin the Extension (If applicable)**
   - Some browsers hide extension icons by default.
   - Click the extensions menu (puzzle icon in Chrome/Chromium).
   - Locate uBO Scope and click the pin icon to make it visible in the toolbar.

3. **Browser Version Compatibility**
   - Check your browser version meets the minimum requirements:
     - Chrome/Chromium ≥ 122
     - Firefox ≥ 128
     - Safari ≥ 18.5
   - Extensions relying on Manifest V3 and webRequest API need these minimum versions.

4. **Restart the Browser**
   - Occasionally, browser restart resolves icon visibility issues.

5. **Check for Conflicting Extensions**
   - Disable other extensions temporarily in case they interfere.

<Tip>
If the icon remains missing after these steps, consider reinstalling uBO Scope from the official sources.

## 2. No Data Shown in the Popup

When clicking the toolbar icon, the popup should display network connection details for the current tab. If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or remains empty:

### Fix Steps

1. **Ensure Active Tab Has Network Activity**
   - uBO Scope reports only on network requests made by active tabs.
   - Visit popular sites with third-party content (e.g., news or e-commerce sites) to generate traffic.

2. **Ensure Proper Permissions**
   - The extension requires permissions (`activeTab`, `webRequest`, and `storage`) granted automatically on install.
   - If browser blocked these, consider reinstalling and accepting the permissions.

3. **Check Browser Support and Manifest Version**
   - uBO Scope depends on the browser's webRequest API.
   - Some networks or browser settings may restrict this API.

4. **Reload the Tab or Open a New Tab**
   - Network data collection begins at page load; refreshing ensures capture.

5. **Verify the Extension is Enabled and Running**
   - Check the browser’s extension management to ensure no errors.

6. **Clear Browser Cache and Storage**
   - Sometimes stale cache causes issues. Clearing browser cache or resetting extension storage can help.

<Tip>
Use the extension on well-known sites with rich third-party content to confirm it is working properly.
</Tip>

## 3. Badge Count Not Updating Correctly

The toolbar badge should show the number of distinct third-party domains allowed for the current tab. If it is not updating:

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Confirm Network Activity on the Tab**
   - Without network requests, the badge remains empty.

2. **Check Browser Compatibility With webRequest API**
   - Some browsers or versions restrict or limit webRequest usage (e.g., strict privacy modes).

3. **Reload the Tab**
   - Badge updates after a delay (~1 second) following network requests.

4. **Open Browser Console and Look for Errors**
   - Errors related to the extension service worker or background script may prevent updates.

5. **Disable Other Extensions**
   - Conflicts may cause improper network tracking and badge display.

6. **Restart Browser**
   - Resolves temporary background process issues.

## 4. Extension Not Tracking Network Requests Correctly

If you notice that uBO Scope is missing connections or the classification of domains seems off:

### Steps to Remedy

1. **Check Browser Permissions and WebRequest Availability**
   - uBO Scope relies on authorized access to `webRequest` events.
   - Some browser setups (especially stricter privacy settings) may block this.

2. **Understand Limitations of webRequest API**
   - Requests not reported by the browser’s webRequest API (e.g., certain types of WebSocket traffic or background network operations) cannot be tracked.

3. **Ensure uBO Scope is Not Blocked by Security Software**
   - Security or firewall software may interfere with the browser’s extension system.

4. **Use the Extension on Typical Websites**
   - Test on common websites with multiple third-party domains to confirm behavior.

5. **Review Browser Console Logs for Warnings or Failures**

## 5. Browser-Specific Notes

<u>**Chrome/Chromium**</u>
- Ensure you are running version 122 or later.
- Manifest V3 extensions require the new service worker background, which may be stopped and restarted by the browser, causing short data interruptions.

<u>**Firefox**</u>
- Requires version 128 or later.
- Extension ID is `uBO-Scope@raymondhill.net`.
- Firefox's webRequest API has full features allowing comprehensive tracking.

<u>**Safari**</u>
- Requires Safari 18.5 or later.
- Host permissions are limited compared to Chromium and Firefox.
- Some network protocols (e.g., WebSocket) might not be fully observable depending on the platform.
