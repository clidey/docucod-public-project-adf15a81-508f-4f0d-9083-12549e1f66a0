# Validate Your Installation

Ensure uBO Scope is actively monitoring and reporting third-party network connections in your browser by following the simple validation steps below. This guide walks you through inspecting the toolbar badge, exploring the popup panel, and using test web pages for real-time verification.

---

## 1. Check the Toolbar Badge

The toolbar icon of uBO Scope displays a badge count representing the number of distinct third-party domains your browser has successfully connected to for the active tab.

### How to Verify:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. The icon usually appears near the address bar or extension area.
2. Observe the badge number:
   - A number greater than zero indicates active monitoring and that third-party connections have been detected.
   - An empty badge (no number) means zero third-party domain connections recorded for the active tab.

### What This Means:

- The badge updates in real-time as you browse different pages.
- The count reflects allowed connections only; it does not represent blocked requests.

<Check>
If you do not see the uBO Scope icon, ensure the extension is installed and enabled in your browser’s extensions manager.
</Check>

## 2. Open and Inspect the Popup Panel

The popup panel provides a detailed view of all third-party domains connected to from the active tab, categorized into *allowed*, *stealth*, and *blocked* outcomes.

### Steps to Access:

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
2. Wait a moment for the popup to load data for the current tab.
3. Review the summary and detailed domain lists:
   - **Allowed:** Domains from which resources loaded successfully.
   - **Stealth:** Domains involved in hidden redirects.
   - **Blocked:** Domains for which connection attempts were blocked or failed.

### What to Look For:

- Domain names displayed are normalized and decoded for readability.
- Each domain shows the number of requests observed on the current page.
- The summary count matches the toolbar badge.

<Check>
If the popup shows no data for the active tab, reload the page and try again.
Ensure you are on a page that makes network requests, preferably with third-party content.
</Check>

## 3. Use Test Pages to Confirm Real-time Monitoring

To confirm uBO Scope actively processes network requests, visit websites known to load third-party resources.

### Recommended Steps:

1. Navigate to a site rich in third-party content such as popular news sites or media platforms. For a controlled test, consider custom test pages designed to trigger third-party requests (see notes below).
2. Observe the toolbar badge update as the page loads.
3. Open the uBO Scope popup to see the live list of connected domains.

### Example:

- Visit a site like [https://example.com](https://example.com) (replace with a reputable site known for externally-hosted assets).
- Watch the badge count increase as connections are made.
- Explore the popup list for the domain details.

<Note>
Specialized ad-blocker test pages are discouraged as reliable sources since they often create artificial connection attempts not typical in real browsing.
Instead, use real-world sites or your own test setups.
</Note>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

### Issue: Toolbar Badge Does Not Appear or Update

- Confirm the extension is installed and enabled.
- Verify browser version meets minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Try restarting the browser.
- Check extension permissions include access to the current site.

### Issue: Popup Shows No Data

- Reload the active web page and retry.
- Test on a different page with known third-party content.
- Disable other extensions that might interfere with network monitoring.

### Issue: Unexpected Zero Counts on Busy Web Pages

- uBO Scope only reports requests visible through the browser’s `webRequest` API.
- Some connections made by plugins, apps outside the browser context, or DNS blockers are not visible.

## 5. Confirming Success

You have successfully validated that uBO Scope monitors third-party network connections when:

- The toolbar badge updates with a nonzero count on pages with external content.
- The popup panel displays domains categorized by allowed, stealth, and blocked connections.
- Counts in the badge and popup summary are consistent.
