# Quick Validation Steps

Ensure your uBO Scope extension is properly installed and actively reporting third-party domain connections by following these straightforward validation steps. This guide will help you confirm that uBO Scope is running correctly and that you understand the key indicators and data presented.

---

## 1. Refresh Active Web Pages

To start seeing network connection data, uBO Scope needs to observe outgoing requests during page loads.

**Action:**
- Open a few tabs with websites you frequent.
- Refresh these pages to trigger new network requests.

<u>Why?</u> Network requests happen when webpages load or reload. Without refreshing, uBO Scope may not have current data to report.

<Check>
Make sure you refresh pages after installing uBO Scope to enable real-time monitoring.
</Check>

## 2. Identify the Toolbar Badge

The toolbar icon for uBO Scope shows a badge count which represents the number of distinct third-party domains connected from the active tab.

**What you should see:**
- An icon with numeric badge (e.g., `3`, `10`), or no badge if there are no third-party connections.

**Meaning:**
- The badge number indicates how many unique third-party remote servers had successful connections during the page load.
- A blank badge means no third-party domains were detected or connections are blocked.

<Tip>
A lower badge count typically reflects better privacy, as it means fewer distinct third-party connections.
</Tip>

## 3. Open the Popup for Initial Data

Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup window, which summarizes third-party connections.

### What the popup shows:
- **Top Header:** Displays the main domain (hostname) of the active tab.
- **Domains connected:** Shows the total number of unique third-party domains involved.
- **Sections:**
  - **Not blocked (allowed):** Domains successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains detected but blocked stealthily via redirection.
  - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked with an error event.

### How to interpret:
- Each section lists domains with connection counts indicating how many requests associated with each domain.
- Stealth-blocked domains often indicate connections redirected or hidden by blockers.

<Info>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or '?' symbol, it means uBO Scope has no network activity recorded yet for the current tab.
Refreshing the tab usually resolves this.
</Info>

## 4. Verify Badge and Popup Update After Navigation

Navigate to different websites or reload the current page.

**Expected outcome:**
- The toolbar badge updates to reflect distinct third-party connections.
- The popup updates with new domain information relevant to the active tab.

<Warning>
If badge or popup does not update after navigation and refresh, try disabling and re-enabling the extension, or reinstalling it.
</Warning>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Quick Issues

<Accordion title="Popup shows no data even after refreshing pages">
If the popup remains empty or shows 'NO DATA':

- Confirm the extension has required permissions (access to all sites).
- Ensure your browser supports the `webRequest` API fully (see prerequisites in installation guide).
- Try restarting the browser.
- Validate you do not have content blockers that fully block `webRequest` events.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Toolbar badge stuck or not showing numbers">
This can happen if:

- The browser's extension framework isn’t updating badges.
- Temporary interruption in background service worker (Chromium).

Solution:
- Refresh the active tab.
- Click another tab and return.
- Restart the browser.
- Reinstall the extension as a last resort.
</Accordion>
