# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

Welcome to the troubleshooting guide for uBO Scope. This page is designed to help you swiftly resolve common problems you may encounter during installation or when using the extension early on. Whether you're facing permission errors, unexpected badge counts, or browser compatibility hurdles, this guide will get you back to monitoring your third-party connections effectively.

## 1. Permission Errors and Installation Problems

### Issue: Extension Fails to Install or Request Necessary Permissions

**Why it Happens:**
- Your browser version may not meet the minimum supported requirement.
- Required permissions (`activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`) were denied or blocked during installation.

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Verify Browser Compatibility**
    - Chromium-based browsers must be version **122.0** or higher.
    - Firefox requires version **128.0** or higher.
    - Safari supports uBO Scope starting from version **18.5** and above.

2. **Reinstall Extension From Official Sources**

    For ease and security, use the official stores:

    - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) for Chromium browsers
    - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) for Firefox

3. **Ensure Permissions Are Accepted**

    When prompted during installation, **do not deny** the permissions for `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`. These are essential for the extension to function correctly.

4. **Manual Installation**

    If you manually load the extension via developer mode, ensure the manifest matches your browser’s requirements:

    - Check the `manifest.json` file for correct permissions and minimum browser version.

<Tip>
If you experience installation failures due to permission requests, try disabling other extensions temporarily, especially other content blockers, as they might interfere.
</Tip>

## 2. Badge Count Not Displaying or Incorrect

The toolbar badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains your current tab connects to. A lower count is better, reflecting fewer third-party connections.

### Issue: Badge Count Is Missing or Stuck

**Why it Happens:**
- The extension's background service worker or script failed to load properly.
- WebRequest API limitations or other security settings block the extension from capturing requests.
- Browsing activity does not produce sufficient network events (e.g., using local pages, pages with no network calls).

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Reload the Browser or Extension**

    - Restart your browser to reset the extension's service worker.
    - Go to your browser's extension management page and toggle uBO Scope off and on.

2. **Open a Regular Website for Testing**

    - Avoid testing on local or 'file://' URLs because the extension cannot monitor those network requests.
    - Navigate to a common, network-rich website (e.g., https://example.com).

3. **Check Browser Settings**

    - Make sure no other content blockers or security settings are conflicting.
    - On some browsers, strict privacy settings or disabling webRequest API may limit functionality.

4. **Verify Tab Monitoring**

    - The extension only counts connections for active tabs. Make sure you have the tab focused that you are monitoring.

<Warning>
The badge count represents *distinct third-party remote servers*. It does *not* count blocked requests or all requests indiscriminately.
</Warning>

## 3. Extension UI Not Updating or Showing No Data

When opening the extension popup, the panel should display connected domain counts under three categories:
- Not Blocked
- Stealth-Blocked (redirected)
- Blocked

### Issue: Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Empty Lists

**Why it Happens:**
- The popup couldn’t retrieve current tab data.
- The background script is not running or delayed.

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Wait for Data to Load**

    - Sometimes the popup requires a moment to process network events and display data.
    - Look for any loading indicators or delays before reading the panels.

2. **Reload the Tab or Navigate Again**

    - Reload the webpage you want to monitor to ensure traffic is captured.

3. **Check Permissions and Service Worker Status**

    - Confirm the extension is active and not suspended by your browser's power-saving features.

4. **Inspect Developer Console** (Advanced)

    - Open the browser's Developer Tools console for the popup.
    - Look for errors related to message passing or permission denials.
    - This can hint at missing permissions or script load failures.

## 4. Browser Compatibility Notes

uBO Scope supports the latest major browsers but behaves differently based on underlying APIs:

| Browser   | Minimum Version | Known Notes & Tips                                    |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium | 122.0+          | Supports WebRequest API fully. Badge updates immediately. |
| Firefox   | 128.0+          | Supports WebRequest. Follow Firefox-specific permission prompts. |
| Safari    | 18.5+           | Limited host permissions; no WebSocket monitoring on older versions. |

<Tip>
Keep your browser updated for the most seamless experience with uBO Scope. Browsers sometimes modify API access that impacts extensions like uBO Scope.
</Tip>

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Do not rely solely on badge counts to evaluate content blockers.** A lower number indicates fewer distinct third-party connections, not necessarily less blocking.
- **Avoid using synthetic 'ad blocker test' webpages** for judging the extension. Real-world browsing is the best test.
- **If you use multiple blockers,** conflicts might obstruct accurate data collection; consider temporarily disabling others during setup.
- **Private or incognito browsing** often restricts extension permissions; confirm uBO Scope is enabled in these modes if used.

# Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Encountered Problems">
<Accordion title="Why does uBO Scope require the 'webRequest' permission?">
The extension uses the `webRequest` API to monitor all outgoing network requests, including those allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked. Without this permission, it cannot track third-party connections or update badge counts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I see no badge count, is this normal?">
Yes, if the current tab has no third-party connections or network activity, the badge will be empty. Try browsing to a website with active network requests to see the badge update.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use uBO Scope with other content blockers?">
Yes, but other extensions may interfere or modify network requests, potentially affecting the accuracy of counts. If you observe inconsistent results, temporarily disable other blockers and test.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why am I seeing different counts than my content blocker?">
uBO Scope counts the number of distinct third-party domains with observed connections, not the number of requests or blocks. Content blockers report block counts differently, often including multiple requests to the same domain.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope work on restricted URLs like 'file://' or 'about:' pages?">
No. Due to browser API limitations, uBO Scope cannot monitor network requests made on local file pages or internal browser pages.
