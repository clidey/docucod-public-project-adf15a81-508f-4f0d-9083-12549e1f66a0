# Validate uBO Scope Operation

Quickly confirm that uBO Scope is actively monitoring and reporting network connections in your browser. This guide walks you through simple verification steps designed to ensure uBO Scope captures and accurately displays network connections per active tab, helping you trust the extensionâ€™s core functionality.

---

## 1. Preparation: Confirm Installation and Permissions

Before validating operation, ensure uBO Scope is installed and has necessary permissions:

- Confirm the extension is installed and its icon appears in your browser toolbar.
- Make sure the browser supports the required API (`webRequest`). Supported browsers include:
  - Chromium-based browsers (Chrome 122+)
  - Firefox 128+
  - Safari 18.5+
- Verify uBO Scope has permissions for active tab access, storage, and webRequest as requested upon installation.

<Tip>
If the uBO Scope icon does not appear or permissions were declined, revisit installation instructions outlined in the [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) documentation.
</Tip>

## 2. Open a Website to Generate Network Traffic

uBO Scope tracks the distinct third-party remote servers your browser connects to on a per-tab basis. To test:

1. Open a new browser tab.
2. Navigate to a popular website known to load multiple third-party resources (e.g., https://news.ycombinator.com, https://www.wikipedia.org).
3. Wait for the page to fully load, allowing network requests to complete.

<Note>
Choose a site with real-world third-party content (such as CDNs, analytics, embedded content) to produce meaningful connection data. Avoid artificially fabricated "ad blocker test" sites as they do not reflect genuine browsing scenarios.
</Note>

## 3. Inspect the uBO Scope Popup

Now, confirm uBO Scope captures these network connections:

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
2. Observe the following sections within the popup:
   - **domains connected:** Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected to during the tab's session.
   - **not blocked:** Lists domains and counts of connections that were allowed.
   - **stealth-blocked:** Lists domains for which connections were silently blocked.
   - **blocked:** Lists domains fully blocked by content blockers or failed requests.

3. Verify that the **domains connected** count is a number greater than zero if the site has third-party content.
4. Review domain names for recognizable CDNs or third-party services.

<Tip>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or the counts remain zero despite browsing, see the troubleshooting tips in the Troubleshooting section.
</Tip>

## 4. Interpret the Toolbar Badge

uBO Scope signals the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted through its toolbar badge:

- The badge number equals the count of unique third-party domains with successful connections.
- An empty badge or no number means no connections or inactive monitoring.

Observe this badge as you switch tabs or reload pages to see real-time updates.

<Info>
The badge count helps you assess your exposure to third-party servers independently from block counts or filter list specifics.
</Info>

## 5. Common Validation Workflows

### Basic Validation

- Open a website with known third-party content.
- Open the uBO Scope popup and confirm that multiple domains are listed under "not blocked" and the badge count corresponds.
- Reload the page and verify the counts refresh accordingly.

### Cross-Check with No Content Blocker

- Disable other content blockers temporarily.
- Visit a site with third-party content.
- Confirm uBO Scope detects and reports connections accordingly.

### Validation with Content Blocker Enabled

- Enable a content blocker.
- Repeat browsing the site.
- Check uBO Scope's "blocked" and "stealth-blocked" sections populate accordingly.

<Tip>
Use these workflows to confirm uBO Scope correctly reports connection outcomes under varied blocking conditions.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

### Issue: No Data or Empty Popup
- Confirm that the extension has the required permissions, especially access to `webRequest` API.
- Reload the webpage or browser tab to trigger fresh network activity.
- Restart the browser to reset session data.

### Issue: Badge Does Not Update
- Verify the extension is enabled and the browser supports dynamic badge updates.
- Check if the browser version meets minimum requirements (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

### Issue: Network Requests Not Showing
- Ensure the site accessed loads resources via supported protocols (`http`, `https`, `ws`, `wss`).
- Confirm no conflicting extensions are interfering with network reporting.

<Tip>
For persistent problems, consult the [Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) guide.

## 7. Next Steps

Now that you've verified uBO Scope operation:

- Explore how to [interpret the badge and main UI](https://docs.gorhill.com/ubo-scope/guides/main-workflows/interpreting-badge) for deeper insight.
- Try analyzing network requests per tab using the [Analyzing Third-Party Connections](https://docs.gorhill.com/ubo-scope/guides/main-workflows/analyzing-network-requests) workflow.
- For any issues or detailed scenarios, review [tips for clearer results and fewer connections](https://docs.gorhill.com/ubo-scope/guides/advanced-use/tips-optimizing-insights).

Happy analyzing!

## Appendix: Sample Validation Quick Commands

For advanced users using browser developer consoles or devtools, you can also verify active connections with these commands:

```javascript
// Query currently active tab
browser.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }).then(tabs => {
    const activeTab = tabs[0];
    console.log('Active tab URL:', activeTab.url);
});
```

Open uBO Scope popup and verify data matches.
