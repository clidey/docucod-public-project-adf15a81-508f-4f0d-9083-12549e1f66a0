# Quick Validation Checklist

Confirm that uBO Scope is actively tracking and reporting remote server connections in your browser using this straightforward checklist. These steps help you verify that the extension has installed correctly and that network connection data is being captured and displayed as expected.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation

- **Check Extension Presence:**
  - Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
  - Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser's extensions or add-ons manager.

- **Verify Version:**
  - Confirm you have version 1.0.1 or higher installed.

<Tip>
If you do not see the uBO Scope icon, revisit the installation instructions to complete the setup: [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/guides/getting-started/installation.md).
</Tip>

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface

- **How to Open Popup:**
  - Click the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar.
  - The popup window titled **uBO-Scope** should appear.

- **Initial Popup Elements:**
  - The hostname section is at the top, initially showing the current tab's domain or 'NO DATA' if no data is captured.
  - A summary section displays the total number of domains connected in the active tab.
  - Below the summary, three categorized sections list domains grouped by connection outcome: _not blocked_, _stealth-blocked_, and _blocked_.

<Note>
If the popup only shows 'NO DATA' and no domains, refresh the active tab page or revisit a website to trigger network requests.
</Note>

## 3. Test Network Requests are Being Tracked

- **Navigate to a Website:**
  - Visit a commonly used site that loads external resources (e.g., news, social media, or e-commerce sites).
  - Allow the page to fully load to generate network activity.

- **Observe Popup Updates:**
  - Open the uBO Scope popup again.
  - Confirm that the _domains connected_ count updates to reflect the number of distinct remote servers contacted.
  - Verify that domains appear in at least one of the outcome categories (_not blocked_, _stealth-blocked_, _blocked_).

<Tip>
Third-party domains typically include analytics, advertising, content delivery networks (CDNs), or social widgets. Seeing these domains listed indicates successful tracking.
</Tip>

## 4. Understand Popup Sections and Badge Behavior

- **Allowed (not blocked):** Remote servers that the web page successfully connected to without interference.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were redirected or handled stealthily (e.g., silently blocked, redirected).
- **Blocked:** Domains actively blocked by uBO Scope or related filtering.

- **Badge Counts:**
  - The browser toolbar icon badge shows the number of distinct _allowed_ third-party domains detected on the active tab.
  - Badge disappears if no allowed domains are detected.

<Note>
Badge updates occur shortly after page load and network events are processed (approximately within 1â€“2 seconds).
</Note>

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### No Domains Appear in Popup

- Reload the browser tab to generate fresh network requests.
- Ensure the extension has appropriate permissions enabled (activeTab, webRequest, storage).
- Disable other conflicting extensions that might block or interfere with network requests.

### Badge Does Not Update

- The badge reflects only the _allowed_ domains count; if all requests are blocked or stealth-blocked, badge will be empty.
- Network requests might be cached; try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R).

<Tip>
If issues persist, consult the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/getting-started/validation-troubleshooting/common-issues.md) guide for detailed help.
</Tip>

## 6. Verify Browsers and Permissions

- Confirm you are running a supported browser version:
  - Chrome 122+ / Firefox 128+ / Safari 18.5+
- Ensure uBO Scope has webRequest and storage permissions as per installation requirements.

## 7. Next Steps

- Explore the popup's detailed domain lists to understand third-party connections per site.
- Use the badge and popup info to evaluate tracking behaviors on different websites.
- For deeper understanding, read the [Understanding the Popup and Badge](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/guides/getting-started/understanding-ui-badge.md) and [Basic Usage](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/guides/getting-started/basic-usage.md) guides.

# Summary
This checklist helps you quickly verify that uBO Scope is properly installed and actively tracking network connections on the sites you visit. It guides you through verifying installation, inspecting the popup UI, observing network data capturing, understanding the badge behavior, and troubleshooting common issues.

Make sure the extension icon is present and enabled, open the popup to check domain counts and categories, and visit sites to generate tracking data. If you encounter issues, refresh tabs and validate permissions.

For comprehensive guidance, consult installation and troubleshooting documentation, as well as the popup and badge usage guides provided in the documentation navigation.
