# Quick Validation Checklist

Ensure your uBO Scope extension is actively monitoring and reporting network activity with this straightforward checklist. This guide helps you verify that the extension is properly capturing connection data on popular websites and that the extension's toolbar icon is reflecting real-time results, building your confidence in a successful setup.

---

## 1. Confirm the Extension Icon is Visible and Active

- Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It uses the extension icon shown below:

  ![uBO Scope Icon](img/browsericons/logo32.png)

- If the icon is not immediately visible:

  1. Open your browser’s extensions menu.
  2. Pin uBO Scope to the toolbar (in Chrome/Edge: click the puzzle icon, then pin the extension).

- Make sure the icon is not grayed out or disabled.

<Check>
If the icon is missing or disabled, reinstall the extension and revisit the installation instructions.
</Check>

## 2. Visit Popular Websites to Generate Network Activity

- Open sites known for common third-party connections, such as:
  - https://www.wikipedia.org
  - https://www.reddit.com
  - https://www.nytimes.com

- These sites typically connect to a mix of legitimate first-party and third-party domains.

- While browsing, watch for changes in the badge count displayed on the uBO Scope icon.

<Note>
The badge number represents distinct third-party remote servers contacted successfully. A nonzero count indicates uBO Scope is actively monitoring network requests.
</Note>

## 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup to Review Connection Data

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.

- At the top, the popup displays the hostname of the active tab.

- Below, the domain counts are broken down into three categories:
  - **Not blocked:** Connections allowed by any content blocker or network filter.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Requests redirected or stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked.

- Each category lists the connected domains along with how many requests were observed.

- Ensure data populates each section as appropriate for the site you’re visiting.

<Check>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or empty sections despite active browsing, retry a page reload or check installation completeness.
</Check>

---

## 4. Verify Badge Count Updates Correspond with Browsing

- The toolbar badge number should update as you navigate different tabs or sites.

- Opening a new tab and visiting resource-heavy sites should increase the domain count.

- Returning to simpler sites or empty tabs should show a lower or zero count.

<Warning>
If the badge never updates or remains static at zero, the extension might be inactive or lacking proper permissions.
</Warning>
