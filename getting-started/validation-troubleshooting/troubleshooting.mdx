# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide helps you swiftly identify and resolve the most frequent setup problems encountered with uBO Scope, such as missing permissions, the extension not appearing, or the toolbar badge not updating.

## 1. Extension Not Appearing in Browser Toolbar

If you cannot see the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar:

1. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open your browser’s extensions or add-ons page.
   - Confirm that "uBlock Origin Scope" (or "uBO Scope") is installed and enabled.

2. **Check Browser Compatibility:**
   - Ensure your browser version meets the minimum required version:
     - **Chrome:** Version 122 or higher
     - **Firefox:** Version 128 or higher
     - **Safari:** Version 18.5 or higher

3. **Pin the Extension:**
   - In Chrome and Firefox, click the extensions puzzle icon and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.

4. **Reload the Browser:**
   - Restart your browser to finalize installation.

<Tip>
If the extension remains hidden, try reinstalling it from the official source:
- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

## 2. Permissions Issues Preventing Network Monitoring

uBO Scope requires certain permissions to observe network requests effectively:

- **Active Tab Access:** To link network data to the active browser tab.
- **WebRequest API:** To listen to network events (requests, redirects, errors).
- **Storage Permission:** To save session data and settings locally.

### Steps to Verify Permissions:

1. Open your browser’s extension management page.
2. Locate uBO Scope and review its permissions.
3. Ensure it has access to URLs:
   - `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` for Chromium
   - Additionally, `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*` for Firefox
4. If any permission is missing, remove and reinstall the extension to prompt permission requests.

<Warning>
Without proper permissions, uBO Scope cannot report third-party connections accurately. Permissions must be granted explicitly during installation or prompt acceptance.
</Warning>

## 3. Toolbar Badge Not Updating or Showing Zero

The toolbar badge indicates the number of distinct allowed third-party domains connected by the current tab. If it is not updating or always shows zero:

1. **Refresh the Active Tab:**
   - Reload the webpage to reset monitoring.

2. **Verify Network Activity:**
   - Navigate to websites known to load third-party resources (e.g., news sites, social media).

3. **Confirm Extension Is Active:**
   - Check the extension icon is enabled and not disabled or blocked by other software.

4. **Check for Conflicts:**
   - Other extensions or strict privacy settings might block the WebRequest API access.

5. **Restart the Browser:**
   - A fresh session ensures the background service worker is running.

6. **Clear Cached Data:**
   - Go to browser settings → Privacy & Security → Clear Browsing Data, then clear cache and cookies.

<Note>
uBO Scope updates the badge based on the number of distinct domains observed per tab; some pages may legitimately have zero third-party connections.
</Note>

## 4. Extension Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Blank Information

If the popup interface displays "NO DATA" or empty sections when opened:

1. **Reload the Tab:** Sometimes, data is only available after a fresh page load.
2. **Switch to a Different Tab:** Confirm if the issue persists across multiple tabs.
3. **Check for Network Requests:** uBO Scope only reports URLs accessed over HTTP, HTTPS, or WebSocket protocols.
4. **Confirm Extension Permissions:** See section on permissions above to validate.
5. **Allow Time for Processing:** The extension batches and processes network requests periodically (about every 1 second).

<Info>
The data shown relates to the active tab and its network requests; no data may simply indicate no monitored network activity.
</Info>

## 5. Unexpected Network Requests Not Shown or Missing

If some network connections appear missing in uBO Scope’s report:

- **Content Blockers and DNS Filtering:** Some blocking methods may prevent requests from reaching the WebRequest API.
- **Browser API Limitations:** Certain network requests outside the `webRequest` API scope cannot be detected.
- **Stealth Mode and Redirects:** uBO Scope categorizes redirected requests as "stealth blocked"; verify this section.

<Tip>
Use known test sites with typical third-party content to verify that uBO Scope reports expected network connections.

## 6. Extension Not Working After Browser Update

If the extension stops reporting after a browser upgrade:

1. **Check Extension Compatibility:** Confirm your current browser version is still supported.
2. **Re-enable the Extension:** Sometimes updates disable extensions; re-enable if needed.
3. **Clear Extension Cache:** Remove and reinstall for a clean state.
4. **Verify Permissions:** See section 2.
5. **Check Browser Release Notes:** Some browser API behaviors or permissions may have changed.
