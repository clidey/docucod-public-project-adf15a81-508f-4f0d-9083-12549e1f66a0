# Troubleshooting Installation

When installing uBO Scope, encountering issues such as the extension not appearing, permission errors, or browser compatibility conflicts can be frustrating. This guide provides practical troubleshooting steps to swiftly resolve common installation problems, helping you get uBO Scope up and running with confidence.

---

## 1. Extension Not Visible After Installation

If you have installed uBO Scope but do not see its icon on the browser toolbar or the extension list, proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Confirm Installation Successful
- Check your browser's extensions or add-ons manager to ensure uBO Scope appears in the list.
- For Chromium-based browsers, navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
- For Firefox, go to `about:addons`.
- For Safari, check the Extensions preferences under Safari → Preferences → Extensions.

### Step 2: Enable the Extension
- Make sure uBO Scope is enabled (toggle switch set to ON).

### Step 3: Pin or Show Toolbar Icon
- Browser extensions may require manual pinning to the toolbar.
- In Chrome and Edge, click the puzzle-piece icon and pin uBO Scope.
- In Firefox, ensure the extension icon is visible by customizing the toolbar.

### Step 4: Restart Browser
- Sometimes, a simple browser restart activates the extension.

<Warning>
If the extension does not appear even after these steps, the installation might have failed or been blocked.
</Warning>

## 2. Permissions Not Granted or Extension Not Working

uBO Scope relies on webRequest API permissions to capture network data. If you experience that nothing is tracked or the icon’s badge does not update, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Verify Permissions
- Check that the extension has requested and been granted the proper permissions:
  - Access to URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and WebSocket URLs: `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`)
  - Access to browser tabs and storage
  - Usage of `webRequest` API
- These permissions are requested during installation and can be reviewed in your browser’s extension details page.

### Step 2: Check Browser Compatibility
- uBO Scope supports the following minimum browser versions:
  - Chromium-based browsers: v122 and later
  - Firefox: v128 and later
  - Safari: v18.5 and later
- Using unsupported browser versions will cause installation or operational issues.

### Step 3: Disable Conflicting Extensions Temporarily
- Some security or content-filtering extensions or strict browser policies may interfere with uBO Scope's permissions.
- Temporarily disable other extensions or security tools and test uBO Scope again.

### Step 4: Reinstall the Extension
- Remove uBO Scope and reinstall from the official store:
  - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

<Note>
If you manually install from source or sideload the extension, confirm that the manifest matches your browser's requirements and that permissions are correctly declared.
</Note>

## 3. Browser Compatibility and Version Issues

### Step 1: Confirm Browser Version
- Check your browser version via:
  - Chromium: `chrome://settings/help`
  - Firefox: `about:support`
  - Safari: About Safari in the menu

### Step 2: Update Browser
- Update to the latest stable release or at least meet the minimum supported version listed above.

### Step 3: Use the Correct Extension Package
- The uBO Scope extension has platform-specific manifests and configurations:
  - Chromium package uses a service worker background script.
  - Firefox uses a module-type background script.
  - Safari requires version 18.5 or later and has specific Safari settings in its manifest.
- Avoid installing packages intended for a different browser.
