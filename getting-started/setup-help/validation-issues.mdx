# Troubleshooting First Run

Welcome to the troubleshooting guide designed specifically for resolving common issues encountered during your first run with **uBO Scope**. Whether you see an empty badge, missing data in the popup, or tracking doesn’t appear as expected, this guide helps you quickly verify essential settings and run simple diagnostics to restore full functionality.

---

## 1. Common Issues and Symptoms

### Empty Badge on Extension Icon
- The badge count on the browser toolbar remains empty or missing, even when browsing websites.

### Missing or Blank Popup Data
- The popup window shows "NO DATA" or does not list any connected domains.

### Tracking Not Appearing
- No network requests are being recorded or displayed when browsing.

---

## 2. Quick Verification Steps

Before diving into deeper troubleshooting, confirm these baseline system and browser conditions:

### Step 1: Verify Browser Compatibility
- uBO Scope supports:
  - Chromium-based browsers version 122 and above
  - Firefox version 128 and above
  - Safari version 18.5 and above
- If your browser is below these versions, upgrade to the latest stable release.

### Step 2: Confirm Extension Installation and Permissions
- Ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Confirm the extension has these permissions:
  - `webRequest` permission to observe network requests
  - `storage` permission to save session data
  - Host permissions for URLs such as `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*`
- To verify:
  1. Open your browser's extensions page (e.g., chrome://extensions/ or about:addons).
  2. Locate the uBO Scope extension.
  3. Check details or permissions and confirm the above are granted.

### Step 3: Check Browser Settings Related to Extensions
- Make sure the extension is allowed to run in private/incognito windows if you use them.
- Disable any other extensions that could conflict, especially other webRequest-intercepting extensions.

<Tip>
If your content blocker or another privacy extension restricts access for uBO Scope, disable that specific blocker temporarily to confirm.
</Tip>

## 3. Verify uBO Scope Core Functionality

Follow these steps to ensure uBO Scope captures and displays data correctly.

### Step 1: Reload the Active Tab
- Reload the currently active browser tab to trigger network requests anew.

### Step 2: Open the Toolbar Popup
- Click on the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar.

### Step 3: Interpret Popup Interface
- Check the hostname displayed at the top of the popup.
- Confirm if the summary "domains connected" shows a count other than `?`.
- Review the three outcome sections:
  - **Not blocked** – third-party domains allowed
  - **Stealth-blocked** – redirected or stealth-blocked domains
  - **Blocked** – explicitly blocked domains

If popup remains blank or shows “NO DATA”:
- There may be no network requests captured for the open tab.
- Try visiting a different website known to load diverse third-party content, such as news or media sites.

## 4. Diagnosing Specific Problems

### Problem: Empty Badge or No Data Gathered

#### Causes:

- The extension lacks the required permissions.
- Browser settings or other extensions block data capture.

#### Solutions:
- Restart the browser fully and try again.
- Confirm all permissions as above.
- Disable conflicting extensions temporarily.
- Check if background scripts (service worker) show errors in the browser console or extension logs.

### Problem: Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Sections are Missing

#### Causes:
- No successful network activity recorded for the current tab.
- Tab may be loading pages without third-party connections.
- Network requests may be blocked upstream by other extensions.

#### Solutions:
- Navigate to a site with diverse network calls (e.g., https://news.ycombinator.com).
- Reload the tab and open the popup immediately.
- Disable other blockers or privacy extensions.

### Problem: Badge Shows Incorrect or Unexpected Counts

#### Causes:
- Cached data not refreshed after tab load.
- Background session data corrupted or delayed.

#### Solutions:
- Reload the page.
