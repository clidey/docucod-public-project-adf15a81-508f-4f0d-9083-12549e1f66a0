# Prerequisites & Supported Browsers

Before installing and using uBO Scope, ensure your system and browser environment meets the necessary requirements. This guide helps you confirm compatibility, understand minimal browser versions, and review permissions needed for uBO Scope to work effectively.

---

## 1. System Requirements

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to run within modern browsers supporting Manifest Version 3 (MV3) extensions.

- **Operating System**: Any OS compatible with supported browsers (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS for supported browsers).
- **Browser**: Must be a supported Chromium-based browser, Firefox, or Safari, with minimal required versions listed below.

## 2. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope requires browsers with support for the `webRequest` API and MV3 extensions to reliably observe network requests. It supports the following browsers with strict minimal version requirements:

| Browser      | Minimum Version | Notes                                         |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Chromium     | 122.0+          | Includes Google Chrome and other Chromium derivatives. Restriction noted in manifest as `minimum_chrome_version`. |
| Firefox      | 128.0+          | Cross-platform, including desktop and Android versions.    |
| Safari       | 18.5+           | macOS and iOS Safari, referencing Safari Web Extensions.  |

These minimum versions are enforced to ensure API compatibility and trustworthy data collection.

<AccordionGroup title="Manifest Permissions & Host Permissions per Browser">
<Accordion title="Chromium Manifest Permissions and Host Permissions">
```json
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*", "wss://*/*", "ws://*/*"]
}
```

- **Permissions Explained**:
  - `activeTab`: Allows access to the currently active browser tab.
  - `storage`: Enables saving and retrieving extension data.
  - `webRequest`: Accesses network request details to monitor connections.
- **Host Permissions**: Grants uBO Scope access to all HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket URLs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Firefox Manifest Permissions and Host Permissions">
```json
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*", "wss://*/*", "ws://*/*"]
}
```

- Mirror Chromium’s permissions, ensuring full coverage of network requests on permitted URLs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Safari Manifest Permissions and Host Permissions">
```json
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*"]
}
```

- Notice WebSocket URLs (`wss://` and `ws://`) are **not** listed.
- Safari-specific minimum version is set to 18.5 in manifest, ensuring compatibility with MV3 features.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 3. Required Browser Permissions

For the extension to function fully, you must grant it the following permissions during installation or first run:

- **Active Tab Access**: Enables uBO Scope to monitor network activity in your current browsing context.
- **Storage Access**: Allows the extension to save session and configuration data securely.
- **webRequest API Access**: Critical for observing all network connection events, including allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked requests.

If any of these permissions are missing or denied, uBO Scope cannot collect reliable network data.

## 4. Network Requirements

- No special network configuration is needed.
- The extension listens to browser network events and does not generate additional network traffic for analysis.
- Firewall or security software should not block the extension’s requested permissions or the browser’s webRequest API.

## 5. Summary of Compatibility

| Browser      | Minimum Version | WebSocket Monitoring | Notes                               |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Chromium     | 122.0+          | Yes                 | Full network monitoring including WS
| Firefox      | 128.0+          | Yes                 | Full network monitoring including WS
| Safari       | 18.5+           | No                  | Network requests only HTTP/HTTPS   |

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- Always update your browser to the latest stable version to ensure security and compatibility.
- During installation, review and accept extension permissions carefully.
- Verify installation by checking the extension icon and badge count after browsing a webpage.

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
**Symptom:** Extension fails to install or monitor network requests.

**Solution:** Check your browser version. If it’s below the minimum required version, update to the latest stable release.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Not Granted">
**Symptom:** Extension installed but shows no network data or badge count remains empty.

**Solution:** Ensure all permissions (`activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`) are granted during install or from your browser’s extension settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported Browser or Platform">
**Symptom:** Extension is not listed in your browser’s add-ons store or crashes.

**Solution:** Confirm you are using a supported browser and version. uBO Scope currently supports only Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers as noted. Others are unsupported.
