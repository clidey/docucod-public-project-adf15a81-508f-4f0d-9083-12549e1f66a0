# What is uBO Scope?

Discover the central concept behind uBO Scope—a lightweight, browser extension that provides unparalleled transparency into every network connection webpages attempt or successfully make to remote servers. Independent of any content blockers you have installed, uBO Scope surfaces the reality behind web traffic by reporting distinct third-party connections in real-time.

---

## Why uBO Scope Exists

Modern webpages interact heavily with numerous third-party services—analytics, advertising, content delivery networks (CDNs), social media widgets, and more. Users and filter list maintainers often lack visibility into these connections, making it difficult to assess privacy risks or content blocker effectiveness.

uBO Scope addresses this by revealing **all** attempted and successful remote connections initiated by webpages in your browser. It operates independently of content blockers, capturing network requests whether allowed, stealth-blocked (hidden from the page), or outright blocked.

This makes uBO Scope an essential tool for users who want to understand the true network behavior of the websites they visit.

## What uBO Scope Measures

- **Distinct Third-Party Domains**: The badge count on the toolbar icon quantifies the number of *distinct* third-party remote servers contacted by a webpage. This provides an immediate sense of the scope of external network communications.

- **Connection Outcomes**: Network requests are grouped into three categories:
  - **Allowed**: Requests that succeeded or were redirected successfully.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections that were redirected or suppressed stealthily by content blockers or browser internals.
  - **Blocked**: Requests that failed due to errors caused by content blocker rules or network failures.

- **Independence from Content Blockers**: Because uBO Scope uses the browser’s `webRequest` API directly, it works regardless of your content blocker configuration or even DNS-based blocking, as long as the browser reports the requests.

## Who Benefits from uBO Scope?

### Privacy-Conscious Web Users
Users seeking to audit and control their exposure to third-party trackers and services gain accurate, local visibility into exactly which remote servers webpages contact.

### Filter List Maintainers
Maintainers can verify their lists’ effectiveness and diagnose false positives or leakages by observing actual network traffic, even in locked-down environments where traditional developer tools are limited.

### Web Researchers
Researchers investigating the web ecosystem, third-party service prevalence, or networking behaviors benefit from detailed and precise connection analytics.

## Key Value Points

- **Clear Reality Check on Block Counts**: uBO Scope debunks common myths from badge counts shown by content blockers. For example:
  - A higher block count doesn’t necessarily mean a better blocker; what ultimately matters is how many third-party servers are contacted (lower is better).
  - Popular "ad blocker test" websites offer unreliable results due to fabricated requests and stealth blocking techniques.

- **Transparency Across Blockers**: Since uBO Scope monitors the actual network requests at the browser level, its data supplements any blocker you use, providing insights impossible to get through online testing tools or the blocker interface alone.

- **Simplicity and Light Weight**: Designed to be minimal and unobtrusive, uBO Scope runs efficiently as a browser extension without interfering with browsing experience.

## Understanding the Toolbar Badge and Popup Panel

uBO Scope includes a toolbar icon badge that shows the count of distinct allowed third-party domains contacted by the current tab. Clicking the icon opens the popup panel displaying:

- The tab’s hostname and its primary domain.
- Lists segmented by connection outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked) showing domains and request counts.

This panel gives a granular view of connections to support deeper analysis.

---

## Practical Considerations

- The badge count reflects distinct domains; multiple requests to the same domain count once.
- Not all third-party domains are malicious; many are essential infrastructure like CDN providers.
- uBO Scope cannot detect network requests made outside the browser’s `webRequest` API (e.g., some internal or encrypted DNS queries).
