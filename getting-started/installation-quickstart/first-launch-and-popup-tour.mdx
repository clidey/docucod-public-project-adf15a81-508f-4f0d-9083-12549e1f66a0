# First Launch & Basic Usage

Welcome to **uBO Scope**! This guide walks you through launching the extension for the first time, understanding what the toolbar badge count means, and how to navigate the popup UI to interpret domain connection information for your current browser tab.

---

## 1. Launching uBO Scope for the First Time

After completing installation from your browser’s official extension store (see [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope#installation)), you are ready to start using uBO Scope.

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Icon

- The uBO Scope extension icon appears on your browser’s toolbar, typically near the address bar.
- It uses the uBO Scope logo.

### Step 2: Observe the Badge Count

- This badge number reflects the **number of distinct third-party remote servers connected to by the active tab’s webpage**.
- A lower number indicates fewer third-party connections, which often correlates to less cross-site tracking or fewer external dependencies.

<Info>
Remember: The badge count reflects distinct third-party domains **allowed** or connected to—not blocked connections.
</Info>

## 2. Opening and Understanding the Popup UI

Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup panel. This UI offers a detailed breakdown of the current tab’s network connections.

### Step 1: Open the Popup

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- The popup displays instantly, showing connection summaries.

### Step 2: Interpret the Header

- At the top, you'll see the domain name of the active tab’s main page.
- If a subdomain is present, it appears in a smaller font next to the main domain.

### Step 3: Review the Domains Connected Summary

- This count at the top summarizes the total distinct third-party domains contacted.

### Step 4: Explore Connection Categories

The popup groups remote connections by outcome categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains successfully connected to by your browser.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections stealthily blocked without the page detecting interference.
- **Blocked**: Domains explicitly blocked, for example by your content blocker.

Each category displays:
- A list of domains.
- The count of requests to each domain during the current tab session.

<Steps>
<Step title="View Allowed Domains">
Check the "not blocked" section to see all domains your browser successfully connected to.
</Step>
<Step title="View Stealth-Blocked Domains">
The "stealth-blocked" section lists domains your content blocker hid from the page.
</Step>
<Step title="View Blocked Domains">
The "blocked" section shows domains your content blocker actively prevented from loading.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 5: Understand Request Counts

- The number beside each domain shows how many times your browser attempted or succeeded in connecting during the tab session.
- These counts help identify which third parties are more prominent or frequent.

---

## 3. What The Badge Count Means in Everyday Use

- The badge shows the count of **distinct allowed third-party domains**, not the count of blocked attempts.
- This helps you **understand the actual network exposure** your web browsing session encounters.

### Practical Tip:

If you see a high badge number, you might be loading many third-party resources, like trackers, CDNs, or advertising networks.

### Important Note:

Not all third parties are inherently bad; for instance, major CDNs often serve critical resources efficiently.

## 4. Quick Tips for Effective Use

- **Refresh the page** if you want to see updated connection info after navigation or interacting with webpage content.
- If the badge is blank or not showing a number, it means no third-party connections were made or detected for the current tab.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your existing content blockers to audit which connections are allowed or blocked.

<Warning>
If the badge count seems unexpectedly high, or the popup shows many unknown domains, review your content blocker settings to ensure it’s operating correctly.
</Warning>
