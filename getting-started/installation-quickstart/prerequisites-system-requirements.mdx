# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Ensure your system is fully prepared for a smooth installation and optimal operation of uBO Scope by confirming compatibility and permissions before proceeding with the installation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed to work seamlessly on major modern browsers. To ensure full functionality, verify that you are using the supported versions as listed below:

| Browser       | Minimum Version | Notes                                              |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Google Chrome | 122.0+          | Requires Manifest V3 support and service workers   |
| Mozilla Firefox | 128.0+         | Includes desktop and Android editions              |
| Safari        | 18.5+           | Requires Manifest V3 support                        |


> Browsers older than these versions lack critical API support required for uBO Scope to monitor network activity.

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

Since uBO Scope functions as a browser extension, it runs on the operating systems supported by the respective browsers, including:

- Windows 10 and later
- macOS 11 (Big Sur) and later
- Linux distributions with compatible Chrome or Firefox versions
- Android versions supporting Firefox 128+ or Chromium 122+


> Note: uBO Scope is **not** a standalone application; it cannot be installed outside supported browsers.

---

## 3. Required Permissions

During installation, uBO Scope requests specific browser permissions vital for its core functionality to monitor and report network connection outcomes:

- **activeTab**: Allows uBO Scope to access details of the active browser tab to present network connection summaries.
- **storage**: Enables storing session data like domain connection counts locally to persist data between browser sessions.
- **webRequest**: Central to uBO Scope’s capability; necessary to listen and analyze all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket (ws/wss) network requests.

### Host Permissions

To capture network requests accurately, uBO Scope requires access to the following URL patterns:

- `https://*/*`
- `http://*/*`
- `wss://*/*`
- `ws://*/*` (except in Safari which currently excludes ws and wss)


> These grants let the extension observe all outbound requests in the browser, crucial for transparency.

---

## 4. Network and Connectivity Requirements

Ensure your network settings permit your browser to monitor network requests effectively:

- Firewalls or network security software should allow browser extensions to observe HTTP(S) and WebSocket traffic.
- Proxy or VPN configurations typically do not interfere but verify if monitoring of network requests is enabled under those setups.


> Restrictions or non-standard network configurations may cause incomplete or missing network request data.

---

## 5. Summary of Permissions from Manifests

For transparency, here is a summary of permissions from official manifests for major platforms:

<AccordionGroup title="Manifest Permissions">
<Accordion title="Chromium-based browsers manifest.json permissions">
```json
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*", "wss://*/*", "ws://*/*"],
  "minimum_chrome_version": "122.0"
}
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Firefox manifest.json permissions">
```json
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*", "wss://*/*", "ws://*/*"],
  "browser_specific_settings": {
    "gecko": {"strict_min_version": "128.0"},
    "gecko_android": {"strict_min_version": "128.0"}
  }
}
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Safari manifest.json permissions">
```json
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*"]
  // Note: WebSocket permissions (ws/wss) are not granted in Safari
}
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Preparing Your Environment

Before installing uBO Scope, perform the following checks and preparations:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Browser Version">
- Open your browser’s About page (e.g., `chrome://settings/help` or `about:addons` in Firefox).
- Confirm the version matches or exceeds minimum requirements.
- Update your browser if necessary.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Internet Access">
- Ensure your device is connected to a network with internet access.
- Disable or configure firewall and proxy settings if they block extension access.
</Step>
<Step title="Backup Important Data">
- It's best practice to backup browser data such as bookmarks before installing new extensions.
</Step>
<Step title="Understand Permissions">
- Upon installation, review and accept the permissions requested.
- Understand these permissions grant uBO Scope the ability to monitor network requests for transparency.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Operating system or browser restrictions (corporate policies, managed environments) may block or limit extension permissions. Consult your system administrator if you encounter restrictions.

## Troubleshooting Common System Requirement Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Installation Blocked Due to Browser Version">
If installation denies due to an unsupported browser version:
- Update your browser to the latest stable release.
- If unable to update, try installing on a supported browser or device.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Not Granted or Extension Functionality Limited">
- Verify you have granted all requested permissions during installation.
- Some browsers may require manual permission enabling in extension settings.
- Safari currently restricts WebSocket (`ws://` and `wss://`) access for extensions, limiting some data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Requests Not Detected">
- Check firewall or antivirus software settings; add exceptions for your browser.
- Disable VPN or proxy temporarily to test if network traffic is being blocked or modified.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
