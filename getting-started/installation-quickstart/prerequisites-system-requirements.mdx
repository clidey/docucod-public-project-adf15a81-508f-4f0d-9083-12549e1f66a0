# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Before installing and using uBO Scope, it is essential to ensure your system and browser environment meet the minimum requirements. This guarantees full compatibility and optimal operation of the extension to effectively monitor and report remote server connections.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is a browser extension tailored to modern browsers with support for Manifest Version 3 extensions. Confirm your browser version meets these baseline requirements:

| Browser     | Minimum Version | Notes                                   |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Chromium    | 122.0 or higher | Includes Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers |
| Firefox     | 128.0 or higher | Both desktop and Firefox for Android supported |
| Safari      | 18.5 or higher   | Supports Safari desktop only            |

> Ensure your browser is updated to at least these versions before proceeding with installation.


## 2. Supported Platforms

- **Chromium-based Browsers:** Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and others that support Manifest V3 extensions.
- **Mozilla Firefox:** Desktop and Android versions starting at version 128.
- **Apple Safari:** Desktop version 18.5 or later with Manifest V3 support.

> Note: Functionality and APIs differ slightly in these platforms due to browser architecture differences, but uBO Scope maintains consistent core behavior across them.


## 3. Required Browser Permissions

When installing uBO Scope, the extension will request the following permissions. These are mandatory for its operation to monitor network requests and store data securely:

- **`activeTab`** — Allows the extension to access information about the active tab to track connections per browser tab.
- **`storage`** — Enables saving session data locally within the browser to maintain connection history and details.
- **`webRequest`** — Required to listen to and report on network requests made by web pages, enabling detailed visibility of remote connections.

Additionally, uBO Scope requires access declared as **host permissions** to observe requests to both HTTP and HTTPS URLs as well as WebSocket protocols:

- For Chromium and Firefox:
  - `http://*/*`
  - `https://*/*`
  - `ws://*/*`
  - `wss://*/*`

- Safari limits to:
  - `http://*/*`
  - `https://*/*`

> These permissions ensure that uBO Scope can capture all relevant network traffic without exceptions.


## 4. System and Environment Requirements

- **Operating System:** Compatible with any OS supported by the browsers listed above (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android for Firefox).
- **Network Connectivity:** No special network configuration is needed. However, ensure no corporate or local firewalls block browser extension permissions or functionalities.


## 5. Additional Considerations

- **Content Blocking and DNS:** uBO Scope intercepts and reports on network requests visible to the browser’s `webRequest` API. If network traffic is blocked outside the browser scope (for example, via system DNS filtering), such blocked requests cannot be detected or reported.
- **Browser Privacy Settings:** Some privacy settings or custom profiles that restrict extension permissions might prevent uBO Scope from functioning correctly. Verify that extensions are allowed to run with the requested permissions.


## 6. How to Verify You Meet Prerequisites

Follow these quick checks before installation:

1. **Check your browser version:**
   - Open your browser’s “About” page (e.g., `chrome://settings/help` for Chrome) and confirm the version number.
2. **Check permissions availability:**
   - Ensure your browser installation supports the required WebExtension APIs (`webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab`).
3. **Confirm no conflicting extensions:**
   - Avoid running multiple network-monitoring or content-blocking extensions that could interfere with uBO Scope’s webRequest listeners.

<Tip>
Updating to the latest stable version of your browser before installation avoids unexpected permission or compatibility issues.

| Requirement               | Details                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Browsers                  | Chromium ≥ 122.0, Firefox ≥ 128.0, Safari ≥ 18.5                  |
| Permissions               | `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`                             |

# Troubleshooting Prerequisite Issues

If you encounter problems when installing or running uBO Scope related to compatibility or permissions, consider these troubleshooting steps:

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
Update your browser to the latest stable release that meets the minimum version number (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+). Older versions may lack required Manifest V3 support.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Required Permissions">
Double-check that the browser extension permissions prompt was accepted. Refuse of any of the critical permissions (`webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab`) will prevent the extension from operating correctly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported Platform or OS">
Verify your operating system is supported by your browser version. Some older or less common OSes might not support Manifest V3 or required APIs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Conflicting Extensions">
Disable other content blockers or network-monitoring extensions temporarily to rule out interference with uBO Scope’s listeners.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Restricted Network Environment">
Corporate firewalls or network policies may prevent extension communications. Confirm that browser extensions are fully functional in your network environment.
</Accordion>
