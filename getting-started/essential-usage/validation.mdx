# Validating a Successful Installation

Ensure your uBO Scope extension is operating correctly with these straightforward validation steps. This guide will help you identify the extension’s icon in your browser toolbar, interpret the informative badge counts, and verify that the popup interface is actively reporting real-time network activity. These checks confirm that uBO Scope is capturing and displaying connection data as designed, giving you immediate feedback on its operational status.

---

## 1. Locate the uBO Scope Extension Icon

After installation, the first indication of a successful setup is spotting the uBO Scope icon on your browser’s toolbar.

### Steps

1. Look for an icon labeled **uBO Scope** or showing the extension's distinctive badge icon among your browser’s extensions area (usually near the address bar).
2. If you do not see the icon immediately:
   - Check your browser’s extensions menu.
   - Pin or enable uBO Scope to appear on the toolbar.


<Check>
Finding the extension icon confirms that the browser has loaded uBO Scope successfully.
</Check>

### Tip

Some browsers hide extension icons by default after installation. Pin uBO Scope to your toolbar for easy access.

## 2. Interpret the Toolbar Badge Count

Once the extension icon is visible, a numerical badge may appear on it. This badge count is a crucial indicator of uBO Scope’s real-time monitoring:

- **What the Badge Shows:** The number represents the count of distinct third-party domains with which your browser has established successful connections while browsing the current tab.

- **Meaning of the Count:** A higher count means more third-party remote servers contacted, while a lower count typically indicates fewer external domains accessed.

### Steps

1. Open any webpage.
2. Observe the badge on the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
3. The badge should update dynamically as the page loads and as network activities occur.

<Note>
The badge only reflects successful connections, helping you track the actual external resources the page reaches out to in real time.
</Note>

### Common Pitfalls

- If the badge is empty or does not update:
  - Refresh the page.
  - Check if uBO Scope permissions are granted.
  - Ensure no conflicting extensions block webRequest API access.

## 3. Verify Popup Shows Real-Time Network Activity

uBO Scope’s popup interface provides a categorized live view of network requests, helping you inspect allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections per page.

### Accessing the Popup

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup window appears, showing network activity details.

### What to Look For

- **Summary Section:** Displays the total count of connected domains.
- **Outcome Sections:** Three categories with lists of domains:
  - **Allowed:** Domains where connections succeeded.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected stealthily.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connection requests failed or were blocked.

- **Live Updates:** As you navigate within the tab or refresh, these lists and counts update in real time to reflect network behavior.

### Steps

1. Open the popup immediately after loading a page.
2. Check that each section has relevant domain entries and associated connection counts.
3. Refresh or navigate to a new page and observe that the popup updates accurately.

<Check>
Seeing domain names and counts in each category confirms that uBO Scope is correctly monitoring all network requests.
</Check>

### Troubleshooting

- If the popup shows "NO DATA" or remains empty:
  - Confirm that you have enabled the extension and allowed its permissions.
  - Reload the page to generate network activity.
  - Disable any content blockers that might interfere with uBO Scope’s webRequest listeners.
  - Restart the browser if necessary.
