# Troubleshooting Common Issues with uBO Scope

Ensure your experience with uBO Scope is seamless by quickly diagnosing and resolving common installation and setup challenges. This guide helps you identify why the extension icon might not appear, why permission prompts may not show up, or why uBO Scope doesn’t seem to monitor connections accurately. Follow these actionable steps to restore full functionality and know where to seek additional help.

---

## 1. Extension Icon Missing from Toolbar

If you cannot find the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar:

- **Verify installation:** Ensure the extension is properly installed in your browser. Check your list of installed extensions/add-ons.
- **Enable the extension:** Some browsers disable newly installed extensions by default. Manually enable uBO Scope via the extension settings.
- **Pin the extension (Chromium-based browsers):**
  1. Click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions).
  2. Find uBO Scope in the list.
  3. Click the pin icon to show it in the toolbar.
- **Restart your browser:** Sometimes restarting resolves icon display issues.

<Tip>
If using Safari, ensure your Safari version is 18.5 or newer, as earlier versions are unsupported.
</Tip>

## 2. Permissions Prompt Not Appearing

uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor network requests. If permission prompts do not appear:

- **Check browser version:** The extension requires at least Chrome 122, Firefox 128, or Safari 18.5.
- **Reload the extension:**
  - Go to your browser’s extensions page.
  - Disable then re-enable uBO Scope.
  - Reload any active tabs you want monitored.
- **Manually grant permissions:** Some browsers let you view and configure permissions for installed extensions manually.
- **Clear session storage:** Sometimes stale session data blocks permission dialogs. Restart your browser or clear the browser’s session storage for the extension (advanced).

<Warning>
Without the proper permissions (`activeTab`, `webRequest`, `storage`), uBO Scope cannot capture network events, leading to empty or inaccurate reports.
</Warning>

## 3. uBO Scope Not Monitoring Connections or Showing No Data

When uBO Scope does not track network connections or displays 'NO DATA':

- **Confirm that you have active tabs:** uBO Scope monitors network activity of active tabs only.
- **Check for unsupported protocols:** uBO Scope tracks HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS schemes (depending on browser, for example Safari only HTTP/S).
- **Confirm content blocker interference:** Some blockers or browser privacy settings could suppress network event reporting. Verify by disabling or adjusting them temporarily.
- **Verify browser supports webRequest API events:** uBO Scope depends on the `webRequest` API, which certain browsers or configurations may restrict.

<Tip>
Open uBO Scope’s popup after loading or reloading the webpage you want to monitor to trigger fresh connection data retrieval.
</Tip>

## 4. Conflicts with Other Extensions

A few extensions may interfere with uBO Scope’s operation:

- **Multiple network-monitoring tools:** Running several extensions that rely on `webRequest` can cause conflicts or incomplete data.
- **Privacy-focused extensions:** These might block or obfuscate requests before uBO Scope can log them.

**Resolution:**
- Temporarily disable other extensions one by one to isolate conflicts.
- Prioritize uBO Scope if detailed connection monitoring is required.

<Note>
uBO Scope is designed to be a transparent observer and does not block connections itself, minimizing risk of conflicts, but extension interactions can still affect data capture.
</Note>

## 5. Badge Count Does Not Update or Is Incorrect

If the toolbar badge count is missing or inaccurately reflects connections:

- **Reload all tabs:** Browser or extension might temporarily lose sync; reloading tabs typically fixes this.
- **Validate browser support (Safari note):** Safari has stricter MV3 policies which may affect badge updates.
- **Check for background script errors:** Use your browser’s extension debugger to check for any errors in the background script.
- **Clear session storage:** Corrupted session data can cause stale badge counts.

<Tip>
Badge counts reflect the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected to. A count of zero means no such connections detected.
</Tip>

## 6. Network Data Seems Incomplete or Missing WebSocket Connections

- **Browser-specific behavior:** Firefox and Chromium track both HTTP(S) and WS(S) requests, while Safari tracks only HTTP(S).
- **Check manifest host permissions:** The extension requires appropriate host permissions to monitor all traffic. Ensure uBO Scope is updated to latest version for accurate permissions.

## 7. How to Access Developer Tools for Further Diagnosis

1. Open your browser’s extensions management page.
2. Enable Developer Mode (Chrome, Firefox).
3. Open extension background page or service worker console.
4. Look for logged errors or warnings relevant to uBO Scope.

This can help identify extension crashes, permission issues, or other failures.

## 8. When to Seek Additional Help

If after following previous steps issues persist:

- Consult the official GitHub repository [uBO-Scope GitHub](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) for known issues and updates.
- Report your issue with detailed information including:
  - Browser name and version
  - Operating system
  - uBO Scope version
  - Exact problem description and steps to reproduce
- Browse or ask questions in community forums or the extension’s issue tracker.
