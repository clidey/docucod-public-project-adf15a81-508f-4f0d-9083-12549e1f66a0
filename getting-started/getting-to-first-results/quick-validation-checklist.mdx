# Quick Validation Checklist

Ensure your installation of uBO Scope is successful and the extension is functioning correctly with this straightforward validation checklist. These steps will guide you through verifying extension visibility, performing a live network test, and confirming expected badge behavior across browsing sessions.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Icon Visibility

The uBO Scope extension icon indicates it is installed and active in your browser toolbar.

- Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's extension area (usually near the address bar).
- The icon should be visible without any warning indicators.

<Check>
If you do not see the icon:
- Make sure the extension is enabled in your browser's extensions or add-ons page.
- Refer to the installation guide for your browser:
  - [Installing on Your Browser](/getting-started/setup-installation/installing-on-your-browser)
</Check>

## 2. Verify Badge Count on a Browsing Tab

uBO Scope uses a badge on its icon to display the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected by the current tab.

- Open any common website (e.g., https://example.com).
- Observe the badge on the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar:
  - A number represents how many distinct third-party domains the active tab connected to.
  - An empty badge means no third-party connections detected.

<Note>
A lower badge count typically indicates fewer third-party connections, which is generally desirable for privacy.
</Note>

## 3. Perform a Live Network Request Test

Test uBO Scope’s responsiveness by actively generating network requests.

### Steps:

1. Open a new browser tab with a site known for making third-party requests, such as https://news.ycombinator.com or https://www.wikipedia.org.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup panel.
3. Observe the panel updating with:
   - **Domain list counts:** Sections labeled 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' show domains and their request counts.
   - **Hostname and domain information:** Clearly displayed at the top.

### What to expect:
- The badge count on the extension icon matches the number of distinct third-party domains listed under 'not blocked'.
- Domains under 'stealth-blocked' or 'blocked' sections indicate connections that were either silently handled or blocked by the browser or content blockers.

<Check>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or no domains:
- Refresh the page to trigger new network requests.
- Confirm you are on a site with actual third-party resource requests.
</Check>

## 4. Confirm Badge Updates Across Different Pages

To ensure uBO Scope tracks each tab independently and updates badge counts correctly:

1. Navigate to several different websites in separate tabs, e.g.:
   - https://www.google.com
   - https://www.github.com
   - https://www.mozilla.org
2. For each tab, observe the badge count on the extension icon changes accurately to reflect unique third-party connections for that tab.
3. Open the popup panel in each tab to cross-check domain lists and counts.

<Note>
The extension tracks connections per active tab. Badge counts and popup data are scoped to the current tab’s network activity.
</Note>

## 5. Validate Badge Reset on Tab Close

uBO Scope automatically clears recorded data when a tab is closed.

- Open a tab, navigate to a website, and wait for the badge count to update.
- Close the tab.
- Reopen the tab or open a new tab and confirm the badge count resets and shows appropriate values for the current tab.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Badge count stays empty or does not update:**
  - Check that uBO Scope has required permissions (`webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab`).
  - Verify no conflicts with other extensions affecting network monitoring.
  - Refresh tabs or restart your browser.

- **Popup panel shows 'NO DATA':**
  - Ensure the tab is fully loaded with active network requests.
  - Try visiting different websites to generate traffic.
  - Update your browser and uBO Scope to the latest versions.

- **Badge number seems incorrect:**
  - Understand the count only reflects distinct third-party domains connected, not total requests.
  - Refer to explanations on connection categories: [Understanding Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Connections](/overview/core-concepts-and-key-ideas/domain-connection-types)
