# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

_uBO Scope_ aims to provide seamless insight into the network connections made by your browser tabs. However, some users may encounter common issues during initial setup that affect data display, badge counts, or popup behavior. This guide addresses frequent onboarding challenges and offers clear, actionable solutions to get you up and running quickly.

## 1. Badge Count Not Displaying or Always Zero

The badge on the browser toolbar should show the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected during your browsing session. If it shows no number or remains at zero, follow these steps:

### Actions:

1. **Check Extension Permissions:**
   - Confirm uBO Scope has the required permissions (`activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`). These are essential for monitoring network requests.
   - In Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, go to the extensions management page and verify permissions.

2. **Browser Compatibility and Version:**
   - Ensure your browser meets minimum version requirements:
     - Chromium: Version 122.0 or later
     - Firefox: Version 128.0 or later
     - Safari: Version 18.5 or later

3. **Verify Network Request Monitoring:**
   - The extension uses the browser’s `webRequest` API to detect network activities. If the browser or environment restricts this API (for example, in incognito/private mode without explicit permission), uBO Scope cannot detect requests.
   - Enable necessary permissions for incognito mode if you want monitoring there.

4. **Reload or Restart Browser:**
   - After installation or permission changes, restart the browser or reload the extension to apply new permissions.

5. **Visit Active Webpages:**
   - The badge updates based on active tabs with network requests. Open websites that load content from third-party servers (CDNs, analytics, ads).
   - Try visiting common sites with multiple external resources.

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- If permissions are granted but badge still does not update, disable then re-enable the extension.
- Confirm you are not using conflicting extensions blocking or restricting webRequest APIs.

## 2. Popup Panel Shows "NO DATA" or Blank Sections

When clicking the uBO Scope icon, the popup should display domains connected and categorize them as Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, or Blocked. If the popup is blank or shows "NO DATA":

### Actions:

1. **Reload the Current Tab:**
   - uBO Scope gathers data per tab. Refresh the webpage to trigger fresh network request monitoring.

2. **Wait for Data Collection:**
   - Network request data is batched and processed asynchronously, usually updating within a second.
   - If the page just loaded, wait a moment and reopen the popup.

3. **Check Browser Console for Errors:**
   - Open developer tools on the popup page to check for script errors.
   - Error logs might indicate missing resources or permission issues.

4. **Verify Active Tab Selection:**
   - uBO Scope shows data relevant to the active tab. Ensure you're viewing a tab with network traffic.

5. **Confirm the Extension Is Not Disabled or Restricted:**
   - Sometimes, corporate or security policies disable parts of extensions.
   - Check if the extension icon is grayed out or if alerts appear in the extensions panel.

6. **Test with Different Websites:**
   - Some pages block scripts or restrict calls. Open popular websites known to load third-party content.

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Clear browser cache and cookies, then reload.
- If popup.js doesn’t update, try disabling other extensions to rule out conflicts.

## 3. Permissions or Feature Limitations

### Known Constraints:
- The extension requires the `webRequest` permission to monitor network connections. If your browser disables or limits this API due to privacy settings or incognito mode, data collection may not function correctly.
- uBO Scope cannot monitor network requests made outside the browser’s webRequest API scope (e.g., non-browser native calls or routed via unusual protocols).

### Actions:
- Grant full permissions, including incognito mode access if needed:
  - In the browser extensions page, enable "Allow in incognito" or equivalent.

- Use supported browsers and updated versions to avoid API deprecations.

## 4. No Badge Number Despite Network Activity

Sometimes you know network requests are happening but the badge remains empty.

### Common Causes and Fixes:
- **Requests Are From First-Party Only:**
  uBO Scope’s badge counts distinct _third-party_ remote servers. If you only visit sites that load resources from their own domain, the badge may correctly be zero.

- **Requests Blocked Before Monitoring:**
  If network requests never reach the browser’s webRequest API because they are blocked at DNS, VPN, or OS-level firewall, uBO Scope cannot detect them.

- **Network Requests Are Non-HTTP(S)/WS:**
  Only HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS schemes are monitored. Other protocols aren't detected.

### Verify:
- Visit well-known multi-CDN sites (e.g., news portals, retail sites) and watch for badge updates.
- Disable other content blockers to see if network request reporting changes.

## 5. Extension Appears Non-Responsive or Popup Freezes

### Fixes:
- Reload the browser and extension.
- Clear the browser’s extension cache.
- Confirm that the extension files (scripts, stylesheets) are intact:
  - Extensions sometimes fail due to corrupted or partial installs.
- Try reinstalling the extension from the official store.

## Appendix: Quick Troubleshooting Commands for Developers

If you wish to diagnose issues yourself, you can check in the browser's developer console:

```javascript
// Check if permission to use webRequest is available
navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'webRequest' }).then(console.log).catch(console.error);

// Test that the active tab data can be queried by the extension's background script
browser.runtime.sendMessage({ what: 'getTabData', tabId: currentTabId }).then(console.log).catch(console.error);
```

# Appendix

### Popup Sections Explained

- **Allowed:** Domains for which connections were successful and not blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections attempted but blocked stealthily (e.g., redirects).
- **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked requests.

Understanding these helps diagnose why data might be missing or counts low.
