# Checking Network Connections with uBO Scope

This guide helps you understand and interpret the network activity information uBO Scope provides. You'll learn how to visit a website, open the uBO Scope popup interface, read connection summaries, and make sense of the toolbar badge count.

---

## 1. Accessing uBO Scope on a Webpage

To begin analyzing network connections for a website:

1. **Open your browser** where uBO Scope is installed (supported browsers include Chrome, Firefox, and Safari).
2. **Navigate to any website** you want to analyze. For instance, visit `https://example.com`.
3. After the page loads, **click the uBO Scope toolbar icon** near your browser's address bar.

<u>What happens next:</u> The uBO Scope popup will open, reporting the network activity related to the currently active tab.

<Info>
If this is your first visit to the site after launching the browser or installing uBO Scope, allow a moment for data to collect and display.

## 2. Understanding the uBO Scope Popup Interface

The popup shows a summary and detailed breakdown of all third-party remote server connections that the current webpage attempted or successfully made.

### Popup Sections Explained:

- **Hostname & Domain Header**: Displays the base domain and any subdomain of the active tab, decoded for readability.

- **Summary Section**: Shows the total number of distinct third-party domains with network activity reported.

- **Connection Outcome Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains where connections were successful and not blocked.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were redirected stealthily without blocking indicators.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where connection attempts were actively blocked.

Each outcome section lists domains along with how many requests were made.

<Check>
Remember, a lower count in "not blocked" suggests fewer third-party connections, which often aligns with stronger privacy.
</Check>

## 3. Interpreting the Toolbar Badge Count

The uBO Scope toolbar icon badge indicates the **number of unique third-party domains successfully connected** from the current tab.

- A **higher badge count** means the webpage connected to many distinct third parties.
- A **zero or no badge** means no external third-party servers connected or allowed.

<Tip>
The badge count reflects *allowed* connections only, not blocked or stealth-blocked connections.
This helps you focus on actual external data flows.
</Tip>

## 4. Real-World Usage Example

Say you open `https://newsportal.com` and click the uBO Scope icon:

- The popup header shows the domain `newsportal.com`.
- The summary reads "domains connected: 12".
- Under **not blocked**, you see domains like `cdn.example.net` (22 requests), `analytics.site.org` (3 requests).
- **Stealth-blocked** might list `tracker.badsite.com` (1 request).
- **Blocked** could list `ads.someserver.com` (5 requests).

This tells you that the website successfully loaded resources from 12 distinct third-party domains, blocked some known ad servers, and detected stealthy redirects.

## 5. Best Practices & Tips

- Visit multiple pages on the same site to observe changes in third-party connections.
- Use the badge count as a quick indicator of connection volume.
- Complement this data with your content blockerâ€™s interface for holistic insight.

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- If no data appears, ensure uBO Scope is properly installed and permissions are granted.
- Network activity is only tracked per active tab; switching tabs changes the displayed data.
- Some connections might be transient; refreshing the page updates the report.

## 7. Troubleshooting

If you see empty data or inconsistent counts:

- Confirm the extension is enabled and browser meets minimum version requirements.
- Reload the tab manually and open the popup again.
- Check if other extensions interfere by disabling them temporarily.
- Review permissions granted to uBO Scope (especially `webRequest` and host permissions).
