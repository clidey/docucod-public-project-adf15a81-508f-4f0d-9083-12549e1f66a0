# Supported Browsers & System Requirements

Understanding which browsers and operating systems support uBO Scope is essential for a seamless installation and effective use. This guide outlines compatibility details, required permissions, and critical notes about the foundational `webRequest` API.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with major browsers that implement the WebExtensions API and expose the `webRequest` API with sufficient capabilities. Below are the supported browsers with relevant details:

| Browser      | Supported Versions                      | Notes                                                        |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chrome**   | Version 122.0 and above                | Requires Manifest V3 support. Uses `service_worker` background|
| **Firefox**  | Version 128.0 and above                | Compatible with desktop and Android Firefox                   |
| **Safari**   | Version 18.5 and above (Safari Web Extensions) | Requires official Web Extension support                      |


> All supported browsers must have access to the `webRequest` API that monitors HTTP and WebSocket network requests.


## 2. Supported Operating Systems

As a browser extension, uBO Scope's operating system support is inherently tied to the browsers themselves. It supports any OS where the supported browsers run, including:

- **Windows** (all recent versions that support the target browser versions)
- **macOS** (compatible with Safari 18.5+, Chrome, and Firefox)
- **Linux** (supports compatible versions of Chrome and Firefox)
- **Android** (Firefox for Android, version 128.0 and above)


## 3. Required Permissions

During installation and operation, uBO Scope requests specific permissions to function as intended:

- **`webRequest`**: To observe and measure network requests made by the browser.
- **`storage`**: To save session state and cached data such as the Public Suffix List.
- **`activeTab`**: To interact with the active browser tab's network details.
- **Host permissions**: 
  - URLs such as `https://*/*` and `http://*/*` (plus `wss://*/*` and `ws://*/*` for Firefox and Chromium) to capture requests across all web origins.

<Note>
Make sure to grant these permissions during installation. Insufficient permissions will limit or prevent uBO Scope from accurately reporting network request outcomes.
</Note>


## 4. Important Notes About the `webRequest` API

uBO Scope relies heavily on the browser’s `webRequest` API. Understanding its impact is crucial for users:

- The extension listens to network requests including HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket secure (wss), and WebSocket (ws) schemes depending on browser support.
- Some browsers limit `webRequest` access depending on policies, privacy settings, or extension installation methods.
- Network requests made outside the scope of the `webRequest` API (e.g., specific browser internals or certain proxy configurations) are NOT visible to uBO Scope.

<Warning>
If your browser or environment restricts access to the `webRequest` API, uBO Scope will be unable to report network connections correctly. Review browser policy or security settings if expected functionality is missing.
</Warning>


## 5. Browser-Specific Manifest and Background Script Notes

- **Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.)** use Manifest V3 with a **service worker** running the background script: `/js/background.js`.
- **Firefox** also supports Manifest V3 with a module-type background script, ensuring compatibility with latest standards.
- **Safari** requires strict minimum version 18.5 and uses a module-type background script for smooth operation.

These differences are handled internally and do not require user intervention but should be noted for troubleshooting or advanced configuration.


## 6. Verifying Browser Compatibility

To confirm your browser supports uBO Scope:

1. Ensure your browser version meets the minimum specified above.
2. Confirm you can install extensions from official addon stores (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons).
3. Check that the extension requests the permissions listed in Section 3 during installation.


## 7. Troubleshooting Supported Browser Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Browser Compatibility Issues"> 
<Accordion title="Extension Fails to Install or Enable"> 
- Ensure your browser version is up to date.
- Use official stores or developer mode only with trusted sources.
- Confirm that the browser supports Manifest V3 and WebExtensions API.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network Requests Do Not Show Up"> 
- Confirm the `webRequest` permission was granted.
- Check if content blockers or browser privacy settings restrict network monitoring.
- Verify your browser is not configured to limit extensions' network event capabilities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Shows No Data or No Updates"> 
- Reload the page or browser and try again.
- Make sure the browser is not blocking background scripts.
- Verify that the network requests you are testing generate observable traffic.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 8. Summary

uBO Scope supports Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, and Safari 18.5+, running on any OS those browsers support. It requires explicit permissions—especially `webRequest` and host permissions—to function effectively. Understanding the pivotal role of the `webRequest` API ensures proper installation and troubleshooting.
