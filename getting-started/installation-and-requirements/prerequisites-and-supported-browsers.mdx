# Prerequisites & Supported Browsers

Ensure your system and browser environment are compatible with uBO Scope before installing. This page details the supported operating systems, required browser versions, permissions needed, and any browser-specific considerations to guarantee a smooth setup and optimal usage.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

uBO Scope supports all major operating systems where supported browsers run, including:

- **Windows** (10 and newer recommended)
- **macOS** (recent versions; macOS 11 or later is best)
- **Linux** (modern distributions supporting Chromium or Firefox)
- **iOS/iPadOS** for Safari browsers supporting Safari web extensions (see Safari section below)

This coverage aligns with compatible browser versions detailed below.

## 2. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to provide live insights into third-party network requests. It supports the following browsers and minimum versions:

| Browser   | Minimum Version | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Chromium** (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge) | 122.0+          | Requires Manifest V3 support and webRequest API availability. |
| **Mozilla Firefox** | 128.0+          | Supports desktop and Android Firefox with full feature support. |
| **Safari** | 18.5+           | Supports Safari on macOS and iOS/iPadOS with Safari Web Extension support.

> **Note:** These minimum versions ensure compatibility with Manifest Version 3 requirements and the necessary browser APIs uBO Scope relies on.

## 3. Required Extension Permissions

uBO Scope requests the following permissions to function correctly:

- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to interact with the currently active browser tab.
- **storage**: Enables saving and loading extension settings and session data.
- **webRequest**: Monitors HTTP and WebSocket network requests your browser makes.

Additionally, uBO Scope declares host permissions to monitor network requests on all URLs with:

- `http://*/*`
- `https://*/*`
- `ws://*/*` (WebSocket, Chromium & Firefox only)
- `wss://*/*` (WebSocket Secure, Chromium & Firefox only)

> These permissions are fundamental because uBO Scope tracks all third-party connections initiated by pages in real time.

## 4. Browser-Specific Details & Considerations

### Chromium-based Browsers

- Requires minimum Chrome version 122.
- Uses Manifest Version 3 with a service worker background script.
- WebSocket monitoring is supported.

### Mozilla Firefox

- Minimum Firefox version 128.
- Supports desktop and Android environments.
- Uses Manifest Version 3 but relies on a module background script.
- WebSocket monitoring is enabled.

### Safari

- Minimum Safari version 18.5.
- Uses Manifest Version 3 with a module background script.
- Does **not** monitor WebSocket connections due to current API limitations.
- Installation is through Safari Extensions via the App Store or developer-sideloading.

## 5. Network Requirements

- The extension listens to browser network events via the `webRequest` API.
- No additional firewall or proxy configuration is typically necessary.
- Ensure that your browser is permitted to monitor web requests and WebSocket connections.

## 6. Verification Checklist Before Installation

- Confirm your browser version meets or exceeds the required minimum listed above.
- Verify your operating system supports your browser version.
- Understand and accept the permissions uBO Scope needs to provide its functionality.
- On Safari, ensure you have enabled Safari Web Extensions support.

<Tip>
Running the latest stable version of your browser is strongly recommended for maximum compatibility and security.

## Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

- If the extension icon does not appear after installation, verify the browser version and permissions.
- For WebSocket connection reporting absence on Safari, understand this is a known limitation tied to browser API support.
- If encountering permission errors, review extension permissions in your browserâ€™s extensions/settings page.

<Warning>
Do not attempt to force-install uBO Scope on unsupported browser versions; this can cause extension failures or unpredictable behavior.
</Warning>
