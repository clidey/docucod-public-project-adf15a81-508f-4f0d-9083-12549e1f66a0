# First Launch and Initial Configuration

Welcome to your first experience with uBO Scope! This guide walks you through opening the uBO Scope popup from your browser toolbar, familiarizing yourself with the initial view, identifying interactive elements, and understanding your immediate options. Designed for simplicity and instant value, uBO Scope requires no complex setup — just open and start seeing live network connection details.

---

## 1. Accessing the uBO Scope Popup

The uBO Scope extension integrates smoothly as a browser toolbar icon in Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers. Here's how to access it:

### Steps to open the popup:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon** in your browser's toolbar. It displays the extension’s logo (a shield icon) and may show a numeric badge representing active third-party connections.

2. **Click the icon once** to open the uBO Scope popup. This popup reveals the current tab's network connection data.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the icon immediately, check your browser extension menu or pin it to the toolbar for easier access.
</Tip>

## 2. What You See on First Open

When you open uBO Scope for the first time, expect a clean, intuitive interface designed to deliver actionable insights at a glance.

### Popup interface elements:

- **Tab Hostname Header**: At the top, you'll see the hostname of the active tab or a "NO DATA" message if the extension hasn't recorded any network activity yet.

- **Domains Connected Summary**: Shows the total count of distinct third-party domains your current tab has connected to.

- **Outcome Sections**: Three categorized lists display domains grouped by connection outcome:
  - **Not Blocked** (allowed): Domains successfully contacted without blocking.
  - **Stealth-Blocked** (stealth): Domains where connections were silently redirected or altered.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where connection attempts failed or were explicitly blocked.

- **Domain Rows**: Each section lists domains with a small badge showing how many requests or connections were made to that domain.

### Visual overview:

```plaintext
+--------------------------------------------------+
| [Hostname or NO DATA]                            |
| domains connected: [count]                       |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| not blocked                                      |
|   example.com     [5]                            |
|   cdn.example.net [3]                            |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| stealth-blocked                                  |
|   tracker.example.com [2]                        |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| blocked                                          |
|   ads.example.org [7]                            |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

## 3. Interactive Elements and User Options

uBO Scope is intentionally minimalistic and focused. When first opened, you will mostly interact with the following elements:

- **Popup Refresh**: The data refreshes automatically reflecting current tab activity—no manual refresh is needed.

- **Domains in Lists**: Domain names act as informative labels only; clicking them currently does not perform actions (no settings or detail drill-down yet).

- **Toolbar Icon Badge**: Updates in real-time to show the number of distinct allowed third-party domains connected per tab. A lower count indicates fewer third-party contacts, generally better for privacy.

### Configuration Options

- **None on first launch.**

uBO Scope requires no initial user configuration; all necessary permissions and monitoring start immediately upon installation and browser activity.

<Tip>
This simplicity ensures you start seeing third-party connection data without distraction or complex setup.
</Tip>

## 4. Understanding Immediate Utility

Right after your first launch, uBO Scope provides value by:

- **Showing real-time network connection counts** per browsing tab.
- **Classifying network outcomes** clearly so you understand which connections were blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed.
- **Helping you quickly assess privacy exposure** on websites, highlighting the quantity and nature of third-party domains contacted.

For example, if your browser visits a news site and the toolbar badge shows "12," uBO Scope is telling you that 12 distinct third-party domains were contacted—some may serve content, ads, or tracking scripts.

## 5. Troubleshooting First Launch

### No Data Displayed or Badge Empty?

- Confirm the extension is enabled in your browser.
- Ensure you have visited at least one website after installation to generate network data.
- Some pages (like new tab or internal browser pages) provide no network activity accessible to extensions.

<Tip>
Switch to a typical website (e.g., https://example.com) and open the popup again to see if data populates.
</Tip>

### Toolbar Icon Missing?

- Check your browser’s extension management to verify uBO Scope is installed and not disabled.
- Pin the icon to the toolbar if your browser supports hiding other extensions.

### Badge Counts Not Updating?

- Wait a few seconds after loading pages as data processing happens asynchronously.
- Reload the current tab to generate new network requests.
