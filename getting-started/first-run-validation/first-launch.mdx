# Launching uBO Scope

After installing uBO Scope in your browser, the next step is to understand how to open the extension, read its toolbar badge indicator, and access the popup interface to start monitoring remote server connections. This guide walks you through those initial interactions so you can immediately begin leveraging uBO Scope’s transparency into your browser’s network activity.

---

## 1. Accessing uBO Scope After Installation

uBO Scope installs as a browser extension available from your browser’s toolbar. Follow these steps to locate and open it:

1. **Locate the Toolbar Icon**
   - After installation, find the uBO Scope icon in your browser's extension area, near the address bar.
   - The icon resembles the product logo and is labeled 'uBO Scope' on hover.

2. **Pin the Icon for Easy Access (Optional but Recommended)**
   - In browsers like Chrome or Firefox, you may need to pin the extension icon to the toolbar:
     - Click the extensions menu (puzzle piece icon).
     - Click the pin next to uBO Scope to keep it visible at all times.

3. **Open the Extension’s Popup Interface**
   - Click the uBO Scope icon. This opens a popup window providing detailed information about network connections for the active browser tab.

<Check>
Verify that your browser shows the uBO Scope icon and that clicking it opens a popup labeled "uBO-Scope" with sections for connection outcomes.
</Check>

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge Indicator

The toolbar icon’s badge displays a number representing **the count of distinct third-party remote servers with which your browser connected during the current tab session**.

### What the Badge Indicates:

- **Number Shown:** The count of unique third-party domains that had successful connections.
- **No Number (Empty Badge):** Indicates either no third-party remote server connections detected yet, or none present for the active tab.

### Why the Badge Matters:

- A **lower badge count is better**, signaling fewer third-party remote servers contacted.
- The badge helps you **quickly gauge your exposure** to various remote servers while browsing.

### Important Notes:

- The badge only counts distinct domains, **not individual requests**.
- It does not count first-party or main site domains.
- Stealth-blocked or fully blocked connections do NOT increment the badge count.

<Info>
If the badge is unusually high on a website, it indicates numerous third-party servers are involved. This can guide privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers in their investigations.

## 3. Opening and Using the uBO Scope Popup Interface

The popup interface is your main window into what uBO Scope observes. Here’s how to use it when you open it:

### Popup Layout Overview:

- **Hostname Header:** Shows the hostname of the current tab and its root domain in Unicode.
- **Summary Section:** Displays total count of distinct connected third-party domains.
- **Outcome Sections:** Three categories showing domains grouped by connection outcome:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains whose requests were silently redirected or stealth-blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Domains whose requests were blocked by the content blocker.

### How to Interpret the Popup:

1. **Check the Header:** Confirms which site you are inspecting.
2. **Review the Summary:** Quickly see how many distinct third-party domains your browser contacted.
3. **Explore Outcome Sections:** Each section lists domains along with the count of requests made.

### Practical Example:

Suppose you visit a news website:
- The popup might show **Not Blocked** with domains like CDN providers.
- The **Stealth-blocked** section could list trackers silently redirected.
- The **Blocked** section might include domains prevented by content blockers.

This immediate visibility helps you understand the extent and nature of remote connections for your current tab.

## 4. Best Practices for First Use

- **Visit a few different websites** and open the popup to see how connection patterns differ.
- **Observe the badge count** as you browse to intuitively understand third-party exposure.
- **Don’t rely solely on badge numbers** but review the domains listed in the popup for context.
- **Use uBO Scope alongside uBlock Origin** or other content blockers to correlate blocking actions.

<Warning>
Because uBO Scope depends on the browser’s `webRequest` API to detect connections, it may not report network requests made outside the browser or by specialized apps.
</Warning>

## 5. Troubleshooting Initial Launch

If you do not see the uBO Scope icon or the popup does not show data:

- **Verify Installation:** Ensure the extension is properly installed by checking your browser’s extension manager.
- **Reload the Tab:** Sometimes refreshing the active tab repopulates connection data.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Confirm you are running a compatible browser version:
  - Chromium-based browsers v122+
  - Firefox v128+
  - Safari v18.5+
- **Permissions:** Ensure the extension has necessary permissions to monitor network requests.

If issues persist, consult the Troubleshooting guides linked below.

### Example Interaction Flow

```plaintext
User installs uBO Scope extension → finds uBO Scope icon in toolbar → clicks icon to open popup → sees badge number on icon indicating number of connected third-party domains → reviews detailed domain lists grouped by connection outcome in the popup → refreshes browser tabs to update data → uses insights to verify content blocker effectiveness.
```

---

### Callout: What the Badge Does Not Reflect

- The badge does not count requests made outside the browser.
- Badge count is distinct domain count, **not** total number of requests.
- Block count in other extensions may differ due to different detection methods; uBO Scope focuses on distinct domains.

By following these steps and guidelines, you will have uBO Scope up and running effectively, providing actionable insights into your browsing network activity from day one.
