# Validating That uBO Scope Is Working

Ensuring that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browser’s network connections is essential to gaining real-time visibility into third-party domains contacted during your browsing sessions. This guide walks you through how to interpret the extension's toolbar badge, understand the popup interface, and perform basic validation actions to confirm correct setup.

---

## 1. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

- The toolbar badge on the uBO Scope icon displays a count representing the **number of distinct third-party domains** with which your active tab has successfully connected.
- A **lower badge count is preferable**, indicating fewer third-party connections.
- If the badge is **empty**, it means no third-party network connections have been detected or recorded for the current tab.

### How the Badge Reflects Connection Outcomes

- Only **allowed** third-party domains contribute to the badge count.
- Domains involved in blocked or stealth-blocked requests do **not** increase the badge count.

<Check>
Keep in mind that the badge count updates dynamically as you browse and reflects connection activity in the current active browser tab.
</Check>

## 2. Using the Popup Interface to Inspect Network Connections

Clicking the uBO Scope icon opens the popup, providing a detailed breakdown of network domains contacted by the active tab.

### Popup Components Explained:

- **Hostname header**: Shows the main hostname of the active tab. If the hostname differs from its registered domain (public suffix-based domain), the UI displays both parts.
- **Domains Connected Summary**: Displays the total count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- Three sections for connection outcomes:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains for which network requests were allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains intercepted by stealth blocking (e.g., redirects or hidden blocking). These do not add to the badge count.
  - **Blocked**: Domains for which connections were blocked.

Each domain entry includes:
- The third-party domain name (translated from punycode to Unicode when necessary).
- A count badge showing how many connections to that domain occurred.

<Info>
The popup provides immediate transparency on network activity passing through your browser for the active tab without requiring any initial configuration.

## 3. Performing Basic Validation Steps

Follow these straightforward steps to confirm uBO Scope is functioning correctly:

<Steps>
<Step title='Verify the Toolbar Icon is Present'>
Ensure the uBO Scope icon appears on your browser toolbar after installation.
If it is missing, revisit the installation process.
</Step>
<Step title='Open uBO Scope Popup'>
Click the extension icon.
You should see a popup with a hostname header and three outcome sections.
Initially, "NO DATA" may appear if no network activity has been recorded.
</Step>
<Step title='Visit a Web Page'>
Navigate to a website (e.g., https://example.com).
Wait a few seconds for the page to load fully to allow network requests.
</Step>
<Step title='Refresh the uBO Scope Popup'>
After the page loads, click the extension icon again.
You should see:
- The hostname or domain of the visited page.
- A summary count of domains connected.
- Lists of domains grouped by outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).
</Step>
<Step title='Examine the Badge Count'>
Observe the toolbar badge number when the tab is active.
It should match the count in the popup’s “domains connected” summary.
</Step>
<Step title='Test with Different Websites'>
Repeat with multiple websites.
You should notice the badge and popup updating dynamically with new third-party domains.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
• If the popup remains empty or the badge never updates, check browser permissions and ensure the extension has access to webRequest data as documented.
• Disabling other extensions temporarily helps rule out conflicts interfering with network monitoring.
</Tip>

## 4. Example Validation Scenario

Imagine visiting a news website. After loading:

- You open uBO Scope’s popup to see:
  - Main tab hostname listed (e.g., `news.example.com`).
  - Summary shows 5 domains connected.
  - "Not Blocked" shows domains like `cdn.example.net` and `analytics.example.org` with their request counts.
  - "Blocked" and "Stealth-blocked" may list known trackers or ad servers.

- The toolbar badge shows "5" matching the popup's summary.

This confirms uBO Scope is actively monitoring and reporting third-party network interactions in real time.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues">
<Accordion title='Toolbar Badge Doesn’t Appear or Update'>
- Make sure the extension is enabled in your browser.
- Verify all permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`) are granted.
- Try reloading the current tab after installing the extension.
- Disable other extensions temporarily to check for interference.
- Review console logs via browser developer tools for possible errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title='Popup Shows "NO DATA" Continuously'>
- Confirm network activity is occurring (try navigating web pages with rich third-party content).
- Ensure the browser version meets minimum requirements (Chrome ≥ 122, Firefox ≥ 128, Safari ≥ 18.5).
- Restart the browser to allow the extension’s background processes to initialize properly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title='Counts Mismatch Between Badge and Popup'>
- The badge counts distinct _allowed_ domains only.
- The popup shows full breakdown including stealth-blocked and blocked domains.
- Ensure you are viewing the popup while the tab is active.
- Reload the popup to refresh data consistency.
</Accordion>
