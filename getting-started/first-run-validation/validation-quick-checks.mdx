# Quick Validation: Is It Working?

Ensure your uBO Scope extension is up and running correctly by following these swift, actionable checks. This page guides you through verifying the presence of the toolbar icon, monitoring badge count updates, and confirming that the popup data accurately reflects real-time network activity on the sites you visit. By completing these validations, you'll gain confidence that uBO Scope is actively capturing and reporting third-party connections within your browser.

---

## 1. Verify Toolbar Icon Presence

The first sign that uBO Scope is operational is the presence of its distinctive toolbar icon in your browser’s extension area.

### Steps:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar:
   - It’s identified by the extension’s logo (refer to the official icons shown in the installation guide).
2. If the icon is not visible:
   - For Chromium-based browsers, check the extensions menu (puzzle piece icon) and pin uBO Scope so it always shows.
   - For Firefox or Safari, ensure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions/add-ons manager.

<Check>
If you cannot locate the toolbar icon after installation, revisit the installation instructions for your specific browser to ensure proper setup.
</Check>

## 2. Observe Badge Count Behavior

uBO Scope displays a badge number on its toolbar icon representing the count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the webpage you are browsing.

### Steps:

1. Open any website that naturally loads external content (e.g., a news site or popular social platform).
2. Watch the badge count on the uBO Scope icon:
   - A non-zero badge indicates detected third-party network connections.
   - A blank badge means no third-party connections were observed on the active tab.
3. Navigate between different tabs and observe how the badge count updates according to each page's network activity.

<Note>
The badge count reflects **allowed connections** — third-party servers that the page successfully contacted.
</Note>

## 3. Open and Inspect the Popup Data

The uBO Scope popup provides categorized details about third-party remote servers and their connection outcomes.

### Steps:

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup UI.
2. Review these key elements:
   - **Hostname and domain header:** Identifies the active tab’s top-level site.
   - **Domains connected count:** Shows the total number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
   - **Categorized domain lists:** Separate lists for domains that were **not blocked (allowed)**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
3. Confirm that the domain listings reflect activity on the page:
   - Visit known sites with varied third-party content (for example, popular news websites often have ads or analytics).
   - The popup should list several domains corresponding to real remote servers contacted.

<Check>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or no domains despite browsing content-rich websites, the extension may not be capturing network requests correctly. Proceed to troubleshooting or reinstall.
</Check>

## 4. Sample Tasks to Confirm Functionality

Use the following simple tasks to test uBO Scope's monitoring capabilities in a realistic setting.

### Task 1: Visit a popular website

1. Navigate to https://example.com or any news website.
2. Observe the badge count on the toolbar icon – it should update shortly.
3. Open the popup and verify a list of 3rd-party domains appears.

### Task 2: Open a new tab to a blank page

1. Open a new tab (e.g., about:blank).
2. Check the badge count – it should be empty.
3. Open the popup and ensure it indicates no data or zero domains.

### Task 3: Refresh a page repeatedly

1. Reload the same webpage several times.
2. Observe the badge count reflecting consistent third-party domains.

<Info>
Repeating page loads helps verify that the extension persistently tracks network activity and updates correctly.

## Troubleshooting Quick Tips

- If the badge count never updates:
  - Confirm the extension has required browser permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`).
  - Restart your browser to reload the extension.
  - Disable conflicting extensions that might interfere with webRequest API.
- If the popup shows no data:
  - Refresh the page after opening the popup.
  - Try navigating to a popular site with known external connections.

Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../first-run-validation/troubleshooting-setup) guide for detailed help.
