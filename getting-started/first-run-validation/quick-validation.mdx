# Quick Validation Steps

Ensure uBO Scope is correctly installed and functioning by running this simple example workflow. This guide helps you quickly verify badge counts, observe remote server connections on a sample webpage, and confirm that reporting operates independently from other content blockers. Follow these practical steps to validate your extension's operation immediately after installation.

---

## 1. Confirm Toolbar Badge Count Behavior

The toolbar icon badge displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser has connected to.

### Steps:

1. Open your browser where uBO Scope is installed.
2. Look at the uBO Scope toolbar icon:
   - A number badge should appear showing the count of unique allowed third-party domains for the active tab.
   - If there's no badge, it likely means no network connections have been made or tracked yet.

### What to expect:

- The badge count updates in real-time as you load webpages that make network requests.
- Lower numbers generally indicate fewer third-party connections, which is better for privacy.

<Tip>
If the badge never appears after loading websites, ensure uBO Scope has necessary permissions and is enabled. See the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](getting-started/first-run-validation/common-issues-solutions) guide for help.
</Tip>

## 2. Observe Remote Server Connections on a Sample Webpage

To verify uBO Scope correctly reports network activities, access a webpage that loads resources from diverse servers.

### Steps:

1. Navigate to a site known for third-party content (e.g., a news site or popular blog).
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup interface.
3. In the popup, examine three sections:
   - **Not Blocked**: Domains from which resources were successfully loaded.
   - **Stealth-blocked**: Domains with redirected or stealth-blocked requests.
   - **Blocked**: Domains for which requests were blocked.
4. Observe the count and domains displayed to verify that connections are tracked.

### What to expect:

- The popup lists domains grouped by their connection status.
- The summary shows the total distinct domains detected.
- Domains appear decoded to their Unicode representation for clarity.

<Callout>
Notice that uBO Scope tracks connections regardless of other content blockers active in your browser.

## 3. Ensure Reporting Works Independently of Other Content Blockers

uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to report network request outcomes independently.

### Steps:

1. With uBO Scope installed alongside other content blockers, load several webpages.
2. Check that uBO Scope's badge and popup correctly reflect network connections.
3. Disable other content blockers temporarily and reload pages.
4. Confirm uBO Scope's reporting remains consistent.

### What to expect:

- uBO Scope's counts and lists remain accurate with or without other blockers enabled.
- It reports blocked, stealth-blocked, and allowed connections even if DNS or other mechanisms block requests externally.

<Tip>
Troubleshooting steps if results seem incorrect:
- Reload the page to refresh data.
- Ensure uBO Scope has the required "webRequest", "activeTab", and "storage" permissions.
- Verify you are using a supported browser version (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Quick Validation

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled in your browser's extension settings.
- Reload your active tab to refresh network data.
- Check browser version compatibility.
- Verify that uBO Scope has permission to access active tabs and web requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or 'NO DATA'">
- Refresh the webpage you are inspecting.
- Confirm uBO Scope's background process is running.
- Try disabling other extensions that might interfere (rare but possible).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Connections Not Matching Expectations">
- Remember the badge counts distinct third-party domains, not the number of requests.
- Some connections may be stealth-blocked or blocked due to external factors.
- Refer to detailed domain status explanations in [Reading Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Domains](guides/interpreting-data/reading-status).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding the Output

- **Badge Number:** Shows how many unique third-party domains had allowed connections for the current page.
- **Popup Sections:**
   - *Not Blocked*: Domains that successfully loaded content.
   - *Stealth-blocked*: Domains blocked via redirects or stealth blocking.
   - *Blocked*: Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.
- **Domain Representation:** Domains are translated from ASCII/punycode to Unicode for readability.

## Next Steps

- After confirming your installation is working, proceed to explore more insights by visiting [Reading Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Domains](guides/interpreting-data/reading-status) to better understand connection statuses.
- Use [Making Sense of Toolbar Badge Counts](guides/interpreting-data/badge-counts-meaning) to grasp what the different badge counts imply for your privacy.
- For issues during initial validation, consult [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](getting-started/first-run-validation/common-issues-solutions).
