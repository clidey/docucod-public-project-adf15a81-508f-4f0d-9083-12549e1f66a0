# Quick Validation & Core Functionality

Ensure uBO Scope is actively tracking network requests for your browser tabs by following this straightforward guide. This section walks you through interpreting the toolbar badge count, opening the popup interface, and understanding the categories of network outcomes reported.

---

## 1. Viewing the Toolbar Badge Count

The toolbar icon for uBO Scope provides a real-time count of distinct third-party remote servers connected by your current tab.

### Steps:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
2. Observe the badge number displayed on the icon:
   - This number represents the **count of distinct third-party domains** with active or recent network connections for the current tab.
   - A lower badge count generally indicates fewer external third-party connections, which often means better privacy.
3. If the badge is empty, there are no third-party connections identified for the active tab.

### Important Notes:
- The badge count **does not measure blocked requests**; instead, it counts the number of allowed distinct third-party domains.
- Content blockers or DNS filters on your system may affect these counts, but uBO Scope reports accurately as long as the browser exposes the network requests.

<Check>
Always verify you are looking at the active tab, as the badge count is tab-specific.
</Check>

## 2. Opening and Using the uBO Scope Popup Interface

The popup gives you a detailed view of all network connections initiated by the current tab, grouped by their outcome.

### Steps:

1. Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
2. The popup will open, showing:
   - **Tab Hostname**: The primary domain of the currently active tab.
   - **Domains Connected**: Total count of distinct domains contacted.
   - Three sections listing domains by their request outcome:
     - **Not Blocked** (`allowed`) — connections permitted.
     - **Stealth-Blocked** (`stealth`) — connections silently blocked by stealth techniques.
     - **Blocked** (`blocked`) — connections explicitly blocked.
3. Domains are displayed with a count badge indicating how many requests were made to each domain.

### Reading the Sections:

- **Allowed:** These domains fetched resources successfully or connections were allowed.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** These domains represent requests silently blocked without alerting the webpage or affecting functionality.
- **Blocked:** These domains had requests explicitly denied or failed due to errors.

### Tips:
- Use the popup frequently to gain insight into your browsing activity and third-party connections.
- The popup UI adapts responsively if your browser window is narrow, ensuring full visibility of data.

## 3. Understanding Network Request Outcomes

uBO Scope tracks three key connection outcomes for network requests from your tabs:

| Outcome          | Description                                                                |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Allowed**      | Requests that successfully connected or were permitted by filters.         |
| **Blocked**      | Requests that failed due to blocking or errors (e.g., filter block, error).|
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Requests silently blocked using stealth methods to avoid webpage disruption. |

<u>All outcomes are tab-specific and presented clearly in the popup by domain.</u>

### Practical Scenario:
If you visit a news site, the toolbar badge shows how many unique third-party servers the page connected to, and the popup lets you explore which domains were allowed, which were blocked, and which were stealth-blocked.

## 4. Validating uBO Scope Operation

To confirm that uBO Scope is active and correctly tracking requests:

<Steps>
<Step title="Load a website">
Navigate to any website in your browser.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe badge changes">
Watch the badge count on the uBO Scope icon update to reflect distinct third-party connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Open popup">
Click the toolbar icon to open the popup and review the detailed domain lists for allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret results">
Verify the domain names and counts correlate with your browsing experience.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
A non-updating badge or empty popup likely means the extension is not tracking requests. Revisit installation or permissions if this occurs.
</Note>

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **No badge or empty popup**:
  - Ensure uBO Scope has proper permissions in your browser.
  - Confirm you are using a supported browser version (Chromium v122+, Firefox v128+, Safari v18.5+).
  - Try refreshing the tab or restarting the browser.

- **Unexpected high badge count**:
  - Many legitimate sites use multiple CDNs or third-party services; a high count is not necessarily a security threat but a sign of numerous external connections.

- **Popup shows no domains despite browsing**:
  - Content blocking through DNS or other external mechanisms out of the browser's webRequest API scope may prevent accurate reporting.

## 6. Next Steps

- After verifying the extension is working:
  - Explore the [What is uBO Scope?](/overview/introduction-and-value/product-purpose) page to understand full product benefits.
  - Consult [Launching uBO Scope](/getting-started/first-run-validation/first-launch) for detailed info on initial usage.
  - Visit the [Troubleshooting First Run](/getting-started/setup-help/validation-issues) page if you encounter issues.
