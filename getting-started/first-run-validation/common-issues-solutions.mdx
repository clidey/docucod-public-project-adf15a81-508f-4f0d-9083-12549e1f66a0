# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

If you have encountered difficulties during the installation or initial setup of **uBO Scope**, this guide is here to help you quickly identify and resolve the most frequent problems. This page addresses common issues such as permission denials, browser incompatibilities, and missing toolbar badge icons, providing straightforward solutions to get you up and running without delay.

---

## 1. Extension Permissions Issues

### Problem
The extension cannot monitor network requests or update the badge count, often due to missing or denied permissions.

### Solution
- **Verify Extension Permissions:** uBO Scope requires access to the `webRequest` API, `storage`, and active tab permissions.
- **Check Browser Prompts:** After installation, browsers may prompt you to grant permissions. Accept all requests.
- **Review Extension Settings:**
  1. Open your browser's extension management page.
  2. Locate uBO Scope.
  3. Confirm it has permissions to access URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
- **Reinstall if Necessary:** If permissions appear correct but issues persist, try removing and reinstalling the extension.

<Note>
Permissions are foundational for uBO Scope’s operation. Without them, the extension cannot listen to network traffic or display meaningful data.
</Note>

## 2. Browser Compatibility and Version Requirements

### Problem
The extension fails to install or function correctly due to an unsupported browser or outdated browser version.

### Solution
- **Supported Browsers:**
  - Chromium-based browsers, version 122 or later.
  - Firefox, version 128 or later.
  - Safari, version 18.5 or later.
- **Check Browser Version:**
  1. Go to your browser's About page to view the current version.
  2. Update your browser if it does not meet the minimum version requirements.
- **Use Official Stores:** Install uBO Scope only from official browser extension stores to ensure compatibility and security.

<Warning>
Older browser versions or alternative distributions might not support all required APIs, causing unreliable operation.
</Warning>

## 3. Missing Toolbar Badge or Popup Malfunction

### Problem
After installation, the uBO Scope icon appears on the toolbar but does not show badge counts or the popup page fails to load data.

### Solution
- **Confirm Extension is Enabled:** Disable and re-enable uBO Scope to reset its state.
- **Reload Current Tab:**
  - The badge count updates dynamically based on current tab activity. Reload the page to trigger network request monitoring.
- **Check for Conflicts:**
  - Disable other extensions that might interfere with webRequest API or browser action badges.
- **Clear Extension Storage:**
  1. Go to browser extension settings.
  2. Clear local storage/data for uBO Scope.
  3. Reload the extension or browser.
- **Inspect Console Logs:**
  - Open the browser extension’s background script console and popup console to check for error messages.

<Tip>
When testing, open a new tab, navigate to a commonly used website with third party resources, and verify if the badge updates accordingly.
</Tip>

## 4. Network Requests Not Being Recorded

### Problem
The extension shows no network activity, even though the site loads external resources.

### Solution
- **Verify Content Blocking Settings:** uBO Scope reports network events independently but underlying browser blocking can affect network visibility. Check if other content blockers or privacy settings interfere.
- **Network Protocol Permissions:**
  - Ensure extension permissions include `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*` if WebSocket monitoring is required.
- **Reload the Tab:**
  - Network request data is captured per tab and updates on reload.

## 5. General Troubleshooting Steps

Follow this checklist to address issues not covered above:

1. **Restart Browser:** Close and reopen your browser.
2. **Update uBO Scope Extension:** Confirm you have the latest version installed.
3. **Check for Browser Updates:** Keep your browser updated to ensure API compatibility.
4. **Test in a Clean Profile:** Create a new browser profile with no other extensions enabled to isolate conflicts.

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Details & Common Scenarios">
<Accordion title="Why is the extension badge not showing numbers?">
The badge count reflects the number of unique third-party domains contacted by the current active tab. If you see no badge:

- Ensure you have permission to intercept network requests.
- Reload the current page to trigger data capture.
- Disable competing extensions that may block or alter network requests in a way that hides them from uBO Scope.
- Verify the browser action icon is correctly installed and not hidden.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension does not update data on tab changes">
This can happen if the extension’s background or service worker crashes or is suspended. To fix:

- Restart your browser.
- Check browser logs for errors.
- Keep browser updated to latest stable release.
- Confirm uBO Scope is allowed to run in background (some browsers restrict this).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission prompt not shown or denied by mistake">
If you declined permissions at install:

- Remove and reinstall uBO Scope.
- Manually grant permissions via browser extension management page.
- Clear any stored extension settings that might prevent prompting.

<Accordion title="Toolbar icon missing after install">
- Check browser extension toolbar customization:
