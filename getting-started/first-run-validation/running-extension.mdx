# Launching uBO Scope for the First Time

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with uBO Scope. This guide walks you through accessing the extension after installation, interacting with the popup interface, and verifying the toolbar badge displays correctly. By the end, you will confidently launch uBO Scope and inspect the live network activity it reveals on your browser.

---

## 1. Opening uBO Scope in Your Browser

uBO Scope integrates seamlessly with your browser toolbar, appearing as an icon near the address bar.

### Steps to Open the Extension Popup

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's extension area (usually near the top-right corner).
2. Click the uBO Scope icon once. This action opens the popup interface showing third-party connection data for the current active tab.

<Check>
Ensure the extension icon is visible. If not, check your browser’s extension management area to pin or enable uBO Scope.
</Check>

<Tip>
If you just installed uBO Scope, you might need to refresh your current tab or open a new tab for the connection data to populate.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface

The popup displays a real-time summary of third-party connections made by the active tab’s web page.

### Key Sections in the Popup:

- **Tab Hostname:** Shows the hostname of the current site you are browsing.
- **Domains Connected:** Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Outcome Categories:** Connections are grouped into three categories:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which network requests succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were stealthily blocked or redirected.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where network requests were outright blocked or failed.

Each category lists involved domains with a count badge showing how many requests were made to that domain.

### How to Explore Domain Connections

- Scroll through each outcome category to see all related domains.
- Use the domain names to identify which third parties interact with the webpage.

<Note>
These categories help you understand the network behaviors independently of your content blockers, as uBO Scope reports all network requests the browser attempts.
</Note>

## 3. Verifying the Toolbar Badge Behavior

The small badge number over the uBO Scope icon provides a quick indicator:

- It counts the number of **distinct third-party domains with allowed connections** on the active tab.
- A lower count generally indicates fewer third-party connections, which may be preferable for privacy.

### How to Confirm Correct Badge Display

1. Observe the badge number after opening uBO Scope.
2. Open the popup and note the number under "domains connected."
3. Confirm these numbers match; the badge should reflect the count of allowed domains shown.

<Warning>
If the badge is blank or not updating, try refreshing the tab or reopening the browser. The extension collects data once active network requests are made.
</Warning>

## 4. Practical Tips for First-Time Use

- **Refresh or Navigate:** For accurate popup data, ensure you are on a page that makes network requests (like a news site or web app).
- **Check Permissions:** uBO Scope requires certain browser permissions to monitor requests; if data doesn’t appear, verify permissions in your browser settings.
- **Multiple Tabs:** Badge counts and popup data are tab-specific; switch tabs and check the popup again to see different connection data.

<Info>
The popup dynamically updates with network activity but reflects the state since page load. For real-time changes, reload the page after opening the popup.

## Appendix: Real-World Scenario

Imagine browsing a popular news site. You open uBO Scope, and the badge shows "5," meaning five distinct third-party domains are actively connected. Opening the popup reveals three domains under "not blocked," one under "stealth-blocked," and one under "blocked." This insight helps you understand exactly how many and which third parties your browser interacted with on that page.
