# Troubleshooting Installation & Setup Issues

This guide helps you quickly diagnose and resolve common problems encountered during the installation and initial setup of uBO Scope. Whether you hit permission errors, browser incompatibilities, or find the extension popup unresponsive, this troubleshooting resource empowers you to unblock your path and start using uBO Scope effectively.

---

## 1. Identify Common Installation Blockers

### 1.1 Check Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope requires modern browsers with specific minimum versions and permissions:

- **Chromium-based browsers**: Minimum version 122.0 or later
- **Firefox**: Minimum version 128.0 or later
- **Safari**: Minimum version 18.5 or later

Older browsers or unsupported versions will prevent uBO Scope from functioning correctly.

<Tip>
Always verify your browser version before installation by visiting its "About" page.
</Tip>

### 1.2 Confirm Required Permissions

Ensure the extension has been granted the following permissions:

- Access to `webRequest` API (monitors network requests)
- Host permissions covering HTTP/S and WebSocket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`)
- Storage and active tab access

Without these, uBO Scope cannot capture connection data correctly.

---

## 2. Diagnosing Popup and UI Issues

### 2.1 Extension Popup Is Blank or Shows 'NO DATA'

This symptom usually means uBO Scope has not received any tab data or failed to initialize.

#### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Refresh the active browser tab** to trigger network monitoring anew.
2. **Make sure the active tab URL uses HTTP, HTTPS, or WebSocket protocols.**
   uBO Scope skips non-network URLs like `about:blank` or internal pages.
3. **Verify browser extension permissions:**
   - Go to your browser's extensions page
   - Find uBO Scope
   - Check that all requested permissions are granted
4. **Restart the browser:** Sometimes browser service workers or extension scripts fail silently.

<Tip>
After restarting, open the popup immediately on a website that actively loads external resources (e.g., news sites) to confirm data appears.
</Tip>

### 2.2 Extension Badge Does Not Update

The badge count reflects the number of distinct remote servers contacted by the webpage.

#### Troubleshooting:

- Ensure the webpage is loading content that triggers network requests.
- Confirm that third-party resources exist; minimal or isolated content sites may show zero.
- Disable other conflicting extensions temporarily to rule out interference.

<Tip>
Opening the popup can refresh internal counters—try toggling popup open/close.
</Tip>

## 3. Fixing Permission & Installation Errors

### 3.1 Missing Permissions or Error Messages When Installing

If you see errors related to permissions:

1. **Reinstall the extension from the official source:**
   - Chrome Web Store for Chromium browsers
   - Firefox Add-ons for Firefox
   - Follow official manual installation instructions for Safari
2. **Confirm no restrictive browser policies are blocking extension permissions** (common in managed or enterprise environments).
3. **Review browser flags or security settings** that may limit extension API access.

<Tip>
Check the browser console (/extensions page, developer mode enabled) for detailed error logs.
</Tip>

### 3.2 Service Worker or Background Script Fails to Load

Because uBO Scope uses a service worker (background script), failures here prevent network monitoring:

- Reload uBO Scope from the extensions page.
- Restart the browser to clear stale service worker states.
- Make sure your browser version supports Manifest v3 extensions.

---

## 4. Unsupported Browsers and Environment

uBO Scope is designed specifically for the latest versions of Chrome/Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers.

- Do not expect the extension to work on older browsers or those without compatible WebExtensions APIs.
- Linux users installing Safari-extension builds must package it correctly (see `tools/make-safari.sh`)—errors here will block operation.

<Tip>
Refer to the respective browser manifest files to confirm minimum version requirements and permissions:
- [Chrome manifest](platform/chromium/manifest.json)
- [Firefox manifest](platform/firefox/manifest.json)
- [Safari manifest](platform/safari/manifest.json)
</Tip>

## 5. Quick Diagnostic Commands & Checks

Use these steps to check and clear common hiccups:

```shell
# Reload extension on Chrome/Chromium
chrome://extensions/ → Enable Developer Mode → Click Refresh on uBO Scope

# View browser console logs
Ctrl+Shift+J (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Option+J (Mac)

# Clear extension's local storage to reset session data
# (through extension management UI or browser developer tools)
```
