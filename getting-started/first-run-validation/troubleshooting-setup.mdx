# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

When you first install uBO Scope, it's essential to ensure the extension is functioning correctly to accurately monitor third-party remote server connections. This guide addresses frequent problems encountered during installation or initial use — such as the extension icon missing, badge counts stuck at zero, or the popup showing no data — and provides practical solutions to get you back on track swiftly.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation and Browser Support

1. **Verify Extension Icon Presence:**
   - Look for the uBO Scope icon on your browser's toolbar. It uses a colored badge to display active connection counts.
   - If the icon is missing:
     - Ensure the extension is installed from the official browser store:
       - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
       - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
     - Check that your browser is supported:
       - Chromium-based browsers version **122+**
       - Firefox version **128+**
       - Safari version **18.5+**

2. **Browser Permissions:**
   - The extension requires permissions for `webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab` to monitor network requests properly.
   - Confirm these permissions were granted during installation.

<Tip>
If you installed via an unsupported method or an older browser version, the extension may not load or function.
Always use the official channels for installation to ensure compatibility and security.
</Tip>

## 2. Badge Counts Remain at Zero or Do Not Update

The toolbar badge indicates the number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections on the active tab. If this count stays zero despite browsing activity, try the following:

1. **Reload the Extension:**
   - Go to your browser's extensions page:
     - Chrome: `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`
     - Firefox: `about:addons`
     - Safari: Safari > Preferences > Extensions
   - Disable and re-enable uBO Scope, or choose to reload the extension if supported.

2. **Restart the Browser:**
   - Close all browser windows and restart your browser to ensure background scripts start fresh.

3. **Check Network Request Tracking:**
   - uBO Scope listens for network requests via the browser's `webRequest` API with broad host permissions:
     ```json
     "host_permissions": [
       "https://*/*",
       "http://*/*",
       "wss://*/*",
       "ws://*/*"
     ]
     ```
   - If you’re using a highly restrictive privacy setting or other extensions that interfere with `webRequest` listeners, uBO Scope may fail to observe requests.

4. **Try Browsing Different Websites:**
   - Visit a commonly trafficked site with third-party resources (like news or content-heavy sites) that load external domains.
   - Observe if the badge increments accordingly.

<Warning>
Extensions or browsers that limit, block, or modify `webRequest` APIs may prevent uBO Scope from capturing network data correctly.
Disable conflicting extensions temporarily to isolate issues.
</Warning>

## 3. Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Appears Empty

Opening the popup (`popup.html`) should display a summary of domains connected, grouped by their outcome: allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked. If this data is missing or stale, follow these steps:

1. **Manually Reload the Popup:**
   - Close and reopen the popup to trigger data refresh.

2. **Verify Active Tab Tracking:**
   - The extension focuses on the current tab. Ensure you are viewing a tab with visible network activity.

3. **Reload the Affected Tab:**
   - Reload the webpage in the active tab to generate fresh network requests that the extension can monitor.

4. **Review Browser Console for Errors:**
   - Open the browser's developer console (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Opt+I`) to check for errors related to extension scripts, especially `popup.js` or `background.js`.

5. **Check for Browser-Specific Permissions:**
   - Safari requires a minimum version **18.5+** and sometimes stricter extension permissions.
   - Make sure the extension has appropriate permissions through Safari's Extensions preferences.

6. **Ensure Storage Access:**
   - The popup relies on data stored via the extension's local/session storage.
   - If storage is disabled or cleared frequently by privacy settings, data may be lost.

<Tip>
The popup uses distinctive color codings and grouped domains to help interpret results:
- **Allowed:** Green shades
- **Blocked/Stealth-blocked:** Red shades
If these colors and domain counts do not appear, the extension is likely not capturing or processing network requests properly.
</Tip>

## 4. Common Browser-Specific Issues and Adjustments

### Chrome / Chromium
- Confirm minimum Chrome version is **122+**.
- In Chrome's Extensions page, enable **Developer mode** and reload uBO Scope if it behaves unexpectedly.
- Watch for conflicts with privacy extensions that might disable `webRequest` APIs like 'Privacy Badger' or 'uMatrix'.

### Firefox
- Requires Firefox **128+**.
- Ensure extension ID `uBO-Scope@raymondhill.net` matches, indicating official install.
- Disable any strict content-security policies or private browsing restrictions that might hinder extension operation.

### Safari
- Minimum Safari version **18.5**.
- Check that the extension is enabled in Safari Preferences > Extensions.
- Safari's extension model may require explicit manual reloads after browser updates.

<Note>
Consult your browser's extension documentation for managing permissions, reloading, or troubleshooting extension states.
</Note>

## 5. Resetting or Reinstalling the Extension

If problems persist, a complete reset or reinstall may clear corrupted data or stale states.

1. **Uninstall the Extension:** Remove uBO Scope from your browser.
2. **Clear Browser Cache and Storage:** Optionally clear local extension storage via the browser settings.
3. **Restart the Browser:** Fully close and relaunch the browser.
4. **Reinstall uBO Scope:** Use the official extension store links.

<Warning>
Reinstalling will clear stored session data and history maintained by the extension.
</Warning>

## 6. When to Seek Further Support

If the above steps do not resolve your issue, consider:

- Reviewing open and closed issues on the [uBO Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
- Reaching out by filing a new issue with detailed information about your browser version, OS, and the problem.
