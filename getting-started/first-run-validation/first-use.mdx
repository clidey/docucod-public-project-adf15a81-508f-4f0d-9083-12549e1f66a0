# First Successful Use

This guide walks you through your first interaction with uBO Scope after installation. You'll learn how to open the uBO Scope popup, interpret the data displayed, and understand the meaning of the badge count on the browser toolbar. This step-by-step walkthrough is designed to help you quickly gain insight into your browser’s network connections and the extension’s reporting.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

After installing uBO Scope, it integrates into your browser’s toolbar as an icon. This icon shows a numeric badge indicating how many distinct third-party remote servers your current tab has connected to.

### Steps:

1. Navigate to any website in your browser (e.g., open https://example.com).
2. Locate the uBO Scope icon next to the address bar (toolbar area).
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open its popup panel.

<Tip>
The badge count on the icon reflects the number of unique third-party domains from which your current webpage fetched resources or content. A lower count usually means fewer third-party connections.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Understanding the Popup Data Sections

The uBO Scope popup displays a summary of the remote servers connected by the current tab. It organizes network connections into three distinct categories:

- **Not Blocked**: Third-party domains where the connection succeeded without blocking.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were blocked stealthily (hidden from the webpage).
- **Blocked**: Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.

### Visual Layout:

- The panel header shows the hostname of the current tab clearly distinguished into subdomain and main domain.
- The _domains connected_ count shows the total number of distinct domains connecting.
- Each section lists domains with their corresponding connection counts.

### Example:

```
example.com            (host displayed in header)

domains connected: 12

not blocked
- cdn.example.net  (5 connections)
stelath-blocked
- analytics.tracker.com  (3 connections)
blocked
- ads.badsite.com  (4 connections)
```

<Tip>
Each domain row shows the domain name and the number of requests made to it from the current page during the session.
</Tip>

## 3. Interpreting the Badge Count on the Icon

The badge number on the toolbar icon dynamically updates to reflect the current page's distinct third-party domains with successful network connections (i.e., in the _Not Blocked_ category).

- **What does the badge count mean?**
  - It represents the exact count of unique third-party domains **not blocked** that your current tab connected to.
  - If the count is zero or blank, it means no connections or no allowed third-party domains.

- **Why is this important?**
  - This count helps you understand the third-party network exposure of the page.
  - A lower number indicates fewer external servers being contacted, enhancing privacy and reducing tracking risks.

<Warning>
Don't interpret a higher badge count as an error; it indicates more distinct allowed third-party domains, which is not necessarily good or bad but critical information.
</Warning>

## 4. Typical First-Time User Flow

Here’s a straightforward user scenario illustrating a typical first-time interaction:

<Steps>
<Step title="Visit a Website">
Go to your favorite website. After navigation, observe the badge count on the uBO Scope icon updating according to the network activity.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup panel showing domain connection details.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Header Hostname">
At the top, identify the current tab's hostname and its domain parts for clear context.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Domain Sections">
Look through the "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked" categories to see which remote servers were contacted and the count of requests to each.
</Step>
<Step title="Understand the Summary">
Note the total distinct domains connected as reported under "domains connected" and compare it with the badge count to grasp successful connections.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Refresh the Page:** After loading a page, open the popup to see updated network connection data.
- **Switch Tabs:** Badge count and popup data update per active tab, reflecting its specific network connections.
- **Domain Decoding:** Domains are displayed using Unicode format, ensuring internationalized domain names are human-readable.
- **Browser Compatibility:** The popup and badge behavior are consistent across supported browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

<Note>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or no domains, this usually means no network connections have been recorded for the active tab session or the extension is still initializing.
</Note>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup and Badge Behavior">
<Accordion title="Popup shows NO DATA or empty results">
- Ensure the tab has fully loaded and made network connections.
- Refresh the page and reopen the popup.
- Confirm the extension is enabled and granted necessary permissions (storage, webRequest).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count does not update or shows unexpectedly">
- The badge only counts allowed distinct third-party domains.
- If you expected fewer or more, try refreshing the page.
- Check for conflicts with other privacy or content-blocking extensions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup does not open when clicking icon">
- Restart the browser.
- Verify the extension installation is successful.
- Ensure your browser supports manifest version 3 extensions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. What’s Next?

Once comfortable with opening and interpreting the first popup, dive deeper into:

- [Interpreting Connection Insights](../guides/getting-started-essentials/interpreting-connection-insights) to learn detailed meanings behind network request outcomes and domain behaviors.
- [Quick Validation Steps](../../first-run-validation/validate-functionality) to ensure your setup captures connections reliably.
- [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup Issues](../../first-run-validation/troubleshooting-setup) if you encounter problems.

This foundation sets the stage for intelligently monitoring your browsing network footprint with confidence.

## Appendix: How uBO Scope Gathers and Displays This Data

Understanding the data you see helps contextualize the popup.

- uBO Scope listens to your browser’s network requests using the `webRequest` API.
- It categorizes requests by their outcome: allowed, stealth blocked, or blocked.
- The extension associates these requests with domain names and counts occurrences.
- This processed data is sent to the popup for display whenever you open it.

This process ensures you see accurate, up-to-date info about third-party connections impacting your browsing.
