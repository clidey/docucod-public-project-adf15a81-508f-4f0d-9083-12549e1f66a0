# Quick Validation Steps

This guide walks you through a practical checklist to confirm that **uBO Scope** is actively monitoring your browser’s network requests and accurately displaying connection information. By following these steps, you will verify the extension's correct operation and gain confidence in the insights it provides about third-party remote server connections.

---

## 1. Confirm uBO Scope Installation and Activation

- Ensure you have installed uBO Scope via your browser’s official extension store:
  - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
  - Safari extension via App Store (minimum Safari version 18.5)

- Verify that the uBO Scope icon appears in your browser’s toolbar.
- Confirm that the extension has the necessary permissions (webRequest and host access).

<Tip>
If the icon is missing, review your browser’s extension management page to confirm the extension is enabled.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup window.
- The popup initially displays the current active tab’s monitored network connections.
  - The top header shows the page’s hostname and domain.
  - The summary section reports the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
  - Separate sections list domains grouped as **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

<Note>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or remains empty, reload the active browser tab and try again to ensure data collection starts.
</Note>

---

## 3. Visit Real Websites to Generate Network Data

uBO Scope monitors actual network requests made by webpages. To test this:

- Navigate to well-known, content-rich websites (e.g., https://www.wikipedia.org, https://www.nytimes.com).
- Avoid synthetic 'ad blocker test' pages as they do not reflect real-world connections and can misrepresent uBO Scope’s reporting.

- After page load, open the uBO Scope popup again.
- Observe the updated domain counts and connection categories, reflecting third-party network activity on the visited website.

<Tip>
Choose sites with multimedia and external resources for richer network activity and clearer validation output.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Interpret the Connection Categories

uBO Scope classifies connections into three categories based on network request outcomes:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Third-party domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Third-party requests redirected silently without user-visible blocking.
- **Blocked:** Network requests explicitly blocked or failed.

- The badge count on the toolbar icon indicates the number of distinct third-party domains in the **Not Blocked** category.

<Info>
A lower badge count suggests fewer third party servers connected, generally indicating stricter blocking or less exposure.
</Info>

---

## 5. Verify Badge Count Updates

- As you navigate between tabs or reload pages:
  - Confirm that the badge number on the uBO Scope icon updates to reflect the distinct allowed third-party domains for the active tab.
  - If no third-party connections occur or are all blocked, the badge should clear (i.e., no number displayed).

<Warning>
If badge numbers do not update after page reloads, ensure your browser supports the `webRequest` API fully and that no other extension interferes.
</Warning>

---

## 6. Check Tab Switching Behavior

- Switch between multiple browser tabs.
- Open uBO Scope popup on different tabs and compare the connection data:
  - Each tab should show data exclusive to its own network activity.
  - Badge count should correspondingly update with the active tab.

---

## 7. Recognize Common Limitations

- uBO Scope can only measure requests visible via the browser’s webRequest API. Some network activity (e.g., certain WebSocket protocols or DNS-based blocking outside this scope) may not be captured.
- If an extension or DNS configuration prevents requests from reaching the browser’s networking stack visible to extensions, those connections won't appear.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Checklist

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA or Empty">
- Reload the current tab to trigger fresh network requests.
- Confirm extension permissions include host access and webRequest.
- Disable conflicting extensions that might block uBO Scope’s access.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
- Verify browser version meets uBO Scope minimum requirements (e.g., Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Restart the browser to clear stale extension state.
- Check for errors in browser extension console.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Zero or High Third-Party Domain Counts">
- Remember that some legitimate websites rely on multiple CDNs or third-party services.
- Refresh the page and monitor network activity in developer tools alongside uBO Scope.
- Compare data with other network inspection tools to confirm accuracy.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
