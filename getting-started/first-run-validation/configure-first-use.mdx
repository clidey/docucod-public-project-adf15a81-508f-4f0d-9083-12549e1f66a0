# Configuring and Using uBO Scope for the First Time

Welcome to your first look at uBO Scope, a browser extension that reveals all third-party remote server connections initiated by webpages you visit. This document guides you step-by-step through what to expect when you open uBO Scope for the first time after installation, how to access its interface, interpret its UI elements — including domain counts and categories — and begin analyzing network activity with confidence.

---

## 1. Opening uBO Scope: Accessing the Popup Interface

Once installed, uBO Scope integrates tightly with your browser toolbar.

### Step 1: Locate the Extension Icon

- Find the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It typically appears as a small badge with the letter 'uBO' or the extension's logo.
- The badge displays a number representing the count of **distinct third-party domains connected** by the currently active tab.

### Step 2: Open the Popup

- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup window.
- The popup dynamically updates to show connection details for the active tab.

<Tip>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or remains empty, refresh the current tab or open a new website to trigger network activity that uBO Scope can analyze.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding uBO Scope's UI Elements

The popup interface provides an at-a-glance summary of network connections relating to the active tab, organized clearly into intuitive categories.

### UI Breakdown:

| UI Element      | Description                                                                                         |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| **Tab Hostname**| Shows the current webpage's hostname and its registered domain, decoded to Unicode if needed.   |
| **Domains Connected Count** | Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains connected from the current tab.  |
| **Allowed Section**   | Lists domains from which resources loaded successfully and were not blocked.                    |
| **Stealth-Blocked Section** | Contains domains whose requests were redirected stealthily and are not visible to the webpage. |
| **Blocked Section**   | Lists domains where network requests failed or were explicitly blocked by the browser or content blockers. |


### How Domains Are Displayed

- Each domain entry shows the domain name and a badge with a count, indicating how many connection attempts were made to that domain.
- Domains are sorted alphabetically within their respective sections for easy navigation.

## 3. Interpreting the Information: What the Categories Mean

Understanding the three domain groupings helps you assess the third-party exposure of the webpage you are analyzing.

### Allowed Domains
- These are third-party servers that the webpage connected to successfully.
- Typically include content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics services, or other resources required for full webpage functionality.
- A smaller count here usually indicates fewer third-party dependencies, which is often desirable for privacy.

### Stealth-Blocked Domains
- These domains attempted connections that were redirected or stealth-blocked.
- Such blocking means that the resource was intercepted or redirected in a way that the webpage does not see the request as blocked.
- This can be due to advanced content blocking or privacy-preserving mechanisms.

### Blocked Domains
- Contains domains from which network requests failed or were explicitly blocked by the browser’s content blocking features.
- Indicates third-party connections prevented from loading, useful for verifying the effectiveness of your content blockers.

<Info>
The accurate categorization of network request outcomes by uBO Scope is essential for users to differentiate allowed versus blocked third-party connections correctly, rather than relying solely on block counts or incomplete data.

## 4. Initial Workflow: Viewing Data About Remote Connections

Follow these simple steps to start analyzing network connections for any page you visit.

### Step 1: Navigate to a Webpage

- Open a website of interest in your browser.
- Wait for the page to load fully to ensure all network requests are captured.

### Step 2: Open uBO Scope Popup

- Click on the extension icon to reveal the popup interface.
- Observe the domains connected count updating according to the page’s network traffic.

### Step 3: Explore Domain Lists

- Scroll through the **Allowed**, **Stealth-blocked**, and **Blocked** sections to see the domains.
- Use the counts to gauge how many times each domain was called.

### Step 4: Compare Hostname vs. Registered Domains

- At the top, the current tab’s hostname and its registered domain are displayed.
- This helps identify the main site versus third-party connections.

<Tip>
Carefully review "stealth-blocked" domains to understand network requests that evade standard blocking detection.
</Tip>

## 5. Tips for Effective First Use

- **Refresh the Page:** Network requests are observed per page load. Refresh the page if no data appears.
- **Privacy Awareness:** A high domain count indicates larger third-party exposure; evaluate what domains you trust.
- **Use Content Blockers Wisely:** uBO Scope reports network activities regardless of any active content blockers, letting you verify their impact.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Initial Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with First-Time Use">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA'">
- Ensure you have opened a valid webpage with active network requests.
- Refresh the tab to trigger data collection.
- Confirm the extension has necessary permissions; check your browser’s extension settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Counts Do Not Update Immediately">
- Network request processing is batched with a slight delay (about 1 second).
- Wait briefly or reload the page.
- Close and reopen the popup if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains Appear Unicode-Encoded or Punycode">
- uBO Scope automatically decodes domains to Unicode where possible.
- If you see Punycode, it reflects actual internationalized domains.
- No action needed unless you report issues.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Appendix: View of Popup HTML Structure

For reference, the popup consists mainly of sections showing counts and domains in categories, dynamically rendered when opened.

```html
<h2 id="tabHostname">
    <span></span>
    <span>NO DATA</span>
</h2>
<main>
    <section id="summary">
        domains connected: <span>?</span>
    </section>
    <section class="outcome allowed">
        <h3>not blocked</h3>
        <div class="domains"></div>
    </section>
    <section class="outcome stealth">
        <h3>stealth-blocked</h3>
        <div class="domains"></div>
    </section>
    <section class="outcome blocked">
        <h3>blocked</h3>
        <div class="domains"></div>
    </section>
</main>
```

This structure enables efficient categorization of network domains into Allowed, Stealth-blocked, and Blocked groups.
