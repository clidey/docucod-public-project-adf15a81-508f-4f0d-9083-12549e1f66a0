# Quick Validation & First Use

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide will walk you through the simplest way to verify that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browsing sessions. You’ll learn how to interpret the popup window, understand what the badge counts mean, and confirm that domain monitoring is functioning correctly — all critical steps to ensure your setup is working as intended.

---

## 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup

<uBO-Scope />

operates as a browser extension with a popup interface that provides a live overview of third-party connections for the current tab.

### Steps:

1. Locate the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser’s toolbar. It looks like a little badge with a number or may be just the icon if no domains are yet connected.
2. Click the icon to open the popup window. This popup surfaces live data about network connections associated with your active tab.

<Check>
If you do not see the icon:
- Verify that uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled in your browser.
- See the guide "Launching uBO Scope for the First Time" for installation verification tips.
</Check>

## 2. Understand What You See in the Popup

Once the popup is open, you'll encounter a clean and organized display segmented by connection outcome categories and a summary count.

### Popup Sections Explained:

- **Hostname Section (Title):**
  - Shows the current tab's full hostname with a two-part display:
    - The first span (left) displays the subdomain part, if different from the registered domain.
    - The second span (right) shows the registered domain (the main domain name).

- **Summary:**
  - Displays total number of distinct domains connected to from this tab under "domains connected".

- **Outcome Sections:** These groups list domains categorized by network request outcome:
  - **Not Blocked (allowed):** Domains your browser successfully connected to.
  - **Stealth-Blocked (stealth):** Domains involved in redirects.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed due to blocking.

- Each outcome section lists domains with a badge representing the number of requests made to that domain.

<Note>
Domain names shown support Unicode and are converted automatically from Punycode for easy reading.
</Note>

---

## 3. Interpret the Toolbar Badge Count

The number you see on the browser toolbar badge corresponds to the count of distinct *allowed* third-party domains detected in the current active tab.

- This dynamically updates as you browse and network requests occur.
- If the badge is empty or missing, it means zero allowed third-party domains have been detected yet for your current tab.

<Warning>
The badge count only reflects the allowed domains, not the blocked or stealth domains.
</Warning>

## 4. Confirming Domain Monitoring is Working

To be confident that uBO Scope is correctly monitoring your browsing session:

### Step-by-Step Validation:

1. In the popup, look for multiple domain entries under the **Not Blocked** category while visiting a complex website.
2. Verify the **domains connected** summary count reflects a realistic number (often more than 0).
3. Observe that domains are updated live as you navigate or refresh pages.

### Example:

- Visit `https://example.com`.
- Open uBO Scope popup.
- You see `example.com` and various third-party domains listed with badge counts.
- The summary says something like `domains connected: 12`.
- The badge on the toolbar shows `12`.

This confirms uBO Scope is actively tracking network requests for your tab.

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Use popular websites** with known third-party content for quick validation (e.g., news sites, e-commerce platforms).
- Avoid closing the tab immediately to allow data to accumulate.
- Refresh pages if the popup shows `NO DATA` or unexpected emptiness.

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- The popup may show `NO DATA` if the tab has no network requests or is still loading.
- Badge counts lagging behind can happen if intensive requests flood the tab, but will update within seconds.
- Some stealth block events may not appear immediately.

<Warning>
Make sure your browser allows the necessary permissions for the extension to monitor network requests, particularly "activeTab" and "webRequest" permissions.
See the "Initial Configuration" documentation for details.
</Warning>

## 7. Troubleshooting Quick Validation Issues

If you do not see expected domain data:

- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and permissions granted.
- Refresh the active tab.
- Close and reopen the popup.
- Verify the badge is showing and updates.

For detailed troubleshooting, visit the [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](../first-run-validation/troubleshooting) guide.

## 8. Next Steps

After confirming uBO Scope is active and monitoring connections:

- Explore the [Overview of the Popup and Toolbar Badge](../../guides/getting-started/overview-of-the-ui) for in-depth UI understanding.
- Learn about domain outcomes in [Understanding Domain Statuses: Allowed, Blocked, Stealth](../../guides/getting-started/understanding-domain-statuses).
- Begin practical use by identifying third-party remote connections in your browsing via the respective workflow guides.

## Appendix: Popup UI Structure & Behavior

For users interested in technical underpinnings, the popup is structured in HTML as follows:

- The popup displays the tab's hostname at the top (`#tabHostname`).
- The summary section (`#summary`) shows the total domains connected.
- There are three outcome sections with class names `allowed`, `stealth`, and `blocked`.
- Domains are listed inside their respective sections as rows showing domain name and a numeric badge.
- Domain names shown use punycode conversion to Unicode for readability.
- The popup script fetches tab-related connection data asynchronously and renders it dynamically.

<Tip>
This popup and badge display update automatically as network events occur, providing a live snapshot aligned with your browsing activity.
