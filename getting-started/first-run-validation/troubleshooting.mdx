# Troubleshooting Setup Issues

When installing or launching uBO Scope, you might encounter common issues such as a missing extension icon, an unresponsive popup, or inaccurate badge counts. This guide provides clear, step-by-step solutions to help you quickly resolve these problems and get your extension running smoothly.

---

## 1. Extension Icon is Missing from Browser Toolbar

If the uBO Scope icon does not appear after installation, follow these steps:

1. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open your browser's extensions management page (`chrome://extensions/`, `about:addons`, or Safari Extensions preferences).
   - Confirm that uBO Scope is installed and enabled.

2. **Pin the Extension to Toolbar:**
   - In Chrome and Chromium browsers, click the puzzle-piece menu, find uBO Scope, and click the pin icon.
   - In Firefox, use the overflow menu to drag the icon to the toolbar.
   - In Safari, ensure that the extension is enabled and visible in your toolbar preferences.

3. **Restart Your Browser:**
   - Sometimes, a browser restart resolves temporary UI glitches.

4. **Check Browser Version Compatibility:**
   - uBO Scope requires:
     - Chrome/Chromium 122 or later
     - Firefox 128 or later
     - Safari 18.5 or later
   - Upgrade your browser if your version is below these minimums.

<Note>
Extension icon absence is often due to installation not fully completing, browser compatibility, or the icon being hidden in overflow menus.
</Note>

## 2. Popup Interface Does Not Open or is Unresponsive

If clicking the extension icon produces no popup or a blank/unresponsive window:

1. **Confirm Proper Loading of Popup HTML:**
   - The popup content comes from `popup.html`.
   - Check for blocked scripts or resources in your browser console (press F12 to open DevTools).

2. **Extension Permissions:**
   - uBO Scope requires permissions: `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
   - Ensure permissions haven’t been denied; try toggling the extension off and on again.

3. **Disable Conflicting Extensions:**
   - Some extensions might interfere with popup scripts.
   - Temporarily disable other extensions to isolate conflicts.

4. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Cached extension files might cause stale content.
   - Clear your cache or reload the extension manually.

5. **Reload Extension:**
   - In developer mode, use the 'Reload' button on the extensions page.

6. **Check for Browser Errors:**
   - In the background or extension console, look for errors logged related to background scripts or popup scripts.

<Warning>
Popup issues can sometimes be due to browser bugs or aggressive privacy features that block the extension’s scripts. Adjust settings accordingly.
</Warning>

## 3. Badge Count Shows Incorrect or No Numbers

The badge displays the number of distinct allowed third-party domains for the active tab. If it shows empty, zero, or incorrect counts:

1. **Ensure You Are On a Webpage:**
   - The badge updates only when a valid tab with network activity is detected.
   - If the tab is blank, the badge will be empty.

2. **Verify Permissions and Connectivity:**
   - The extension needs webRequest access to network events.
   - Confirm network requests are not blocked globally by other tools before the extension can observe them.

3. **Test with Common Websites:**
   - Navigate to a content-rich site to generate network requests and observe badge changes.

4. **Refresh the Tab:**
   - Reload the page to trigger new network requests which the extension can monitor.

5. **Restart Browser:**
   - Sometimes background scripts may fail or stop tracking.
   - Restart the browser to reinitialize the extension.

6. **Check Background Process:**
   - The background service worker tracks network requests.
   - Use developer tools to check if it is running without errors.

7. **Update Extension:**
   - Ensure you are running the latest version, as bugs affecting badge counts may be fixed in newer releases.

<Tip>
The badge reflects **distinct third-party domains allowed** by the browser for the active tab—not the total number of network requests or blocked items. A low or zero count may indicate effective content blocking or a page with few third-party resources.
</Tip>

## 4. Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Results

If your popup shows the headline as 'NO DATA' or lists with no domains:

1. **Browse to Secure HTTP(S) Sites:**
   - The extension tracks network requests with HTTP or HTTPS schemes.
   - Ensure you have browsed tabs with valid network connections.

2. **Wait Momentarily:**
   - Network requests are collected asynchronously with a slight delay.
   - Wait a few seconds after loading a page before opening the popup.

3. **Verify Tab is Active:**
   - The popup shows data only for the currently active tab in the current window.

4. **Check for Privacy or Security Settings:**
   - Some private modes, trackers blockers, or VPNs may prevent network request visibility.

5. **Reload Page:**
   - Refresh the page to restart network request tracking.

## 5. General Troubleshooting Steps

Follow these broad steps when faced with unresolved issues:

- **Reinstall the Extension:** Remove and reinstall uBO Scope from the official browser store.
  
- **Reset Extension Data:** Clear storage used by the extension via browser extension settings.

- **Consult Browser Logs:** Use developer tools to monitor console errors under the extension context.
