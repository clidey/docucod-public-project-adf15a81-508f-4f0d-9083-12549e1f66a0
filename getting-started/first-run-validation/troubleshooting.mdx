# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide helps you resolve typical challenges encountered during the first run or installation of uBO Scope. If the extension does not appear, the toolbar badge fails to update, permissions are denied, or the popup shows no data, follow these straightforward steps to fix the problem and ensure smooth onboarding.

---

## 1. Extension Not Appearing in Browser Toolbar

If you cannot find uBO Scope's icon after installation, try the following:

1. **Confirm Installation**
   - Open your browser's extension or add-ons page.
   - Verify that 'uBO Scope' is listed and enabled.

2. **Check Browser Compatibility**
   - Ensure your browser version meets the minimum requirements:
     - Chrome ≥ 122
     - Firefox ≥ 128
     - Safari ≥ 18.5 (where supported)

3. **Pin the Extension**
   - In browsers like Chrome and Firefox, extensions may be hidden in the overflow menu.
   - Click the puzzle-piece icon (extensions menu) and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.

4. **Restart Your Browser**
   - Sometimes a restart is necessary to initialize the extension properly.

<Tip>
If your browser is outdated or restricted (e.g., enterprise-managed), the extension might be blocked or incompatible. Check your browser policy settings if you’re using such an environment.
</Tip>

## 2. Toolbar Badge Not Updating or Showing Zero

The badge reflects the number of distinct third-party domains successfully contacted on the active tab. If it stays blank or shows zero unexpectedly:

1. **Visit a Website with Network Activity**
   - Test by loading a site known to make external requests (e.g., https://example.com).

2. **Check Permissions**
   - uBO Scope requires permissions to access `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and certain hosts (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`).
   - Verify these permissions are granted:
     - In the extension details page, check `Permissions` and `Host Access`.

3. **Allow Site Access When Needed**
   - Some browsers block extensions from accessing certain sites by default.
   - On the uBO Scope icon, click and ensure 'Allow access to this site' or 'On all sites' is enabled.

4. **Ensure No Conflicting Extensions**
   - Extensions that block or modify web requests (e.g., other content blockers) can interfere.
   - Temporarily disable other extensions to isolate issues.

5. **Reload the Tab**
   - After adjusting permissions or extension settings, reload the webpage to trigger network activity and badge updates.

6. **Check Browser Console for Errors**
   - Open Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Option+I), filter console by "uBO Scope" or relevant errors.

<Warning>
If network requests are blocked by external systems like DNS-level filters or firewall rules, uBO Scope might not capture their outcomes correctly.
</Warning>

## 3. Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Results

If you click the extension icon and the popup displays 'NO DATA' or appears empty:

1. **Ensure You Are on an Active Tab With Network Requests**
   - The popup shows data for the active browser tab.
   - Open a tab with a fully loaded webpage that makes third-party requests.

2. **Wait a Moment After Opening the Popup**
   - The extension processes network activities asynchronously; allow a second or two for data to load.

3. **Reload the Tab**
   - Reloading the tab forces network traffic, populating the popup.

4. **Check Extension State**
   - If the popup stays in a 'loading' state indefinitely, the extension's background script might have crashed.
   - Restart or reload the extension (see section below).

5. **Verify That the Extension Has Required Permissions** (similar to the badge issue)

---

## 4. Permissions Denied or Extension Not Monitoring Requests

The extension relies on several crucial permissions to function:

- `webRequest` – for monitoring HTTP and WebSocket traffic.
- `activeTab` – to interact with the currently active tab.
- Host permissions (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, `ws://*/*`) – to observe network requests.

If you suspect permissions are missing or denied:

1. **Review Extension Permissions**
   - On your browser’s extensions page, click uBO Scope and look for permission warnings or toggles.

2. **Enable All Required Host Access**
   - Set the extension's host access to 'On all sites' or 'When you click the extension', then reload the page.

3. **Reinstall the Extension**
   - Sometimes reinstalling ensures permissions are requested and granted properly.

## 5. How to Reinstall or Reload the Extension

If issues persist after verifying permissions and trying the above, reinstalling or reloading the extension can reset its state:

### Reinstall

1. Open the extensions page in your browser.
2. Remove or uninstall uBO Scope.
3. Reinstall from the official source:
   - Chrome: [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
   - Firefox: [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
4. Reload your browser.

### Reload

1. Open the extensions page.
2. Enable the developer mode toggle (if available).
3. Click the 'Reload' button on uBO Scope.
4. Reload your browsing tab to resume monitoring.

<Tip>
Reloading is faster than reinstalling and retains your previous settings.
