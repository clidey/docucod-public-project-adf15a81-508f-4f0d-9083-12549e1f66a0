# Validating and Troubleshooting uBO Scope

Ensure your uBO Scope browser extension is correctly monitoring network activity so you can rely on accurate privacy insights. This guide provides quick checks to verify proper operation and offers solutions for common issues encountered after installation or during first use.

---

## 1. Confirming uBO Scope Is Monitoring Network Traffic

The primary goal is to verify that uBO Scope is actively tracking your browser’s network requests. Follow these steps to quickly validate:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open its popup interface.

- The popup should display the current webpage’s domain at the top.
- You should see sections listing domains under the categories: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
- The summary shows the count of distinct connected domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Badge Count is Present">
Look at the badge on the uBO Scope toolbar icon.

- It should display a number representing distinct third-party domains connected by the current tab.
- If the badge is empty or missing, uBO Scope might not be processing requests properly.
</Step>
<Step title="Browse a Variety of Websites">
Navigate to several different websites.

- Confirm that the popup updates with new domain connection counts and lists reflect changing network activity.
- Badge counts should vary with site complexity and third-party content.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If the popup and badge update correctly, uBO Scope is successfully monitoring network traffic.
If not, proceed to the troubleshooting section.
</Note>

## 2. Common Troubleshooting Scenarios

When uBO Scope does not appear to monitor network traffic or count connections accurately, consider these typical issues and resolutions:

### 2.1 Extension Permissions
- Confirm uBO Scope has been granted the necessary permissions. It requires `webRequest` permission and host access (`http://*/*` and `https://*/*`).
- In some browsers, verify the extension is allowed to operate incognito or in private browsing if needed.

### 2.2 Extension Conflicts
- Disable other extensions that may interfere with `webRequest` API, especially other content blockers or privacy tools.
- Check whether uBO Scope is enabled and not accidentally paused or removed.

### 2.3 Browser Compatibility and Version
- Ensure you are using a compatible browser version:
  - Chromium-based browsers require a minimum of Chrome 122.
  - Firefox requires version 128 or higher.
  - Safari requires version 18.5 or higher.
- See the [System Requirements](../getting-started/preparation-installation/system-requirements) page for more details.

### 2.4 Network Environment
- Some network conditions or VPNs may obscure or block the network events that uBO Scope relies on.
- Try disabling VPNs or proxies temporarily to test.

### 2.5 Extension Initialization Timing
- After installing or reloading the extension, wait a few seconds for internal data such as the public suffix list to load.
- Reload the affected tabs to trigger fresh network tracking.

<Tip>
If you observe persistent issues, try restarting your browser and revisiting your test sites.
</Tip>

## 3. Resetting uBO Scope Data

If you suspect stale or corrupted session data, clearing uBO Scope's stored data can help:

1. Open your browser's extension management page.
2. Locate uBO Scope and choose its options/settings.
3. Clear local storage or reset session data if the option is available.
4. Alternatively, uninstall and reinstall uBO Scope.

This will force fresh initialization on your next browsing activity.

## 4. Understanding Output and Reporting Issues

If the count of connected domains seems unusually low or high:

- Remember the badge shows distinct third-party remote servers connected — a lower count is usually better for privacy.
- Some network requests are stealth-blocked or blocked as reported in the popup, reflecting your existing content blocker’s effect.
- The extension relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API, so any network traffic outside this API's scope cannot be tracked.

<Note>
If you see no change on browsing new sites while the badge remains empty, it strongly suggests monitoring issues.
</Note>

## 5. Reporting Problems

If after following these steps uBO Scope still does not function as expected:

- Review the [Installation Guide](../getting-started/preparation-installation/installation-guide) and [System Requirements](../getting-started/preparation-installation/system-requirements) to confirm environment compatibility.
- Consult the [First Run Guide](../getting-started/first-use-setup/first-run) to cross-check expected UI behavior.
- Visit the [Feature Snapshot](../../overview/getting-started/feature-glance) page to verify features available.
- For advanced assistance, raise an issue on the official GitHub repository at [github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).

<Check>
Always verify your browser version and ensure uBO Scope’s permissions are fully granted for seamless monitoring.
</Check>
<Warning>
Do not rely on stale or fabricated 'ad blocker test' sites as indicators of the extension’s effectiveness—validate with real-world browsing.
</Warning>
