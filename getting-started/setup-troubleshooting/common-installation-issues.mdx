# Resolving Common Installation Problems

Ensuring uBO Scope installs and activates correctly is crucial for gaining full visibility into the network connections your browser encounters. This guide addresses the most frequent challenges users face during installation and first use, providing actionable solutions and clear diagnostic steps for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

---

## 1. Installation Blocked or Extension Not Installing

If the browser blocks installation or you cannot find uBO Scope after installing:

### Step-by-Step Solutions

1. **Verify Browser Compatibility**
   - uBO Scope requires the following minimum browser versions:
     - Chrome (Chromium) 122+
     - Firefox 128+
     - Safari 18.5+
   - If you are running an earlier version, update your browser to meet these requirements.

2. **Use Official Installation Sources**
   - Install only from the official stores:
     - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
     - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
     - Safari Extension Gallery or App Store as applicable

3. **Check Browser Policies and Restrictions**
   - Corporate or managed devices may restrict extension installations.
   - Review your browser’s extension management policies or consult your administrator.

4. **Try Manual Installation for Development Builds** (Advanced)
   - For troubleshooting, you may load the extension as an unpacked extension in developer mode.
   - Follow your browser’s guide on developer extension loading.

<Tip>
Avoid untrusted third-party sources for installation to keep your browser and privacy secure.
</Tip>

## 2. Missing or Invisible Toolbar Icon

Even when uBO Scope installs successfully, the toolbar icon might not appear or might be hidden.

### How to Resolve

### Step 1: Confirm Installation
- Open your browser’s extensions or add-ons page to verify uBO Scope is enabled.

### Step 2: Show Toolbar Icon
- In Chrome and Edge:
  - Click on the puzzle-piece extension menu.
  - Find uBO Scope and click the pushpin to pin it permanently to the toolbar.
- In Firefox:
  - Open the Customize Toolbar panel.
  - Drag the uBO Scope icon to the toolbar if it is not visible.
- In Safari:
  - Ensure Safari is set to show extension icons via the View menu.

### Step 3: Verify Permissions
- If the icon is missing after installation, it may be due to insufficient permissions.
- Ensure uBO Scope is granted **`webRequest`**, **`activeTab`**, and **`storage`** permissions as shown in the manifest.

<Tip>
Missing toolbar icon is often caused by extension being disabled or needing to pin the icon manually. Pin icon immediately after installation for quick access.
</Tip>

## 3. Browser-Specific Permission Prompts

Some browsers display additional permission prompts after installing uBO Scope due to its reliance on the `webRequest` API.

### What to Expect

- You will see dialogs requesting access to your browsing data or tabs.
- Permissions required:
  - **`webRequest`**: To monitor network requests
  - **`activeTab`**: To identify current active tab
  - **`storage`**: To persist session data

### How to Proceed

1. Review the permissions carefully.
2. Grant permissions to allow full functionality.
3. If permissions are denied, uBO Scope may not track or display data correctly.

<Warning>
If you accidentally deny permissions, uninstall and reinstall uBO Scope or adjust permissions in your browser’s extension management settings.
</Warning>
