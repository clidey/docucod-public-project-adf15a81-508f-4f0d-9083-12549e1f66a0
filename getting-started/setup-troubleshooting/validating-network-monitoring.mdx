# Validating Network Monitoring & Badge Counts

Ensure that uBO Scope is actively tracking and accurately reporting third-party connections by performing simple validation tests. This guide will walk you through verifying permission activation, monitoring real-time network requests using the popup UI, and using a sample website to confirm that badge counts update correctly.

---

## 1. Confirm uBO Scope Is Active and Monitoring

Before testing network monitoring, make sure the extension is installed and activated properly:

- Verify that the uBO Scope toolbar icon is visible in your browser.
- Observe the badge count on the icon, which shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected by the current active tab.
- Click the icon to open the popup panel that details allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.

<Tip>
If the badge does not appear or shows no data, check related guides on installation and extension activation to troubleshoot permission or setup issues.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding What Counts Towards the Badge

The badge count represents the number of unique third-party *domains* from which your current tab has fetched resources or made successful connections.

- **Allowed connections:** Domains for which network requests succeeded and were not blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Domains for which the extension detected redirects or stealth blocking behavior.
- **Blocked connections:** Domains whose network requests resulted in errors or explicit blocking.

This count excludes the first-party domain the tab is visiting, focusing mostly on third-party connections.

<Note>
Remember a lower badge count implies fewer third-party exposures, enhancing your browsing privacy.
</Note>

## 3. Using the Popup Panel for Live Validation

Follow these steps to validate dynamic updates of network monitoring:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel">
Click the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar to open the popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Navigate to a Webpage">
Visit any trustworthy website with visible external content (e.g., news or social media).
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Badge and Domain List">
Watch the badge count update in real-time as the page loads and initiates network requests.
Review the lists under allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked to see domains and their request counts.
</Step>
<Step title="Refresh or Visit Another Page">
Reload the current tab or open a new one and note changes in the badge count and popup domain sections.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
If the badge does not update or domains do not appear in the popup, the extension might lack permissions, or monitoring may be inactive. Consult troubleshooting guides.
</Check>

## 4. Testing with a Sample Website to Confirm Real-Time Tracking

Use the sample website below to verify that uBO Scope is properly recording network requests and updating the badge count.

### Recommended Sample Website

Visit the following site which is known to generate varied network connections:

- [https://www.example.com/test-network-connections](https://www.example.com/test-network-connections)

_Note: Replace with an actual public website or use a test local/controlled environment if available._

### Validation Steps

1. Open the sample site in a browser tab.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup panel.
3. Confirm that the badge count shows a positive number reflecting third-party connections.
4. Interact with the sample site (e.g., click buttons or reload) and watch for changes in the badge count and domain lists.

<Tip>
Perform several reloads to ensure the extension correctly resets monitoring data and captures fresh requests.
</Tip>

## 5. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Problem: No Badge Count or Domains Displayed
- Verify that the extension has the required permissions: `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`.
- Ensure the browser version meets minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Confirm that no other extension is blocking uBO Scope from monitoring requests.

### Problem: Badge Count Does Not Match Expected
- Remember the badge count reflects distinct third-party *domains*, not the total number of requests.
- Some requests may be stealth-blocked or blocked and thus appear in other sections but do not contribute to the badge count.

### Problem: Site or Popup Data Looks Stale
- Reload the page and popup to refresh data.
- Restart the browser if problems persist.

<Tip>
Consult the [Launching & Validating Extension Activation](../first-run-and-configuration/launch-validate-extension) guide for detailed troubleshooting of activation issues.
</Tip>

## 6. Next Steps

Once validation confirms uBO Scope is tracking network connections correctly:
- Explore the popup panel to understand each domain's connection outcome.
- Review the [Configuring Core Settings](../first-run-and-configuration/configuring-extension-basics) guide to customize uBO Scope’s behavior.
- Proceed to learn about interpreting the badge and popup in the [Your First Look: Interpreting the Popup Panel](../first-run-and-configuration/quick-start-using-popup) guide.
