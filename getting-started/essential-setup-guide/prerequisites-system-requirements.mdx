# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing and using uBO Scope, ensure your system and browser environment meet the necessary requirements. This will guarantee a smooth installation and reliable operation of the extension without unexpected issues.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed to work with the latest secure and stable browser versions that support the modern WebExtension APIs it relies on. Compatible browsers and required minimum versions are:

| Browser  | Minimum Version |
| -------- | --------------- |
| Chromium | 122.0 and above |
| Firefox  | 128.0 and above |
| Safari   | 18.5 and above  |

### How to check your browser version:
- **Chromium/Chrome**: Navigate to `chrome://settings/help`
- **Firefox**: Select _Help_ -> _About Firefox_
- **Safari**: Select _Safari_ -> _About Safari_

Upgrading to these versions or higher is crucial, as older versions lack necessary APIs such as the updated `webRequest` listeners.

<Note>
Attempting to install uBO Scope on unsupported browser versions will prevent proper operation or block installation entirely.
</Note>

---

## 2. Required Permissions

uBO Scope operates by monitoring network traffic through browser APIs and needs explicit permissions granted at installation to perform its core functionality:

- **ActiveTab**: To access information about the currently active browser tab.
- **Storage**: To store session data and public suffix lists locally for accurate domain matching.
- **webRequest**: To listen and analyze all network requests made by webpages including redirects and errors.

These permissions are requested automatically during extension installation. No manual permission configurations are necessary.

---

## 3. System Platform Requirements

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension compatible across standard desktop platforms where the supported browsers run:

- **Operating Systems**:
  - Windows 10 or later
  - macOS 11 or later
  - Linux distributions supported by Chromium or Firefox

- **Hardware**: No special hardware or resources are required beyond what your browser already needs.

<Check>
Ensure your operating system is fully updated to maintain browser compatibility and security.
</Check>

## 4. Network and Environment Requirements

To function correctly, uBO Scope must be able to observe all network requests performed by your browser:

- The extension listens to all HTTP, HTTPS, WS (WebSocket), and WSS requests.
- Network firewall or proxy settings should not block or interfere with these requests or the extension's background service worker.

If you use firewall software or network policies, ensure these do not restrict the extension's use of network monitoring APIs.

<Warning>
Network requests made entirely outside the visibility of the browser's `webRequest` API (e.g., some VPN or system-level blockers) cannot be reported.
</Warning>

## 5. Summary Checklist Before Installation

Use this checklist to verify your readiness:

- [ ] Browser is Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+.
- [ ] Operating system is up-to-date and supported.
- [ ] Default browser permissions (activeTab, storage, webRequest) can be granted during install.
- [ ] Network environment allows the extension to monitor WebRequests.

## 6. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Compatibility Issues and Fixes">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
If your browser version is older than required, update it to the latest stable version through your browser’s update mechanism.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Not Granted">
During installation, if permission prompts were dismissed or denied, remove the extension and reinstall carefully, accepting the required permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="System Firewall or Proxy Blocking ‘webRequest’ API">
Adjust firewall or proxy configurations to allow browser extensions to access network request data or whitelist the browser process.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported Browser or Platform">
uBO Scope is currently only supported on Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari at the stated version minimums. Avoid installing on other browsers.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Next Steps

Once you have confirmed that your system meets these prerequisites, proceed to the [Installation Instructions](https://your-docs-site.com/getting-started/essential-setup-guide/installation-instructions) to add uBO Scope to your browser.


---

#### Supporting Information from Manifests

Each browser platform declares min version and permissions in its manifest, for example:

```json
// Chromium manifest snippet
"minimum_chrome_version": "122.0",
"permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
"host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*", "wss://*/*", "ws://*/*"]
```

```json
// Firefox manifest snippet
"browser_specific_settings": {
  "gecko": {
    "strict_min_version": "128.0"
  }
},
"permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"]
```

```json
// Safari manifest snippet
"browser_specific_settings": {
  "safari": {
    "strict_min_version": "18.5"
  }
},
"permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"]
```

These ensure the extension only installs on compatible browsers with the required permissions.
