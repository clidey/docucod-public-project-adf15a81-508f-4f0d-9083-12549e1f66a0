# Quick Validation & First Observation

Confirm that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browsing with these simple, practical tests. This guide walks you through opening the extension's popup on any webpage, checking the badge count on the toolbar icon, and interpreting the initial network connection results. By following this quick checklist, you ensure that uBO Scope is working properly and providing accurate remote server connection insights.

---

## 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup on an Active Webpage

1. Navigate to any webpage in your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
2. Locate the uBO Scope extension icon on your browser toolbar. It typically displays the uBO Scope logo.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon once to open its popup window.

<Tip>
Opening the popup on an active tab triggers uBO Scope to display the current monitoring summary for that page, showing the remote servers contacted.
</Tip>

## 2. Check the Toolbar Badge Count

- Observe the numeric badge displayed directly on the uBO Scope extension icon.

- The badge number represents the count of distinct third-party remote domains with which your current tab has successfully connected.

- Remember, a lower badge count generally indicates fewer third-party connections, which is typically better for privacy.

<Note>
The badge count updates dynamically as network requests complete and can sometimes briefly show zero or no number if the page has not yet loaded or no third-party connections were observed.
</Note>

## 3. Understand the Popup's Initial Results

The popup divides network requests into three outcome categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which connections succeeded without interception.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were made but blocked in a stealthy manner, often used by content blockers to avoid detection by websites.
- **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked by your active content blocker through network errors or refusals.

### How to Read the Popup Layout

- **Hostname Display:** At the top, your active tab's hostname and main domain are shown plainly.
- **Domains Connected (Summary):** A quick numeric summary shows how many distinct domains were contacted.
- **Outcome Sections:** Each category lists domains along with how many requests succeeded, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

<Tip>
Focus on the 'not blocked' section to identify which third-party servers your current webpage truly connects to. This helps spot any potentially unwanted connections.
</Tip>

## 4. Verify Expected Behavior

- If you see the hostname reflect your current website, the extension is actively monitoring this tab.
- A visible badge count greater than zero confirms active counting of third-party network connections.
- A populated popup with domains listed under allowed or blocked sections signals proper data collection.

<Warning>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or the badge remains blank despite browsing webpages, the extension might not be monitoring correctly. Consider restarting the browser or reinstalling the extension.
</Warning>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Initial Issues

- **Popup Shows "NO DATA":** Ensure you clicked the extension icon on a loaded webpage, not on blank tabs or internal browser pages.
- **Badge Does Not Update:** Network requests may be delayed or blocked by other extensions; disable conflicting extensions temporarily.
- **No Domains Listed:** Confirm the extension permissions include access to active tabs and web requests.

<Check>
Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../essential-setup-guide/troubleshooting-common-issues) guide if problems persist.
</Check>

## 6. Next Steps After Validation

- Explore the [Understanding Domain Connections and Badge Counts](../../interpreteresults/understanding-domain-connections) page to deepen insight into what your results mean.
- Use [Comparing Content Blockers with uBO-Scope](../../interpreteresults/comparing-content-blockers) to see how uBO Scope helps evaluate filtering effectiveness.
- Try browsing different websites and observe how the popup and badge counts change in real time.

### Additional Tips

- **Badge Interpretation:** The badge counts only third-party domains, which excludes the main siteâ€™s domain.
- **Popup Refresh:** The popup refreshes data each time it is opened, reflecting recent browsing activity.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Make sure you are on a supported browser version; older versions might prevent proper operation.

### Visual Reference Sample from Popup

```html
<h2 id="tabHostname"><span></span><span>NO DATA</span></h2>
<section id="summary">
    domains connected: <span>?</span>
</section>
<section class="outcome allowed">
    <h3>not blocked</h3>
    <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
<section class="outcome stealth">
    <h3>stealth-blocked</h3>
    <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
<section class="outcome blocked">
    <h3>blocked</h3>
    <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
```

This popup will populate with your current third-party connection details after successful validation.
