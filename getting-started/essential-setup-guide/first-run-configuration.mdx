# First Run & Initial Configuration

Welcome to your first interaction with **uBO Scope**. After installing the extension, this guide will help you immediately get started by showing how to open the **uBO Scope popup**, understand the **toolbar badge count**, and interpret what these indicators reveal about third-party connections observed on the active webpage.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

The **uBO Scope** extension provides you with detailed insights through its popup interface, accessible directly from the browser toolbar.

### Steps to Open the Popup

1. Locate the **uBO Scope icon** (a shield-shaped symbol) on your browser's extension toolbar. It will usually be near the address bar.
2. Click the icon once. This action opens the **uBO Scope popup**, a panel summarizing network connection data for the current active tab.

<Tip>
If the icon is hidden behind the browser's extension overflow menu, click the toolbar's extensions menu (often a puzzle-piece symbol) and then click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Badge Count

On the toolbar icon of uBO Scope, you'll notice a numerical badge. This badge is a quick indicator designed to help you grasp the privacy exposure of the active tab.

### What the Badge Count Represents

- The badge number shows **how many distinct third-party domains** the active webpage has connected to or attempted to connect to **successfully**.
- A **higher number means more third-party connections**, which often implies wider web tracking exposure.
- A **blank badge** means no third-party connections were counted for the active tab.

### Why This Matters

Not all third-party connections are harmful—many websites legitimately load assets from Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) or partners. However, **uBO Scope highlights the extent of these connections in real time, empowering you to assess and control your browsing exposure.**

<Info>
Remember, the badge count is based on unique third-party domains detected **after the page finishes loading or during navigation**.
</Info>

## 3. Interpreting the Popup Contents

The popup provides a transparent breakdown of network outcomes by third-party domains associated with the active browser tab.

### Popup Sections

- **Domain Header:** Shows the _current tab's hostname_ and its main domain.
- **Summary Section:** Displays the total **number of distinct connected domains**.
- **Allowed:** Lists third-party domains for which network requests were allowed.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Lists third-party domains whose requests were stealthily blocked, a form of blocking done without the website's detection.
- **Blocked:** Lists third-party domains explicitly blocked.

### Using the Popup

1. Upon opening, review the top header that identifies the page domain.
2. Check the **domains connected** count for a quick overview.
3. Scroll through the **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** lists to see which third parties were contacted or prevented.
4. Each domain entry shows the number of requests observed.

<Tip>
Hovering over the badge count or domains in the popup is not necessary—the badge is a direct count, and the popup gives detailed counts for each domain.
</Tip>

## 4. Example User Flow

Let's say you've just installed uBO Scope and want to check the active website's third-party connections:

- You click the toolbar icon; the popup opens.
- The badge shows "5," indicating five distinct third-party domains connected.
- In the popup, you see under **Allowed** domains such as `cdn.example.com` and `analytics.partnersite.org` with counts showing how many resources each served.
- Under **Stealth-Blocked**, you see a few domains that your browser silently blocked without the website’s awareness.
- Under **Blocked**, you find domains your content blocker actively prevented.

This immediate visibility lets you understand your browsing exposure and which external servers your browser communicated with.

## 5. Tips for First-Time Users

- **Refresh the web page** before checking uBO Scope to capture all network events.
- **Switch tabs** and observe badge counts to compare third-party exposure across sites.
- Use uBO Scope as a companion to your content blocker; the allowed list shows third-party connections that passed through.

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting First Run Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or No Domain Info">

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- Confirm that uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Try toggling the extension off and on in your browser’s extensions page.
- Reload the current tab to force new network requests.
- Check browser permissions to ensure uBO Scope has access to network requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains List in Popup is Empty or Incomplete">
- Network request logging starts only after installation; it won't show historical data.
- Switch to different active tabs and refresh them to generate data.
- Content blockers or browser privacy settings may prevent latest network info; verify their configuration.
</Accordion>
