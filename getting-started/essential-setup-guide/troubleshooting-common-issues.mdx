# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

When setting up uBO Scope, you might encounter a few common problems related to browser compatibility, permissions, or missing data in the popup interface. This guide helps you quickly identify, understand, and resolve these issues to ensure a smooth experience from installation through first use.

---

## 1. Unsupported Browser or Version

### Problem:
You installed uBO Scope, but it does not activate or display expected data.

### Cause:
The extension requires specific browsers and minimum versions:

- **Chromium-based browsers:** Version 122 or higher
- **Firefox:** Version 128 or higher
- **Safari:** Version 18.5 or higher

Earlier versions lack necessary APIs or permissions.

### Solution:

1. Verify your browser and version:
   - In Chrome/Chromium: `chrome://settings/help`
   - In Firefox: `about:support`
   - In Safari: `Safari > About Safari`
2. Upgrade your browser to a supported version if needed.
3. Restart the browser after updating.

<Check>
You can confirm your browser is supported by checking the [Supported Browsers & Integration Points](https://example.com/overview/architecture-workflows/browser-integration) documentation.
</Check>

## 2. Extension Permissions Not Granted or Misconfigured

### Problem:
The extension popup shows 'NO DATA', or the badge icon does not update.

### Cause:
uBO Scope depends on these permissions to access network information:

- `activeTab` — to interact with the current tab
- `storage` — to persist session and configuration data
- `webRequest` — to monitor network requests

Permissions may be blocked or missing due to browser settings or manual changes.

### Solution:

1. Check extension permissions:
   - Chromium: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, locate uBO Scope, and click 'Details'. Confirm all permissions are enabled.
   - Firefox: Go to `about:addons`, find uBO Scope, click on permissions or preferences to verify.
2. Reinstall the extension if permission prompts did not appear or were denied.
3. For Safari, ensure you enable the extension in Safari's Preferences under the Extensions tab.

<Tip>
If the extension was installed from outside official stores, some permissions may be restricted by browser security policies.
</Tip>

## 3. Missing or Incomplete Data in Popup

### Problem:
Opening the uBO Scope popup shows 'NO DATA' or partial domain lists despite active browsing.

### Cause:
This usually means the extension did not capture network events correctly for the current tab, which can be caused by:

- Tab switching before data collection completes
- Browsing in private/incognito modes where extension access is limited
- Network requests being blocked before the extension can monitor them
- Browser API limitations or conflicts with other extensions

### Solution:

1. Make sure the tab is fully loaded and active before opening the popup.
2. Avoid using uBO Scope in incognito/private modes unless the extension is explicitly allowed there.
3. Disable conflicting privacy or content blocker extensions to see if results improve.
4. Refresh the tab and then open the popup to trigger fresh data collection.

<Warning>
Some network requests happen outside the browser webRequest API's reach (e.g., certain DNS-based blocking). uBO Scope cannot detect these.
</Warning>

## 4. Badge Count Does Not Update or Shows Incorrect Values

### Problem:
The toolbar badge count might remain empty or out-of-sync with expected third-party domains.

### Cause:
The badge is updated based on network request outcomes tracked per tab. Failures can occur if:

- The extension session is corrupted or not saved properly
- Background service worker or scripts are terminated prematurely
- Network requests have no confirmed successful response

### Solution:

1. Restart the browser to reset extension background scripts.
2. Clear extension storage manually if persistent issues occur:
   - Go to extension settings and clear data if provided, or
   - Use browser developer tools to clear storage for the extension
3. Allow some browsing time and interact with different tabs, then check if counts update.

<Note>
The badge count represents distinct allowed third-party remote domains, not total requests. A lower count typically indicates less third-party exposure.
</Note>

## 5. Troubleshooting Steps Summary

Follow this checklist to diagnose and resolve setup problems:

- **Verify Browser Compatibility:** Confirm supported browser and version.
- **Check Permissions:** Make sure all required permissions are granted.
- **Confirm Extension Activation:** Reload tabs or reinstall the extension.
- **Avoid Private Mode Limitations:** Use the extension in normal browsing mode.
- **Handle Conflicts:** Disable other extensions that might interfere.
- **Restart Browser:** Refresh background scripts and session data.
- **Validate Network Traffic:** Open the popup on a fully loaded tab.
