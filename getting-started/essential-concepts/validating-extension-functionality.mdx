# Confirming uBO Scope Works As Expected

uBO Scope provides real-time visibility into the third-party network connections your browser makes. This guide helps you quickly verify that the extension is functioning correctly by observing its toolbar badge updates and inspecting the detailed popup report for the active browser tab.

---

## 1. What to Expect After Installation

Once uBO Scope is installed and active, here’s what a healthy, working setup looks like:

- **Toolbar Badge**: Displays a number representing the count of distinct third-party domains that your current tab has connected to successfully.
- **Popup Interface**: Shows categorized lists of domains based on connection outcomes — `not blocked`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked`.
- **Data Updates**: The badge and popup update dynamically as you load web pages and network requests happen.

<u>Important:</u> The badge count reflects the number of unique allowed domains connected in the current tab only. A lower count usually indicates fewer third-party connections.

---

## 2. Verifying the Toolbar Badge Count

Follow these steps to check if the badge count reflects network activity:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a Webpage">Navigate to any website in your active browser tab. Modern websites with third-party resources like analytics, ads, or CDNs often trigger network connections that uBO Scope detects.</Step>
  <Step title="Observe the Toolbar Icon">
    Look at the uBO Scope toolbar icon near your address bar.

    - If the badge is blank, it means no third-party connections were detected.
    - If a number appears, it indicates the count of distinct domains connected successfully.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reload the Page">
    Refresh the webpage to see the badge count update in real time. The number should change according to the network requests executed by the page.
  
    If the badge never appears or never updates, there could be a setup or permission issue.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
If the badge remains empty for most sites, try opening different pages or ensure you have granted permissions properly.
</Check>

## 3. Inspecting the Popup Network Connection Summary

The popup offers a comprehensive view of the network request outcomes for the active tab.

### How to Open the Popup

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar to open the popup.

### Understanding Connection Categories

The popup groups domains as follows:

- **Not Blocked**: Domains that were connected successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where network requests were redirected or manipulated stealthily (may appear as blocking without direct user notice).
- **Blocked**: Domains with network requests that failed or were blocked.

### Verifying Popup Content

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Domain Name Display">
    The top heading shows the hostname and its main domain for the active tab.

    For internationalized domain names, uBO Scope converts and displays them in Unicode for readability.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Look at Domain Lists">
    Under each category section, you will see a list of domains along with counts showing how many times connections were made or blocked.

    The number of `'not blocked'` domains should generally correspond with the toolbar badge count.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Data Refresh">
    Reload the active page while the popup is open or reopen the popup after navigation. The data should update to reflect new network activity.

    If the popup remains empty or stale, it can indicate a communication problem between the background service and popup UI.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Early Issues

### Badge Does Not Appear or Update

- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled in your browser’s extension manager.
- Ensure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions:
  - `webRequest` permission to monitor network requests.
  - Host permissions allow monitoring all URLs (e.g., `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`).
- Try restarting the browser to reload extension resources.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions preventing badge updates.

### Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Empty

- Navigate to a site with active network activity and reopen the popup.
- Confirm the active tab in the popup matches the page you are testing.
- If persistent, reload the extension or browser.

### Unexpected Badge Counts

- Understand that the badge shows unique distinct domains (not individual requests).
- Some connections might be stealthily redirected or blocked, affecting counts.
- Refer to the **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** lists in the popup for clarity.

## 5. Real-World Validation Scenario

To confidently confirm uBO Scope works:

1. Open a mainstream website you know loads third-party content (e.g., a popular news site).
2. Watch the badge update after page load with a numeric count.
3. Open the popup and verify at least some domains are listed under `not blocked` or `blocked`.
4. Reload the page and observe dynamic updates both in badge and popup data.

This practical test ensures the extension actively monitors and reports network requests tied to your current browsing context.
