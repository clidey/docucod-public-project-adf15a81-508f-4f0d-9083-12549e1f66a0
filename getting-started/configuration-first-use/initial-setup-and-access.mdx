# Set Up & Open the Extension

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through locating and launching the extension from your browser toolbar. You will learn how to handle the permissions requested upon installation and get familiar with the initial popup interface, so you can start monitoring your browser’s network activity instantly.

---

## 1. Locate the uBO Scope Extension Icon

After installing uBO Scope in your browser (see Installation Instructions for your platform), your first step is to find the extension icon in the browser toolbar.

- **Look for the uBO Scope icon:** The icon uses the uBO Scope logo in various sizes (typically 16x16, 32x32 pixels, etc.).
- **Browser toolbar location:**
  - In Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave), the icon generally appears in the upper-right corner near the address bar.
  - In Firefox, the icon may appear alongside your other extensions or inside an "overflow" menu accessible by clicking the puzzle piece icon.
  - In Safari, the icon will be on the toolbar near the address bar once enabled.

If you do not see the icon immediately:

- Check your extension management page and ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
- Pin the icon to the toolbar if your browser offers this option.

<Check>
Ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled before proceeding. Refer to the [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) if you need assistance installing the extension.

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface

Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar to open the popup. This interface is your control panel for viewing network activity detected by the extension.

- **Initial load:** The popup will request permission to access data related to your active tab, such as network requests.
- **Permissions requested:**
  - **Access to current tab data:** Essential for monitoring network requests made by the webpage.
  - **WebRequest permission:** Allows the extension to observe network traffic.
  - **Storage permission:** Used to store temporary session data.

Granting these permissions is crucial for uBO Scope to function properly.

<Tip>
Permissions are handled by your browser’s extension management system. Review requested permissions carefully to maintain your security and privacy.
</Tip>

## 3. Understand the Initial Popup Appearance

Once opened, the uBO Scope popup will present:

- **Hostname display:** Shows the domain currently monitored in the active tab.
- **Domains connected summary:** A count of distinct remote third-party domains to which connections have been made.
- **Three network outcome sections:**
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains where network connections were allowed successfully.
  - **Stealth Blocked:** Domains where connections were blocked stealthily by other blockers, but detected by uBO Scope.
  - **Blocked:** Domains for which uBO Scope recorded blocked connection attempts.

Each domain entry includes a count indicating how many times connections were attempted or blocked during the session.

<Note>
If you see "NO DATA" or zero counts, it means uBO Scope has not detected network activity for the current tab yet. Reload the webpage or navigate to a new page to start capturing data.
</Note>

## 4. Check the Toolbar Icon Badge

uBO Scope’s icon displays a small badge number indicating the number of distinct third-party domains contacted by the active tab.

- A **lower badge count** means fewer third-party connections, which generally indicates greater privacy.
- The badge updates dynamically as network requests are monitored.


tl;dr: The badge number is your at-a-glance privacy indicator.

## 5. Best Practices

- **Keep uBO Scope visible:** Pin the extension icon to stay aware of network activity at all times.
- **Reload tabs after installation:** To ensure uBO Scope starts monitoring immediately.
- **Review the summary regularly:** Look at the "Not Blocked" vs. "Blocked" domains to understand what connections are allowed or blocked.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Startup Issues
