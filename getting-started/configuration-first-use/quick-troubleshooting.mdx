# Troubleshooting & Validation

Ensure uBO Scope is correctly installed and functioning by walking through common setup issues, verifying permissions, and validating data display. This guide empowers you to quickly identify and fix problems that might prevent the extension from working as intended.

---

## 1. Extension Not Visible in Browser Toolbar

If you cannot find the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar, follow these steps:

1. **Confirm Installation**
   - Open your browser's extensions page:
     - Chromium/Chrome: `chrome://extensions`
     - Firefox: `about:addons`
     - Safari: Preferences > Extensions
   - Verify that **uBlock Origin Scope (uBO Scope)** is installed and enabled.

2. **Pin the Extension (for Chromium browsers)**
   - Click the puzzle-piece icon near the address bar.
   - Find uBO Scope and click the pin icon to keep it visible.

3. **Check Browser Version Compatibility**
   - Ensure your browser version meets the minimum requirements:
     - Chromium-based browsers: version 122 or newer
     - Firefox: version 128 or newer
     - Safari: version 18.5 or newer
   - Upgrade your browser if needed.

<Check>
Always ensure extensions are enabled and visible in your browser's toolbar for easy access.
</Check>

## 2. Permissions Not Granted or Issues With Web Request Monitoring

uBO Scope relies on certain permissions to observe network traffic accurately. Problems in permissions may cause it to show no data.

1. **Verify Extension Permissions**
   - Confirm the extension has:
     - Access to active tab
     - Storage access
     - `webRequest` API permissions
   - In the extension management page, check under "Permissions" or "Site Access".

2. **Host Permissions**
   - The extension requires access to all HTTP(S) and WebSocket URLs as declared:
     - `http://*/*`
     - `https://*/*`
     - `ws://*/*`
     - `wss://*/*`
   - If the browser blocks or limits such permissions, requests may not be captured.

3. **Reload the Extension**
   - Sometimes, after installation or browser update, permissions need refreshing.
   - Disable and re-enable the extension or reload it in the extensions page.

4. **Private/Incognito Mode**
   - Ensure uBO Scope is allowed to run in private/incognito mode if you are testing there.

<Warning>
Browser restrictions or security settings can limit access to network events, resulting in empty or incomplete data.
</Warning>

## 3. No Data Displayed in the Popup

If the uBO Scope popup shows "NO DATA" or zero connections:

1. **Check Active Tab**
   - uBO Scope shows network data per active browser tab.
   - Make sure you open the popup on an active tab with network activity.

2. **Wait for Network Activity**
   - If the page hasn’t finished loading or made network requests, data will be sparse.
   - Refresh the page and then open the popup.

3. **Verify Network Monitoring is Working**
   - Open Developer Tools > Network tab to ensure the page is making external requests.
   - If no such requests appear, the extension can only report what the browser requests.

4. **Badge Count Consistency**
   - The toolbar icon badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
   - A zero badge means no connections detected or recorded on that tab.

5. **Extension Conflicts**
   - Other extensions that intercept or modify `webRequest` events might interfere with uBO Scope.
   - Try disabling other network-related extensions temporarily.

## 4. Quick Validation Steps

Follow these quick checks to verify uBO Scope is functional:

1. Open a webpage that loads external resources (e.g., news site, social media platform).
2. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar to open the popup.
3. Observe the badge count on the extension icon - it should show a numeric value representing connected domains.
4. In the popup, check the sections labeled **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**, listing domain names and connection counts.
5. Confirm that the domain entries match typical third-party services, such as CDN providers or analytics servers.

<Check>
You should see a realistic number of connected domains reflecting the page's third-party network activity.
</Check>

---

## 5. Checking Browser Restrictions

Some browsers impose special restrictions on extensions:

- **Firefox:** Verify that uBO Scope’s `webRequest` permissions are active. Newer Firefox versions require explicit user approval.
- **Chromium:** Extensions must comply with Manifest V3. Ensure your browser is updated to supported versions.
- **Safari:** Limited host permissions; only HTTP(S) URLs are allowed, no WebSocket capture support.

If you suspect specific restrictions, refer to your browser’s extension debugging tools or logs.
