# Run Your First Network Analysis with uBO Scope

After successfully installing uBO Scope, it's time to put it to work by analyzing network connections on an active webpage. This guide walks you through how to open the extension's popup interface, understand the badge number displayed on the toolbar icon, and interpret the categorization of remote server connections shown in the popup.

---

## 1. Open the Extension Popup and Verify It's Active

uBO Scope operates per browser tab, collecting data about remote server connections made by the active webpage.

### Steps:

1. Navigate to a website you want to analyze. For example, visit your favorite news or shopping site.
2. Locate the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser's toolbar. It typically appears near the address bar as a small icon matching the extension's logo.
3. Click on the uBO Scope icon. This opens a popup window showing network connection details for the current tab.

<Tip>
If the popup does not appear or shows no data, ensure the extension is enabled and that you have navigated to a fully loaded webpage.
</Tip>

## 2. Understand the Badge Number on the Toolbar Icon

The numeric badge on the extension's icon reports the **number of distinct third-party domains** your current tab has connected to successfully.

- A **lower badge number indicates fewer third-party connections**, which is generally preferable.
- This count reflects domains that the browser actually fetched resources from, not just blocked attempts.

### How It Works:

- When you load a tab, uBO Scope tracks network requests and updates this count in real time.
- Only domains classified as "allowed" (not blocked) contribute to the badge number.

<Note>
The badge updates automatically and provides an immediate glimpse of third-party network exposure per tab.
</Note>

## 3. Explore the Popup Interface

The popup window organizes domain connections into three categories, each representing the outcome of network requests:

| Category       | Description                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **not blocked** (Allowed) | Domains from which your browser successfully fetched resources. |
| **stealth-blocked**       | Domains where blockers intervened in a way that the webpage cannot detect but prevents resource loading. |
| **blocked**               | Domains where connection attempts were outright blocked by content blockers or network failures. |

### Interface Breakdown:

- **Hostname Display:** Shows the current tab's hostname and its registered domain, helping you identify which website is being analyzed.
- **Domains Connected:** The number listed at the top summarizes how many distinct domains the current tab connected to (matching the badge count).
- **Domain Lists:** Each section lists domains under its outcome category, with a count badge indicating the number of requests for that domain.

### Example Visualization:

```plaintext
Hostname:  www.example.com  example.com

domains connected: 12

not blocked
 - cdn.examplecdn.com [5]
 - analytics.someservice.com [3]

stealth-blocked
 - tracker.hidden.net [2]

blocked
 - ads.thirdpartyad.com [4]
```

<Tip>
Clicking the extension icon again refreshes the popup with the latest data for the active tab. Switching tabs and reopening the popup shows data respective to the selected tab.
</Tip>

## 4. Run a Sample Check: Analyze a Popular Website

To see uBO Scope in action and understand your real browsing exposure:

1. Open a popular website with known third-party content, such as https://news.ycombinator.com
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. Observe the badge number and popup lists update dynamically as the page loads additional resources.

You should see a balance of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains according to your browser's content blocking setup.

## 5. Interpreting Results and Next Steps

- Use the badge number and domain lists to gauge how many third-party servers your browser connects to.
- Compare results when visiting different websites to understand exposure.
- Combine insights with your content blocker configuration to fine-tune privacy preferences.

If you see unexpectedly high allowed connections or many blocked domains, you may want to:

- Review your content blocker settings.
- Investigate specific domains listed in the popup.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues Opening the Popup and Viewing Data">
<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' or '?' domains connected">
- Make sure the current tab is fully loaded; uBO Scope collects data only from active, loaded tabs.
- Confirm the extension has permission to access the current site.
- Try switching tabs and reopening the popup to refresh data.
- Reload the page to generate fresh network requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge number does not appear or update">
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and visible in the toolbar.
- Some browsers may hide badges for inactive tabs; select the tab to update.
- Restart the browser to reset extension state.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

By viewing the uBO Scope popup after visiting a website, you gain transparent real-time insight into the remote server connections your browser makes. The badge number provides a quick summary of distinct allowed third-party servers, while the categorized domain lists deepen your understanding of network outcomes.

This first analysis enables you to begin assessing your exposure and configuring your environment for privacy or debugging needs.
