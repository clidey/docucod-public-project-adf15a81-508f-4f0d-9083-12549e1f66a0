1. Open Firefox.
2. Visit the [uBO Scope Firefox Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
3. Click **Add to Firefox** and allow the permissions request.
4. Once added, the uBO Scope icon will be visible near the address bar.


### 3. Installing on Safari

2. Visit any website and observe the badge on the uBO Scope icon increment, indicating detected third-party connections.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup showing connection details per domain — this confirms the extension is actively monitoring network connections.

## Manual Installation for Advanced Users

If you prefer or need to install the extension manually (e.g., for development or environments without extension store access), follow these steps:

### Download and Prepare

1. Clone or download the uBO Scope repository from GitHub: [https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope)
2. Use the `tools/make-package.sh` script to build your platform-specific extension package. Example:

```bash
./tools/make-package.sh chromium
```

This creates a build directory with the extension files for Chromium. Similar commands apply for `firefox` and `safari`.

### Loading in Browser

- **Chromium**: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable Developer mode, click **Load unpacked**, and select the generated build directory for Chromium.
- **Firefox**: Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click **Load Temporary Add-on**, and select any file inside the build directory (e.g., manifest.json).
- **Safari**: Use Xcode to open the macOS Safari extension project and run it locally.


<Warning>
Manual installation should only be attempted if you understand browser extension environments and API requirements. Automated update mechanisms are disabled for manual installs.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Extension Not Appearing in Toolbar**
  - Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser's extension manager.
  - Manually pin the extension icon to the toolbar if hidden.

- **Badge Count Not Updating**
  - Verify you are visiting typical websites (uBO Scope reports network connections; some sites may not connect to third parties).
  - Reload the active webpage.

- **Browser Version Compatibility**
  - Confirm your browser meets or exceeds the minimum version listed earlier.

- **Permissions Not Granted**
  - uBO Scope requires permissions to access all website data; check and grant these if prompted.

- **Conflicts with Other Extensions**
  - uBO Scope works alongside popular content blockers but may be limited by browser API constraints.
  - Disable conflicting extensions temporarily to isolate issues.

<Tip>
If problems persist, restart your browser or consult the [Supported Browsers & System Requirements guide](../getting-started/installation-and-prerequisites/system-requirements) for deeper diagnostics.
