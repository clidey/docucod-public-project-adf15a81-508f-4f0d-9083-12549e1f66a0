# Supported Browsers & System Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the following criteria before installing uBO Scope to guarantee optimal performance and compatibility.

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is officially supported on the latest versions of the three major browsers below. Confirm your browser meets the minimum version requirements for a seamless installation and operation.

| Browser        | Minimum Supported Version | Notes                          |
|----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Google Chrome  | 122.0+                    | Chromium-based browsers supported with Manifest V3 and service worker background scripts.
| Mozilla Firefox| 128.0+                    | Includes desktop and Firefox for Android.
| Safari         | 18.5+                     | Requires Safari 18.5 or later due to background script support.


### Browser-Specific Details

- **Chrome & Chromium-based browsers:**
  - Requires Chrome version 122.0 or higher.
  - Uses Manifest Version 3 with a service worker as the background script.
  - Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).

- **Firefox:**
  - Requires Firefox version 128.0 or higher.
  - Supports both desktop and Android versions.
  - Uses Manifest Version 3 with module-type background scripts.
  - Available on [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).

- **Safari:**
  - Requires Safari 18.5 or newer for proper support.
  - Uses Manifest Version 3 with module-type background scripts.
  - Must be installed from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com) as an extension.


## 2. System-Level Requirements

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension, but meeting these system prerequisites ensures stable operation:

- **Operating Systems:**
  - Windows 10/11, macOS Ventura (or later), Linux distributions supporting latest browsers.
  - Android 13+ for Firefox mobile.
- **Memory & CPU:** No special hardware requirements; modern systems easily support uBO Scope.
- **Disk Space:** Minimal (<10 MB) since it’s an extension.


## 3. Network and Permissions Considerations

- **Network Access:** uBO Scope requires the browser’s permission to monitor and report on all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket (ws:// and wss://) requests.
- **Permissions Needed:** 
  - `activeTab` — to access the currently active tab's network activity.
  - `storage` — to persist session data and settings.
  - `webRequest` — to observe network connections and their outcomes.
- **Host Permissions:** 
  - Access to all URLs is required, including:
    - `http://*/*`
    - `https://*/*`
    - `ws://*/*`
    - `wss://*/*`


## 4. Platform-Specific Notes

- **Linux Users:** No specific constraints beyond browser requirements.
- **Android:** Only Firefox on Android is currently supported and must be version 128 or above.
- **Safari:** Safari extensions running on macOS require the extension to be signed and distributed through the Apple ecosystem.


## 5. How to Verify Browser Compatibility

Follow these steps to confirm your browser meets requirements before installation:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Version">
Open your browser and navigate to the 'About' page:

- Chrome: go to `chrome://settings/help`
- Firefox: go to `about:support`
- Safari: Click Safari > About Safari

Verify the version meets or exceeds the minimum stated above.
</Step>
<Step title="Ensure Manifest Version 3 Support">
Confirm your browser supports extensions using Manifest V3:
- For Chrome/Chromium and Firefox recent versions, Manifest V3 is supported by default.
- Safari from version 18.5 supports Manifest V3 extensions.
</Step>
</Steps>
