# Troubleshooting Installation & Startup Issues

Ensure uBO Scope works flawlessly from the moment you install it. This guide addresses the most frequent setup problems, such as missing badge counts, empty popup displays, and permission errors. Follow these clear, step-by-step troubleshooting workflows to confirm your installation is complete and the extension is running as expected.

---

## 1. Verifying uBO Scope Installation

Before diving into troubleshooting, confirm the extension is installed correctly.

### Steps:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon** on your browser toolbar. It typically appears as the uBO Scope logo.
2. **Click the icon** to open the popup panel.
3. **Check for the badge number** (a count indicating distinct third-party remote servers connected).

   - If the badge is missing or blank, continue to the troubleshooting steps below.
   - If the popup displays "NO DATA" or is empty, follow the popup-specific checks.

### Tips:
- A visible badge count is essential for real-time monitoring.
- The popup panel summarizes network connections; if empty, the extension may not be capturing data.


## 2. Common Issues and How to Fix Them

### Issue: Badge Count Does Not Appear

#### Cause:
- Permissions not granted or insufficient for `webRequest` API.
- Extension disabled or blocked by browser.

#### Resolution Steps:

1. **Check Extension Permissions:**

   - Go to your browser’s extensions page (`chrome://extensions/`, `about:addons`, or Safari extension preferences).
   - Confirm uBO Scope has permissions including `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and host permissions (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` where applicable).

2. **Verify Host Permissions:**

   - uBO Scope needs access to the URLs you visit to capture requests.
   - If you use restricted-site modes or profiles with privacy settings, ensure these do not block extensions.

3. **Restart Browser:**

   - After granting permissions, restart your browser to reload the extension fully.

4. **Check for Conflicting Extensions:**

   - Disable other extensions that may interfere with `webRequest` or network monitoring.

5. **Reinstall uBO Scope:**

   - Remove and reinstall the extension if issues persist.

<Check>
Make sure your browser version meets the minimum supported version:
- Chromium browsers: version 122 or later
- Firefox: version 128 or later
- Safari: version 18.5 or later

Using outdated browser versions can cause permission or API access issues.

### Issue: Popup Displays "NO DATA" or Is Empty

#### Cause:
- Extension’s background service worker or script is not running.
- Background script didn’t load the Public Suffix List or session data correctly.
- No active tab with network requests during popup opening.

#### Resolution Steps:

1. **Refresh Active Tab:**

   - Reload the webpage in the current active tab to generate fresh network requests.

2. **Close and Reopen the Popup:**

   - Sometimes popup UI needs to be reopened after tab refresh.

3. **Check Background Activity:**

   - Disable and re-enable the extension to restart background scripts.

4. **Verify Network Access:**

   - Confirm your firewall or browser policies do not block uBO Scope’s internal scripts or background data fetching.

5. **Validate Permissions:**

   - Confirm the extension has the required host permissions to monitor the active tab’s URLs.

6. **Try Another Tab:**

   - Switch to a different tab known to generate network requests.

<Warning>
If the popup is permanently empty after these steps, the extension may be blocked by browser policy or security settings.
Contact your system administrator or check browser enterprise policies.
</Warning>


### Issue: Permission Errors in Console or Unexpected Behaviors

#### Cause:
- Browser privacy/security settings blocking extension APIs.
- Insufficient permissions declared in manifest.
- Temporary service worker eviction in Chromium browsers.

#### Resolution Steps:

1. **Check Browser Extension Settings:**

   - Verify all required permissions (especially `webRequest` and host permissions) are granted.

2. **Inspect Browser Console:**

   - Open your browser’s developer console for the extension (`chrome://extensions/`, then click 'background page' or inspect popup).
   - Look for errors related to permissions or API failures.

3. **Temporary Service Worker Recycling (Chromium):**

   - Expect that background service workers may unload/reload.
   - Reload or interact with the extension to restart the worker.

4. **Disable Restrictive Privacy Modes:**

   - Some modes block extension access to network requests.

5. **Reset Extension Settings:**

   - Clear extension storage if corruption is suspected (via browser extension management or clearing `storage` data).

6. **Reinstall the Extension:**

   - Remove and reinstall to restore default permissions.


## 3. Verification: Confirming uBO Scope Works Correctly

Follow these steps to verify that uBO Scope is operational:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a new tab and navigate to a busy website">
Load a site with multiple third-party resources, such as a news site or a popular blog.

<Step title="Observe the toolbar icon for the badge count">
Check that a number appears on the uBO Scope icon, indicating third-party connection counts.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the uBO Scope icon to open its popup panel">
Verify the popup displays a summary section with the total domains connected and sections listing allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine domain entries">
Confirm domains appear with counts, indicating live network activity.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>If the badge and popup function as described, uBO Scope is properly installed and monitoring network requests effectively.</Check>


## 4. Additional Tips & Best Practices

- **Browser Updates**: Always use the latest browser version compatible with uBO Scope for best results.
- **Manage Conflicting Extensions**: Disable other network monitoring or blocking extensions temporarily to isolate issues.
- **Session Persistence**: uBO Scope maintains network data per tab session; closing tabs will clear their data.
- **Platform Differences**: Note that Safari has limited WebSocket support, potentially affecting some network insights.
