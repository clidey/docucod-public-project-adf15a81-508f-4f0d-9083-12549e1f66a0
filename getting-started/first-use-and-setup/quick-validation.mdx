# Quick Validation: Is uBO Scope Working?

This quick validation guide helps you confirm that **uBO Scope** is successfully tracking and reporting web requests in your browser. By following a few simple checks involving visiting websites, observing the extension's icon badge, and inspecting popup data, you will confidently know that uBO Scope is active and functioning as intended.

---

## 1. Open the uBO Scope Extension

1. Locate the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
2. Click the icon to open the popup panel, which provides a live summary of network connection activity for the current browser tab.

<Tip>
If you do not see the icon, ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your browser extensions.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Visit a Variety of Websites

To generate network request data for uBO Scope to track, open multiple websites with different content and third-party elements, such as:

- News sites
- E-commerce stores
- Social media platforms
- Video streaming pages

This variety ensures uBO Scope detects different types of network connections.

<Tip>
Using popular or content-rich websites increases the chance to observe a wider variety of connections and outcomes.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Monitor the Toolbar Icon Badge

The badge number on the extension icon reports **the number of distinct third-party remote domains from which network connections have been allowed** on the active tab.

- A **non-zero badge count** means uBO Scope is tracking connections.
- A **zero or missing badge** may indicate no third-party connections or a startup/loading issue.

<Tip>
Lower badge values generally indicate fewer third-party connections, which is preferable for privacy.
</Tip>

<Warning>
If the badge never updates despite browsing multiple websites, check that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (see the installation instructions) and the background scripts are running.
</Warning>

## 4. Inspect the Popup Panel Details

When you open uBO Scope’s popup for the current tab, notice the following:

- **Hostname and Domain Display:** The header shows the current tab's hostname and main domain.
- **Summary Count:** Reports the total number of domains connected.
- **Outcome Sections:** Distinct sections list domains under:
  - `not blocked` (allowed connections)
  - `stealth-blocked` (redirected connections)
  - `blocked` (failed connections)

### How the Panel Updates

- Domains display alongside a count of the number of requests.
- Domains are sorted alphabetically within each outcome category.

<Tip>
Refresh the popup by closing and reopening it after navigating sites to see updated data.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Confirm Meaningful Data Presence

Validate the extension's operation by checking that:

- The **summary count** is greater than zero after browsing.
- The **domain lists** in all three outcomes contain entries.
- The domains shown correspond to sites or third parties that normally load with the visited webpages.

<Tip>
Use websites known for multiple resource requests (e.g., news portals) to generate richer data.
</Tip>

<Warning>
If the popup only shows 'NO DATA' or empty domains, make sure the page has finished loading and network requests have completed, then reopen the popup.
</Warning>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Quick Validation Issues">
<Accordion title="No Badge Number Appears">
- Verify that uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled in the browser extensions page.
- Confirm the browser version meets minimum requirements (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Look for errors in the browser’s extension console or background script logs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA or Empty Lists">
- Ensure you have active web requests on the tab by visiting different sites.
- Close and reopen the popup to refresh displayed data.
- If problem persists, reload the extension or restart the browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Number Does Not Update After Navigation">
- Confirm that the browser allows webRequest monitoring.
- Disable other conflicting extensions that might override webRequest listeners.
- Clear session storage by restarting the browser or reloading the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Counts and Domains Don't Reflect Expected Sites">
- Remember the badge and popup track **distinct third-party remote domains**, not all domains.
- Some requests may be blocked or stealth-blocked, reducing visible allowed connections.
- The Public Suffix List is used internally to group domains logically.
</Accordion>
