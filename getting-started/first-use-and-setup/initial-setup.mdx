# Launching uBO Scope for the First Time

Welcome to your first experience with **uBO Scope**, a powerful browser extension designed to give you real-time insights into the third-party network connections your browser initiates. This guide walks you through how to locate and open the extension from your browser, understand the badge count displayed on the toolbar icon, verify that uBO Scope is actively monitoring network requests, and interpret what you see in the main user interface when visiting web pages.

## 1. Accessing uBO Scope from Your Browser

After installing uBO Scope, here’s how to find and open it:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon** in your browser’s toolbar. It uses a distinct icon showing various pixel sizes (`16px`, `32px`, `64px`, or `128px`) depending on your browser and display scaling, but it will always appear as a small shield-like badge labeled `uBO Scope`.

2. **Click the toolbar icon** to open the popup panel.

   - The popup provides interactive details about network connections related to the current active tab.
   - This is the primary UI to review summarized connection information.

<Tip>
If the icon is not visible, check your browser’s extension menu or pin the extension in the toolbar for easier access.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Badge Count

The badge count on the uBO Scope icon shows the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** connected from the page you're currently viewing.

- Example: If the badge reads `5`, it means that 5 different third-party domains were contacted.
- **Lower counts typically indicate fewer third-party connections**, which may imply fewer privacy exposures.

### Important Notes:
- Not all third-party connections are harmful or unwanted; legitimate third parties such as CDNs or service providers usually appear.
- The extension counts only successfully observed network connections, regardless of what content blockers are in use.
- Connections outside browser API visibility (such as some WebSocket restrictions in Safari) may not be counted.

<Warning>
A high badge count doesn’t necessarily mean a privacy risk—it’s a measure of distinct domains contacted, not blocked requests.
</Warning>

## 3. Verifying Active Monitoring

To confirm uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browser tab’s network activity:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Webpage">
Navigate to any website using your browser.
</Step>
<Step title="Click on the uBO Scope Icon">
Open the popup panel by clicking the toolbar icon.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe Domains Connected">

- The popup’s main area will display the domain of the current tab clearly at the top.
- Sections below categorize domains involved in network traffic into groups such as `not blocked`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked`.
- At the top, the summary line shows the total **number of distinct connected domains**, which should reflect on the badge.

</Step>
<Step title="Check Badge Updates">
Reload the current webpage and watch the badge count update accordingly.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the badge does not update or the popup does not display any data, ensure that the extension has the necessary permissions activated (see installation guides). Also, try refreshing or reopening the tab to trigger data collection.
</Tip>

## 4. What You See in the Main UI

The main popup interface of uBO Scope presents a detailed but straightforward view:

- **Hostname Display:** At the top, you see the full hostname of the active tab’s website, split to highlight domain and subdomain details.

- **Summary Section:** Shows the total count of distinct connected domains.

- **Outcome Sections:** Three categorized lists show domains by their network request outcomes:
  - **Not blocked:** Connections allowed and successful.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Requests redirected or stealthily blocked (used internally to mark requests with special handling).
  - **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked connections.

Each entry shows the domain name and the count of connections made to that domain during the session.

### Example:
```text
Hostname: example.com
Domains connected: 3

not blocked
 - cdn.example.net (2 connections)
 - api.partner.com (1 connection)

stealth-blocked
 - ads.tracker.com (5 connections)

blocked
 - unwantedtracker.net (2 connections)
```

## 5. What to Expect After Your First Install

- uBO Scope starts collecting network request data immediately upon installation and permission grant.
- The badge count will appear empty until a webpage finishes loading and network data is collected.
- You may see a variety of legitimate third-party connections depending on the websites you visit.
- The extension respects browser-specific limitations (e.g., Safari limits WebSocket request monitoring).

<Note>
Make sure to refresh your active tabs after installation to allow uBO Scope to start monitoring fresh page loads and connections.
</Note>

## 6. Tips for a Smooth First Experience

- **Pin the extension icon** to your toolbar for quick access.
- Open multiple tabs to see independent badge counts per tab.
- Visit different websites to observe varied third-party connection patterns.
- Use uBO Scope as a complementary tool alongside your content blockers to audit your browsing privacy.
