# Quick Test: Is uBO Scope Working?

uBO Scope is designed to reveal live network activity for the active browser tab by monitoring remote connections to third-party servers. This quick test guide shows you how to validate that uBO Scope is functioning correctly by triggering network activity and interpreting the results shown in the extension's popup and toolbar badge.

---

## 1. Trigger a Test by Visiting a Sample Website

1. **Open your browser** where uBO Scope is installed (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
2. **Navigate to a site known to load multiple third-party resources**, for example, a popular news site or a web page with external ads and CDNs.
   - Alternatively, open a sample test page if available that triggers various network requests.

> As the page loads, uBO Scope listens to all network requests initiated by that tab and tracks their outcomes.

---

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup to View Connection Results

1. Click the **uBO Scope toolbar icon** next to the browser's address bar to open the popup panel.
2. Observe the following key sections in the popup:
  - **Domains Connected:** At the top summary, this shows the number of distinct domains contacted.
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Lists domains where connections were successfully established.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Shows domains whose requests were redirected stealthily by content blocking mechanisms.
  - **Blocked:** Lists domains where network requests failed or were explicitly blocked.

3. Each section displays individual domains along with a count badge indicating how many requests were made.

---

## 3. Understand the Toolbar Badge and Popup Indicators

- The **toolbar icon badge number** reflects the total number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected to in the active tab.
  - If no domains are connected yet, the badge will be empty.
- Domains shown under "**not blocked**" correspond to resources loaded despite any blocking policies.
- The "**stealth-blocked**" category represents requests that were transparently redirected or handled to prevent detection by webpages.
- The "**blocked**" section lists requests that failed due to content blocking rules or errors.


---

## 4. What You Should Expect to See

- Upon visiting a page with several external resources, uBO Scope will display multiple domains under the **Not Blocked** section.
  - The badge count on the toolbar icon should increase proportionally to the distinct domains connected.
- If you are running any content blocker alongside uBO Scope, some domains may appear under **Blocked** or **Stealth-Blocked**, reflecting the blocking outcomes.
- The data updates live as network requests progress, so opening the popup immediately after the page loads shows an overview of connection activity.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

- **No badge number visible or popup shows "NO DATA"**:
  - Ensure uBO Scope is correctly installed and enabled.
  - Refresh the active tab to retry capturing network requests.
  - Verify that your browser and uBO Scope versions meet minimum supported requirements.

- **Badge count remains static despite network activity:**
  - Confirm uBO Scope has permission to access webRequest API (usually granted at installation).
  - Check if the page uses protocols or connections that are outside the monitoring scope (e.g., some encrypted or background service calls).

- **Popup shows zero domains even on active websites:**
  - Try testing on a different site with known diverse third-party connections.
  - Disable other extensions that might interfere with network request reporting.

## 6. Optional: Use a Dedicated Test Page

If you want a controlled environment to test uBO Scope:

1. Open a simple test site that intentionally loads resources from various third-party domains.
2. Observe the popup updating the list of domains in real time.
3. Confirm that the badge count matches the number of distinct domains shown.


---

## Summary

Validating that uBO Scope is working involves visiting a webpage that initiates network connections, then opening the popup to observe how those connections are classified by outcome. The toolbar badge provides an at-a-glance count of connected third-party domains, while the popup panels break down the detailed status into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories.

Follow these steps anytime to confirm uBO Scope actively monitors network connections as intended.

## Additional Tips

- Remember that a **lower badge count is generally better**, indicating fewer third-party connections.
- Not all third-party connections are harmful; legitimate CDN usage often leads to a small count.
- Always test with real-world websites rather than artificial "ad-blocker test" pages for truthful results.
