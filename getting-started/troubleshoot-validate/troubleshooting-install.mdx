# Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

When installing uBO Scope for the first time, users sometimes encounter problems that prevent the extension from appearing correctly, functioning as expected, or starting in supported browsers. This guide highlights the most frequent issues and provides practical, step-by-step solutions so you can start monitoring your network connections reliably.

---

## 1. Extension Does Not Appear in the Browser Toolbar

If after installation you do not see the uBO Scope icon on your browser's toolbar:

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm Installation Success">
Verify that the extension is listed as installed/enabled:
- **Chrome**: Open `chrome://extensions` and ensure uBO Scope is present and enabled.
- **Firefox**: Open `about:addons` > Extensions, confirm uBO Scope is enabled.
- **Safari**: Open Safari’s Extensions preferences to confirm.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Browser Version Compatibility">
The supported minimum versions are:

- Chrome 122 or later
- Firefox 128 or later
- Safari 18.5 or later

Older versions will not support the extension properly.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable Toolbar Icon (if hidden)">
Sometimes the icon may be hidden:

- Look for a puzzle piece menu or overflow area and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.
- In Safari, ensure the extension is enabled in preferences.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If your browser version is below the minimum supported versions, update your browser to meet the compatibility requirements before reinstalling.
</Warning>

## 2. Permissions Not Granted or Extension Not Responding

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to function, including access to active tabs, request data, and storage.

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Permissions During Installation">
When installing, the browser prompts for permissions:

- Confirm you have accepted all requested permissions.
- Without these, uBO Scope cannot monitor network requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Manually Review Permissions">
- In **Chrome** and **Firefox**, visit the extension details page to ensure all permissions are granted.
- For Safari, check extension preferences.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload or Reinstall the Extension">
Sometimes permissions do not activate correctly on initial install:

- Disable and then re-enable the extension.
- Uninstall and reinstall the latest version.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Permissions like `webRequest` and `activeTab` are essential. Without them, uBO Scope cannot observe network connections.
</Tip>

## 3. Extension Fails on Unsupported Browsers or Environments

uBO Scope is designed specifically for Chromium (Chrome/Edge), Firefox, and Safari. It does not support other browsers or environments.

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Compatibility">
Confirm you are using one of the supported browsers:

- Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave) with version 122+
- Firefox version 128+
- Safari version 18.5+

Other browsers will not work with this extension.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Installation Package Matches Browser">
Ensure you installed the correct version of uBO Scope for your browser:

- Use the Chrome Web Store for Chrome
- Use Firefox Add-ons for Firefox
- Use Safari Extensions Gallery or direct install method for Safari
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Attempting to install the Safari version on Chrome or vice versa will not work. Always select browser-specific versions.
</Warning>

## 4. Extension Installed but No Data is Displayed in Popup

If the uBO Scope popup opens but reports ‘NO DATA’ or no network connections:

<Steps>
<Step title="Reload the Active Tab">
- The extension starts tracking for the currently active tab after installation.
- Reload the webpage you want to monitor to initiate network connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Allow Some Network Activity">
- uBO Scope requires network requests to report data.
- Visit multiple sites or interact with content to generate connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Check for Conflicts with Other Extensions">
- Some privacy or security extensions may interfere with webRequest listeners.
- Temporarily disable other extensions and check if uBO Scope populates data.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The toolbar icon badge shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected. Ensure you visit a page with network activity to see meaningful data.
</Tip>

## 5. uBO Scope Does Not Update or Show Current Data

User complaints sometimes mention stale or non-updating information.

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Extension Is Not Disabled">
Sometimes extensions can be disabled during browser updates or crashes.

- Check extension status and re-enable if needed.
</Step>
<Step title="Restart Your Browser">
- Fully close and reopen the browser to refresh the extension’s service worker/background process.
</Step>
<Step title="Clear Extension Storage">
- Corrupted or outdated extension data might cause stale data.
- Remove storage manually:
  - For Firefox and Chrome, visit `chrome://extensions` or `about:addons`, open developer mode (if available), and clear extension data.
- Alternatively, remove and reinstall the extension.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The extension’s background process can be evicted and restarted by the browser; this is normal behavior. Reloading tabs after restart ensures data synchronizes properly.
</Note>

## 6. Common Platform-Specific Issues

<u>Safari:</u>

- Confirm Safari version is 18.5 or higher.
- Enable the extension explicitly in Safari’s preferences.
- If the extension fails to load, check console logs via Safari’s Develop menu for errors.

<u>Firefox:</u>

- Extension ID must be correct; installation outside AMO must utilize correct ID.
- Ensure Firefox version is at least 128.

<u>Chromium:</u>

- Minimum Chrome version is 122.
- Service worker-based background script requires compatible browser settings.

## 7. Additional Tips for Successful Setup

- Always install the latest stable release from official stores or repositories.
- If building from source, carefully execute platform-specific build scripts (e.g., `tools/make-package.sh`) to package the extension.
- After installation, open the popup immediately on an active tab and reload the page to start collecting data.
