# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide helps you diagnose and resolve frequent setup challenges you might encounter with uBO Scope. Whether the extension does not appear after installation, fails to update its connection reports, or shows no data, these actionable steps guide you in identifying and fixing the root causes. You will also learn how to access logs and adjust browser settings to ensure smooth operation.

## 1. Extension Not Appearing or Toolbar Icon Missing

If uBO Scope doesn't appear in your browser toolbar after installation, follow these steps:

1. **Verify Installation:**
   - Ensure you installed the extension from the official store for your browser:
     - Chromium-based browsers: [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
     - Firefox: [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
     - Safari: Available via Safari Extensions Gallery or as per your system requirements.

2. **Check Browser Version Compatibility:**
   - uBO Scope requires:
     - Chromium browsers version 122 or higher
     - Firefox version 128 or higher
     - Safari version 18.5 or higher
   - Update your browser if needed.

3. **Enable the Extension:**
   - In your browser’s extensions or add-ons page, make sure uBO Scope is enabled.

4. **Show Toolbar Icon:**
   - Some browsers hide newly installed extension icons by default.
   - Look for an extensions or puzzle icon on the toolbar, and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.

<Note>
If you still don’t see the icon, try restarting your browser to complete the extension activation.
</Note>

## 2. Permissions and Access Issues

uBO Scope relies on specific browser permissions to monitor network connections accurately. Without these, it may not function properly.

### Required Permissions

- **Access to Active Tab**: To read data about the current webpage.
- **Storage**: To save session data and settings.
- **WebRequest API**: To intercept network requests and monitor outcomes.
- **Host Permissions:** Access to URLs matching `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and WebSocket URLs (for Chromium and Firefox).

### How to Check and Fix Permissions

1. Open your browser’s extension management page.
2. Select uBO Scope.
3. Verify that all requested permissions are granted.
4. Reinstall the extension if permissions were not fully accepted during first install.

<Warning>
On some browsers (like Firefox and Chromium), updates or reinstalls may reset permissions. Confirm permissions were not revoked.
</Warning>

## 3. Extension Loads but Shows "NO DATA" or Empty Popup

This issue occurs when uBO Scope does not detect or report any network connections for the active tab.

### Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

1. **Confirm Active Tab is Monitoring Network Activity:**
   - uBO Scope relies on tabs actively loading web pages.
   - Switch to a new tab with a distinct website that makes network connections.

2. **Wait for Data Processing:**
   - uBO Scope batches network events and updates asynchronously with a 1-second delay.
   - Wait a few seconds after loading the page before checking the popup.

3. **Check Browser WebRequest API Availability:**
   - Some environments or privacy settings disable or limit the webRequest API.
   - To verify, visit pages with many external resources (e.g., news portals or popular websites) and see if counts update.

4. **Disable Other Extensions Temporarily:**
   - Other privacy or content blocking extensions might interfere.
   - Temporarily disable other extensions and retry.

5. **Reload or Restart the Browser:**
   - Restarting the browser can often resolve transient issues.

## 4. Extension Improperly Reports or Fails to Update Badge Count

If the badge number on the extension’s toolbar icon does not change or shows unexpected results:

- **Ensure the extension received proper runtime messages:**
  - uBO Scope listens for webRequest events; if these fail, badge won't update.
- **Verify site matches host permissions:**
  - Sites must load resources over protocols covered by permissions (`http`, `https`, `ws`, `wss`).
- **Clear session data manually:**
  - Sometimes stale data leads to inconsistent reporting.
  - You can clear stored session data by reinstalling the extension or clearing browser extension storage.

## 5. How to View Logs and Validate Extension Operation

uBO Scope does not provide a built-in verbose logging UI but can be indirectly debugged via browser developer tools.

### Viewing Background Script Logs

1. Open your browser’s extensions page.
2. Locate uBO Scope and open its background service worker or background page console:
   - **Chromium-based browsers:** Click "Service Worker" under uBO Scope and open Developer Tools console.
   - **Firefox:** `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, find uBO Scope, and open "Inspect".
   - **Safari:** Use Safari’s Develop menu to inspect extension background scripts.

3. Look for output or errors related to network event handling.

### Validating Network Monitoring

- Open the popup UI by clicking the uBO Scope icon.
- Confirm it displays the domain counts separated by allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- If no data or empty sections show after browsing to active sites, review permissions and active tab states.

<Info>
The badge count updates dynamically and reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains connected on the active tab.

## 7. Additional Tips

- **Keep Browser Up to Date:** New versions often fix extension compatibility.
- **Use Official Extension Stores:** These versions receive correct signing and permissions.
- **Review Other Installed Extensions:** Some content blockers or privacy add-ons may interfere with webRequest API event reporting.
- **Test with Known Websites:** Try popular sites that load many third-party resources to validate that connections are detected.
