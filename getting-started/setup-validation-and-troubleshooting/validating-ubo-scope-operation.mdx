# Validating uBO Scope Operation

Ensuring that uBO Scope is correctly capturing and reporting network connections is crucial for gaining accurate insights into your browser's interactions with remote servers. This guide walks you through quick, practical steps to verify that the extension is functioning as intended by using known websites as test cases, interpreting badge updates, and exploring the popup interface details.

---

## 1. Confirm uBO Scope Is Active

Before diving into data validation, make sure uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your browser:

- Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like the uBO Scope logo.
- If the icon is missing, verify installation status in your browser's extension or add-on manager.
- The icon's badge should be visible when you navigate to websites.

<Tip>
If the badge is not visible, the extension may not be running or may require reloading. Refer to the installation guides for your browser.
</Tip>

## 2. Use Known Websites as Test Cases

To verify accurate reporting, visit reliable websites that are widely recognized and generate typical network requests. These websites act as test cases with predictable behavior.

**Recommended test sites:**

- https://example.com
- https://www.wikipedia.org
- https://www.mozilla.org

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Test Website">
Navigate to one of the recommended sites in an active browser tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe uBO Scope Badge">
Watch the uBO Scope toolbar icon for the badge update – it shows the number of distinct third-party domains that the page contacted.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the uBO Scope Icon to Open the Popup">
Click the toolbar icon to open the popup panel showing details about allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Hostname and Domain Display">
At the top of the popup, confirm that the hostname and domain correspond to your active tab’s website.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Connection Categories">
Check the lists under each outcome (not blocked, stealth-blocked, and blocked). These show domains contacted and their respective connection counts.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
The badge number reflects **allowed** distinct domains contacted. A lower badge count typically indicates fewer third-party connections, which is generally preferred for privacy.
</Info>

## 3. Understand Badge Updates and Popup Details

uBO Scope updates the badge text dynamically to reflect the number of unique third-party domains your browser connected to from the active tab.

- **Badge Number:** Shows count of distinct "allowed" third-party domains.
- **Not Blocked Section:** Lists third-party domains successfully connected.
- **Stealth-Blocked Section:** Shows domains where connections were intercepted as stealth-blocked.
- **Blocked Section:** Lists domains for which connections were actively blocked or errored.

Each domain entry includes a count badge showing how many times a connection to that domain was made during the tab session.

<Note>
The information updates live as you browse and interact with websites, giving real-time feedback on network activity.
</Note>

## 4. Interpreting Common Scenarios

### Scenario: No Badge or No Data Showing

- Ensure the webpage has initiated network requests.
- Refresh the webpage to generate new network activity.
- Check if other extensions or browser settings affect `webRequest` events.

### Scenario: High Badge Number on Known Privacy-Focused Sites

- Some legitimate sites load content from multiple CDNs and third-party services.
- Evaluate domain names carefully to distinguish benign services from unwanted third parties.

### Scenario: Expected Domains Missing

- Network requests might be cached or blocked before interception.
- Some requests might not be accessible via the browser’s `webRequest` API.
- Review browser permissions to ensure uBO Scope can observe network requests.

## 5. Practical Troubleshooting Tips

- Reload the tab and try again if data doesn’t appear.
- Verify that uBO Scope is enabled and has over necessary permissions like `webRequest`.
- Disable other extensions temporarily to isolate conflicts.
- Check your browser version meets the minimum requirements for uBO Scope.

## 6. Next Steps After Validation

- Explore the popup details while using various websites to understand network connections.
- Consult the [Understanding Allowed, Stealth, and Blocked Domains](https://docs.example.com/guides/interpreting-results-and-real-world-use/understanding-domain-status) page for deeper insight.
- Use uBO Scope to audit filter lists and content blockers more effectively.

## Example Validation Walkthrough

```plaintext
1. Open https://www.wikipedia.org in a new tab.
2. Observe the uBO Scope icon badge update from no number to a positive count (e.g., 3).
3. Click the icon to see the popup panel.
4. Confirm the hostname shows "www.wikipedia.org" and domain "wikipedia.org".
5. Review the 'not blocked' section listing domains like "upload.wikimedia.org" with counts.
6. Verify no unexpected domains appear in blocked or stealth-blocked sections if you’re not using aggressive blocking.
```
