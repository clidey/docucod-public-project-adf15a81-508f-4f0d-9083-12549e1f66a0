# System Requirements & Supported Browsers

Ensure your environment meets the necessary system and browser requirements to install and run uBO Scope smoothly. This page guides you through supported browsers, operating system compatibility, and the permissions the extension requires to function effectively.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope supports the three major browser engines, each requiring specific minimum versions for full compatibility with its core features:

| Browser Engine | Supported Browsers                      | Minimum Version  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|------------------|
| Chromium       | Google Chrome, Edge, Brave, others     | 122.0            |
| Firefox        | Firefox Desktop and Android            | 128.0            |
| Safari         | Safari on macOS and iOS                | 18.5             |


### Why These Versions?
These minimum versions reflect the earliest releases supporting Manifest Version 3 (MV3) extensions, crucial APIs such as `webRequest`, and security models compatible with uBO Scope's functionality.

### Checking Your Browser Version
- **Chromium/Chrome-based browsers**: Go to `chrome://settings/help` or `edge://settings/help`.
- **Firefox**: Go to `about:support`.
- **Safari**: Use the ‘About Safari’ option in the Safari menu.


## 2. Supported Operating Systems

uBO Scope runs on all platforms compatible with the supported browsers:

- Windows (for Chromium and Firefox)
- macOS (including Safari support)
- Linux (Chromium and Firefox)
- Android (Firefox only, due to extension support limitations)


## 3. Extension Permissions Explained

To deliver an accurate and reliable report of remote server connections, uBO Scope requires specific permissions:

| Permission    | Purpose                                         |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `activeTab`   | Access the details of the current active tab to measure network requests associated with it. |
| `storage`     | Store session and public suffix data locally for continuity and performance. |
| `webRequest`  | Monitor and analyze network requests initiated by the browser, critical to identifying remote server connections. |
| `host_permissions` | Access URLs beginning with `http://` and `https://` (and WebSocket variants for Chromium and Firefox), enabling monitoring of request outcomes. |


### Permission Details by Browser

- **Chromium & Firefox** include permissions for WebSocket URLs (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`), allowing visibility into WebSocket connections.
- **Safari** does not request WebSocket host permissions due to platform restrictions.


## 4. Best Practices for a Smooth Setup

- **Use supported browsers and ensure they meet the minimum versions listed.**
- **Keep your browser updated regularly,** as updates often include security patches and improved API support necessary for extension stability.
- **Grant all required permissions during installation,** or the extension may miss vital request data.

<Tip>
Blocking or denying the `webRequest` permission will prevent uBO Scope from tracking network connections accurately.
</Tip>


## 5. Quick Verification of Environment Compatibility

Follow these steps before installing:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Version">
Verify your browser matches the minimum version requirements listed above.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Operating System Support">
Ensure your operating system supports the browser version you are using.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Extension Permissions">
During installation, confirm that uBO Scope requests and receives the `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` permissions.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 6. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Typical Compatibility Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
Check your browser version using the built-in ‘About’ or ‘Help’ menu. Update your browser to meet or exceed these minimums: 
- Chromium-based: 122.0
- Firefox: 128.0
- Safari: 18.5
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Extension Permissions">
If the extension cannot access the active tab or network requests, it may be due to denied permissions. Reinstall the extension and ensure to accept all permission prompts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported Browsers or Platforms">
uBO Scope is not supported on browsers outside Chromium, Firefox, and Safari families, or earlier browser builds that lack MV3 support.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 7. Additional Notes

- **WebRequest API Support:** The extension depends on your browser’s implementation of the `webRequest` API, which is available in the supported browsers and versions listed.
- **Minimal Resource Use:** uBO Scope only requests necessary permissions to maintain privacy and performance.
- **Browser-Specific Behavior:** Due to differences in extension APIs, some features may behave slightly differently across browsers, but permission requirements remain consistent.


## 8. Where to Go Next

After confirming your system meets these requirements, proceed to the [Installing uBO Scope]( /getting-started/setup/install) guide to download and install the extension. Then, visit [First Run & Initial Setup]( /getting-started/setup/first-run) to start tracking your network connections immediately.
