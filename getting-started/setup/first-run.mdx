# First Run & Initial Setup

Welcome to your first experience with **uBO Scope**! This guide walks you through what to expect the moment you install and run the extension. You'll learn how to find the toolbar icon, understand the badge count it displays, and review your first real-time connection data. Follow these steps to confirm uBO Scope is working correctly and to get insightful visibility into your browser's network connections.

---

## 1. Locating the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

After installing uBO Scope from your browser's extension store, the first step is to find the extension's icon in your browser's toolbar.

- **Where to look:**
  - Usually appears near the address bar.
  - The icon uses the uBO Scope logo — a stylized shield with distinct colors (refer to the icons installed with the extension).

- **What you should see:**
  - The uBO Scope icon will have a dynamic badge number overlay.
  - If you see no badge or icon, check your browser's extensions menu or pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.

<Tip>
If you do not see the icon, try restarting your browser or checking your extension management page to ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count

uBO Scope’s badge count is not just a number—it's a privacy and network transparency metric.

- **What does the number mean?**
  - It shows the count of **distinct third-party remote servers** your current tab has connected to.
  - A **lower count** indicates fewer third-party connections, which is generally better for privacy.

- **Badge behavior:**
  - The count updates in real time as new connections are made or blocked.
  - If no connections are detected, the badge will be empty.

- **Important context:**
  - Not all third-party connections are harmful; content delivery networks (CDNs) often use third-party servers legitimately.
  - The badge helps you see the *scope* of network activity rather than raw block counts.

<Note>
The badge count is a direct reflection of connections observed through your browser’s network activity. It accounts for allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections behind the scenes.
</Note>

## 3. Opening uBO Scope’s Popup Interface

Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup panel. This panel presents real-time detailed data about the network connections from the current active tab.

### Popup Interface Overview

- **Hostname Header:** Displays the current page’s hostname and domain.
- **Summary Section:** Shows the number of distinct domains connected.
- **Connection Categories:**
  - **Not Blocked:** Allowed connections, showing domains for which requests succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Transparent blocks or redirects typically invisible to the user.
  - **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked connections reported in real-time.

### Sample First Popup View

When you open the popup for the first time on any website, expect the following:

- **Hostname:** The domain of the website you are viewing.
- **Domains Connected:** A count of all unique domains establishing network connections.
- **Detailed lists:** Domains grouped by their request outcomes.

<Tip>
To see the most meaningful data, open a website that loads various third-party content providers, such as news sites or social media platforms.
</Tip>

## 4. Running Your First Operation

Follow these steps to verify uBO Scope is fully functional and capturing live network data on your first run.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to a Website">
Open any website (e.g., example.com or a site with mixed content).
</Step>
<Step title="Observe Badge Updates">

- Look at the toolbar icon badge.
- Notice the number increment as connections to third parties are detected.

If the badge number remains empty and you visit different sites with external content, proceed to troubleshooting below.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel">

- Click the uBO Scope icon.
- View the hostname and connected domains.
- Check each outcome category (Not Blocked, Stealth-Blocked, Blocked).

The domains listed should correspond to entities loaded by the current website.
</Step>
<Step title="Refresh the Page and Review Updates">

- Reload the page.
- Watch the badge count update and the popup lists refresh.

This confirms the extension is monitoring network requests actively.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. What Successful First Use Looks Like

- **Clear badge count:** Shows a non-zero number for sites with third-party networks.
- **Popup displays multiple domains:** Contains at least some allowed domains, potentially stealth and blocked listings.
- **Hostname matches active tab:** The popup header correctly reflects the currently viewed site.

<Check>
If all of these are true, uBO Scope is functioning as designed.
</Check>

## 6. Best Practices and Tips for Effective First Run

- **Use sites with diverse third-party content:** News, multimedia, or social networks.
- **Be patient:** Some connections happen after page load, so keep the popup open a moment.
- **Pin the extension icon:** Makes quick access and badge visibility easier.
