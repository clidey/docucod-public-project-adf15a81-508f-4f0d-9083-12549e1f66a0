# Installing uBO Scope

Welcome to the installation guide for **uBO Scope** — a powerful browser extension that reveals all remote server connections your browser makes, independent of any content blockers or DNS filters you use. This guide will take you through a straightforward, step-by-step process to install uBO Scope on **Google Chrome**, **Mozilla Firefox**, and **Apple Safari**, including options for manual installation and updating.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers & Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

- **Browsers Supported:**
  - Google Chrome 122.0 or newer
  - Mozilla Firefox 128.0 or newer
  - Safari 18.5 or newer
- **Permissions Required:** The extension requests `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` permissions to monitor network requests properly.
- **Network Access:** The extension operates fully when the browser's `webRequest` API has visibility into network activities — no special firewall or proxy configuration is required.

<Tip>
If you're unsure about your browser version, use the browser's “About” menu to check and update to the latest stable release.
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Steps

| Browser           | Installation Link                                                                                  |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chrome**        | [Chrome Web Store - uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)        |
| **Firefox**       | [Firefox Add-ons - uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)               |

#### Steps:
1. Click the link for your browser above.
2. Click **Add to Chrome** or **Add to Firefox**.

### Option B: Manual Installation (Developer / Offline Setup)

If you prefer or need to install uBO Scope manually, follow these instructions:

#### Step 1: Download the Source Code

Clone or download the [uBO Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
cd uBO-Scope
```

#### Step 2: Create a Platform-Specific Build

Use the included build script to prepare the extension files for your target browser platform:

```bash
# Replace PLATFORM with one of: chromium firefox safari
./tools/make-package.sh PLATFORM
```

Example for Chrome:

```bash
./tools/make-package.sh chromium
```

This generates the extension files under `build/uBO-Scope.PLATFORM/`.

<Tip>
You may specify a version as second argument to `make-package.sh` to embed it in the manifest.json file.
</Tip>

#### Step 3: Load the Extension in Your Browser

##### For Google Chrome:
1. Open `chrome://extensions/` in your browser.
2. Enable **Developer Mode** (toggle in top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the `build/uBO-Scope.chromium/` folder.

##### For Mozilla Firefox:
1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Select any file inside `build/uBO-Scope.firefox/` (like `manifest.json`).

##### For Safari:
1. Open Safari, go to **Preferences > Extensions**.
2. Use the Safari Extension Builder to load the `build/uBO-Scope.safari/` directory.

<Warning>
Temporary loading of extensions is intended for development or testing. For regular use, install from the official store to receive automated updates.
</Warning>

- No error messages or permission issues are displayed on install.

<Tip>
If you don’t see network data or badge counts, try refreshing the page or restarting the browser.
</Tip>
