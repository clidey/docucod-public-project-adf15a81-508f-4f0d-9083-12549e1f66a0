## 3. Verifying a Successful Installation

Once installed, you should verify that uBO Scope is properly active and ready:

1. Look for the **uBO Scope icon** in your browser toolbar. It will typically display a badge indicating network activity numbers once you start browsing.
2. Click on the icon to open the popup panel. Initially, it may show NO DATA until you visit a site.
3. Visit a website to generate network connection data. The icon’s badge will update with the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.

<Tip>
If the badge doesn’t update after browsing, try refreshing the tab or restarting your browser.
</Tip>

## 4. Additional Tips and Best Practices

- **Permissions:** uBO Scope requires permissions like `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`. The installation prompt will request these; accepting them is essential for uBO Scope to function fully.
- **Manifest v3:** uBO Scope uses Manifest Version 3, ensuring compatibility and security in the latest browser versions.
- **Keep Updated:** Though uBO Scope is stable, check periodically for updates via your browser’s extension management page.

<Note>
Extensions relying on the webRequest API require full network visibility; ensure that other extensions do not conflict or restrict uBO Scope’s ability to monitor connections.
</Note>
