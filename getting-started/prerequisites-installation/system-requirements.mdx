# System Requirements for uBO Scope

Ensure your environment supports uBO Scope before installation to have a seamless, functional experience. This page details the compatible browsers, supported operating systems, browser version requirements, and required permissions necessary for uBO Scope to work as intended.

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed to operate as a browser extension that monitors third-party network connections using the browser’s `webRequest` API. It supports the following browsers:

- **Google Chrome / Chromium**
  - Minimum version: **122.0**
  - Available via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - Supports HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket (ws, wss) protocols

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum version: **128.0**
  - Available via [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
  - Supports HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket protocols

- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum version: **18.5**
  - Note: Safari supports only HTTP and HTTPS, not WebSocket protocols fully


## 2. Supported Operating Systems

As a browser extension, uBO Scope runs on any operating system where the supported browser versions run. This includes:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux distributions
- Android (Firefox Android only, given Firefox version requirements)
- iOS (Safari, with relevant version requirements)


## 3. Required Browser Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to capture and report network request data. During installation, the following permissions will be requested:

- **activeTab**: To access and monitor the active browser tab
- **storage**: To store session data and public suffix lists locally
- **webRequest**: To monitor browser network requests, including HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket protocols
- **host permissions**: To observe network requests on all URLs. This includes:
  - `http://*/*`
  - `https://*/*`
  - `ws://*/*` (for Chromium and Firefox)
  - `wss://*/*` (for Chromium and Firefox)


<Note>
If the browser denies any of these permissions or restricts the `webRequest` API (e.g., certain mobile or privacy-oriented browsers), uBO Scope may not function correctly.
</Note>


## 4. Network and Browser Considerations

- **Network Access**: uBO Scope monitors network requests at the browser level using available APIs. It requires normal network connectivity to monitor requests effectively.
- **WebRequest API Limitations**: Some browsers or browser versions may limit or restrict reporting capabilities of the `webRequest` API, affecting uBO Scope’s ability to detect stealth-blocked or blocked connections.
- **Content Blocking and DNS**: uBO Scope reports on network requests regardless of content blocking methods or DNS-level blocking, as long as the browser reports these requests.


## 5. Installation Environment Checklist

Before installing:

- Verify your browser version meets the minimum requirements listed above.
- Confirm you have permission to install browser extensions on your device.
- Ensure your browser settings allow extensions to request necessary permissions.


## 6. Summary Table

| Component          | Details                                         |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Supported Browsers | Chrome ≥122, Firefox ≥128, Safari ≥18.5         |
| Supported OS       | All major OS where supported browsers run       |
| Permissions Needed | activeTab, storage, webRequest, broad host access |
| Network Protocols  | HTTP, HTTPS (All), WebSocket (Chromium & Firefox) |


## 7. Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with System Compatibility">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
If your browser version is below the minimum supported version, uBO Scope may fail to install or operate properly.

**Solution:** Update your browser to the latest stable release.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Denied or Restricted">
If you deny requested permissions or your browser policy restricts extension permissions, the extension cannot monitor the network requests.

**Solution:** Review extension permissions and your browser policies, then allow the necessary permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="WebRequest API Unavailable or Limited">
Some browsers or private modes disable or limit the `webRequest` API.

**Solution:** Use uBO Scope in standard browsing mode on a supported browser.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 8. Additional Notes

- uBO Scope relies on a Public Suffix List to correctly group domains for reporting. This list is updated and stored automatically by the extension.
- The extension is built with manifest_version 3 and leverages background service workers for efficient monitoring.
- For more detailed architecture and integration information, refer to the [Integration Overview](https://example.com/overview/architecture/integration-overview) documentation.
