# System Requirements for uBO Scope

Welcome to the uBO Scope System Requirements guide. Before installing uBO Scope, a browser extension that exposes remote server connections initiated during your browsing experience, it’s essential to ensure your environment meets all the necessary criteria for smooth operation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed to function optimally on modern browsers that support the Web Extensions Manifest Version 3 standard, particularly focusing on seamless integration with the webRequest API to monitor network connections.

### Supported Browsers

- **Chromium-based browsers:** Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and others built on Chromium.
- **Mozilla Firefox:** Full support with recent Firefox releases.
- **Apple Safari:** Limited to recent versions supporting manifest v3 with service worker background scripts.

### Minimum Browser Versions

| Browser         | Minimum Version |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Chromium (Chrome) | 122.0           |
| Firefox          | 128.0           |
| Safari           | 18.5            |

These minimum versions ensure compatibility with Manifest Version 3 extensions, necessary permissions, and the service worker background implementation employed by uBO Scope.


<Tip>
Always keep your browser updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security improvements and the best experience using uBO Scope.
</Tip>

## 2. Permissions Required

uBO Scope relies on specific browser permissions to observe network requests and report connections accurately. These permissions ensure the extension can access, analyze, and display real-time network connection data without disrupting your browsing.

### Essential Permissions

- **`activeTab`**: Grants temporary access to the currently active tab to extract related network data.
- **`storage`**: Allows storing session data such as the public suffix list and network request outcomes between browser sessions.
- **`webRequest`**: Core permission enabling the extension to observe network requests, including HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket connections, and redirects.
- **`host_permissions`**: Defines which sites the extension can observe, typically set to monitor all HTTP(s) and WebSocket URLs.

### Host Permissions

uBO Scope requests host permissions for:

- `https://*/*`
- `http://*/*`
- `wss://*/*` (on Chromium and Firefox)
- `ws://*/*` (on Chromium and Firefox)

For Safari, WebSocket permissions are limited and not requested.

<Note>
The breadth of host permissions is necessary to observe all third-party and first-party network connections during your browsing. This does not mean uBO Scope modifies or blocks content.
</Note>

## 3. Browser Features and Technical Considerations

### Background Service Worker

uBO Scope uses a **service worker** as a background script to monitor network requests efficiently. Manifest Version 3 mandates this mechanism for modern browser extensions, increasing efficiency and security.

- Chromium browsers require at least version 122 to support service workers in extensions.
- Firefox and Safari have implemented or are implementing support with their MV3 compliance.

### WebRequest API

The extension depends on the browser's **webRequest API** to gain visibility on network requests, including:

- Successful connections
- Blocked requests
- Redirects

Browsers must expose this API for third-party extensions for uBO Scope to function properly.

### Public Suffix List

uBO Scope internally uses the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to accurately deduce domain and subdomain relationships, helping to categorize connections correctly.

This list is embedded and updated within the extension’s session storage to maintain accurate domain parsing.

---

## 4. Operating Environment

Though uBO Scope primarily depends on browser capabilities, the following baseline environment guidelines help ensure a smooth user experience.

### System Requirements

- Any operating system supported by the supported browsers (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Sufficient memory for browser operation (minimum 2GB RAM recommended)
- Internet connectivity for network monitoring

### Network and Firewall

- Browsers must have unrestricted access to the internet and the webRequest API data.
- Firewalls or security software should not block extension permissions or webRequest API usage.

---

## 5. Preparing for Installation

Before installing uBO Scope, verify:

- Your browser version meets or exceeds the minimum listed above.
- You understand that the extension will request permissions to observe web traffic as described.
- You have administrative privileges to install extensions in your browser.

<Tip>
If you experience issues with installation or extension functionality, check this page first to confirm your browser and environment meet the requirements.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with System Requirements">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
Make sure you have installed the latest browser version.

- Update your browser to the latest stable release.
- Check the browser’s "About" page for version details.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Permissions">
If the extension installation fails or features don't work:

- Ensure you accept the required permissions during installation.
- Check if your browser or security software blocks any requested permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported Browser">
uBO Scope is not compatible with browsers outside Chromium, Firefox, and Safari at the specified versions.

- Switch to a supported browser if necessary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="WebRequest API Access Denied">
Some browsers limit webRequest API access in private or restricted modes.

- Try disabling private browsing mode to test.
- Refer to your browser’s extension policy documentation.
</Accordion>
