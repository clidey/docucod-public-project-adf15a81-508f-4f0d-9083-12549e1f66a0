# Your First Run with uBO Scope

Welcome to your first experience with uBO Scope. This guide walks you through launching the popup UI, understanding the badge on the toolbar icon, and interpreting the connection information for the websites you visit. By the end, you will confidently read uBO Scope's key indicators, unlocking insights into your browser’s remote server connections.

---

## 1. Launching the Popup UI

uBO Scope integrates seamlessly into your browser as an extension with an icon in the toolbar. To see detailed connection data for your current tab:

1. **Click on the uBO Scope icon** in the browser toolbar. 
2. The popup panel opens, showing the hostname of the active tab and categorized connection statistics.

The popup loads live data on third-party domains contacted by the tab you're viewing, categorized into **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

<Check>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA', try refreshing the page or switching to a tab with network activity.
</Check>

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The badge on the extension icon displays a **count** representing the number of distinct third-party domains with successful (allowed) connections from the current tab.

- A **lower badge count** means fewer third-party domains were connected to, reflecting better privacy and fewer external fetches.
- When there's **no badge number**, it means no third-party remote servers were contacted or all were blocked.

<Tip>
Remember, the badge count is about distinct third-party domains contacted. This is a more meaningful indicator than raw block counts shown by other blockers.
</Tip>

## 3. Interpreting the Popup's Domain Categories

The popup UI groups remote connections into three categories:

| Category           | Meaning                                                                                                   | Visual Indicator             |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**    | Domains from which resources were successfully fetched (allowed requests).                                 | Listed under 'not blocked'   |
| **Stealth-Blocked**| Domains for which the requests were stealthily redirected or blocked without explicit error notification.  | Listed under 'stealth-blocked' |
| **Blocked**        | Domains where requests were explicitly blocked or failed with errors.                                     | Listed under 'blocked'       |

Each section shows a list of domains with a count of how many requests were observed.

### Example Scenario:

Imagine you visit a news website. The popup panel might show:

- **Not Blocked:** `cdn.example.com` (15 requests), `images.site.com` (8 requests)
- **Stealth-Blocked:** `tracking.adnetwork.net` (3 requests)
- **Blocked:** `annoying.ads.com` (4 requests)

This lets you know which domains are currently allowing content to load and which are blocked or stealth-filtered.

<Info>
Stealth-blocking is subtle and often invisible to the site, ensuring it works without breaking site functionality.
</Info>

## 4. Visual Elements and Their Meaning

- **Hostname Header**: Displays the full hostname of the active tab in two parts:
  - Left side: The subdomain prefix (if any).
  - Right side: The main registered domain.

- **Summary Section**: Shows the total number of distinct third-party domains contacted (from allowed connections).

- **Domain Rows**: Each domain row includes the domain name and a badge with the count of requests seen.

- **Loading Indicator**: When the popup first opens, it shows a loading state. It automatically refreshes once data loads.

## 5. Tips for First Use

- **Visit various websites** to see how the badge count and popup categories change.
- Use uBO Scope as a privacy audit tool to **spot heavy third-party connections** or unexpected domains.
- Recognize that some domains in the **'not blocked' list** may be legitimate CDN or service domains.
- If you see suspicious domains in the **blocked** or **stealth-blocked** sections, that indicates successful filtering.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common First Run Issues">
<Accordion title="No Data in Popup">
If the popup displays "NO DATA":

- Ensure the tab has actually loaded a webpage with network activity.
- Refresh the tab to generate network requests.
- Check if your browser supports `webRequest` API properly and permissions are granted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Not Updating">
If the badge count does not update:

- Reload the webpage to trigger fresh network monitoring.
- Ensure the extension is active and not disabled.
- Wait a few seconds; the extension batches and updates info asynchronously.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected High Badge Count">
A high badge count indicates many third-party remote servers contacted.

- Consider whether browser settings or other extensions are allowing excessive connections.
- Compare badge counts across filtered and unfiltered tabs to validate blocking effectiveness.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. What Happens Behind the Scenes (Brief Overview)

For context, uBO Scope listens to your browser’s network `webRequest` events (success, error, redirect) to track real network outcomes per tab. It uses a public suffix list to correctly group hostnames under registered domains, helping summarize third-party connections meaningfully.

Though you don’t interact directly with this, it ensures the popup accurately reflects real-time data.

## 8. Next Steps

- Explore the [Interpreting the Popup Panel](https://docs.example.com/guides/analyzing-connections/interpreting-popup-stats) guide to deepen your understanding of the domain categories and data.
- Review [Making Sense of the Toolbar Badge Count](https://docs.example.com/guides/analyzing-connections/understanding-badge-count) for how badge numbers relate to privacy.

———

For a practical start, simply install uBO Scope, visit any website, click the extension icon, and watch the badge and popup evolve with network activity.

You are now ready to begin monitoring your browsing connections with clarity and confidence.
