# Validating Successful Setup

A successful setup of uBO Scope ensures that you can reliably see connection data for the websites you visit and that the extension is actively monitoring network requests. This guide provides a straightforward checklist and quick tests to confirm uBO Scope is active, properly reporting domain connections, and tips for troubleshooting in case domains don’t appear as expected.

---

## 1. Confirm uBO Scope Installation and Activation

Before validating data collection, ensure the extension is correctly installed and active in your browser.

- **Check Extension Presence:**
  1. Locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser’s toolbar.
  2. If not visible, visit your browser's extensions page and confirm uBO Scope is enabled.

- **Verify Permissions:**
  uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor all network requests:
  - Access to webRequest API covering `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, and `ws://*/*`.
  - Storage permission for session data.
  
  Confirm these permissions in your browser’s extension management.

<Check>
If you cannot find the extension icon or the extension requests permissions beyond what is expected, reinstall from the official store links:
- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
</Check>

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface

The popup UI provides an overview of connections observed on the current active tab.

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
2. Observe the sections displaying domain connection counts:
   - `domains connected` shows the number of distinct domains with allowed connections.
   - Outcome categories:
     - **not blocked** — connections allowed to domains.
     - **stealth-blocked** — connections that were invisibly redirected.
     - **blocked** — connections explicitly blocked.

<Info>
If the popup shows `NO DATA` or no domains listed, it indicates that monitoring has not yet captured data for the current tab.
</Info>

## 3. Perform Quick Validation Tests

To verify uBO Scope observes network traffic, visit well-known, high-traffic websites and check for connection data.

### Step-by-step test flow:

<Steps>
<Step title="Visit High-Traffic Sites">
Navigate to popular websites like `https://www.google.com`, `https://www.youtube.com`, or `https://www.wikipedia.org`.
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the toolbar icon while on the visited page.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Domains Connected">
Ensure the `domains connected` count is greater than zero.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domain Lists">
Confirm domains appear under the **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked** sections.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Domain counts will vary based on your other content blockers and network conditions.
</Note>

## 4. Verify Badge Status on Toolbar Icon

The toolbar badge reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains connected to on the active tab.

- A **non-zero badge number** indicates active monitoring and reporting.
- A **blank or missing badge** means no allowed connections have been recorded for the tab.

<Check>
If you never see a badge count increase after visiting sites, it suggests uBO Scope may not be running or lacks necessary permissions.
</Check>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

If domains do not appear, or data seems stale or missing, try the following:

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Guidance">
<Accordion title="Extension Not Recording Data">
- Reload the web page after opening the uBO Scope popup.
- Restart your browser to reload extension background processes.
- Ensure other content blockers or privacy tools are not interfering.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Icon Badge Shows No Count">
- Confirm you are on a valid web page and not a browser internal page.
- Verify the extension’s webRequest permissions are intact.
- Try clearing browser cache and cookies as corrupted state can impact monitoring.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Domains Under Allowed Section">
- Confirm that the visited websites actually load remote resources.
- Visit known sites with multiple third-party resources.
- Disable other blocker extensions temporarily to test.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth-Blocked or Blocked Domains Missing">
- Check if your content blocker actively blocks or redirects resources.
- Verify that stealth-blocking behavior is expected for your setup.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Best Practices for Validation

- Visit various types of websites (e.g., news, social media, e-commerce) to see diverse network requests.
- Use fresh browser profiles or private/incognito windows for initial tests.
- Regularly update uBO Scope and your browser to latest versions for best compatibility.
- Avoid fake 'ad blocker test' websites; they don't provide reliable validation.
