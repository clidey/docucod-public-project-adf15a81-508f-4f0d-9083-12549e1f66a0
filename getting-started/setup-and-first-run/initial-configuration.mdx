# Initial Configuration

uBO Scope is designed to deliver meaningful insights immediately upon installation, minimizing setup requirements so you can focus on analyzing remote server connections without delay. This page guides you through understanding the default settings, the role of session data and permissions, and what you can expect from uBO Scope straight out of the box.

---

## 1. Default Settings and Out-of-the-Box Behavior

uBO Scope is built to work with **minimal configuration**. Once installed, it:

- Automatically monitors all network requests related to your active browser tabs.
- Categorizes these requests into three groups: **allowed (not blocked)**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
- Uses the browser’s **webRequest API** to passively gather data on remote connections.
- Displays a badge count on the extension's toolbar icon indicating the number of distinct third-party domains with connections.

All these features are enabled by default without requiring any manual user configuration.

You do not need to create or modify any configuration files or environment variables to start using uBO Scope.
</Check>

## 2. Session Data: What It Is and Why It Matters

uBO Scope uses session data internally to temporarily store network request outcomes and the current tab’s connection details:

- Session data tracks allowed, stealth, and blocked domain sets per browser tab, enabling per-tab insights.
- The data is stored using the browser’s **storage.session** API, which persists only during the current browser session.
- This approach ensures that the memory footprint stays manageable, and results reflect your browsing activity in real time.

### What You Should Know About Session Data

- Session data isn’t something you need to manage manually; it’s internally handled by the extension.
- Closing a tab purges its related session data automatically.
- Data persists only during your active browsing session; restarting the browser resets data.

<Info>
Session data enables the extension to deliver immediate, accurate feedback on connection outcomes without any additional setup on your part.
</Info>

## 3. Permissions Required by uBO Scope

For uBO Scope to operate as expected, the extension requests the following permissions during installation:

- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to access currently active tabs to associate network events with the correct tab.
- **storage**: Utilized to save session data and cache the Public Suffix List for domain grouping.
- **webRequest**: Critical for monitoring network requests, tracking their connection state, status, and outcome.

If these permissions are not granted or are revoked, the extension will not be able to collect accurate connection data or display results.

<Warning>
Ensure you grant all required permissions during installation to unlock uBO Scope’s full functionality.
</Warning>

## 4. How uBO Scope Uses the Public Suffix List

To group and analyze connections effectively by domain, uBO Scope leverages the **Public Suffix List (PSL)**:

- The PSL helps distinguish registrable domains from subdomains accurately.
- This is essential because network requests often involve multiple subdomains but represent the same third-party entity.
- uBO Scope automatically downloads and caches the latest PSL from a trusted source during initialization.

<Note>
The PSL caching is automatic and transparent—no user action is needed.
</Note>

## 5. What to Expect After Installation

Once installed and permissions granted:

- uBO Scope immediately begins tracking network requests without delays or configuration steps.
- The extension icon badge will display a count of distinct third-party domains connected by the active tab.
- Opening the uBO Scope popup (click the toolbar icon) will show categorized lists of:
  - Domains with allowed (not blocked) requests.
  - Domains with stealth-blocked requests.
  - Domains with blocked requests.

### First Use Tip

Browse a website known for requesting multiple external resources (such as a news site or social media platform) and observe the badge count change and popup listings.

<Check>
A non-zero badge count signals that uBO Scope successfully tracked connected third-party domains.
</Check>

## 6. No Configuration? Why?

uBO Scope is intentionally designed with **zero user configuration required** because:

- It captures network request outcomes passively using browser APIs.
- Its primary goal is monitoring and reporting, not blocking or altering requests.
- Minimizing friction accelerates your ability to gain insights immediately after installation.

If advanced configuration or customization options are needed, they may be explored in future releases or separate guides.

## Troubleshooting Common Initial Setup Issues

### Extension Not Showing Badge Count or Popup Data

- **Verify permissions:** Confirm all uBO Scope permissions (activeTab, storage, webRequest) are granted in your browser.
- **Browser compatibility:** Ensure your browser version meets minimum requirements:
  - Chrome 122 or newer
  - Firefox 128 or newer
  - Safari 18.5 or newer
- **Restart browser:** Sometimes permission changes or updates require a browser restart.
- **Network restriction:** Some network protection tools or proxies may interfere with webRequest API functionality.

### Session Data Not Persisting Within a Session

- Remember that session data is ephemeral and **cleared on browser restart** or tab closure.
- This is expected behavior to keep data current with active browsing.

<Tip>
If permissions or browser versions do not match requirements, install the extension on a supported browser or update your browser to the latest version.
</Tip>
