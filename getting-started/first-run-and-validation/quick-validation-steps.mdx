# Quick Validation Steps

Ensure your uBO Scope installation is working correctly by performing this straightforward network monitoring test. This guide walks you through visiting a website to verify the extension's badge updates and popup displays accurate third-party connection details.

---

## 1. Open a Supported Browser and Confirm Installation

- Verify you have installed uBO Scope from the official source for your browser:
  - **Chromium-based browsers** (version 122 or later): [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - **Firefox** (version 128 or later): [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
  - **Safari** (version 18.5 or later): Install via Safari Extensions settings

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar (it uses the extension's logo).

<Check>
If you do not see the icon:
1. Verify the extension is enabled in your browser's extensions or add-ons page.
2. Restart your browser and check again.
3. Consult the [Troubleshooting Installation Issues](https://docs.uboscope.example/getting-started/first-run-and-validation/troubleshooting-installation-issues) guide.
</Check>

## 2. Navigate to a Popular Website

- Open a new browser tab.
- Visit a widely used website with external resources, such as:
  - https://www.wikipedia.org
  - https://www.github.com

This step triggers network requests to multiple third-party servers.

<Tip>
Choose a website with a rich ecosystem of external content like images, ads, or analytics to observe varied network connections.
</Tip>

## 3. Observe the uBO Scope Toolbar Badge

- Check the extension icon badge on your toolbar:
  - The **badge number** indicates the count of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to on the current tab.
  - A **blank badge** means no third-party connections were recorded or the extension has not yet processed requests.

- Wait a few seconds after page load to allow the extension to process network events.

<Note>
The badge count reflects only distinct third-party domains that made successful or attempted connections; it does not count requests blocked before network initiation.
</Note>

## 4. Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup.
- Review the displayed information:
  - The **top header** shows the current tab's hostname and domain.
  - The **"domains connected" summary** shows the total count of distinct third-party domains contacted.
  - Three sections list domains categorized as:
    - **Not blocked** — allowed connections.
    - **Stealth-blocked** — requests blocked in a way that is harder to detect.
    - **Blocked** — explicitly blocked requests.

<Check>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or an empty list:
1. Reload the webpage.
2. Wait a moment to allow the extension to collect data.
3. Confirm that you are on a page with network activity.
</Check>

## 5. Verify Third-Party Connections Are Reported

- Confirm you see at least one domain listed under **not blocked** or **blocked** in the popup.
- The badge should update to match the count displayed in the popup summary.

- Additional details like counts per domain help validate that the extension is capturing network request outcomes correctly.

<Tip>
Some domains may appear under stealth-blocked if the browser or content blockers prevent visibility. This is expected behavior and the extension actively differentiates these.
</Tip>
