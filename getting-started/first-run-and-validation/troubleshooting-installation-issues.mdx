# Troubleshooting Installation Issues

Ensuring uBO Scope installs and runs correctly is essential to gaining full visibility into your browser's third-party network connections. This guide addresses the most common problems users encounter during installation and the first run, providing clear solutions and tips to get you up and monitoring without delay.

## 1. Extension Not Appearing After Installation

If the uBO Scope extension icon is missing from your browser toolbar, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Solutions

- **Verify Installation:**
  - Ensure you installed the extension from the correct store for your browser:
    - Chromium browsers: [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
    - Firefox: [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
    - Safari: Installed through Safari's Extensions settings, minimum version 18.5+

- **Check Toolbar Settings:**
  - Some browsers hide extension icons by default. Open your browser's extension or toolbar customization settings and pin or show the uBO Scope icon.

- **Restart Browser:**
  - Completely close and reopen your browser to finalize the installation.

- **Confirm Compatibility:**
  - Make sure your browser version meets the minimum requirements:
    - Chromium 122+
    - Firefox 128+
    - Safari 18.5+

<Tip>
Always choose the official extension stores to avoid unverified copies. Follow browser version compatibility strictly to avoid hidden installation issues.
</Tip>

## 2. Extension Loads but Does Not Report Connections

When uBO Scope runs but shows no data or a constant 'NO DATA' message in the popup, try the following troubleshooting steps:

### Remedies

- **Refresh the Page or Open a New Tab:**
  - uBO Scope tracks network activity per tab. Ensure you're viewing a tab with active network requests.

- **Check Permissions:**
  - Verify that uBO Scope has been granted all necessary permissions including `webRequest` and `activeTab`. Reinstalling can often reset these.

- **Ensure No Other Conflicting Extensions:**
  - Disable other extensions temporarily to check for conflicts that may block uBO Scope from receiving network data.

- **Verify Network Activity:**
  - Navigate to a website with third-party content (e.g., a news site with ads). uBO Scope should detect and display domains connecting.

- **Restart Browser:**
  - Service workers backing the extension can occasionally stop unexpectedly. Restarting the browser resets internal states.

<Warning>
If your browser blocks webRequest API access (e.g., due to privacy or security settings), uBO Scope won’t receive necessary data. Adjust your browser or privacy settings accordingly.
</Warning>

## 3. Platform-Specific Installation Issues

### Chromium Browsers

- Require at least Chrome version 122.
- Install from the official Chrome Web Store.
- If the popup does not load correctly, clear your browser cache or reinstall the extension.

### Firefox

- Minimum version 128 required.
- Available via Firefox Add-ons.
- If you encounter persistent issues, try reinstalling the extension or refreshing Firefox’s add-ons.

### Safari

- Requires Safari 18.5 or above.
- Extensions are managed via Safari > Preferences > Extensions.
- Manually enable the extension after installation.
- If network connections do not show, ensure Safari's extension permissions allow webRequest API access.

<Note>
For any browser, if you installed uBO Scope manually (e.g., from source), verify that the manifest file matches your browser platform requirements and that the extension files are not corrupted.
</Note>

## 4. First-Run Validation and Diagnosing Common Errors

Running a quick test immediately after installation helps confirm proper setup.

### Quick Validation Steps:

1. Visit a common website that loads several resources (e.g., `https://www.wikipedia.org`).
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup interface.
3. Confirm the badge count updates to a number representing connected third-party domains.
4. Check the popup for sections showing 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' domains.

If the badge remains empty and no domains appear:
- Reload the page.
- Check for errors under browser’s developer console related to uBO Scope.

### Interpreting Popup Behavior:

- If popup displays 'NO DATA' persistently, it indicates that the extension is not receiving or processing network traffic for the active tab.
- If counts are zero on all pages, the extension might not have permissions or is being blocked.

## 5. Additional Tips and Best Practices

- **Keep Your Browser Updated:** Extension functionality relies heavily on the browser’s webRequest API availability and permissions.
- **Limit Other Extensions Temporarily:** Extensions that modify network requests may interfere with uBO Scope’s ability to track connections.
- **Avoid Privacy Settings That Block Extensions' APIs:** Settings or firewalls that block extension permissions will affect the extension’s data gathering.

## 6. Getting Further Help

If you’ve tried all above and still face issues:

- Visit the official GitHub repository: [https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope)
- Open an issue ticket describing your browser, version, and exact problem
- Consult the [Installation Guide](../introduction-and-installation/installation-guide) and [Launching uBO Scope](../first-run-and-validation/launching-ubo-scope) pages for detailed walkthroughs

By following these troubleshooting steps and verifying compatibility and permissions, you will ensure that uBO Scope is correctly installed and ready to provide transparent insights on your browser's remote server connections.
