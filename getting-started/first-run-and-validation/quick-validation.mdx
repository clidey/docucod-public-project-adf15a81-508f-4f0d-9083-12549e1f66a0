# Quick Validation Checklist

Ensure your uBO Scope extension is actively monitoring third-party network connections with this fast, step-by-step checklist. Complete these validations to confirm your setup is operational and you can trust the connection data before diving into advanced usage.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation

- Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar:
  - **Chromium-based browsers**: Look for the puzzle piece icon or your extensions bar.
  - **Firefox**: Check the extensions menu or toolbar area.
  - **Safari**: Verify via Safari’s Extensions preferences.

- **Expected result:** uBO Scope icon is visible without errors.

<Check>
If the icon is not visible, please ensure you have installed uBO Scope from the official store:
- Chrome Web Store: [uBO Scope for Chromium](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- Firefox Add-ons: [uBO Scope for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
</Check>

---

## 2. Verify Toolbar Badge Count

- Open a new tab and navigate to a popular website (e.g., https://example.com).
- Look at the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge:
  - It displays a number representing distinct third-party remote servers contacted.
  - A **lower count** indicates fewer third parties, typically implying improved privacy.

- **Expected result:** A non-zero badge count (unless the page has no third-party connections).

<Tip>
Badge count reflects distinct remote servers connected, not the total network requests or content blocked.
</Tip>

## 3. Open and Review the Popup Interface

- Click the uBO Scope icon to open its popup.
- Observe the three domain connection sections:
  1. **Not Blocked:** Domains successfully connected.
  2. **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were stealth-blocked (redirected).
  3. **Blocked:** Domains whose connection attempts were fully blocked.

- **Expected result:** Relevant domain lists populate under these categories reflecting current tab activity.

<Note>
If all sections show "NO DATA" or remain empty, the extension may not be capturing network requests.
</Note>

---

## 4. Confirm Network Request Monitoring

- Reload the active tab with the popup open.
- Watch for domain entries updating in each section as the page loads network resources.
- The badge count should update in real-time reflecting new third-party connections.

- **Expected result:** Popup shows domain counts, categories populate, and badge count updates accurately.

<Warning>
If the extension does not display any domains or update the badge over repeated navigations, check browser permissions:
- Ensure uBO Scope has permission to access all websites in manifest host permissions.
- Confirm no browser settings or other extensions block the WebRequest API.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Validate Browser Compatibility & Permissions

- Verify you are running uBO Scope on a supported browser:
  - Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave)
  - Firefox
  - Safari (limited support)

- Check that you have granted the required permissions:
  - Access to website URLs
  - Ability to read network requests via browser WebRequest API

<Check>
Open your browser’s extensions page and confirm uBO Scope’s permissions and status.
</Check>

## Example Scenario

Imagine visiting a news website. After opening uBO Scope:

- You see the popup quickly listing a few allowed third-party domains serving ads or analytics.
- Badge count shows 5, indicating the number of distinct servers contacted.
- You observe stealth-blocked entries where connection redirect attempts are blocked invisibly.
- If you notice an unexpectedly high count or unfamiliar domains, this prompts a deeper investigation or adjustments in your content blocking.

This checklist ensures you are starting from a solid, working foundation.
