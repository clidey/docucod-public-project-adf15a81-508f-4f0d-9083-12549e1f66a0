# Launching uBO Scope

Discover how to quickly access and open the uBO Scope extension popup after installation. This guide walks you through locating the toolbar icon and demonstrates how to begin monitoring live third-party network connections for any active browser tab.

## 1. Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

After successful installation, uBO Scope adds an icon to your browser's toolbar. This icon is your gateway to the extension's popup interface where all network monitoring happens.

### How to Find the Icon:

- **Chromium-Based Browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.):**
  - Look for the colored `uBO Scope` icon (usually a shield or logo) on the top-right corner of the browser window.
  - If the icon isn’t visible immediately, click the puzzle piece (extensions menu) icon and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar for easier access.

- **Firefox:**
  - The icon appears near the address bar (top-right).
  - If hidden, open the Extensions menu and click the pin icon next to uBO Scope.

- **Safari:**
  - The icon appears in the Safari toolbar; make sure you have enabled the extension via Safari’s Extensions preferences.

<Tip>
If you cannot find the uBO Scope icon, ensure the extension is properly installed and enabled. Refer to the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/introduction-and-installation/installation-guide) to verify.

## 2. Open the Popup Interface

Clicking on the uBO Scope icon opens its popup. This popup provides a real-time audit of all third-party connections associated with the active tab.

### Steps to Open:

1. Navigate to the browser tab you want to monitor.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. The popup window appears overlaying the browser UI, showing detailed network connection data.

## 3. Begin Monitoring Live Network Connections

Once the popup is open, uBO Scope starts displaying live data related to all third-party connections attempted or established by the web page.

### What You Can Expect:

- Domains are grouped by their connection outcome: allowed (not blocked), stealth-blocked, or fully blocked.
- A toolbar badge on the icon dynamically updates to show the count of distinct allowed third-party remote servers.
- Details refresh automatically as network activity changes on the tab.

### Example Use Scenario:

You’re testing a website’s privacy posture:

- Open the site in a tab.
- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
- Observe the list of external domains your browser contacts.
- Compare results with or without content blockers active to verify their effectiveness.

<Tip>
For best results, ensure to refresh the web page or switch tabs after opening uBO Scope to capture fresh network connection data.
