# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

If you encounter problems during installation or notice that the uBO Scope extension does not activate as expected, this guide provides practical checks and solutions to get you back on track. These troubleshooting steps cover the most frequent setup obstacles to ensure your extension runs smoothly without blocking your progress.

---

## 1. Verify Browser Compatibility and Version

uBO Scope supports major browsers including Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge), Firefox, and Safari.

- **Chromium** requires version 122.0 or newer.
- **Firefox** requires version 128.0 or newer.
- **Safari** requires version 18.5 or newer.

**Action:**
1. Check your browser version.
2. Upgrade your browser to meet or exceed the minimum version requirement.

<Tip>
Running an outdated browser version is a common cause for extensions not working correctly.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Ensure Proper Installation

Double-check that uBO Scope is installed from official sources:

- **Chromium-based browsers:** Install via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
- **Firefox:** Install from the [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) site.
- **Safari:** Available via the Safari Extensions Gallery or Apple App Store.

**Verification Steps:**

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
2. Click it to open the popup; if it shows connection data (not "NO DATA"), installation is successful.

<Warning>
Installing from untrusted or third-party sources may lead to malfunction or security risks.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Confirm Required Permissions Are Granted

uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor network requests accurately:

- Access to all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs (host_permissions).
- Permissions for `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.

**Action:**

1. Visit your browser's extension management page.
2. Ensure these permissions are enabled for uBO Scope.
3. If prompted during installation for permissions, accept them to enable full functionality.

---

## 4. Check Extension Activation Status

Sometimes extensions get disabled automatically or by user action.

**How to check:**

- **Chromium/Edge:** Go to `chrome://extensions` and verify uBO Scope is enabled.
- **Firefox:** Visit `about:addons` > Extensions and verify status.
- **Safari:** Open Safari Preferences > Extensions and confirm it is checked.

**Tip:**
Restart your browser after enabling the extension to ensure it's fully registered.

---

## 5. Confirm the WebRequest API Is Functional

uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API to observe network connections.

**Potential Problems:**

- Browser configurations or other add-ons may interfere.
- Some browsers, especially with strict privacy settings, may restrict this API.

**How to verify:**

1. Disable other content blockers temporarily to check for conflicts.
2. Confirm uBO Scope's popup updates the count badge reflecting network connections.

<Note>
If the badge stays blank or does not update, the `webRequest` API may be blocked or non-functional.
</Note>

---

## 6. Resolve Popup Showing "NO DATA"

If opening the uBO Scope popup shows "NO DATA" instead of domain connection info, try:

- Reload the current browser tab to generate network requests.
- Confirm uBO Scope has proper access to the active tab.
- Make sure you are on a webpage that generates network requests (some internal or local pages may not).

## 8. Advanced Troubleshooting

If issues persist beyond the basic checks:

- **Inspect Extension Logs:**
  - Open the browser's extension debugging console:
    - Chromium: `chrome://extensions/` > Enable Developer Mode > Inspect views
    - Firefox: `about:debugging` > This Firefox > Inspect
  - Look for error messages related to uBO Scope.

- **Check for Network Request Interception:**
  - Other extensions or firewall software may block network monitoring.
  - Temporarily disable these to isolate the problem.

- **Reset Extension Data:**
  - Clear stored session data if corrupted.
  - Instructions:
    1. Go to your browser's extension storage.
    2. Clear local storage tied to uBO Scope.

<Warning>
Resetting data will remove any cached connection info but will not affect extension functionality.
</Warning>
