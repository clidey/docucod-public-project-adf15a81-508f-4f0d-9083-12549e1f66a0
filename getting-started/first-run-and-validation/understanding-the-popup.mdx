# Understanding the Popup Interface

Get acquainted with the uBO Scope popup window user interface (UI). This guide helps you interpret the real-time network connection data displayed per active browser tab, showing which domains were connected, allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked. Understanding these sections empowers you to analyze webpage network activity efficiently and uncover valuable insights about third-party connectivity.

---

## Overview of the Popup UI

The popup interface provides a clear, categorized breakdown of third-party remote server connections your browser makes on the current active tab. It is designed for fast auditing and clarity.

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup window opens and displays:

- The hostname of the active browser tab.
- A summary count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- Three main categories of connection outcomes:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
  - **Stealth-Blocked**
  - **Blocked**

Each section shows a list of domains with the number of connection attempts, enabling you to quickly interpret network activity.

> The popup automatically updates to reflect the current active tab’s network connection data.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using the Popup Interface

### 1. Identifying the Tab Hostname

At the top of the popup, the hostname of the currently active browser tab is shown.

- If the tab’s hostname differs from its base domain (e.g., subdomain versus domain), both are displayed.
- If no data is available yet, it shows **NO DATA**.

This immediately tells you which webpage’s connections you are auditing.

### 2. Reading the Total Connected Domains

Below the hostname, a summary displays how many distinct third-party domains the webpage connected with during this browsing session.

- This count represents all unique remote servers the browser requested resources from successfully.
- A lower count implies fewer third-party connections, which is often favorable for privacy.

### 3. Understanding the Outcome Categories

The connection data is organized into three distinct sections:

#### a. Not Blocked (Allowed)

- Domains your browser successfully connected to without interference.
- These connections indicate the active third-party servers supplying content or services.
- Each domain is listed with a count showing how many request attempts succeeded.

#### b. Stealth-Blocked

- Domains that content blockers or filters attempted to block silently.
- These requests were redirected or interfered with without being fully blocked, reflecting stealth-blocking.
- This category highlights subtle blocking techniques that may not fully prevent network requests but alter their behavior.

#### c. Blocked

- Domains where connection requests failed, either dropped or explicitly blocked.
- This shows third-party servers you effectively blocked from loading content.
- Like other sections, each domain has a count of blocked request attempts.

> Sections with no domains remain hidden for less visual clutter.

### 4. Interpreting Domain Rows

For each domain listed under outcome categories, you see:

- The domain name, displayed in a user-friendly format converting any encoded characters to Unicode.
- A count badge indicating how many network requests targeted that domain.

This breakdown helps you pinpoint which domains dominate network activity and their block status.

## Practical Tips

- **Audit your active tab**: Use the popup after loading a webpage to instantly inspect third-party network connections.
- **Compare outcomes**: Seeing allowed vs blocked vs stealth-blocked domains gives a comprehensive insight into the effectiveness of content blockers.
- **Spot unusual domains**: Frequent connections to unknown or suspicious domains may indicate tracking attempts.
- **Use the counts**: High request counts on specific domains might impact performance or privacy.

## Common Pitfalls

- **No data displayed?**
  - Ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
  - Refresh the active tab to trigger network data collection.
  - Check any browser or extension permissions blocking data gathering.

- **Counts seem low or zero?**
  - You might be viewing a new tab or local page with no external connections.
  - Verify the tab’s network activity with browser dev tools for cross-check.

- **Domain encoding issues?**
  - Domains with special characters are automatically converted to Unicode for readability.

---

## How It Works Behind the Scenes (Brief)

- The popup queries the background process for the current tab’s network connection data.
- The data contains categorized sets of domains with counts sorted alphabetically.
- The UI dynamically populates domain rows into their respective sections.
- The summary count reflects the total distinct domains in the allowed outcomes.

This seamless flow ensures the popup always presents the latest accurate connection snapshot.

---

## Summary

The uBO Scope popup interface provides:

- A **clear hostname display** for context.
- A **summary count** of distinct third-party connected domains.
- Three outcome sections displaying domain breakdowns: **allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked**.
- Intuitive counts per domain for quick analysis.

Using this interface, users rapidly obtain actionable transparency into a webpage’s network connections beyond conventional content blocker tools.
