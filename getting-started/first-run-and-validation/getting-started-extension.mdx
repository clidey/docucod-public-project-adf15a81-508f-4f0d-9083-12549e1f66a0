# Your First Successful Run

Discover how to verify that uBO Scope is installed correctly, how to open its popup interface, and how to interpret the data it presents. This guide walks you through the essential first steps to confirm proper functionality and understand what you see immediately after installation.

---

## 1. Confirm Installation Success

After installing uBO Scope in your browser, the first task is to confirm it is active and ready to monitor your network connections.

### Step 1: Verify Extension Icon

- Look for the uBO Scope icon on your browser's toolbar. It uses the "uBO Scope" logo depending on your browser:
  - A badge will display a number representing the count of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to.
  - If you see the icon without a badge, uBO Scope is installed but hasn't yet recorded network data.

<Tip>
The badge number indicates connected third-party servers, which reflects your browsing exposure. A lower count suggests fewer external connections.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Test with an Active Webpage

- Navigate to any active webpage that loads network resources (for example, a news site or popular content platform).
- Watch the badge count update dynamically—typically, it rises as the page loads resources from various third-party domains.

<Tip>
If the badge count does not update after visiting several websites, ensure the extension has the necessary permissions and is enabled for the current browser profile.
</Tip>

## 2. Open uBO Scope's Popup Interface

The popup interface gives a detailed snapshot of network activity for the current tab, showing domains that were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

### Step 1: Access the Popup

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
- The `popup.html` interface loads, displaying summarized data about third-party connections for the active tab.

### Step 2: Understand the Popup Layout

The popup is organized into sections:

- **Domains Connected**: Shows the total number of distinct third-party domains connected during the current tab’s session.
- **Not Blocked**: Lists domains for which connections were allowed.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Lists domains where connections were blocked stealthily, typically to avoid webpage breakage or detection.
- **Blocked**: Lists domains explicitly blocked from connecting.

Each section lists domains alongside a count reflecting the number of connection attempts.

<Tip>
The interface differentiates connections by outcome, helping you quickly identify which third parties you are exposed to and which are blocked or stealth-blocked.
</Tip>

## 3. Interpreting the Popup Data

### Visual Indicators

- The hostname representing the current tab appears at the top.
- The number of connected domains is prominently displayed in the summary.
- Domains are displayed in three distinct categories, each showing a count of connection attempts.

### What Each Outcome Means

- **Not Blocked**: These are domains your browser successfully connected to. Typically, essential services like CDNs or APIs fall here.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Requests to these domains were blocked in a concealed manner, preventing web page errors or detection by websites.
- **Blocked**: Domains explicitly blocked, no connections were successful.

### Domain Grouping Logic

uBO Scope groups hostnames by their registered domain using an integrated public suffix list implementation, ensuring accurate domain classification (e.g., grouping `sub.example.co.uk` into `example.co.uk`). This grouping aids in understanding exposure at the domain level rather than fragmented hostnames.

<Tip>
If some domains look unfamiliar, consider that many sites load resources from third-party providers; these counts help you evaluate your actual third-party network exposure.
</Tip>

## 4. Quick Verification Checklist

- [ ] Installed uBO Scope icon appears in the toolbar.
- [ ] Badge count updates upon loading active websites.
- [ ] Clicking the icon opens the popup with domain connection details.
- [ ] Expected categories (not blocked, stealth-blocked, blocked) are visible, even if some are empty.
- [ ] Current tab hostname is displayed clearly at the top of the popup.

If all these criteria are met, your first successful run is confirmed!

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Your First Run">
<Accordion title="Popup Does Not Open or Shows 'NO DATA'">
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
- Refresh the current tab or navigate to a new page to generate network data.
- Check browser permissions - the extension needs access to current tabs and webRequest API.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Is Always Zero">
- Visit websites that load external resources.
- Make sure no other browser profile or privacy setting blocks extension activity.
- Verify the browser version meets minimum requirements: e.g., Chrome ≥ 122, Firefox ≥ 128, Safari ≥ 18.5.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains are Not Grouped Correctly">
- The extension uses an internal copy of the Public Suffix List to accurately group domains.
- Domain grouping depends on the current suffix list version, which updates on extension startup.
- If inaccuracies persist, try restarting the browser to reload domain data.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps

After confirming your first successful run:

- Explore the [Monitoring Third-Party Connections](../../guides/core-workflow/monitor-connections) guide to understand connection patterns.
- Review [Understanding Domain Categories in the Popup](../../guides/core-workflow/understanding-domain-categories) to deepen your knowledge of the connection outcomes.
- If you encounter issues, consult [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../../getting-started/first-run-and-validation/troubleshooting-install) for detailed problem resolution.

### Summary

Your initial run with uBO Scope provides an instant, transparent view into the network connections your browser makes for each tab. By interacting with the popup, you validate installation success and begin interpreting real-world data about allowed and blocked third-party connections, empowering your privacy and filter maintenance decisions.

## Appendix: Visual Layout of the Popup

```html
<h2 id="tabHostname"><span></span><span>NO DATA</span></h2>
...
<section id="summary">domains connected: <span>?</span></section>
<section class="outcome allowed">
  <h3>not blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
<section class="outcome stealth">
  <h3>stealth-blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
<section class="outcome blocked">
  <h3>blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
```

This structure groups distinct domain connection outcomes clearly for immediate interpretation.
