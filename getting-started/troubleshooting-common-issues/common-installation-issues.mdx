## 1. Verify Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope supports the following browsers with specific minimum versions:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (Chrome, Edge, etc.): Version 122 or later
- **Mozilla Firefox:** Version 128 or later
- **Safari:** Version 18.5 or later

If you attempt to install uBO Scope in an unsupported or outdated browser, the extension will not function correctly or might not install at all.

### How to Check Your Browser Version

- **Chrome / Edge:**
  1. Click the menu (three dots) in the upper-right corner.
  2. Go to `Help` > `About Google Chrome` (or `About Microsoft Edge`).
  3. Your browser version will be displayed. Update if below the required version.

- **Firefox:**
  1. Click the menu (three lines) in the upper-right corner.
  2. Select `Help` > `About Firefox`.
  3. The version number is shown here.

- **Safari:**
  1. Click `Safari` in macOS menu bar.
  2. Choose `About Safari`.
  3. Check the version number.

### Action Steps

- If your browser version is below the minimum, update it to the latest available version.
- If your browser is not one of the supported browsers, switch to a compatible one from the list above.

<Warning>
Attempting to install uBO Scope on unsupported browsers will cause unpredictable issues.
</Warning>

## 2. Confirm Successful Installation

After installing uBO Scope from the appropriate browser store:

1. **Locate the Extension Icon:**
   - In Chromium and Firefox, the uBO Scope icon appears in the toolbar near the address bar.
   - In Safari, check the extension icon area or the `Extensions` menu.

2. **Verify the Toolbar Badge:**
   - The badge on the icon shows the count of distinct third-party domains connected.
   - If the badge is empty or missing, it may indicate the extension did not activate properly.

3. **Open the Extension Popup:**
   - Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup interface.
   - You should see a loading state followed by data reflecting domain connections.

<Check>
If you do not see the icon or the popup is blank after installation, your browser might have blocked the extension or it needs activation.
</Check>

## 3. Enable and Activate the Extension

  2. Ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
  3. Pin the extension to the toolbar if it isn’t visible.

- **Firefox:**
  1. Go to `about:addons` > `Extensions` tab.
  2. Make sure uBO Scope is enabled.

## 5. Extension Not Appearing in Toolbar

If uBO Scope is installed but you do not see the icon:

1. **Check Extension Visibility:**
   - Use the browser’s extension menu to pin or show the extension icon.
2. **Restart the Browser:**
   - Sometimes a full restart refreshes the UI to show newly added extensions.
3. **Disable and Re-enable:**
   - Disable the extension and enable it again to refresh its state.
4. **Check Browser Profiles:**
   - Confirm you installed the extension in the current profile if using multiple browser profiles.

<Warning>
Do not confuse the uBO Scope extension with uBlock Origin or other content blockers. uBO Scope has a distinct icon showing privacy connection counts.
</Warning>

## 6. Troubleshooting Tips

- **Clear Cache & Cookies:**
  Clearing browser cache can sometimes fix issues with extension icons or loading.

- **Extensions Conflicts:**
  Some privacy or security extensions may interfere with uBO Scope’s webRequest API.
  Temporarily disable others to test.

- **Check Permissions:**
  uBO Scope requires permissions such as `webRequest` and `storage`. Ensure these permissions are granted.

- **Verify Network Permissions:**
  The extension must be allowed to access URLs matching `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and websocket schemes.
