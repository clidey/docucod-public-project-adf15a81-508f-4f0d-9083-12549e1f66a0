# Extension UI & Data Problems

This guide addresses common issues you may face with the uBO Scope browser extension's user interface––especially in the popup panel––and data inconsistencies such as missing or stale data, the toolbar badge not updating, or domain connection counts seeming incorrect. It provides practical troubleshooting steps and tips to help you quickly restore accurate and timely network connection reporting.

---

## 1. Understanding the Popup UI Data

The uBO Scope popup displays categorized third-party remote server connections for the active browser tab:

- **Not Blocked (allowed):** Domains where network requests succeeded or were allowed.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Redirected requests representing stealth blocking.
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed or were blocked.

Each category shows domains connected along with the count of requests per domain. The badge on the toolbar icon displays the number of unique allowed third-party domains.

**If data is missing or incomplete:**

- The popup will show 'NO DATA' for the current tab hostname.
- Domain lists may be empty or show outdated counts.

## 2. Causes and Solutions for UI & Data Problems

### 2.1. Popup Does Not Display Expected Data or Shows "NO DATA"

This happens when the extension cannot retrieve or process network connection details for the active tab.

#### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Verify Tab Focus:**
   - Ensure the tab you are inspecting is active and fully loaded.
   - The extension only tracks connections on the active tab.

2. **Reload the Tab:**
   - Reload the webpage to generate fresh network events.

3. **Check Extension Permissions:**
   - Confirm uBO Scope has proper permissions in your browser settings.
   - Permissions required include `activeTab`, `webRequest`, and host access (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`).

4. **Check for Conflicting Extensions:**
   - Other extensions with web request interception may interfere with data capture.
   - Temporarily disable other extensions and test again.

5. **Verify Browser Compatibility:**
   - Ensure you use supported browsers and versions (Chromium >=122, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

6. **Restart Browser:**
   - Close and reopen the browser to reset the extension environment.

### 2.2. Toolbar Badge Does Not Update or Shows Incorrect Counts

The badge's number reflects the count of distinct allowed third-party domains on the active tab.

#### Cause & Fixes

- Network events may not be properly processed if the background script is inactive or crashed.
- Delay in event handling can cause temporary stale badge counts.

**Steps:**

- Reload the tab and open the popup to prompt data refresh.
- Restart the browser if badge remains stale.
- Check browser console for extension errors (Developer Tools > Console in the Extensions page).

### 2.3. Domain Connection Details Seem Incorrect or Unexpected

Sometimes domains appear with unexpected counts or categorization.

#### Explanation & Recommendations

- uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List to accurately identify registrable domains.
- Unicode domains are normalized and displayed using the punycode library.
- Request categorization is based on observed network event outcomes (`allowed`, `blocked`, `stealth-blocked`).

<Info>
Domain counts reflect observed network requests during the current tab session. If the webpage dynamically loads or unloads connections, these numbers may fluctuate.
</Info>

**If you suspect inaccuracies:**

- Reload the tab for a clean session.
- Use browser developer tools to cross-check outgoing network requests.

## 3. Quick Troubleshooting Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm Extension Activation">
Ensure uBO Scope is enabled in your browser's extensions manager with all required permissions.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload the Active Tab">
Reload the page to refresh session data and network events.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Extension Popup Immediately After Reload">
Check the popup panel to verify if domain data now appears.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Toolbar Badge Update">
The badge should show a numerical value for allowed third-party domains. An empty badge means zero tracked domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Restart Browser if Issues Persist">
Sometimes the extension or background process needs a full browser restart.
</Step>
<Step title="Check for Conflicting Extensions">
If problems continue, disable other extensions temporarily and retest.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Additional Diagnostic Tips

- **Inspect Extension Console Logs:**
  - Navigate to your browser's extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions/` or `about:debugging`) and open console logs for uBO Scope.
  - Look for errors related to network events or popup rendering.

- **Validate Network Requests with DevTools:**
  - Use browser developer tools (Network tab) to observe actual requests made.
  - Compare the domains seen there against those displayed by uBO Scope.

- **Clear Extension Storage:**
  - Resetting session data may help if stale data persists.
  - Extensions rarely provide a direct UI for this; restart and reload usually suffice.

## 5. When to Seek Further Help

If after following these steps problems remain unresolved:

- Consult the [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup Issues](https://example.com/getting-started/troubleshooting-common-issues/troubleshooting-install-setup) guide.
