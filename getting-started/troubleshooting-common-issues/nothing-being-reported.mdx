# Troubleshooting: No Connections Being Reported

When the uBO Scope extension's badge remains at zero or the popup reports no domains connected, it means no third-party network activity is being detected. This page guides you through diagnosing common reasons behind no connections being reported and helps restore accurate monitoring.

---

## 1. Understanding What the Badge and Popup Show

- The **badge count** reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers for which network connections were detected by the extension.
- The **popup** lists domains categorized by connection outcome: `allowed`, `blocked`, or `stealth-blocked`.

If the badge is zero and the popup shows "NO DATA" or no domains, it indicates that no connections are registered for the active browser tab.

---

## 2. Common Causes and How to Diagnose Them

### 2.1 Browser or Extension Permissions

uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API to observe network requests. If the extension lacks necessary permissions or the browser restricts access to network events, no data will be collected.

- **Check extension permissions:**
  - Confirm the extension has `webRequest` permission.
  - On Chromium, Firefox, and Safari, this is required to receive network request details.
- **How to verify:**
  - Open your browser extension manager.
  - Locate uBO Scope.
  - Verify the listed permissions include `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`.

### 2.2 Browser Version and Compatibility

Older or unsupported browser versions might limit `webRequest` API capabilities or manifest support.

- **Supported minimum versions:**
  - Chromium-based browsers: version **122** or later
  - Firefox: version **128** or later
  - Safari: version **18.5** or later
- **How to verify:**
  - Check your browser version via its About page or settings.
  - Update to meet minimum requirements.

### 2.3 WebRequest API Limitations

uBO Scope can only detect network requests that pass through the browser's `webRequest` API.

- Some network activity — such as those initiated outside typical browser tabs (e.g., Extension background requests, service workers, or system-level requests) — won't be detected.
- Certain browsers or configurations may restrict `webRequest` access for privacy or security reasons.

### 2.4 Browser Restrictions and Privacy Settings

Privacy-enhancing settings or third-party content blockers may interfere with uBO Scope's ability to observe network requests.

- Some browsers disable or limit API access for extensions to protect user privacy.
- Check if other extensions or browser settings explicitly restrict network monitoring or disable `webRequest` events.

### 2.5 No Third-Party Network Activity on the Current Tab

- If the page you're visiting does not load any external resources or only communicates with same-origin servers, uBO Scope will show zero third-party connections.
- Test by visiting a site that is known to include third-party content such as popular news or social media sites.

## 3. Step-by-Step Diagnostic Checklist

Use this checklist to identify and resolve the cause of no connections being reported.

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Browser and Extension Version">
Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

- Update your browser if needed.
- Ensure you have installed the latest version of uBO Scope.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Extension Permissions">

- Go to your browser's extension management page.
- Select uBO Scope.
- Verify `webRequest` permission is granted along with `activeTab` and `storage`.
- If permissions are missing, reinstall the extension.
</Step>
<Step title="Test on Known Third-Party Content Site">

- Open uBO Scope on a site known for third-party resources (for example, https://www.nytimes.com).
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to view the popup.
- Check if domains and counts appear.
- If still zero, continue troubleshooting.
</Step>
<Step title="Check for Interfering Privacy Settings or Extensions">

- Disable other content blockers or privacy extensions temporarily.
- Check browser privacy or security settings: some may block webRequest API for extensions.
- Try again and observe if connections appear.
</Step>
<Step title="Restart Browser and Reload Tabs">

- Fully close and restart your browser.
- Reload the tab(s) where you want to monitor connections.
- Open uBO Scope to verify data collection starts.
</Step>
<Step title="Reinstall uBO Scope Extension">

- Remove uBO Scope from your browser.
- Visit the official store page (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Safari Extension Gallery).
- Reinstall the extension.
- Repeat diagnostic steps.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Tips and Best Practices

- **Use real-world sites for testing.** Ad blocker test sites may not show actual browser network behavior.
- **Understand badge counts reflect distinct third-party domains only.** A zero count might be normal on sites without external resources.
- **Keep browsers updated** to benefit from latest APIs and security patches.
- **Disable conflicting extensions** while diagnosing to isolate issues.

---

## 5. How to Read No Data Situations in Context

- "NO DATA" or zero domains can mean no connections were made or none were detected.
- It is not necessarily an error — some sites may be self-contained.
- Persistent zero counts across multiple sites generally signal a problem with permissions or API access.
