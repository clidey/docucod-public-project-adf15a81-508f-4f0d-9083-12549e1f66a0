# Troubleshooting Installation & Setup Issues

When encountering difficulties installing or setting up uBO Scope, this guide will help you swiftly identify common issues, understand their causes, and apply practical solutions. Whether you face failed installs, missing permissions, unsupported browsers, or unexpected error messages, these troubleshooting steps are designed to get you up and running with clarity and confidence.

---

## 1. Installation Failures

### Common Symptoms
- Extension fails to appear in the browser's extension list after installation.
- Errors or warnings during installation from the browser's web store.
- Manual installation does not complete or triggers error messages.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Verify Browser Compatibility**
   - uBO Scope supports Chromium-based browsers (Chrome 122+), Firefox 128+, and Safari 18.5+.
   - Using an unsupported browser version will prevent installation.

2. **Use Official Distribution Channels**
   - Confirm that you are installing uBO Scope from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp), [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/), or Apple's Safari Extensions Gallery.
   - Avoid unofficial sources or outdated forked versions.

3. **Check Manifest and Permissions**
   - The extension requires permissions: `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
   - A denied or missing permission can cause installation to fail or become disabled.

4. **Clear Browser Cache and Restart**
   - Cached data or temporary glitches can block successful installs.
   - Restart the browser and retry installation.

5. **Manual Installation (Developers Advanced)**
   - Ensure that all extension files are correctly copied using the provided scripts (e.g., `tools/make-package.sh`).
   - Validate the manifest file matches your target platform.

<Note>
If you encounter specific browser error codes during installation, consult your browser's extension developer documentation or support forums for additional diagnosis.
</Note>

## 2. Extension Fails to Launch or Popup Shows No Data

### Common Symptoms
- Clicking the toolbar icon opens the popup, but no connection data appears.
- The badge count on the toolbar icon is missing or stays at zero despite web activity.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Verify Extension is Enabled**
   - Confirm uBO Scope is active in your extensions list.
   - Disable and re-enable the extension to refresh its runtime.

2. **Ensure Network Permissions Are Granted**
   - uBO Scope requires `webRequest` permission to monitor network connections.
   - Denied permissions will block data collection.

3. **Check Browser Network Access**
   - uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API.
   - Some browser privacy settings, VPNs, or proxy configurations may prevent this API from reporting correctly.

4. **Wait for Data Aggregation**
   - After a tab opens, the extension waits briefly to collect requests (up to 1 second delay).
   - Reload the target tab and then open the popup again.

5. **Reload the Extension**
   - In the browser's developer extensions page, reload uBO Scope to reset service workers and session data.

6. **Review Errors in Browser Console**
   - Open developer tools > Console.
   - Look for errors related to uBO Scope's scripts, particularly `js/background.js` and `js/popup.js`.

## 3. Unsupported Browser or Version

### Issue
- The extension is designed with MV3 manifest standards and specific API calls that require relatively recent browser versions.

### Solutions
- Upgrade your browser to meet the minimum versions:
  - Chrome: 122 or later
  - Firefox: 128 or later
  - Safari: 18.5 or later
- If you cannot upgrade, the extension may not work properly or install.

---

## 4. Permission-Related Errors

### Symptoms
- Warnings about denied permissions during or after installation.
- Extension unable to monitor or display network data.

### Resolution
- Manually check your browser's permissions for the extension and grant all required permissions.
- In Firefox or Chromium, revisit the extension details page to confirm that `webRequest` and `storage` access are enabled.

<Tip>
If using strict privacy or security browser settings, review whitelisting uBO Scope or relaxing policy restrictions that block extension API access.
</Tip>

## 5. Network or Connection Restrictions

### Problems
- The extension is not detecting network requests.
- Badge count remains at zero for all tabs.

### Cause & Fixes
- Ensure your browser is not configured to disable or limit extension access to `webRequest` APIs.
- VPNs, ad-blockers, or security tools running externally may interfere with network request reporting.
- Disable conflicting software temporarily to verify impact.

## 6. Error Messages or Logs

If you see error messages mentioning `runtime`, `storage`, or `session` APIs:
- Verify that the browser is fully updated.
- Extension files may be corrupted; try reinstalling.
- Review the console logs for stack traces to pinpoint issues.

---

## 7. Next Steps After Troubleshooting

- Open the extension popup and verify it shows domains connected.
- Refer to [First Run & Accessing the Extension](getting-started/initial-usage-and-validation/first-run-extension-access) for guidance on verifying successful setup.
