# Installation Instructions for uBO Scope

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions to install uBO Scope on your preferred browser platform: Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari. Whether you want the convenience of official stores or need to manually prepare the extension, follow the instructions below to get started promptly and reliably.

---

## 1. Installing from the Official Stores

### Chrome and Chromium-based Browsers

1. Open your Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.) and navigate to the [Chrome Web Store page for uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
2. Click the **Add to Chrome** button.
3. Confirm any permission prompts that appear to grant uBO Scope access to required features such as network requests and storage.
4. After installation, the uBO Scope icon will appear on your toolbar.

### Firefox

1. Open Firefox and go to the official [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Review and accept the permissions required by the extension.
4. Once installed, the uBO Scope icon appears in your toolbar.

### Safari

As of now, uBO Scope is available for Safari but requires manual installation as it is not currently distributed through the App Store.

- Ensure your Safari version is 18.5 or newer (check **Safari > About Safari**).
- Follow the manual build process detailed below to prepare the extension for Safari.

## 2. Manual Preparation of uBO Scope Extension (for Advanced Users and Safari)

If you prefer to manually install the extension or need to build it for Safari, follow these steps on a Linux environment.

### Prerequisites

- A Linux environment with Bash shell access.
- `jq` command-line JSON processor must be installed to manipulate manifest files.
- `zip` utility installed.

### Step-by-Step Build Instructions

1. Clone or download the uBO Scope repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
   cd uBO-Scope
   ```

2. Use the provided packaging script to build the extension for your platform. For example, to build for Firefox:

   ```bash
   ./tools/make-firefox.sh
   ```

   This script calls the generic packaging script to assemble the extension into the `build/uBO-Scope.firefox` directory.

3. The build script will create an XPI file (Firefox extension package) inside the `build` folder (e.g., `uBO-Scope.firefox.xpi`).

4. For Safari, replace `firefox` with `safari` in the script:

   ```bash
   ./tools/make-package.sh safari
   ```

   This will prepare the extension files needed for manually loading into Safari's Extension Builder.

### Notes on Manual Build

- You can specify a version number as the second parameter to update the manifest version during packaging:

  ```bash
  ./tools/make-firefox.sh 1.0.1
  ```

- The packaging scripts copy all required assets, scripts, styles, and manifest files specific to each browser platform.

## 3. Installing the Built Extension in Your Browser

### Firefox

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` in Firefox.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Navigate to the `build/uBO-Scope.firefox` folder and select the `manifest.json` file.
4. The extension will load temporarily until Firefox is closed.

### Safari

1. Open **Safari > Preferences > Advanced**.
2. Enable **Show Develop menu in menu bar**.
3. Open **Develop > Show Extension Builder**.
4. Click the **+** button and select **Add Extension**.
5. Choose the directory from your manual packaging (e.g., `build/uBO-Scope.safari`).
6. Build and enable the extension from the builder interface.

### Chromium-based Browsers (Manual Load)

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Enable **Developer Mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the directory where the extension was built (e.g., `build/uBO-Scope.chromium`).
5. The extension loads for testing and use.

## 4. Verifying Installation Success

- Upon installation, the uBO Scope icon should appear on your browser's toolbar.

This indicates uBO Scope is correctly monitoring network requests.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation and Loading Issues">
<Accordion title="The extension icon does not appear after installation">
- Ensure the correct browser version is used (minimum Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Loading a manually built extension fails or shows errors">
- Confirm you ran the packaging scripts correctly with the right platform argument.
- Check that `jq` and `zip` utilities are installed and operational.

<Accordion title="Extension does not report any network data">
- Confirm your browser supports the `webRequest` API and that no conflicting privacy extensions block this access.
- Make sure you have loaded at least one webpage with external network requests.
