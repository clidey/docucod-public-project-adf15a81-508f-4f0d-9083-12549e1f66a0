# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Before you begin using uBO Scope, it's essential to understand the environment and conditions needed for a seamless setup and optimal experience. This page details the supported browsers, required permissions, and underlying browser API usage to help you prepare.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to run on the latest versions of mainstream browsers, leveraging their `webRequest` API to track network connections effectively. The current supported browsers are:

- **Chromium-based Browsers** (Google Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)
  - Minimum version: Chrome 122.0+
  - Installation via Chrome Web Store

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum version: Firefox 128.0+
  - Installation via Firefox Add-ons

- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum version: Safari 18.5+
  - Installation via Safari Extensions


> Each browser implements the `webRequest` API slightly differently; uBO Scope adapts accordingly but requires minimum versions to ensure compatibility.

---

## 2. Required Permissions and Browser Features

uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions to function correctly. These are requested during installation and are necessary for monitoring network requests:

- **`webRequest` Permission**
  - Allows uBO Scope to listen to network requests made by web pages.
  - Essential for reporting all connection attempts regardless of blocking.

- **`activeTab` Permission**
  - Grants access to information about the currently active tab, enabling context-specific reporting.

- **`storage` Permission**
  - Enables uBO Scope to save session data locally to persist tracking information.

- **Host Permissions:**
  - Access to all HTTP(S) and WebSocket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
  - Required to observe requests made to any remote servers.

<Note>
These permissions do not give uBO Scope the ability to alter web content or block connections. Its sole purpose is to report and categorize these connections transparently.
</Note>

---

## 3. Understanding the `webRequest` API Role

uBO Scope relies heavily on the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network activity. This API enables the extension to:

- Track every web, WebSocket, and secure request initiated by web pages.
- Detect connection outcomes such as success, errors (blocked requests), and redirects (stealth-blocked).
- Provide real-time updates reflected in the toolbar badge and the popup panel.

This dependency means:

- If the browser restricts access to network requests via `webRequest`, uBO Scope will not be able to report those connections.
- Network requests outside `webRequest` scope (e.g., certain service workers or internal browser processes) cannot be tracked by uBO Scope.

## 4. Platform Compatibility

| Platform         | Supported Browsers         | Minimum Version | Specifics                              |
|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Windows**      | Chromium, Firefox          | Chrome 122+, FF 128+ | Full support via respective stores    |
| **macOS**        | Safari, Chromium, Firefox  | Safari 18.5+, Chrome 122+, FF 128+ | Safari fallback on recent macOS versions |
| **Linux**        | Chromium, Firefox          | Chrome 122+, FF 128+ | No Safari support                      |
| **Android**      | Firefox (strict min 128)   | FF 128+         | Limited, no Chromium-based support    |

> Note: Safari support requires macOS Big Sur or later versions meeting minimum Safari version.

## 5. System Requirements

While uBO Scope is lightweight, to run it effectively your environment should meet these baseline specifications:

- **Operating System:** Supported platforms listed above.
- **Browser Version:** Minimum as specified in the Supported Browsers section.
- **Memory:** At least 100 MB free RAM to handle session data smoothly.
- **Disk Space:** Minimal (less than 10 MB), mostly for extension storage.

<Warning>
Running older browser versions or unsupported platforms may lead to incomplete or inaccurate connection reporting.
</Warning>

---

## 6. Preparing for Installation

Before installing uBO Scope, please ensure:

- Your browser is updated to at least the minimum supported version.
- You have the necessary permissions to add extensions or add-ons.
- You understand that uBO Scope **does not block any content**, it only reports connection information.

For detailed installation instructions, refer to [Installation Instructions](/getting-started/basics-installation/install-on-your-browser).

---

## 7. Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

- **Always install from official stores** to ensure you have the authentic and latest version.
- **Do not disable required permissions**, or uBO Scope will fail to track network requests.
- **Understand that the badge count represents distinct third-party domains connected to**, not individual connections or blocked counts.
- **Remember some browsers (especially Safari) limit certain network monitoring capabilities**, possibly reducing visibility.

<Info>
uBO Scope is designed to complement content blockers and works independently, reporting the effective network state, which helps you understand privacy and security implications better.

## 8. Troubleshooting Prerequisites Issues

If you encounter problems such as no data appearing after installation:

- Verify your browser version meets the minimum requirement.
- Ensure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions granted.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions that restrict webRequest access.
- Restart your browser to apply updates or permission changes.

For detailed troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting Installation & Usage Issues](/getting-started/basics-installation/troubleshooting-common-issues).

## 9. Summary

Understanding these prerequisites and system requirements lays a solid foundation for using uBO Scope effectively. Ensuring your platform and browser setup aligns with these guidelines guarantees you'll gain full transparency into all network connections during your web browsing sessions.
