# Troubleshooting Installation & Usage Issues

This guide addresses the most common issues users encounter during installing and using **uBO Scope**. You will learn how to identify and resolve problems such as missing badge icons, empty popup data, permission errors, and more. By following the steps here, you can quickly regain full visibility into your browser’s remote connections.

---

## 1. Common Symptoms & What They Mean

- **No Badge Icon on Toolbar**
  - Indicates the extension may not be installed correctly, not enabled, or the browser version is unsupported.

- **Badge Count Always Empty or “?” Displayed**
  - Suggests uBO Scope has insufficient permissions or cannot detect network requests on the current tab.

- **Popup Panel Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Blank**
  - Means no connection data has been captured for the active tab, possibly due to lack of permissions or an initialization issue.

- **Error or Warning Messages During Installation or Use**
  - Usually related to missing permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, or `storage`) or browser incompatibilities.

- **No Updates to Badge Count on Navigation**
  - Indicates background process may not be receiving events or network requests are blocked outside of browser API’s scope.

---

## 2. Verify Browser & Extension Compatibility

uBO Scope requires specific minimum browser versions and permissions:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Version">
Confirm your browser meets the minimum supported version:
- **Chromium-based browsers:** Version 122 or higher
- **Firefox:** Version 128 or higher
- **Safari:** Version 18.5 or higher

You can check this via the browser’s About or Help menu.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Extension Installation">
Ensure the extension is installed from official sources:
- Chromium: [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- Firefox: [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- Safari: Use the Safari Extensions Gallery or trusted sources

If installed manually, ensure you have followed manual build and load instructions correctly.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Permissions">
Check that uBO Scope has permissions: `activeTab`, `storage`, and crucially `webRequest`.

Some browsers or security settings may restrict these permissions, especially for `webRequest` or its replacement APIs.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Browsers may disable access to network request data for extensions when privacy features or restrictive content blockers are enabled. uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor connections.
</Note>

## 3. Diagnosing Installation Issues

<Steps>
<Step title="Look for the Toolbar Icon">
The uBO Scope icon should appear in your browser toolbar after installation.

If it does not appear:
- Check if the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions or add-ons settings.
- On Chromium, check the puzzle-piece menu and pin uBO Scope for visibility.
- Restart the browser to refresh extensions.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Manifest Requirements">
The extension manifest requires:
- Host permissions for all HTTP and HTTPS sites (`http://*/*` and `https://*/*`)
- `webRequest` permission to monitor requests

If these are missing or blocked by the browser, installation will fail or the extension will not function correctly.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Browser Error Console">
Open the browser’s developer tools on the extensions page (or background service worker console) to look for error logs.

Common errors:
- Permission denied
- Manifest errors

Resolving these by reinstalling or adjusting browser settings is required.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Troubleshooting Usage Issues

### 4.1 No Data in Popup Panel

- Verify activeTab permission is granted.
- Navigate to a new website tab and reload page; uBO Scope collects network events per tab.
- If popup still shows 'NO DATA':
  - Restart the browser.
  - Disable conflicting extensions that may intercept or block `webRequest` before uBO Scope.

### 4.2 Badge Count Does Not Update

- Badge counts correspond to distinct third-party domains with allowed network connections.
- If counts remain zero or stale:
  - Confirm no conflicting content blockers disable webRequest events.
  - Confirm site uses standard HTTP/S or WebSocket connections (only these protocols are tracked).
  - Reload active tabs to trigger fresh data collection.

### 4.3 Permission or Activity Errors

- Some browsers prompt on installation for permissions. Ensure all prompts are accepted.
- Advanced browser security configurations or privacy settings can block extension APIs.
- Check if the extension is excluded or restricted by system or browser policies.

---

## 5. Where to Find Logs and Diagnostic Information

- Browser Console (Developer Tools): Provides background service worker logs.
- Extension Page: May display install and runtime errors.
- uBO Scope Icon Badge: Reports connection counts; verify if empty or not updating.
- Popup Panel: Displays categorized domain connection data for the current tab.

<Info>
Access the browser’s extension management page and inspect the background process or service worker console to spot errors.

If errors related to permissions or API usage appear, take note of the messages for reporting or further troubleshooting.
</Info>

## 6. Best Practices to Avoid Issues

- Install from official extension stores to ensure up-to-date and unaltered versions.
- Review and accept all permission requests promptly.
- Avoid enabling conflicting extensions that aggressively block or modify network request APIs.
- Keep your browser up to date for best compatibility.
- Use uBO Scope on tabs where network connections are made with standard HTTP/S or WebSocket protocols.

<Tip>
Using uBO Scope with privacy-oriented browsers or strict security profiles may limit data availability. Consider temporarily adjusting settings to verify uBO Scope functionality.
</Tip>

## 7. When and How to Seek Further Help

If problems persist after following all above steps:

- Provide exact browser version and extension version (`1.0.1` or latest).
- Describe symptoms with screenshots of the toolbar, popup panel, and browser console logs.
- Report on any other extensions that may affect network traffic or API access.
- Submit issues or seek help via the [uBO Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
