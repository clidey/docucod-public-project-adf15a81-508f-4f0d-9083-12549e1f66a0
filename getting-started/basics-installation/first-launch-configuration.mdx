# First Launch & Basic Configuration

Welcome to your first experience with uBO Scope! This guide will walk you through what to expect immediately after installing the extension, how to grant necessary permissions, recognize the extension’s badge icon, and verify that uBO Scope is actively monitoring network connections. You'll also learn the key security considerations to keep in mind during setup.

---

## 1. What to Expect After Installation

Upon installing uBO Scope on your browser, you will notice a new toolbar icon appear. This icon is your gateway to the extension’s insights.

- The badge number on the icon represents the **count of distinct third-party remote servers** connected by the active webpage.
- Initially, before browsing any websites, the badge will likely be empty or show no number.
- Clicking the icon opens the popup panel that summarizes network request outcomes for the current tab.

### Key Behavior Immediately Post-Installation

- uBO Scope **runs silently in the background**, capturing every network connection attempt.
- It does **not block or modify** content but reports connections regardless of which content blocker you may have installed.
- The first few seconds of browsing may show no data until network requests are captured.

<Tip>
The badge count is a transparency metric, helping you understand actual third-party connections, not a block count or warning.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding and Granting Permissions

uBO Scope requires permissions that let it monitor network activity and store data locally for your current session.

### Key Permissions Explained

- **`webRequest`**: Allows uBO Scope to see network requests initiated by webpages to report on connection outcomes.
- **`activeTab`**: Grants temporary access to the current tab to fetch its network data.
- **`storage`**: Saves session data across browser reloads.

### How to Grant Permissions

- When installing from your browser’s official extension store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Safari Extensions Gallery), the browser prompts you to accept these permissions upfront.
- Make sure to review and confirm these requests during installation.

<Tip>
If you decline these permissions, uBO Scope will not function correctly. The badge and popup will remain inactive.
</Tip>

## 3. Recognizing and Using the Badge Icon

This icon indicates when uBO Scope is active and provides real-time information.

### Badge Icon Behavior

- The badge displays a **number indicating how many distinct third-party domains** the active tab is connected to.
- No number means no third-party connections detected yet.
- The icon tooltip (on hover) shows the extension name 'uBO Scope'.

### Accessing Detailed Information

- Click the badge icon to open the popup panel.
- The popup categorizes domains by connection outcome: allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- This real-time data helps you understand your current tab’s network footprint.

<Note>
The badge and popup reflect current tab data only and update dynamically as you browse.
</Note>

## 4. Verifying uBO Scope Activation

To confirm uBO Scope is correctly installed and running:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Any Website">
Navigate to any site (e.g., https://example.com) in the browser where uBO Scope is installed.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Badge Number">
Observe the badge icon—within seconds it will update to show a number representing active third-party server connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Badge Icon">
Click to open the popup panel. You should see:
- The tab’s top-level domain in the header
- Sections listing domains under 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'
</Step>
<Step title="Reload the Page">
Refresh the page and watch the badge and popup update reflecting current network data.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the badge never shows a count or the popup remains blank, check your browser’s extension permissions and ensure no conflicts prevent background scripts from running.
</Tip>

## 5. Security Considerations

uBO Scope operates with access to your browsing data to provide meaningful network insights. Here are essential security points:

- **Local Processing:** All network data processing happens locally within your browser extension; no external servers receive your browsing information.
- **Permission Scope:** The extension only monitors network requests as allowed by your browser’s webRequest API.
- **No Modification:** uBO Scope does not alter or block network requests, preserving your browsing integrity.

<Warning>
Avoid installing uBO Scope from unofficial sources. Always use official browser stores to ensure authenticity and security.
</Warning>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common First-Run Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting First Launch Issues">

- Ensure your browser version is supported (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Reload the browser and active tabs.
- Confirm no other extension(s) block or interfere with webRequest API usage.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Panel Shows 'NO DATA' or Blank">
- Refresh the tab you are viewing to trigger network requests.
- Clear browser cache and try again.
- Check browser console for extension errors.
- Disable other privacy or blocker extensions temporarily to isolate the issue.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Missing After Installation">
