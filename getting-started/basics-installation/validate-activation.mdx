# Validating Successful Activation

Ensure that uBO Scope is fully operational and accurately monitoring network connections by learning how to identify the toolbar badge, interact with the popup panel, and verify network connection summaries. This page guides you through confirming that your installation is both complete and effective.

---

## 1. Recognizing the uBO Scope Toolbar Badge

After installing uBO Scope, look for its toolbar icon in your browser's extension area:

- The badge overlays a count number on the icon, representing the number of third-party domains currently connected by the active tab.
- A non-empty badge number indicates the extension is actively monitoring network requests.

> ### Tip
> If the badge is missing or blank, ensure you have visited a web page that initiates network connections and that the extension has the necessary permissions granted.

## 2. Opening the uBO Scope Popup Panel

The popup panel provides a detailed view of network connections for the active tab, categorizing them based on request outcomes:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar.
2. The popup interface will open, showing:
   - **Domain Summary** at the top displaying the total number of connected domains.
   - Sections for **Not Blocked (allowed)**, **Stealth Blocked**, and **Blocked** domains with counts and domain names.

Each section lists domains the tab connected to, with counts of requests made.

> ### Best Practice
> Open the popup panel while navigating active tabs to see live updates reflecting real-time network activities.

## 3. Validating Network Monitoring Functionality

To confirm uBO Scope is monitoring your network activity accurately:

1. Visit a website with active network connections.
2. Observe the badge count incrementing as third-party domains are contacted.
3. Open the popup panel and verify:
   - The **domains connected** count matches or sensibly corresponds to the badge number.
   - Domains are categorized into **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** sections based on request outcomes.

> ### Scenario Example
> Open a news website or another content-rich site that loads multiple resources.
> - The badge should display a count of domains connected.
> - Opening the popup shows detailed counts of each domain's connection attempts.

## 4. Understanding the Popup Panel Data

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Lists domains for network requests successfully completed.
- **Stealth Blocked**: Domains where requests were redirected but stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked**: Domains where requests failed or were explicitly blocked.

Each domain entry includes a count badge showing the number of individual connection attempts.

> ### Practical Tip
> Use this breakdown to assess your browser's content blocking effectiveness and discover which domains are communicating without being blocked.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Validation Problems">
<Accordion title="Badge Not Showing a Number or Icon">
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled in your browser extensions.
- Confirm your browser supports the required APIs and that the extension has permissions for webRequest and activeTab.
- Refresh or reload the tab after installation to trigger network monitoring.
- Check for browser-specific quirks or restrictions (see Prerequisites & System Requirements documentation).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Panel Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty">
- The active tab may not be generating network requests yet.
- Try navigating to a different site with active external resources.
- Close and reopen the popup panel to refresh the data.
- Check browser permissions and extension status.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Counts Seem Incorrect or Static">
- The extension updates request data asynchronously; wait a few seconds for counts to reflect.
- Network connections may be cached or blocked by other content blockers.
- Try disabling other content blockers to isolate behavior.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Verifying Installation Completeness

Successful activation means:

- The toolbar badge updates with the number of connected domains.
- The popup panel opens reliably when clicking the icon.
- Domains and their connection counts populate appropriately across allowed, stealth, and blocked categories.

These indicators confirm that uBO Scope is correctly tracking the webRequest API's network events for the active tab.

<Check>
If all above steps produce expected results, your installation is complete and uBO Scope is functioning effectively.

## Source References

- Toolbar badge updates depend on `background.js` monitoring network request events and setting badge text dynamically.
- Popup UI rendering is handled by `popup.js` which requests tab data and displays the domain lists.
- Domain counts reflect distinct domains from network outcomes: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
