# Quick Validation: Confirm uBO Scope is Working

Ensure that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your network requests and reporting accurate information by following this simple checklist and test scenario. This page guides you through quick validation steps to confirm the extension is functioning as expected right after installation or activation.

---

## 1. Understand What Success Looks Like

uBO Scope's primary function is to track distinct third-party remote servers your browser contacts while browsing. The core user-visible confirmation elements are:

- **Toolbar Badge Count:** Shows the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected to by the current active tab.
- **Popup Interface:** Displays categorized lists of domains in three groups:
  - **Not Blocked (allowed):** Domains with successful connections.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains whose connection attempts were stealth-blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed or were actively blocked.

A proper validation means seeing these dynamic counts and listings update as you browse.

## 2. Perform a Quick Validation Check

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm uBO Scope Is Installed and Enabled">
Open your browser’s extensions management page and verify uBO Scope is installed and enabled.

- In Chrome: Go to `chrome://extensions`.
- In Firefox: Navigate to `about:addons`.
- In Safari: Check `Preferences > Extensions`.

Ensure no disabling icons or error messages appear next to uBO Scope.
</Step>

<Step title="Load an Active Webpage">
Open any website with multiple third-party resources, such as https://www.wikipedia.org or https://news.ycombinator.com.

Watch the uBO Scope toolbar badge change:
- The badge showing a numeric count indicates the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- A blank badge means no third-party connections have been detected yet, which usually means the page hasn’t fully loaded or no third-party requests were made.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup to View Details">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup interface.

Observe the following:
- The header shows the current page’s hostname.
- The **domains connected** summary displays a number that matches or is close to the badge count.
- Sections list domains grouped under "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked" categories.

If these update dynamically as you navigate different pages, uBO Scope is functioning correctly.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Additional Sites and Observe Badge Updating">
Browse a few different websites known for third-party content (e.g., news sites, social media).

Confirm that:
- The badge count changes according to the active tab’s third-party request count.
- The popup displays different domains reflecting each site’s connections.

Consistency here is a key success indicator.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Troubleshooting Common Quick Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues During Quick Validation">
<Accordion title="Badge Does Not Update or Always Shows Blank">
- Confirm uBO Scope is allowed to run on the site (verify host permissions).
- Reload the webpage fully to trigger network request detection.
- Check that your browser's version meets the minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Ensure no other extensions block or interfere with uBO Scope’s webRequest API access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Popup Shows No Data or "NO DATA" Message'>
- Confirm that you are viewing the popup while having an active tab with recognized third-party requests.
- Try reloading the tab.
- Disable and re-enable uBO Scope to reset session data.
- Verify no browser privacy or security settings block extension scripts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Reflect Expected Number of Connections">
- Remember the badge counts distinct third-party remote domains connected, not total requests.
- Some requests may be stealth-blocked or blocked, and not counted in the "not blocked" category.
- If testing on sites with limited or no third-party content, badge count will be low or zero.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
For best validation results, test on active websites with known multiple third-party content providers, such as popular news platforms or social media, to ensure meaningful network activity.
</Tip>

## 4. How uBO Scope Collects and Reports Data (Background Context)

While you don’t need to understand the internals, it helps to know that uBO Scope listens to the browser's network requests using `webRequest` APIs.

- It categorizes requests into **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked** based on their network outcomes.
- It aggregates the number of distinct domains contacted per tab.
- The toolbar badge and popup interface update dynamically based on this data.

This mechanism guarantees accurate, real-time monitoring of your browsing connections regardless of content blockers or DNS filtering in place.

## 5. Next Steps After Successful Validation

Once you confirm uBO Scope is active and reporting:

- Proceed to learn how to interpret the popup data in detail via the ["Viewing Connections and Understanding the Badge" Guide](/getting-started/getting-up-and-running/using-network-monitoring).
- Explore related first-use setup instructions at [Activating and Accessing uBO Scope](/getting-started/getting-up-and-running/initial-launch-activation).
- For deeper troubleshooting, visit [Troubleshooting: No Connections Being Reported](/getting-started/troubleshooting-common-issues/nothing-being-reported).

## 6. Additional Validation Tips

- Refresh tabs multiple times and verify the badge updates each time.
- Validate on HTTP and HTTPS sites to confirm broad coverage.
- If privacy or security extensions are present, temporarily disable them if validation fails, to isolate conflicts.
- Keep uBO Scope updated to the latest version available from the official source.
