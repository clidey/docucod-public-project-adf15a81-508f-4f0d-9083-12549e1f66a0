# Quick Validation Checklist

Confirm that uBO Scope is actively monitoring and reporting network connections correctly with these practical steps. This checklist guides you through verifying the toolbar badge count, understanding the popup interface, and ensuring data accuracy for your active browser tabs.

---

## 1. Verify Toolbar Badge Count

The toolbar badge on the uBO Scope extension icon shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected to by the active tab.

### Steps:

1. Open your browser with uBO Scope installed and enabled.
2. Navigate to a webpage that loads external content (e.g., a popular news site or a social media page).
3. Look at the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar.
   - **Expected outcome:** The badge should display a non-empty number representing the count of distinct allowed third-party domains connected to by that page.
   - **If the badge is empty:**
      - Try refreshing the page.
      - Ensure the extension is active and not disabled.

### Tips:
- The badge count represents successful connections (allowed network requests) only, excluding blocked or stealth-blocked calls.
- A lower badge count generally indicates fewer third-party connections, often desirable for privacy.

<Check>
Confirm the count updates dynamically when you navigate between pages with different connection profiles.
</Check>

## 2. Inspect the Popup Interface

Open the uBO Scope popup (click the extension icon) to get detailed visibility of network connections categorized by outcome.

### Steps:

1. Click the uBO Scope extension icon to open the popup.
2. Observe the main header, which shows the hostname of the active tab.
3. Note the summary section showing 'domains connected' with a numeric value.
4. Review the connection outcome sections:
   - **Not Blocked:** Lists domains for allowed connections.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were redirected stealthily.
   - **Blocked:** Domains where network requests were blocked.

### Expected Results:
- The domains shown under each section should align logically with your browsing experience.
- The total count in the summary matches the total unique domains listed under "Not Blocked".

### Practical Example:
Navigate to a site with known third-party content (e.g., a news aggregator) and observe these categories populate accordingly.

<Warning>
Empty popup or NO DATA message can indicate no active tab data or a communication issue—try reloading the webpage or relaunching the browser.
</Warning>

## 3. Validate Data for Active Tabs

Ensure that data collected relates accurately to the currently active browser tab.

### Steps:

1. Open multiple tabs with different sites.
2. For each tab, open the uBO Scope popup and confirm:
   - The hostname at the top matches the page loaded in that tab.
   - The connection domains and counts differ appropriately between tabs.
3. Close a tab and verify the toolbar badge count updates or clears accordingly.

### Troubleshooting:
- If data does not change after switching tabs, check that the extension has necessary permissions and is enabled.
- If the badge count persists after closing tabs, restarting the browser typically clears cached states.

<Info>
uBO Scope maintains session data per tab using browser APIs and automatically resets data when tabs are closed.

## 4. Confirm Extension Activation and Permissions

The extension requires certain permissions and browser versions to function correctly.

### Check:
- Browsers supported: Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+.
- Permissions required: `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.

### Steps:
1. Visit your browser extension management page.
2. Confirm uBO Scope is enabled.
3. Confirm it has the required permissions granted.
4. If needed, reinstall or update the extension from the official store.

<Tip>
Using an incompatible browser version or lacking permissions will prevent correct monitoring and reporting.
</Tip>

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Solutions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Quick Validation">
<Accordion title='Badge Never Updates or Shows Zero'>
- Ensure you have loaded sites that perform third-party network requests.
- Refresh active tabs.
- Disable conflicting extensions that might interfere with webRequest API.
- Restart your browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title='Popup Shows NO DATA or No Domains Listed'>
- Confirm the tab is fully loaded.
- Some internal or local pages may not trigger network events.
- Check extension permissions.
- Reload the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title='Counts Seem Inconsistent Between Badge and Popup'>
- Badge shows allowed distinct domains for the active tab.
- Popup differentiates between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- Differences may arise if connections redirect or fail silently.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title='Data Does Not Update When Switching Tabs'>
- Make sure you actually switch popup focus or re-open the popup when changing tabs.
- Sometimes browser event timing delays updates.
- Reload the extension to reset any stale state.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
