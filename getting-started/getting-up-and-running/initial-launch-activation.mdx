# Activating and Accessing uBO Scope

Discover how to open uBO Scope in your browser, verify it is active, and understand the meaning of its toolbar badge and popup interface. This guide ensures you can confidently confirm the extension is running and ready to provide privacy insights.

---

## 1. Accessing the uBO Scope Extension

uBO Scope integrates directly into your browser’s toolbar with a distinct icon. Follow these steps to access it:

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Icon

- After installation, look for the uBO Scope icon on your browser's toolbar. Its icon resembles a stylized eye or scope logo.
- On browsers like Chrome or Firefox, the icon appears near the address bar or extension area.
- On Safari, ensure your toolbar is configured to display extension icons.

### Step 2: Activate the Extension Popup

- Click the uBO Scope icon to open its popup window.
- The popup displays current data about third-party connections initiated by the active tab.

<Tip>
If you do not see the icon immediately after installation, check your browser’s extensions menu and pin or enable uBO Scope for quick access.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The badge on the uBO Scope icon is your primary privacy indicator:

- **What it shows:** The number displayed represents the count of distinct third-party remote servers the active tab has successfully connected to.
- **Why it matters:** A lower number indicates fewer third-party connections, which generally relates to greater privacy.
- The badge updates dynamically as pages load and network requests complete.

<Info>
The count focuses exclusively on third-party domains, not total request counts or blocked items. This helps present a clear picture of actual external connections.
</Info>

## 3. Opening and Interpreting the Popup Interface

When the popup is open, you’ll see an organized view of connection details for the current tab:

- **Hostname Display:** Shows the current tab’s hostname and domain.
- **Summary Section:** Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Outcome Sections:**
  - **Not Blocked:** Lists domains where connections were allowed and succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Shows domains that were redirected stealthily or blocked silently.
  - **Blocked:** Displays domains where connections failed due to blocking.

Each section lists domains along with connection counts, helping you identify where third-party requests are directed.

## 4. Confirming uBO Scope is Running Correctly

To ensure uBO Scope is active and tracking:

### Step 1: Visit a Known Website

- Open a webpage that typically loads third-party resources (e.g., news site, social media platform).

### Step 2: Click the uBO Scope Icon

- Verify the badge count changes to reflect connected third-party domains.
- Open the popup and observe populated domain lists under the outcome categories.

### Step 3: Check for Real-Time Updates

- Reload or navigate to different pages and watch if the badge and popup update accordingly.

<Tip>
If the badge remains empty or the popup shows 'NO DATA,' verify you have enabled all necessary permissions during installation and your browser meets minimum requirements outlined in the installation guide.
</Tip>

## 5. When is uBO Scope Active?

uBO Scope is active whenever the browser session is ongoing with the extension enabled:

- It continuously monitors network requests for every tab.
- The toolbar badge and popup reflect data in real time or near real time.
- Closing a tab resets its tracked data.

<Note>
If you disable uBO Scope or uninstall the extension, data tracking will stop immediately.
</Note>
