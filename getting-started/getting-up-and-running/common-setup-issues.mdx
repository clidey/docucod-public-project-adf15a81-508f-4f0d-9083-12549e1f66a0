# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide provides straightforward, effective solutions for frequent installation and activation problems that users may encounter with the uBO Scope browser extension. Whether you're facing permission denials, missing extension functionality, or the extension icon not appearing in your browser, this page will help you quickly recover and get uBO Scope running smoothly.

---

## 1. Extension Not Appearing in Browser Toolbar

If after installation you cannot see the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser's toolbar, follow these steps:

### For Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Edge, etc.):
- Click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions) to reveal installed extensions.
- Find 'uBO Scope' and click the pin icon to pin it to the toolbar.
- If it’s not listed, verify installation success by opening `chrome://extensions/` and searching for "uBO Scope".
- If missing, reinstall the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).

### For Firefox:
- Click the puzzle piece icon in the toolbar.
- Locate 'uBO Scope' and click the pin icon to show it in the toolbar.
- Confirm installation at `about:addons` under Extensions.
- If missing, reinstall from the [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) page.

### For Safari:
- Open Safari Preferences, go to Extensions.
- Ensure 'uBO Scope' is enabled.
- Check if the toolbar button is enabled in the View menu under Customize Toolbar.
- If the extension is not listed, reinstall via the App Store or the developer-provided package.

<Check>
If the extension is installed but not visible:
- Ensure your browser version meets minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Restart your browser after installation.
</Check>

## 2. Missing Required Permissions or Incomplete Activation

uBO Scope requires explicit permissions to monitor web requests and track storage. If the extension lacks these, it may not function properly.

### How to Verify and Fix Permissions:

1. Open your browser's extension management page:
   - Chromium: `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`
   - Firefox: `about:addons`
   - Safari: Safari Preferences > Extensions

2. Locate uBO Scope and inspect its permissions.

3. Make sure 'activeTab', 'storage', and 'webRequest' permissions are granted.

4. If permissions seem restricted:
   - Remove the extension and reinstall it from the official store.
   - After installation, the browser should prompt you for necessary permissions. Approve all.

5. For Chromium browsers, check if you've accidentally disabled 'Allow access to file URLs' if you need it.

6. Restart the browser to ensure permissions are applied automatically.

<Warning>
Due to browser security policies, incomplete permission grants can prevent uBO Scope from operating fully. Always fully accept the permission requests.
</Warning>

## 3. Extension Shows No Data or "NO DATA" in Popup

If the popup displays "NO DATA" or remains empty, this usually indicates the extension is not tracking network activity properly.

### Troubleshooting Steps:

- Confirm that uBO Scope is active on the current tab:
  - The extension only tracks network requests for active tabs it has permission to access.
  - Switch to a different tab or reload the page.

- Check for conflicting extensions:
  - Some extensions might interfere with uBO Scope's ability to listen to network requests.
  - Temporarily disable other content blockers or network-related extensions and test again.

- Confirm browser compatibility and version:
  - uBO Scope requires Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+.
  - Older browser versions may block or limit extension APIs.

- Restart the browser to clear any temporary internal state issues.

---

## 4. Toolbar Badge Count Does Not Update or Is Incorrect

If the badge count on the toolbar icon doesn't reflect current connections or stays empty:

- Reload the active tab to generate new network activity.
- Confirm that you have navigated to a webpage that makes remote server connections.
- Check your browser's Site Settings to ensure uBO Scope has not been blocked or restricted for the current site.
- Restart the browser to reset the extension background process.

---

## 5. Extension Not Monitoring Network Requests (Background Script Issues)

Since uBO Scope uses browser webRequest API listeners in its background script to monitor network connections, issues here can prevent proper monitoring.

### What to do:

- Verify the background script is active (service worker in Chromium or background page in Firefox/Safari).
- Restart the browser to reload the background script.
- Disable and re-enable the extension to force background script reload.
- Confirm browser version support for Manifest V3 and webRequest API (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

<Tip>
If comfortable, use your browser's developer tools (Extensions/debugger) to inspect if background script is running and if errors appear.
</Tip>

## 6. Installation Fails or Extension Is Disabled Suddenly

### Common reasons:

- Browser version incompatible with minimum requirements.
- Corruption during extension installation.
- Conflicts with browser policies or management (corporate restrictions).
- Extension update errors.

### Recovery steps:

- Remove and reinstall the extension from the official store.
- Make sure your browser is up to date.
- Disable or remove conflicting extensions.
- Check for antivirus or security software that might block the extension or browser APIs.

<Warning>
Some browsers or platforms (especially managed or corporate environments) may restrict extension permissions, blocking uBO Scope functionality.
</Warning>

## 7. Permission Prompts Not Appearing or Extension Can't Acquire Permissions

If the extension does not prompt for required permissions or fails to activate:

- Restart the browser and try again.
- Manually check and adjust extension permissions in the browser settings.
- For Chromium browsers, ensure you do not have "developer mode" disabled if installing locally.

---

## 8. Recovery Steps Based on Known Platform Quirks

### Safari:

- Verify Safari version is 18.5 or later.
- Ensure the extension is enabled in Preferences > Extensions.
- If the extension icon is missing, customize the toolbar to add it manually.
- Restart Safari after enabling.

### Chromium:

- Confirm minimum Chrome version 122.0.
- When using developer builds or sideloading, enable developer mode.
- Clear browser cache and restart in case of stale extension scripts.

### Firefox:

- Confirm Firefox is version 128.0 or greater.
- Some nightly or ESR builds may not fully support Manifest V3 APIs required.
- Restart Firefox to reload extension service workers.

# Pro Tips

- Always restart your browser after installing or updating the extension.
- Use the browser’s extension management page to manually verify permissions and status.
- If multiple extensions are interacting with network requests, use controlled experiments disabling others to isolate issues.

# Common Pitfalls

- Ignoring browser version requirements leading to silent failures.
- Denying permissions prompts, which disables functionality.
- Forgetting to pin or add the extension icon to the toolbar, causing confusion.
- Assuming extension activation is instant; some reloading or restarting is required.
