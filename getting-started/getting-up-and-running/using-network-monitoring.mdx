# Viewing Connections and Understanding the Badge

Discover how to open the uBO Scope extension popup, interpret the detailed domain connection data, and understand how these insights empower you to monitor third-party connections impacting your privacy and network security.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

uBO Scope provides real-time insight into network connections through a convenient popup interface linked to the browser toolbar icon.

### Steps to Access the Popup:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon** on your browser toolbar. It appears as the extension's logo.
2. Click the icon once to open the popup panel.
3. The popup will display connection statistics and domain lists related to your current active tab.

<Check>
If the popup does not open, ensure the extension is installed and active by verifying it in your browser's extensions page.
</Check>

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The badge on the toolbar icon displays a real-time count that reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers your current tab has connected to.

### What the Badge Number Represents:

- **Count Meaning:** The badge shows how many unique third-party domains your browser has connected to from the active tab.
- **Privacy Implication:** A lower number is better, indicating fewer distinct third-party connections and less tracking or data exposure.
- **Scope:** This includes all connection attempts, whether allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

### Best Practices for Badge Interpretation:

- Use the badge count as a quick privacy indicator.
- Remember not all third-party domains are harmful; some are essential services like CDNs.
- The badge is independent of any content blockers; it reflects actual network activity observable by the browser.

<Tip>
Keep an eye on sudden spikes in the badge count as it could indicate unexpected or increased third-party activity on a webpage.

## 3. Popup Data Breakdown: Domain Categories and Counts

The popup interface categorizes domains based on the outcome of their connection attempts within the current tab session.

### Categories Explained:

| Category       | Description                                                 | What It Means for You                                |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked** | Domains successfully connected without intervention          | These are allowed third-party connections           |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains whose connections were redirected or hidden to avoid detection | Connections blocked stealthily by content blockers  |
| **Blocked**     | Domains for which connection attempts failed or were explicitly blocked | Connections that were prevented from being established |

### How to Read the Popup Sections:

- Each section lists domains in alphabetical order.
- For each domain, a count indicates how many connection attempts occurred.
- The total number of distinct domains connected is shown at the top.

### Example Interpretation:

If the "not blocked" list shows 3 domains with counts 7, 2, and 1 respectively, it means your current tab connected 10 times collectively across those 3 third-party domains.

## 4. Real-World Value: What These Connections Mean

Understanding connection outcomes enables you to:

- **Assess Privacy Exposure:** By seeing all third-party connections, you know what external entities receive your data or tracking information.
- **Evaluate Content Blocker Effectiveness:** Recognize which requests are blocked or stealth-blocked, helping validate your content blocking setup.
- **Detect Unexpected Activity:** Spot unknown or suspicious third-party connections, enabling proactive measures.

<Note>
The extension reports connections based on the browser's webRequest API, reflecting real attempts and outcomes independent of DNS or other external filters.
</Note>

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Regularly check the badge count and popup details when visiting unfamiliar or privacy-sensitive sites.
- Use the domain counts to identify heavily connected third parties and investigate their necessity.
- Understand that some domains, like content delivery networks (CDNs), are benign and often essential.
- Refresh the popup by reopening it when navigating to a new tab to get updated connection data.

<Tip>
If you see many stealth-blocked or blocked connections but the badge count remains high, it means many distinct connections were still allowed â€“ your content blocker may need tuning.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope Popup and Badge">
<Accordion title="Popup Does Not Open or Shows No Data">
- Verify the extension is installed and enabled.
- Reload the browser or restart it if needed.
- Ensure you are on a website that generates network connections; some internal or local pages may show no data.
- Confirm the browser version meets [system requirements]( /getting-started/installation-basics/system-requirements).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Shows No Number or Zero Constantly">
- This means no third-party connections have been observed for the current tab.
- Refresh the tab or try visiting a different site with external resources.
- Check for other content blockers that might interfere with connection reporting.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Connection Counts Seem Too High or Low">
- Remember the badge counts distinct third-party domains, not total requests.
- The popup provides detailed breakdown to help clarify what the counts represent.
- Some connections may occur from background requests or browser services.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
