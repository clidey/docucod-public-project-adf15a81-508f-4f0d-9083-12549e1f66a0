# Quick Setup Validation

Ensure uBO Scope is fully operational with these quick checks. This guide walks you through verifying that the extension is actively monitoring network requests, shows the expected connection data within the popup UI, and that the toolbar badge count dynamically reflects the active tab’s third-party connections. It also provides targeted troubleshooting steps for common issues encountered during initial setup.

---

## 1. Validate Network Request Tracking

uBO Scope relies on monitoring your browser's network requests to report remote connections accurately.

### Steps:

1. **Open a website you want to analyze.**
2. **Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.**
3. **Observe the displayed data:**
   - The tab's hostname and domain should appear prominently at the top.
   - The counts of connected domains should update in the sections labeled "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked".

<Tip>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or empty domains, uBO Scope might not be capturing network requests properly.
</Tip>

### What should happen:

- The popup panel should show the remote domains connected to by the current tab in categorized sections.
- The domain counts should increase as the page loads and makes network requests.

## 2. Confirm Toolbar Badge Behavior

The badge on the uBO Scope icon reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers accessed by the active tab.

### Steps:

1. Make sure the extension is enabled in your browser.
2. Load or reload a webpage in your active tab.
3. Look at the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
4. Verify that the badge number updates, showing a count of third-party domains connected.

<Note>
If no badge appears or the badge does not update after page navigation or reload,
check that uBO Scope has the required permissions and is enabled for the active tab.
</Note>

### Expected results:

- Badge number shows a count matching or related to connection data shown in the popup.
- Changing tabs or reloading the page updates the badge count accordingly.

## 3. Quick Troubleshooting for Common Issues

Use this section to quickly address typical reasons for missing or inaccurate data.

### Issue: Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Empty Connection Lists

- **Verify extension is enabled:**
  - Check your browser’s extensions/settings page.
  - Ensure uBO Scope is active and has necessary permissions.

- **Reload the current tab:**
  - Sometimes refresh resets data capture.

- **Network Requests may be invisible to uBO Scope:**
  - Some content blockers or browser security settings might block the `webRequest` API.
  - Due to browser limitations, some requests may not be monitored.

### Issue: Toolbar Badge Does Not Appear or Update

- **Extension permissions:**
  - Confirm permissions for `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and storage are granted.

- **Browser compatibility:**
  - Ensure you use a supported browser version (Chromium ≥ 122, Firefox ≥ 128, Safari ≥ 18.5).

- **Conflicting Extensions:**
  - Disable other extensions interfering with network monitoring.

- **Restart the browser:**
  - To reset extension state and allow proper initialization.

### Additional Tips

- Visit multiple websites with distinct third-party content to confirm data changes accordingly.
- Opening uBO Scope’s popup shortly after page load helps verify the expected network requests are captured.

## 4. Understanding What You See

- **Domain Categories in Popup:**
  - **Not blocked:** Connections allowed by any content blocker.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Connections hidden or redirected stealthily.
  - **Blocked:** Connections prevented outright.

- **Badge Count Meaning:**
  - Shows the number of unique third-party domains contacted.
  - A lower number typically signifies fewer remote connections and reduced tracking.

## 5. Next Steps

Once your setup is validated:

- Explore [Your First Usage: Viewing Remote Connections](/getting-started/using-extension/first-usage) to interpret the popup details.
- Review [Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count](/guides/getting-started-with-ubo-scope/understanding-the-badge) to deepen your insight.
- If issues persist, consult [Troubleshooting Common Setup Problems](/getting-started/using-extension/common-issues) for detailed guidance.
