# Validating Installation & Activation

Ensure your uBO Scope extension is properly installed and actively monitoring your browser's network activity by following these clear, practical steps. This validation process confirms your extension is ready to provide real-time insights into the distinct third-party servers accessed by websites.

---

## 1. Confirm the Toolbar Icon Presence

- After installing uBO Scope, look for its icon in your browser toolbar.
- The icon typically resembles a shield or the uBO Scope logo (refer to your browser’s extension section if not visible).

<Tip>
If the icon is missing, check your browser’s extension management page to verify the extension is enabled.
</Tip>

## 2. Understand the Badge Count

- The badge count overlay on the toolbar icon displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers your active tab connects to.
- A lower number on this badge means fewer third-party domains have been reached — which generally indicates better privacy.

<Info>
The badge count reflects **only distinct third-party domains that had successful connections**, excluding blocked or stealth-blocked domains.
</Info>

## 3. Interact with the Popup Interface

- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup panel.
- The popup displays:
  - The current tab's hostname and primary domain.
  - A summary of ‘domains connected’ showing how many distinct domains were contacted and allowed.
  - Three sections categorizing domains as:
    - **Not Blocked**: Connections allowed.
    - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections blocked stealthily to avoid detection.
    - **Blocked**: Connections actively blocked.

### Step-by-Step Popup Check
<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon next to your browser’s address bar.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Hostname and Domain">
At the top, confirm the displayed hostname and domain match the active web page (punycode domains display as Unicode).
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Count Summary">
Look at the 'domains connected' count immediately visible under the heading.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domain Categories">
Scroll through each category (not blocked, stealth-blocked, blocked) to view distinct domain hosts and their request counts.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or lacks information, wait a few seconds and refresh the active tab or try navigating to a different website.
</Tip>

## 4. Verify Network Activity Reporting

- Visit a well-known website that loads third-party resources (e.g., news site, ecommerce platform).
- Observe the badge count changes as the site loads.
- Open the popup to see a list of domains reflecting real network activity.

<Warning>
The extension depends on your browser's `webRequest` API. Some browsers or specific browsing modes (like incognito/private) may restrict this API, limiting data collection.
</Warning>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Validation Issues">
<Accordion title="Missing Toolbar Icon">
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled in your browser’s extensions manager.
- Pin the extension icon to the toolbar if hidden.
- Restart your browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
- Navigate to a site with known external connections.
- Confirm you have the `webRequest` permission granted (check your browser permissions for uBO Scope).
- Reload the tab and the popup.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA">
- Check if the tab is active and supports monitoring.
- Refresh the tab or open a new tab.
- Disable and re-enable the extension.
- Restart the browser.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Confirming Installation via Browser Extension Settings

- Go to your browser’s extension/add-ons page.
- Locate uBO Scope (or uBlock Origin Scope).
- Confirm the listed version matches the latest stable (e.g., 1.0.1).
- Check permissions granted include `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.

<Check>
Correct permissions and version ensure uBO Scope functions fully.
</Check>

## 7. Successful Validation Outcomes

When uBO Scope is correctly installed and active, you will observe:

- The toolbar icon appears and displays a dynamic badge count.
- Opening the popup presents current tab domain details with categorized network connection data.
- The badge count updates as you browse websites with third-party connections.
- Network connections reflect real browsing activity across tabs.
