# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This page helps you diagnose and resolve frequent early roadblocks that may prevent uBO Scope from functioning correctly. If you encounter missing toolbar icons, absent data in the popup, or permission-related errors immediately after installation, follow the actionable solutions below to get the extension working seamlessly.

---

## 1. Missing or Invisible Toolbar Icon

A missing toolbar icon means you won’t be able to open uBO Scope's popup interface or see the badge count.

### How to Resolve

1. **Confirm Installation:** Verify uBO Scope appears in your browser’s list of installed extensions.
    - In Chrome-based browsers: `chrome://extensions/`
    - In Firefox: `about:addons`
    - In Safari: Safari > Preferences > Extensions

2. **Pin the Extension to Toolbar:**
    - In Chrome or Edge, click the puzzle piece icon and pin uBO Scope.
    - In Firefox, ensure the extension’s icon is enabled to display on the toolbar.

3. **Browser Version Compatibility:** Ensure your browser version meets the minimum required version for uBO Scope.

4. **Restart Your Browser:** Sometimes a restart is needed for the icon to show up after installation.

### Common Pitfalls

- Installing in a profile or container where extensions are disabled.
- Browser updates may deactivate extensions; verify after updates.

## 2. No Data or "NO DATA" Displayed in Popup

Seeing "NO DATA" in the popup means the extension isn't receiving network request details for the current tab.

### How to Fix

1. **Refresh the Active Tab:** Reload the webpage you want to monitor to generate new network activity.

2. **Switch Tabs:** Navigate to another tab with network activity. uBO Scope shows network data for the active tab.

3. **First Run Initialization Delay:** On first install or browser start, it can take a few seconds for uBO Scope to gather data.

4. **Active Permissions:** Ensure the extension has permissions to access data for the active tab.
    - Permissions requested during installation must be accepted.

5. **Disable Conflicting Extensions:** Other extensions might interfere with webRequest API usage.

6. **Verify Browser Supports WebRequest Eventing:**
    - uBO Scope relies on browser support to observe network requests.
    - Some browsers or privacy settings can block this.

### Tips

- Try opening developer tools and interacting with the page to generate network requests.
- Use a well-known site with active external resource loading to validate data.

## 3. Permission Errors or "Access Denied" Messages

Errors related to permissions indicate uBO Scope cannot monitor network requests due to restrictions.

### Step-by-Step Remediation

1. **Check Extension Permissions:**
    - uBO Scope requires `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` permissions.
    - Reinstall the extension if prompted for missing permissions.

2. **Verify Host Permissions:**
    - The extension requests access to all `http` and `https` URLs by default.
    - Confirm these permissions are granted in your browser.

3. **Browser Policy Enforcement:**
    - Some browsers or organizational policies can restrict extension permissions.
    - Check with your IT administrator if on a managed device.

4. **Manifest Permissions Review:**
    - If building from source or modifying, ensure `host_permissions` include appropriate URL patterns like:

```json
"host_permissions": [
  "https://*/*",
  "http://*/*"
]
```

5. **Restart Browser After Permission Changes:**

## 4. Badge Count Not Updating Correctly

If the toolbar icon badge shows no number or incorrect counts:

- Confirm you have active network activity in the tab.
- Refresh the tab to trigger new data collection.
- Restart the browser to reset session tracking.
- Disable other blocking extensions that may interfere.

## 5. Extension Appears Installed but Popup Does Not Open

Sometimes clicking the toolbar icon results in no popup or a blank screen.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. Reload the extension:
    - In Chrome: `chrome://extensions/` → toggle off/on.
    - In Firefox: `about:addons` → disable/enable the extension.

2. Clear browser cache or restart the browser.

3. Inspect extension errors via browser debug tools:
    - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/` → Developer mode → Inspect views
    - Firefox: about:debugging → Inspect

4. Check console logs for errors in `popup.js` or `background.js`.

5. If debugging, verify all source files (`popup.html`, `popup.js`) are intact.

## 6. Using Developer Tools to Debug

For developers or advanced users:

- Access the background service worker console to view logged events.
- Check the popup console to see rendering and data issues.
- Validate configuration files like `manifest.json` for proper permissions and paths.

## 7. Additional Support and Resources

If problems persist:

- Review the [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/guides/getting-started/installing-ubo-scope.mdx) guide for clean installs.
- Check [Verifying Installation](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/getting-started/using-extension/verifying-installation.mdx) for validation techniques.
- Join community forums or GitHub Issues to report persistent bugs.

<Tip>
Always keep your browser and uBO Scope extension updated to the latest versions to avoid compatibility problems.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Permissions are crucial: denying or revoking required permissions disables core features of uBO Scope.
</Warning>

<Note>
The extension depends on the browser’s WebRequest API to monitor network traffic; some modern browsers may limit or deprecate this API.
