# Troubleshooting Common Setup Problems

When getting started with uBO Scope, some users encounter common issues related to installation, permissions, browser compatibility, or extension behavior. This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve these frequent problems so you can start monitoring remote connections with confidence.

---

## 1. Extension Permissions Issues

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network connections. If these permissions are missing or not granted correctly, the extension will not function as expected.

### Symptoms
- The toolbar badge does not update or remains empty.
- The popup shows "NO DATA" or no network connections when browsing.
- Network requests are not recorded or displayed.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Verify Extension Permissions in Your Browser**  
   - Go to your browser's extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions/` for Chrome, `about:addons` for Firefox).
   - Locate uBO Scope and click on "Details".
   - Ensure that permissions for "Access your data on all websites", "Storage", and "Web Request" are enabled.

2. **Manually Enable Host Permissions**  
   - Some browsers (especially Chromium-based) allow disabling host permissions.
   - Confirm that uBO Scope has permission to access URLs matching `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and WebSocket protocols (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).

3. **Reinstall the Extension**  
   - Remove the extension and install it again from the official store to reset permissions.

<Tip>
Always install uBO Scope from the official Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons site, or Safari Extensions Gallery to ensure proper permissions and updates.

## 2. Toolbar Badge Not Updating

The toolbar badge indicates how many distinct third-party remote servers have been contacted on the active tab. If this badge fails to update, it usually means network events are not getting processed.

### Common Causes
- Extension is disabled or not fully activated.
- Browser does not support required minimum version.
- Network requests are happening outside the browser’s `webRequest` API reach.

### How to Fix
1. **Confirm Extension is Enabled**  
   - Check your browser toolbar or extensions page to ensure uBO Scope is enabled.

2. **Check Browser Version Compatibility**  
   - Make sure you are running at least:
     - Chromium 122 or newer
     - Firefox 128 or newer
     - Safari 18.5 or newer
   - Older versions may lack necessary APIs or manifest support.

3. **Reload the Active Tab**  
   - Close and reopen the tab or refresh the page to trigger fresh network events.

4. **Confirm Network Requests Are Being Made**  
   - Some pages or browser modes (like incognito with limited extension permissions) might prevent the extension from monitoring requests.

5. **Check for Conflicting Extensions**  
   - Content blockers or network proxies may interfere; try disabling other extensions to isolate the issue.

## 3. Browser Compatibility and Platform Gotchas

While uBO Scope works across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari, each platform has nuances.

### Minimum Versions
- Chromium browsers must be version 122 or later.
- Firefox must be version 128 or later.
- Safari requires version 18.5 or later.

Using unsupported browsers or old browser versions will prevent uBO Scope from functioning.

### Permissions Differences
- Safari users must explicitly grant extension access to all websites via Safari’s Extensions preferences pane.
- Firefox applies strict add-on policies; verify uBO Scope is up to date and enabled.

<Tip>
Check your browser's update settings regularly to ensure you keep uBO Scope and your browser itself current for best compatibility.
</Tip>

## 4. Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Empty Results

When opening uBO Scope’s popup interface, sometimes it displays "NO DATA" under the tab hostname, or the domain connection sections are empty.

### What This Means
- The extension has no data for the current tab.
- Network requests have not yet been detected or recorded.

### What To Do
1. **Verify You Are Viewing an Active, Loaded Tab**  
   - The extension only tracks network requests for the active tab in the current window.

2. **Reload the Page**  
   - Refresh the page to trigger network requests.

3. **Wait Briefly**  
   - The extension processes network requests in batches; allow a few seconds after page load.

4. **Check Extension Enabled State**  
   - Disabled or paused extension cannot collect data.

---

## 5. Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Disable other network or content-blocking extensions temporarily** to determine if they interfere with uBO Scope.
- **Restart your browser** if you notice persistent issues after installation or update.
- **Check browser console logs** (Developer Tools → Console) for errors related to uBO Scope.
- **Verify storage permission** since uBO Scope uses browser storage to save session data; restrictive privacy settings may block this.

<Warning>
Clearing browser cookies or browsing data may reset session storage, potentially affecting uBO Scope's stored session data but will not impact functionality.
</Warning>
