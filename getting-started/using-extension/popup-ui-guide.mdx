# Understanding the Popup Interface

Explore and interpret the essential elements you'll see when you open uBO Scope’s popup interface. This guide helps you understand connection statuses, domain lists, and badge counts for the current browser tab, empowering you to quickly assess network activities and security-related information.

---

## 1. Overview of the Popup Layout

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup reveals a concise yet powerful summary of network connection outcomes for the active tab, organized into several distinct sections:

- **Tab Hostname Header**
- **Summary of Connected Domains**
- **Lists of Domains Grouped by Outcome:**  
  - Not Blocked (Allowed)
  - Stealth-Blocked
  - Blocked

Each section is designed for clarity and immediate insight into the current tab’s network footprint.

### 1.1 Tab Hostname Header

At the top, the popup shows the hostname of the webpage you are visiting:

- The domain is displayed in Unicode form (helpful for internationalized domain names).
- If the hostname is a subdomain, the split is visually indicated to distinguish the subdomain from the base domain.

### 1.2 Domains Connected Summary

Below the header, a summary count shows the total number of *distinct* domains the tab connected to (not blocked).

### 1.3 Lists of Domains by Outcome

The main panel divides domains into three outcome categories:

| Outcome          | Meaning                                                                 | UI Indicator                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**  | Domains contacted without being blocked. These indicate allowed network connections.
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains whose connections were blocked indirectly or stealthily by the content blocker.
| **Blocked**      | Domains whose network requests were explicitly blocked, preventing any data exchange.

Each outcome section lists domains along with how many connections occurred per domain. The counts reflect the total request occurrences, providing visibility into connection intensities.

 <Note>
The popup only shows domains that had *network requests* directly related to the current browser tab.
</Note>

## 2. Detailed Elements and Interpretation

### 2.1 Domain Lists

- Domains are sorted alphabetically within each outcome group for easier scanning.
- Each domain is shown in Unicode to handle international domains correctly.
- Next to each domain is a badge count showing the number of connection attempts or requests associated with that domain.

### 2.2 Outcome Definitions Explained

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** These domains represent remote servers your browser successfully contacted and fetched data from during your session on the current tab.

- **Stealth-Blocked:** This category shows domains blocked in ways that make the blocking less obvious or indirect—for example, network redirects or complicated interference that doesn't cleanly allow or block the request but still prevents certain requests from succeeding.

- **Blocked:** Domains listed here were actively blocked by the content blocker, preventing any network communication.

 <Tip>
Understanding these distinctions helps you identify how the content blocker is working and which domains pose privacy or security concerns.

## 3. How the Popup Reflects Real Network Activity

uBO Scope listens to real-time network events from your browser, filtering and categorizing requests based on their success or failure status. The popup dynamically updates whenever you open it, showing the latest connection details relevant to the active tab.

- The domain counts correspond to unique third-party domains contacted.
- The badge on the toolbar icon matches the count of allowed domains, giving you an at-a-glance indicator of network exposure.

---

## 4. Practical Tips for Using the Popup

- **Evaluate Privacy Exposure:** A higher count of domains under 'Not Blocked' suggests greater network exposure. Privacy-conscious users will typically prefer lower counts.
- **Investigate Stealth Blocking:** If you see many stealth-blocked domains, it may indicate subtle blocking techniques in play. Consider if this aligns with your content blocking settings.
- **Spot Suspicious Domains:** Use the domain lists to quickly spot unexpected or unknown domains, possibly signaling trackers or unwanted servers.

## 5. Common Challenges and Troubleshooting

### 5.1 No Data Shown in Popup

If the popup header shows 'NO DATA' or an empty interface:

- Ensure you have an active tab selected that has loaded network data.
- Confirm uBO Scope is installed and actively monitoring (see Validating Installation).
- Reload the webpage to generate fresh network events.

### 5.2 Badge Count Not Updating

- The badge count reflects distinct allowed domains for the current tab.
- Wait a few moments after navigation as network requests are processed asynchronously.
- Verify your browser permissions allow uBO Scope to monitor network requests.

 <Warning>
The extension's network monitoring depends on browser `webRequest` API availability. Some browsing modes or settings may restrict this.
</Warning>

## 6. Summary

| Popup Element           | Purpose                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Tab Hostname           | Shows the current webpage’s domain in readable form.
| Domains Connected Count | Total count of distinct allowed domains.
| Allowed Domains List   | Domains successfully contacted without blocking.
| Stealth-Blocked Domains | Domains blocked by indirect means.
| Blocked Domains List   | Domains actively blocked from contact.

This simple, structured interface provides transparency and actionable insights into real-time network activities for your privacy and security.
