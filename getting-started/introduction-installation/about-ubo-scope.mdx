# What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight, browser extension designed to reveal every remote server your browser attempts to connect to during your web browsing sessions. Its unique purpose is to provide unparalleled transparency into all network connections—whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked—independent of any content blocking or privacy tools you may be using.

By highlighting these remote connections, uBO Scope empowers users to better understand their online footprint, assess the effectiveness of their content blockers, and debunk common misconceptions about how blocking technologies operate.

## Why uBO Scope Matters

Modern browsers and content blockers filter requests silently, often leaving users unaware of what is actually happening under the hood. Here's why uBO Scope matters:

- **Complete Transparency:** It reports all attempts to connect to third-party servers, regardless of whether requests were allowed or blocked.
- **Independent Insight:** Works alongside any content blocker, revealing actual network activity instead of relying on inferred behaviors.
- **Privacy Awareness:** Enables users to identify third-party domains their browser contacts, helping expose potential privacy issues.
- **Myth Busting:** Helps debunk common myths that can lead to misunderstandings about blocker effectiveness.

## Core Functionality

### What uBO Scope Reports

uBO Scope collects and categorizes every network request made by your browser, classifying domains into three main outcomes:

- **Allowed:** Domains successfully connected to by your browser.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were silently redirected or stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests were explicitly blocked or failed.

For each browser tab, uBO Scope tracks these outcomes and displays a count of unique third-party remote servers contacted via its toolbar icon badge.

### Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The badge on the browser toolbar shows the number of **distinct third-party** remote domains your browser connected to in the current tab. A lower number generally signifies fewer remote server connections, indicating a more restrictive networking footprint.

> **Important:** This count is a measure of remote servers actually contacted, not simply the number of blocked requests.

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Privacy-Focused Users:** Monitor what external servers your browser contacts, gaining a clearer picture of online exposure.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Verify whether their rules effectively limit third-party connections without causing excess blockages.
- **Developers & Analysts:** Analyze network behavior and content blocker impacts with real data.

## How uBO Scope Works Behind the Scenes (Simplified)

While the extension operates seamlessly, it leverages browser APIs to listen to every network request your browser initiates and records their outcomes precisely.

Specifically, it uses the browser's `webRequest` API to track network request attempts, errors, redirects, and successes. It organizes these events per tab and associates domains via a public suffix list to accurately identify registrable domains.

## What to Expect After Installation

- **Immediate Visibility:** Once installed and enabled, uBO Scope instantly begins monitoring network connections.
- **Toolbar Badge Updates:** The badge count adjusts dynamically as you browse, reflecting the current tab's third-party remote server connections.
- **Popup Panel:** Click the toolbar icon to view detailed lists of domains categorized by their request outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).

## Best Practices and Tips

- Regularly review the badge count and popup details for each tab to monitor third-party exposure.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blocker to verify its effectiveness.
- Understand that not all third-party domains are malicious; content delivery networks (CDNs) and essential services also appear.

<Tip>
A lower badge count generally indicates fewer unique third-party servers contacted, implying better privacy and less tracking surface.

<Tip>
Consider correlating uBO Scope data with your content blocker’s logs to get comprehensive insights.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

- **Why does the badge count change with browsing activity?**

  The extension dynamically updates as network requests succeed or fail per tab.

- **Does uBO Scope block anything itself?**

  No. It only monitors and reports network activity without intervening.

- **Can uBO Scope see requests made outside the browser?**

  No. It only tracks requests visible via the browser’s `webRequest` API.
