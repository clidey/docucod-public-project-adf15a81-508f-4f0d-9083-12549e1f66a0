# What is uBO Scope?

## Overview

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to provide transparent, real-time insight into all network connections your browser attempts or successfully establishes while browsing. Its core mission is to reveal the full landscape of third-party remote servers contacted by webpages, going beyond the usual metrics shown by content blockers. By monitoring network requests at a granular level, uBO Scope empowers you with actionable knowledge about your browsing traffic, helping you improve privacy, security, and performance awareness.

This page explains what uBO Scope does, why it matters, and where it fits in your browsing and privacy toolkit.

## What uBO Scope Does

- **Tracks every remote server connection your browser attempts**, covering all URLs your browser requests, including those allowed, blocked, or stealthily intercepted.
- **Works independently of content blockers** — it reports network requests regardless of which blocker you use, so it is a reliable baseline to understand actual network activity.
- **Reports outcomes per tab** — you learn exactly which third-party domains each tab contacts.
- **Aggregates data by domain and network outcome**, distinguishing allowed connections, blocked connections, and stealth modes.
- **Displays data via popup and toolbar badge** for immediate visual feedback.

<u>Example scenario:</u> When visiting a news site, uBO Scope reveals all third-party servers your browser connects to, showing which requests were allowed, which were blocked, and highlighting stealthy connections not normally visible. This clarity helps you assess third-party presence beyond just block counts.

## Why uBO Scope Matters

### Real Transparency Beyond Block Counts
Many content blockers use raw block counts and synthetic "ad blocker test" sites to measure effectiveness—both misleading. A higher block count does not necessarily mean better privacy or less tracking, because it can mask connections allowed to other third-party servers.

<u>uBO Scope debunks myths</u> by showing the exact number of *distinct* third-party domains your browser connects to, regardless of how many requests were blocked or allowed. This helps you:

- Avoid overvaluing blockers with artificially inflated block counts.
- Understand the true level of third-party exposure.
- Make informed decisions about which filters or blockers to use.

### Valuable Tool for Different Users

- **Privacy-minded users** gain a clear window into their network traffic.
- **Filter list maintainers** can verify the reach of their rules objectively.
- **Content blocker evaluators** see consistent cross-browser telemetry regardless of blocking stealth techniques.
- **Everyone** benefits from an objective perspective on third-party connections.

## Core Use Cases

### 1. Monitoring Third-Party Connections
See all third-party domains contacted by each tab in real time. Understand how many and which external servers your browser talks to, broken down by whether connections were blocked, allowed, or stealthy.

### 2. Debunking Content Blocker Misconceptions
Use uBO Scope’s domain count to evaluate content blockers more objectively than block counts or unrealistic third-party test pages, which often mislead users.

### 3. Supporting Filter List Development
Filter maintainers can observe patterns in allowed and blocked domains, improving filter accuracy and verifying rule coverage.

### 4. Improving Privacy Awareness
Learn which third parties are part of your browsing footprint, distinguishing legitimate CDN domains from potentially invasive trackers.

## How uBO Scope Fits in Your Setup

- Works alongside any content blocker; does not replace blocking but complements it with detailed connection data.
- Compatible with major browsers (Chromium, Firefox, Safari), maintaining consistent behavior across platforms.
- Uses the browser’s `webRequest` API to capture network activity reliably.
- Provides domain-focused insights rather than raw request logs, keeping data actionable and concise.

---

## What to Expect When You First Use uBO Scope

- The toolbar icon badge will show a number representing how many distinct third-party domains your current tab connected to.
- Clicking the icon opens a popup showing breakdowns by categories:
  - **Not Blocked**: Connections allowed to remote servers.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections prevented by stealth techniques.
  - **Blocked**: Connections explicitly blocked.

- Lower badge counts are generally better for privacy.

---

## Practical Tips

- If you see many third-party domains on sites you trust, consider tightening your blocking or reviewing your filters.
- Stealth blocking entries indicate network requests prevented silently to avoid site breakage.
- Use uBO Scope data alongside your blocker’s logs for a complete picture.
