# Requirements & Supported Browsers

Ensure your setup meets the necessary prerequisites to guarantee a smooth, transparent experience with uBO Scope. This page clarifies compatible browsers, essential permissions, and highlights known constraints related to network request reporting.

---

## 1. Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope is designed to operate consistently across major modern browsers. For reliable operation, confirm that you use one of the supported browsers with the appropriate minimum versions:

- **Google Chrome (Chromium-based browsers)**: Version 122.0 or higher
- **Mozilla Firefox**: Version 128.0 or higher (including Firefox for Android)
- **Apple Safari**: Version 18.5 or higher

Using browsers older than these minimum versions may result in incomplete or no data being reported due to API limitations.

The extension uses browser native APIs to monitor network requests, which are supported differently depending on the browser and version.

---

## 2. Required Permissions

When you install uBO Scope, it requests specific permissions to function effectively. These include:

- **Access to all HTTP and WebSocket traffic:**
  - Permissions to read requests to URLs matching these patterns: `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` (availability of WebSocket monitoring varies by browser).
- **Active Tab Access:** To correlate network activity with the current browsing tab.
- **Storage Access:** To save session-related data locally in your browser.
- **webRequest API Permission:** Core to intercept and record network request outcomes, including allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked requests.

<u>Permissions by browser platform:</u>

| Browser  | Host Permissions                      | API Permissions               | Notes                                   |
|----------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Chromium | `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` | `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest` | Full WebSocket monitoring supported      |
| Firefox  | `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` | `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest` | Full WebSocket monitoring supported      |
| Safari   | `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`          | `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest` | WebSocket monitoring limited or unavailable |

## 3. Known Limitations in Network Request Reporting

Understanding the boundaries of what uBO Scope can report helps set realistic expectations and avoid confusion.

### 3.1 Coverage of Network Requests

- uBO Scope relies exclusively on the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor traffic.
- Network requests made outside the scope of `webRequest` (such as some internal browser requests or operating system processes) will not be reported.
- Some browsers impose restrictions on monitoring WebSocket connections. Safari, for example, does not support WebSocket monitoring fully, so uBO Scope cannot capture those requests there.

### 3.2 Network Request Outcomes

uBO Scope classifies network requests into three categories:

- **Allowed:** Requests that were successfully made and allowed by the browser and any active content blockers.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed or were explicitly blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests affected by stealth techniques such as redirects used by content blockers to hide blocking from detection.

### 3.3 Network Request Reporting Details

- The extension reports only distinct third-party **remote servers** contacted by your browser tabs, not every single request.
- The toolbar badge displays the count of distinct allowed third-party domains contacted.
- A lower badge count usually indicates fewer third-party connections, which typically represents higher privacy or stricter blocking.

---

## 4. Practical Tips for a Successful Setup

- Verify you are using one of the supported browser versions before installation.
- Review the permissions requested at install time to ensure you allow access to network traffic and active tab.
- Note the variance in WebSocket monitoring across browsers and adjust expectations accordingly.

<Tip>
If you experience missing or incomplete network data, first verify your browser version meets the minimum requirements and that the extension permissions include "webRequest" and full host access.
</Tip>

## 5. Summary Checklist

Before proceeding with installation or use, confirm the following:

- [ ] Browser: Chrome ≥ 122, Firefox ≥ 128, or Safari ≥ 18.5
- [ ] Permissions granted for `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`
- [ ] Host permissions enabled for HTTP and HTTPS traffic URLs
- [ ] Understand that WebSocket reporting might be limited depending on the browser

### Example: Viewing Required Permissions in Chrome Manifest
```json
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*", "wss://*/*", "ws://*/*"]
}
```

<Tip>
Keeping your browser updated ensures compatibility with uBO Scope’s network monitoring capabilities and access to the latest browser APIs.
</Tip>

<Note>
Network requests that do not pass through the browser's `webRequest` API, such as some WebRTC connections or browser internal communications, will not be detected by uBO Scope.
