### Option B: Manual Build and Side-Loading

If you prefer or require manual installation (for development, advanced control, or unsupported platforms), follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
   cd uBO-Scope
   ```

2. **Build the extension package for your platform:**

   Use the included build script specifying your platform (`chromium`, `firefox`, or `safari`). For example, for Chromium:

   ```bash
   ./tools/make-package.sh chromium
   ```

   - This will create a build folder like `build/uBO-Scope.chromium`.
   - Optionally, provide a version number as a second argument to update the manifest version.

3. **Load the unpacked extension into your browser:**

   - **Chromium Browsers:**
     - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
     - Enable **Developer mode**.
     - Click **Load unpacked** and select the build folder.

   - **Firefox:**
     - Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
     - Click **Load Temporary Add-on…** and select any file inside the build folder (e.g., `manifest.json`).

   - **Safari:**
     - Use [Safari Web Extensions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions) guide to load the extension.

<Tip>
Manual installation is ideal for testing pre-release versions or custom modifications but lacks automatic update features.
