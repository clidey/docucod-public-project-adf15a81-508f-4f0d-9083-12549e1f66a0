# Installing uBO Scope

Welcome to the installation guide for **uBO Scope**, the browser extension that reveals all third-party remote server connections your browser attempts. This document walks you through platform-specific installation steps for Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers, ensuring you can add uBO Scope seamlessly and verify it is running correctly after installation.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms & Prerequisites

Before installing uBO Scope, verify your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Supported Browsers:**
  - **Chromium-based browsers** (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.)
  - **Mozilla Firefox** (minimum version 128 or newer)
  - **Apple Safari** (minimum version 18.5 or newer)

- **Permissions:** During installation, the extension requests permissions to access active tabs, manage storage, and monitor network requests (`webRequest`). These permissions are essential for accurate connection monitoring.

- **Network Accessibility:** Ensure your browser allows access to the respective web extension stores and that your environment does not block extension installation.


## 2. Installation Instructions

### Chromium Browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)

1. Open the **Chrome Web Store** page for uBO Scope:

   [uBO Scope on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)

2. Click the **Add to Chrome** button.

3. Confirm the permissions prompt by clicking **Add Extension**.

4. Wait for the extension to download and install. The uBO Scope icon will appear in your browser toolbar.

### Mozilla Firefox

1. Go to the Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope:

   [uBO Scope on Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

2. Click **Add to Firefox**.

3. Review the permissions and click **Add**.

4. After installation, the uBO Scope icon will show up in your browser toolbar.

### Apple Safari

1. Open the **App Store** on your Mac.

2. Search for "uBO Scope" Safari extension.

3. Install the extension following standard Safari extension installation flow.

4. Enable the extension in Safari `Preferences > Extensions` if not already enabled.


## 3. Verifying Installation

After installing uBO Scope, follow these steps to confirm it is properly added and ready to use:

1. Look for the **uBO Scope icon** (stylized as the uBlock Origin Scope logo) in your browser's toolbar or extension bar.

2. Click the icon to open the popup UI. It should display a panel with the current tab's connection summary, initially showing "NO DATA" until network data is gathered.

3. Wait a few seconds while browsing any webpage. The extension collects and reports domains under these categories:
   - **not blocked** — connections successfully made
   - **stealth-blocked** — connection attempts detected and stealth-blocked
   - **blocked** — blocked connections

4. Confirm that the badge on the toolbar icon updates to show the count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the page.


## 4. Initial Post-Install Tips

- **Browse to a site with multiple remote resources**, such as a popular news site or social media platform, to see uBO Scope begin reporting detailed connection data.

- The extension's badge number represents the total **unique third-party domains successfully connected** for the current tab — lower numbers generally indicate fewer third-party contacts.

- Click the extension icon anytime to see a detailed popup breakdown of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections for the active tab.


## 5. Troubleshooting Installation Issues

If you encounter issues during installation or the extension does not behave as expected:

- Ensure your browser is updated to a supported version matching the minimum requirements.

- Verify that your browser allows installation of third-party extensions and that any enterprise policies or security software do not block extension installation.

- Reload the browser and try reinstalling the extension.

- Confirm the permissions prompt was accepted; without the requested permissions, uBO Scope cannot function.

- Consult the [Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues](../first-use-configuration/troubleshooting-common-issues) guide for more help.


## 6. Next Steps

Once uBO Scope is installed and verified:

- Proceed to the [Verifying First Run](../first-use-configuration/first-run-verification) page to confirm the extension tracks network connections accurately.

- Explore the [Understanding the UI](../first-use-configuration/understanding-the-ui) guide to interpret the popup's detailed connection reports.

- Review best practices from the [Quick Start: Common Use Cases](../../overview/feature_overview_usecases/quickstart_usecases) documentation to maximize uBO Scope's value.
