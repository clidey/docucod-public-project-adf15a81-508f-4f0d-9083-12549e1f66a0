# What is uBO Scope?

An accessible overview for newcomers: learn what uBO Scope is, the value it provides, and the scenarios it is best suited for. Understand how it helps track network connections and why its unique approach gives you more transparency over third-party resources.

## Introduction

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to reveal all network connections your browser attempts or completes to remote servers. Unlike many content blockers focused primarily on blocking ads or trackers, uBO Scope shines a spotlight on the *actual network activity* in real time, exposing every connection attempt regardless of content blockers or DNS filtering.

At its core, uBO Scope leverages the browser’s `webRequest` API to listen to and report network requests, categorizing them based on outcomes such as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked. This transparency helps users understand what resources their browser is retrieving, providing an unparalleled view of third-party connections.


## Why Use uBO Scope?

Every webpage you visit may connect to multiple third-party servers — from content delivery networks (CDNs) to analytics and advertising domains. Knowing exactly which distinct third-party domains your browser tries to connect to is critical for protecting your privacy and evaluating the impact of content blockers.

uBO Scope uniquely reports the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** contacted, displayed as a badge count on your browser’s toolbar icon. This count is a key privacy indicator: a lower number means fewer potentially invasive connections.

Unlike block counts used by some blockers, which can be misleading, the number of distinct third-party hosts connected is an objective, neutral metric that reflects your true network exposure.


## How uBO Scope Works

- **Network Request Listener:** uBO Scope uses browser APIs to monitor every network request made by webpages in the browser.
- **Outcome Categorization:** Each request is categorized by its final outcome — whether it was allowed, stealth-blocked (redirected or modified without user notification), or visibly blocked.
- **Badge Indicator:** The toolbar icon updates with a count representing the unique third-party domains successfully contacted on the active tab.
- **Detailed Popup Interface:** Clicking the toolbar icon opens a popup showing detailed per-domain statistics on allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.

This combination gives users a complete picture of their browsing connections without relying on inferred block counts or simplistic heuristics.


## Real-World Scenarios

### For Privacy-Conscious Users
Track and minimize exposure to third-party domains effectively. Monitor how many distinct outside servers your browsing activity touches, regardless of your content blocker.

### For Filter List Maintainers
Gain reliable, real-time data on third-party connections to help tune and validate filter lists across different devices and browsers.

### For Researchers and Technical Users
Use uBO Scope to audit network connections in detail, revealing stealth-blocking behaviors and exceptions that other tools might miss.


## Myths Debunked by uBO Scope

- **"Higher block counts mean better blocking."**

  Block counts often mislead. uBO Scope shows that a content blocker with a high block count may still load resources from *more* third-party servers overall, increasing exposure.

- **"Ad blocker test pages accurately assess blocking."**

  Many such tests use fabricated scenarios, which do not reflect real-world browsing. uBO Scope's live network monitoring offers a truthful window.


## Getting Started Preview

To experience uBO Scope’s value firsthand:

1. **Install the extension** available for Chromium and Firefox from official stores.
2. **Browse as usual** and watch the toolbar badge count update with the number of unique third-party servers.
3. **Open the popup interface** to view detailed domain-level connection analysis for the active tab.

This hands-on approach illuminates your browser’s network activity like never before.

## Summary

uBO Scope is your transparent partner in monitoring every network connection your browser makes. It informs privacy-conscious users, filter makers, and researchers by accurately counting distinct third-party remote servers, uncompromised by content blocker tricks or misleading block counts.
