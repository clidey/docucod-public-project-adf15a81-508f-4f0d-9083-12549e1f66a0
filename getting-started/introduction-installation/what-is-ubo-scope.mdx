description: "Provides a high-level overview of uBO Scope’s purpose: revealing all attempted or successful connections to remote servers for any webpage, regardless of which content blocker is active. Highlights key benefits for privacy-aware users and filter list maintainers, such as transparent third-party connection tracking and badge-based visual feedback."

# What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to transparently reveal all third-party remote server connections that websites attempt or successfully establish as you browse. Its core purpose is to provide clear, accurate insight into your browser's real network activity—regardless of which content blocker or DNS-based filtering is active—helping you understand the actual privacy impact of your browsing session.

## Why uBO Scope Matters

When browsing the web, your browser often connects to many third-party servers to load content, analytics, or ads. Content blockers typically show how many individual network requests were blocked, but this raw block count does not reflect the true privacy outcome. A high block count can actually coincide with more distinct third-party connections, implying less privacy protection.

uBO Scope focuses instead on the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** contacted, reporting these counts via a badge on the toolbar icon. A lower badge count is better, meaning fewer external domains were contacted during page loads.

Understanding this foundation helps debunk common myths:

- **Myth:** "A higher block count means a content blocker is better."

  **Reality:** Block counts don't directly measure privacy. You may have many blocked requests but still connect to many third-party domains.

- **Myth:** "Ad blocker test pages provide reliable measurements."

  **Reality:** These tests often use unnatural, fabricated network requests and don’t account for stealth blocking used by extensions.

uBO Scope’s data cuts through these misconceptions by tracking **real connections** at the network level using your browser’s `webRequest` API.

## How uBO Scope Works

- It listens to all network requests made by webpages for HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and Secure WebSocket protocols.
- Tracks requests' real outcomes: successfully allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Distills this information into a **domain-centric view**, counting distinct third-party remote servers involved.
- Displays a numeric badge on the toolbar icon reflecting the number of unique connected remote servers for the active tab.
- Provides a popup UI for real-time detailed insight into these domains categorized by outcome.

Importantly, uBO Scope works **independently** of any content blocker or DNS filtering your browser uses. It exposes the accurate third-party connection footprint regardless of which blockers or methods are active.

## Who Benefits Most from uBO Scope?

- **Privacy-Conscious Users** who want concrete evidence of what third-party connections their browser makes.
- **Filter List Maintainers** who need real-world network data unobtainable from block counts alone.
- **Content Blocker Researchers and Enthusiasts** aiming to validate or compare blocker effectiveness beyond block counts.

## Key Benefit Highlights

- Transparent, clear visibility into all third-party remote server connections attempted or succeeded for any webpage.
- Badge-based feedback that updates per active tab, instantly signaling exposure to third-party servers.
- Works with all content blockers and DNS filters as long as the browser reports network traffic via `webRequest`.
- Debunks misleading metrics from block counts or synthetic ad blocker test sites.
- Lightweight and privacy-respecting; it only measures, it does not block or interfere.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine visiting your favorite news website. Without uBO Scope, you might see a content blocker’s badge number counting blocks, but you can’t be sure how many unique third-party domains actually received requests.

With uBO Scope installed and active, the toolbar icon badge shows a count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted on that page. Opening the popup reveals which domains were loaded, stealth-blocked, or blocked — giving you precise insight into your privacy footprint.

This empowers you to adjust your blocker settings or browsing habits based on transparent data, not guesswork.

## Quick Glance: Toolbar Badge and Popup UI

- **Toolbar Badge:** Displays the count of distinct third-party domains contacted (lower is better).
- **Popup UI Sections:**
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains where requests succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were blocked but stealthily to avoid detection.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests were actively blocked.

## Important Notes

- The extension relies on browser support for the `webRequest` API.
- Connections outside this API’s scope cannot be tracked.
- Not every third-party domain is malicious; some are necessary content delivery networks (CDNs).
