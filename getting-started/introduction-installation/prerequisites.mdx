# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure your environment meets the necessary system and browser criteria. This guarantees a smooth installation experience and reliable operation of the extension across supported platforms.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to work with modern, popular web browsers that support the WebExtension API and provide access to the `webRequest` API, which uBO Scope relies on for network request monitoring.

- **Chromium-Based Browsers**
  - Official minimum version: **Chrome 122.0** or newer
  - Also compatible with Microsoft Edge, Brave, and other browsers built on Chromium 122+

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Official minimum version: **Firefox 128.0** or newer
  - Compatible with Firefox for desktop and Android where WebExtensions with `webRequest` are supported

- **Safari**
  - Minimum version: **Safari 18.5** or newer
  - Requires macOS or iOS versions that support Safari Web Extensions


> The extension’s manifest files for each platform specify these minimum supported versions and related capabilities.

---

## 2. Operating System and Environment

There are no special OS-level requirements beyond compatibility with the supported browsers listed above. uBO Scope runs as a browser extension, so it inherits the platform support of the host browser.

Ensure your device’s operating system supports the minimum browser versions:

- Windows, macOS, Linux for Chromium and Firefox
- macOS and iOS for Safari

---

## 3. Permissions & Access Requirements

To function correctly, uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions granted at installation:

- **ActiveTab**: Allows the extension to query the currently active tab to monitor its network requests.
- **Storage**: Enables saving and restoring session data and browsing context securely.
- **WebRequest**: Critical for tracking network requests and determining outcomes (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked).

These permissions are explicitly requested during the installation of the extension and are necessary for its core functionality.

> You do not need any additional user credentials or external access tokens; the extension operates fully within the browser sandbox.

---

## 4. Network and Connectivity Requirements

- uBO Scope listens to all HTTP and HTTPS network requests from the browser.
- No special firewall or proxy configuration is required; but network monitoring via browsers’ `webRequest` API can be affected by external network controls.

> Note: Network requests initiated outside the scope of the browser's `webRequest` API (e.g., via some native applications or certain browser internals) may not be tracked.

---

## 5. Prerequisites Summary Checklist

Before proceeding with installation, verify you have the following:

- A supported browser meeting or exceeding the minimum version:
  - Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+
- Sufficient user rights to install browser extensions
- Acceptance of requested permissions (`activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`)
- Basic internet connectivity

---

## Troubleshooting Compatibility

If you encounter issues during or after installation, consider the following:

- **Browser Version Check**: Verify your browser version matches or exceeds the stated minimums.
- **Permission Denied**: Ensure you have not denied any critical permissions during extension installation.
- **Conflicting Extensions**: Some security or privacy extensions might affect the availability of the `webRequest` API.

<Tip>
Always keep your browser updated to the latest stable version to ensure maximum compatibility and security.
</Tip>

## Next Steps

After confirming your system meets these prerequisites, proceed to the **Installing uBO Scope** guide to add the extension to your browser and start observing network connections transparently.
