## 2. Installing from Official Stores

Installing uBO Scope via official stores is the fastest and most straightforward approach.

### Chromium browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge)

1. Open the [uBO Scope page on the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
2. Click the **Add to Chrome** button.
3. Confirm the installation by clicking **Add extension** in the prompt.
4. The extension installs and appears as an icon in the browser’s toolbar.

### Mozilla Firefox

1. Open the [uBO Scope page on Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Review permissions, then click **Add**.
4. The extension installs and an icon appears in the toolbar.

### Safari

uBO Scope for Safari is available for Safari 18.5 and up. Installation typically involves Apple’s Safari Extensions Gallery or the Mac App Store:

1. Visit the Safari Extensions page or appropriate Apple platform.
2. Search for "uBO Scope".
3. Click **Install** or **Get**.
4. Follow on-screen prompts to enable the extension.

> <Note>
> Ensure your browser version meets the minimum required version before attempting installation to avoid compatibility issues.
> </Note>

## 3. Alternative Installation via Packaged Extension

Advanced users or those requiring offline or customized installation can use the packaged extension method. This requires a basic command-line setup:

### Prerequisites

- A Linux environment or any system with bash support
- Installed tools: `jq` (for JSON processing), basic shell utilities

### Step-by-step Installation

1. Open a terminal.
2. Clone or download the uBO Scope repository.
3. Run the packaging script with your platform argument:

```bash
./tools/make-package.sh chromium
```

Replace `chromium` with your target platform: `chromium`, `firefox`, or `safari`.

4. (Optional) Specify a version number as the second argument to set the extension version:

```bash
./tools/make-package.sh firefox 1.0.1
```

5. The script creates the packaged extension in `build/uBO-Scope.<platform>`.

### Verifying Packaging

- Check the `build/uBO-Scope.<platform>` directory for:
  - Extension files including manifest, scripts, HTML, and assets
  - Correct `manifest.json` relevant to the selected platform

## 4. Enabling and Verifying Installation

After installing uBO Scope via either method:

1. Locate the extension icon in your browser toolbar. The icon displays a badge with a count.
2. Visit a few websites and observe the badge updating in real-time, representing distinct third-party remote servers connected.
3. Click the extension icon to open the popup panel showing categorized domains:
   - **Not blocked**: Allowed connections
   - **Stealth-blocked**: Redirected or stealth-blocked connections
   - **Blocked**: Blocked connections

> <Tip>
> If the badge count remains empty or "NO DATA" appears on the popup, try refreshing the current tab or opening a new tab with a website.
> </Tip>

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **Extension not appearing after installation**: Restart the browser.
- **No badge updates or data shown**: Confirm that `webRequest` permission was granted during installation.
- **Using unsupported browser versions** can cause failure or unexpected behavior.
- **Privacy or security settings** might restrict extension permissions; verify these are enabled.

## Appendix: Packaging Script Details (Linux Environment)

For users interested in the underlying packaging process, the `make-package.sh` script automates copying relevant files and preparing the extension package.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This script assumes a linux environment

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "*** Error: need platform name"
    exit 1
fi

PLATFORM="$1"
DES=build/uBO-Scope."$PLATFORM"

echo "*** uBO-Scope: creating extension in $DES"

rm -rf "$DES"
mkdir -p "$DES"

echo "*** uBO-Scope: copying files"

cp -R assets                       "$DES"/
cp -R css                          "$DES"/
cp -R img                          "$DES"/
cp -R js                           "$DES"/
cp ./*.html                        "$DES"/
cp platform/"$PLATFORM"/manifest.json "$DES"/
cp LICENSE.txt                     "$DES"/
cp README.md                       "$DES"/

mkdir -p "$DES"/js/lib
cp node_modules/punycode/punycode.es6.js "$DES"/js/lib/

# Version provided as argument
if [ -n "$2" ]; then
    echo "*** uBO-Scope: setting version to $2 in manifest.json"
    tmp=$(mktemp)
    jq --arg a "$2" '.version = $a' "$DES/manifest.json" > "$tmp" && \
        mv "$tmp" "$DES/manifest.json"
fi
```

Use this script to generate and distribute offline copies of the extension tailored to your browser.
