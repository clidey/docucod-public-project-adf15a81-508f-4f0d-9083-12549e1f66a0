# Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to provide insightful visibility into all third-party remote server connections initiated by webpages you visit. To function correctly, uBO Scope relies on certain system capabilities and permissions which differ slightly depending on the target browser platform.

---

## 1. System and Browser Requirements

### Supported Browsers
- **Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave)
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Safari** (version 18.5 and above)


<u>**Minimum Browser Versions:**</u>
- Chromium: version 122.0 or higher
- Firefox: version 128.0 or higher
- Safari: version 18.5 or higher

### Operating Systems
uBO Scope operates within the supported browsers across standard platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and relevant mobile versions (where supported by the browser and extension infrastructure).

### Browser Features Needed
- Support for the **`webRequest` API**: This API is essential for uBO Scope to monitor network requests and report connection outcomes accurately. It allows the extension to observe and categorize remote server connections made by webpages.

<Tip>
Make sure your browser supports the `webRequest` API and that no restrictive settings or other extensions disable its usage, as this would impact uBO Scope’s ability to report meaningful data.
</Tip>

## 2. Required Extension Permissions

During installation, uBO Scope requests specific permissions needed to operate transparently and securely:

- **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to monitor the currently active browser tab.
- **`storage`**: Enables the extension to save session data and Public Suffix Lists locally to optimize performance.
- **`webRequest`**: Grants the capability to observe network traffic details and outcomes.
- **`host_permissions`**:
  - Access to all URLs under the following schemes:
    - HTTP: `http://*/*`
    - HTTPS: `https://*/*`
    - WebSocket: `ws://*/*`
    - Secure WebSocket: `wss://*/*`

These permissions allow uBO Scope to track network requests across all websites you visit.

<Warning>
These permissions are necessary to provide comprehensive visibility but are scoped in a privacy-respecting manner by focusing on network request metadata rather than content.
</Warning>

## 3. Important Notes on Installation and Usage

- The extension **does not** interfere with or block network requests itself; it acts purely as an observer and reporter of request outcomes.
- To leverage full functionality, ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled in the desired browser using official browser stores or installation sources.
- For browsers not meeting the minimum versions or lacking `webRequest` API support, functionality will be limited or unavailable.

## 4. Installation Flow Summary

1. Confirm your browser version meets the minimum requirements.
2. Verify that your browser supports the `webRequest` API.
3. Install uBO Scope from the official browser store or trusted sources.
4. Accept the requested permissions during installation.
5. After installation, follow guides to verify and explore the extension’s first run.

## 5. Troubleshooting Related to Platforms & Permissions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation and Platform Issues">
<Accordion title="Extension Not Listing Network Requests Correctly">
- Check if the browser version is recent and supports `webRequest`.
- Verify that no other extension or browser setting is disabling `webRequest` interception.
- Try restarting the browser after installation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Browser Does Not Support Minimum Permissions">
- Upgrade to the latest version of your browser.
- Some browsers may limit or change the behavior of `webRequest`, impacting real-time data.
- Consult browser-specific documentation for updating or enabling APIs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Denied or Installation Blocked">
- Ensure you are installing from a trusted browser store.
- Confirm you have the necessary user permissions to install extensions.
- Some corporate or managed browsers may block extensions or specific APIs.
