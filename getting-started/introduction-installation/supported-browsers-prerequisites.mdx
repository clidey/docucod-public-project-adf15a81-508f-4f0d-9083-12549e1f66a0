# Supported Browsers & Prerequisites

Ensure your environment is compatible with uBO Scope before installation. This page details browser support, minimum version requirements, permissions needed, and key prerequisites to help you prepare for a smooth setup.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed to work on major browsers supporting Manifest V3 extensions and providing the `webRequest` API necessary for network monitoring.

| Browser    | Minimum Version  | Notes                                                  |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium   | 122.0           | Requires Chrome 122 or later (based on `minimum_chrome_version` in manifest) |
| Firefox    | 128.0           | Firefox 128 or newer; strict minimum version enforced in manifest | 
| Safari     | 18.5            | Safari 18.5 or newer; uses browser-specific `webRequest` implementation |

---

## 2. System and Environment Requirements

- **Operating System**: Compatible with any OS supported by the above browsers (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android where browser support exists).
- **Browser Type**: Must be a Chromium-based browser (Google Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.), Firefox, or Safari with Manifest V3 extension support.
- **Storage Capability**: The browser must support extension storage APIs (`storage.local` and `storage.session`) for data persistence.

---

## 3. Permissions Required by uBO Scope

The extension requests the following permissions to function transparently and securely:

- **`webRequest`**: To listen to all network requests and determine their outcomes (allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked).
- **`activeTab`**: To interact with the currently active tab, enabling collecting request data scoped to that tab.
- **`storage`**: To save session data and user preferences locally.
- **Host Permissions**:
  - HTTP and HTTPS URLs: `http://*/*`, `https://*/*` to monitor network traffic on web pages.
  - WebSocket URLs: `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` (Chromium and Firefox only; Safari does not include WebSocket host permissions).

<Callout>
  <Note>
    Permissions are minimal and scoped only to what is required for full visibility of network connections.
  </Note>
</Callout>

## 4. Browser-Specific Considerations

<u>**Chromium**</u>
- Extension uses a service worker as a background process (`background.service_worker`).
- Requires Chrome 122+ because of Manifest V3 and new webRequest API behavior.

<u>**Firefox**</u>
- The background runs as a module script (`background.scripts` with type "module").
- Enforces minimum version 128 via `browser_specific_settings.gecko.strict_min_version`.

<u>**Safari**</u>
- Uses background scripts with type module.
- Minimum Safari version 18.5 specified.
- WebSocket host permissions not declared (Safari may have different support).

## 5. Prepare Your Browser Environment

Follow these preliminary checks before installing uBO Scope:

1. **Update your browser** to at least the required minimum version listed above.
2. **Verify extension support**:
   - Confirm your browser supports Manifest V3 extensions.
3. **Verify webRequest API availability**:
   - This API is essential for uBO Scope to intercept and report network requests.
   - Some browsers or privacy configurations may limit API coverage.
4. **Check for conflicting extensions**:
   - Content blockers or privacy extensions that interfere with the webRequest API or block subresources prematurely may affect uBO Scope's accuracy.

<Tip>
Testing uBO Scope alongside your existing content blockers helps you understand its insights better and troubleshoot potential conflicts.

## 6. Permissions Consent and Privacy

Upon installation, the browser will prompt you to approve the requested permissions. These prompt details the extensionâ€™s need to monitor network requests and access active tab information, ensuring transparency.

<u>Security Best Practices:</u>
- uBO Scope requests no more permissions than necessary.
- It does not transmit your connection data externally; all processing is local.
- Review permissions on the extension page in your browser at any time.

---

## 7. Summary: What to Check Before Installation

- Confirm you are using Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+.
- Ensure your browser supports Manifest V3 extensions and the required APIs.
- Verify your browser will allow the extension to request the needed permissions.
- Check network and WebSocket host permissions cover the URLs you browse (typically universal).
- For Safari users, note that WebSocket monitoring may be limited due to host permission scope.

---

## Troubleshooting Prerequisites

If uBO Scope does not work as expected, consider:

- **Browser version too old**: Upgrade to a supported version.
- **Restricted permissions**: Verify you granted all requested permissions during installation.
- **Browser limitations**: Some browser builds or privacy modes might limit `webRequest` API availability.
- **Conflicting extensions**: Disable other extensions that may interfere.
