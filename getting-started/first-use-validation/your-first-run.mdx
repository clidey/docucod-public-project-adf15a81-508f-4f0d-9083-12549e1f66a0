# Your First Run

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with uBO Scope. This guide helps you open the extension on a live webpage, interpret the popup’s detailed connection summary, and verify that the toolbar badge accurately reflects current third-party connections. By following these steps, you will gain practical insight into how uBO Scope reveals network connection activity to third-party servers, ensuring you achieve a definitive success outcome with your initial use.

---

## 1. Open uBO Scope on an Active Tab

Before viewing network connections, ensure you are on a website you want to analyze (such as your favorite news site, social media platform, or any web page with network activity).

### Steps:

1. **Navigate to any active webpage** in your browser where you want to explore third-party connections.
2. Click the **uBO Scope toolbar icon** located near your browser’s address bar.
   - Depending on your browser and extension setup, this is the uBO Scope icon you installed.
   - If you don’t see it, make sure the extension is enabled and pinned to the toolbar.
3. The **popup interface** will open, instantly showing a snapshot of network connections related to the current page.

<Tip>
Pin the extension icon for easy access, so you can quickly open uBO Scope whenever you browse.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Connection Summary

The popup presents a real-time summary of the third-party domains your current webpage connects to, grouped by connection outcome. It helps you understand the flow of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.

### What You See:

- **Hostname Display:** Shows the hostname of the current active tab, divided into subdomain and domain sections to help identify the page clearly.
- **Summary Count:** Number indicating how many distinct third-party domains the page connected to.
- **Connection Outcome Sections:** Three clearly labeled areas with domains and request counts:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains with allowed connections.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains detected but stealthily blocked (often redirects).
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were fully blocked.

### How to Interpret:

- Each domain listed shows the frequency of network requests made during your active session on that tab.
- More domains under **Not Blocked** means more third-parties loaded resources.
- Domains under **Blocked** or **Stealth-Blocked** indicate content blocking activity by uBO Scope or other blockers.

<Info>
The domain and hostname names are presented in Unicode (readable) format even if originally punycode-encoded.
</Info>

## 3. Verify Badge Count Reflects Real-Time Activity

The toolbar badge count on the uBO Scope icon reports the total number of *distinct* third-party domains that the page has connected to or attempted to connect to.

### Steps:

1. Observe the badge number on the uBO Scope extension icon.
2. Compare this badge number against the **domains connected** count displayed in the popup summary.
3. Confirm that these two numbers match, indicating accurate real-time tracking.

<Check>
A blank badge or zero indicates no third-party connections have been detected yet, which can happen on freshly loaded, simple pages.
</Check>

<Tip>
Count discrepancies between the popup and badge text could be temporary if the page is actively loading or refreshing network calls.
</Tip>

---

## 4. What Success Looks Like

After opening the popup and verifying badge sync:

- The popup shows your current tab’s domain at the top.
- The summary count matches the badge number on the toolbar icon.
- You see domains categorized appropriately under **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** sections.
- Each domain shows request counts representing activity on your current browsing session.

This means uBO Scope is actively monitoring and reporting third-party connections on your current page.

<Check>
Success confirming uBO Scope works:
- Popup data populates quickly after opening.
- Toolbar badge updates as you navigate or refresh the page.
- Clear distinction between allowed and blocked connections.
</Check>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common First-Use Issues

If the popup does not display data or the badge does not update:

- **Ensure permissions are granted:** uBO Scope requires permissions for `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`.
- **Reload the web page:** Some network requests are tracked only after page load.
- **Check browser compatibility and version:** Minimum browser versions are required (see prerequisites).
- **Verify extension installation status:** Confirm uBO Scope is enabled.

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Tips for Your First Run">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Empty">
- Reload the page.
- Ensure you have an active tab with network activity.
- Check that the extension is not disabled or blocked.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Toolbar Badge Doesn’t Appear or Update">
- Confirm the extension icon is pinned.
- Refresh the active webpage.
- Check extension permissions in browser settings.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Refer to the 'Troubleshooting Installation & Setup' guide for more detailed fixes if issues persist.
