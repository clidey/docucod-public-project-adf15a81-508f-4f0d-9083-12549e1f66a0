# Quick Validation Checklist

Ensure your installation of uBO Scope is working properly with this concise checklist. This guide helps you verify proper toolbar icon visibility, badge counts, and popup responsiveness before deeper exploration.

---

## 1. Verify Toolbar Icon Visibility

The uBO Scope icon should be visible in your browser's toolbar.

- **Action:** Look for the uBO Scope icon (a shield-like logo).
- **Expected Result:** The icon is displayed without any error or indicator showing it is disabled.

<Check>
If the icon is missing:
- Confirm the extension was installed correctly.
- Check your browser’s extension management page to ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
- On Chrome or Firefox, pin the extension icon to the toolbar if it's hidden.
</Check>

---

## 2. Confirm Permissions and Host Access

uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor network requests effectively.

- **Action:** Review extension permissions.
  - It should have permissions for `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
  - Confirm host permissions cover HTTP, HTTPS (and on Firefox, WS and WSS) for all sites (`*//*`).

- **Expected Result:** No browser prompts are asking to grant these permissions.

<Note>
If a permission prompt was missed or denied, revisit the browser’s extension settings to manage permissions and reload the extension.
</Note>

## 3. Load a Real Website

You need network traffic to be monitored for validation.

- **Action:** Visit a well-known website (e.g., https://www.wikipedia.org) in an active tab.
- **Expected Result:** Network requests generated by the page will be processed by uBO Scope.

---

## 4. Check Badge Count on Toolbar Icon

The badge on the toolbar icon indicates the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected.

- **Action:** Observe the numeric badge on the uBO Scope icon.
- **Expected Result:** 
  - You should see a positive integer reflecting distinct third-party domains.
  - The number is generally low to moderate on normal websites.
  - The badge should update dynamically as you navigate.

<Warning>
A blank or missing badge may indicate no detected connections or failure to monitor requests properly.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Open and Inspect the Popup Panel

The popup panel provides detailed domain connection statistics.

- **Action:** Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
- **Expected Result:** 
  - The popup loads promptly without errors.
  - It displays the website hostname and a summary of connected domains.
  - Domains are categorized under "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked" sections with domain counts.

<Check>
If the popup is empty or stuck on 'NO DATA':
- Refresh the page and try again.
- Ensure you are on a page with active network requests.
- Verify that the extension is not blocked by browser settings or other extensions.
</Check>

---

## 6. Validate Real-Time Updates

uBO Scope processes network events asynchronously.

- **Action:** Navigate to another website or reload the current page.
- **Expected Result:** The badge count and popup panel update to reflect the new site's network connections.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Toolbar icon invisible:** Enable the extension and check browser extension management.
- **Zero or no badge count:** Try a website with expected third-party content; ensure correct permissions.
- **Popup displays NO DATA:** Confirm active site traffic and reload the popup.
- **Badge count stuck:** Restart your browser or reload the extension.

---
