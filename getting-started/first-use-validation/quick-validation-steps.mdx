# Quick Validation Steps

Welcome to the quick validation guide for **uBO Scope**. After installing and initially configuring the extension, this guide provides a straightforward checklist to confirm the extension is functioning as intended and actively monitoring your browser's third-party network connections.

---

## 1. Open a New Website

To begin validating uBO Scope's operation:

- Open your preferred web browser where uBO Scope is installed.
- Navigate to any frequently visited website that typically loads content from multiple domains (e.g., news, shopping, or social media sites).

> Opening a complex webpage ensures uBO Scope can detect a variety of remote connections, providing a rich test scenario.

## 2. Observe the Browser Toolbar Badge

Locate the **uBO Scope** icon in your browser's toolbar. The badge overlay on this icon provides a real-time count of distinct third-party domains contacted by the page:

- Check that the badge is visible; it should display a number representing how many unique remote hosts were contacted.
- If the badge is empty or missing, uBO Scope may not be active or correctly monitoring your tab.

> The badge is your first quick indicator that the extension is alive and tracking network connections per tab.

## 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface

Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar to open the popup interface, which categorizes network connection outcomes:

- **Domains connected**: This summary shows how many different domains the opened webpage has communicated with.
- Connection status sections are divided into:
  - *Not Blocked*: Domains with allowed connections.
  - *Stealth-blocked*: Domains whose connections were silently redirected.
  - *Blocked*: Domains whose connections failed or were actively blocked.

> Review these sections to see real-time results from your current browsing session.

## 4. Confirm Network Request Monitoring

To ensure uBO Scope is actively reporting:

- Refresh the webpage.
- Observe the badge's count updating dynamically.
- Reopen the popup and verify that the domain counts and categories reflect the refreshed activity.

> This behavior confirms that uBO Scope captures ongoing network requests and updates its reporting accordingly.

## 5. Validate Across Multiple Tabs

For comprehensive verification:

- Open several tabs with different websites.
- Switch between tabs and observe each tab's badge count updating independently.
- Open the popup in each tab to confirm tab-specific network monitoring.

> uBO Scope tracks network activity per tab, helping you differentiate behavior across distinct browsing sessions.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Use Sites with Diverse Third-Party Resources**: Websites loading ads, trackers, or content from numerous sources provide a fuller test.
- **Avoid Private Mode Initially**: Some browsers restrict extension functionality in incognito/private windows by default.
- **Keep uBO Scope Updated**: Ensure you have the latest version for best stability and accuracy.

## Common Pitfalls

- **No Badge Display**: This often indicates the extension is not properly installed or enabled for the current site.
- **Static Badge Count**: If the badge does not update after navigation or refresh, try restarting the browser.
- **Popup Showing 'NO DATA'**: This usually means no network activity has been observed yet for the tab.

## Troubleshooting Quick Checks

- Verify uBO Scope is enabled in your browser’s extension manager.
- Confirm requested permissions (*activeTab*, *storage*, *webRequest*) are granted.
- Ensure your browser version meets the minimum requirements (e.g., Chrome ≥ 122, Firefox ≥ 128).
