# Quick Validation Steps for uBO Scope

This guide walks you through simple, straightforward test cases to verify that uBO Scope is correctly monitoring network connections as intended. By completing these steps, you'll confirm that uBO Scope tracks remote server connections, updates its toolbar badge properly, and displays accurate details in the popup interface.

---

## 1. Visit Test Pages to Generate Network Activity

Start by browsing to websites that trigger various network requests, including successful connections, blocked requests, and redirects. This activates uBO Scope's monitoring and provides data for validation.

### Steps:

- Open your web browser where uBO Scope is installed and active.
- Navigate to a reliable, content-rich webpage such as your favorite news site or popular web service.
- Alternatively, visit any page known to load multiple external resources (scripts, images, trackers).

### What to expect:

- The toolbar badge icon of uBO Scope updates to reflect the count of distinct third-party remote domains connected to.
- You may see a non-zero number indicating active third-party connections.

<Tip>
Browsing popular websites that load multiple external resources ensures uBO Scope captures meaningful network events for test validation.
</Tip>

## 2. Observe Toolbar Badge Behavior

The badge number on uBO Scope’s icon represents the number of unique third-party domains with allowed connections.

### Steps:

- While on the test page, look at the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser's toolbar.
- Note the displayed badge number.
- Refresh the page and observe whether the badge updates accordingly.

### What to expect:

- The badge’s number increases if new third-party domains are contacted.
- If no third-party connections occur or all are blocked, the badge will be empty.

<Note>
A lower badge count generally indicates fewer external server connections, which is good for privacy.
</Note>

## 3. Verify Popup Details Align with Badge

The popup UI provides detailed breakdowns of connections categorized by outcome: not blocked, stealth-blocked, and blocked.

### Steps:

- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
- Examine the hostname displayed at the top, which reflects the current active tab's domain.
- Review the three categories:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains with allowed successful connections.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains blocked subtly during redirects.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where requests were explicitly blocked.
- Confirm the count summary matches the badge number.

### What to expect:

- You should see a meaningful hostname at the top, not "NO DATA".
- Each category lists domains (in Unicode if applicable) with the number of respective occurrences.
- The total domain count matches the badge counter displayed on the toolbar.

<Warning>
If you see "NO DATA" or empty categories consistently, it could indicate uBO Scope is not active for the tab or network request data is not yet processed.
</Warning>

## 4. Perform Specific Network Event Testing

To confirm different connection outcomes are tracked, test scenarios that produce redirects, errors, and successful connections.

### Steps:

- Open developer tools in your browser (typically via F12 or right-click > Inspect).
- Navigate to a test page triggering a redirect (e.g., some URL shorteners or meta refresh-based pages).
- Observe the uBO Scope badge and popup after page redirect completes.
- Visit a non-existent resource URL on a trusted domain to force an error event.
- Confirm that the blocked category reflects these failed or denied connections.

### What to expect:

- Redirect-related domains should appear under the stealth-blocked category in the popup.
- Error events should list under the blocked category.
- Successful main resources should register in the allowed category.

<Tip>
If unsure which pages will produce redirects or errors, test with URLs known to redirect or deliberately mistyped domains.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Quick Checks

If validation steps do not show expected results, consider the following quick troubleshooting tips:

- Ensure uBO Scope has granted permissions for `webRequest` and host access.
- Confirm the extension icon is present and enabled in your browser.
- Refresh test pages after installing or updating the extension.
- Open the popup only after the page fully loads to allow processing.
- Check browser version compatibility (refer to prerequisites documentation).
