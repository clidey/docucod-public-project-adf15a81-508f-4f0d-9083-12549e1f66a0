# First Run: What to Expect

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through your initial experience right after installing the extension. You'll learn how to open the main popup interface, interpret the badge count on the toolbar icon, and understand the classification of detected remote connections. These insights set clear expectations so you can confidently start monitoring the network activity of your browsing sessions.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

Once installed, uBO Scope adds its icon to your browser's toolbar.

### How to Access:

- Click the **uBO Scope icon** on your browser's toolbar.
- This action opens the popup interface, which presents real-time connection data for the current active tab.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the icon immediately, check your browser's extension menu or pin the extension to the toolbar following your browser-specific instructions.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Understanding the Badge Count

The extension uses a badge on the toolbar icon to provide at-a-glance information.

### What the Number Means:

- The badge displays the **number of distinct third-party remote server domains for which there was at least one successful connection** in the active tab.
- A **lower badge count** typically indicates fewer remote connections, which is often desirable if you want less third-party tracking or loading.
- If the badge is **empty (no number)**, it means no third-party remote connections were detected for the current tab.

<Info>
Remember, not all third-party domains are malicious or to avoid — many are legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs) or essential services.
</Info>

### Typical Scenarios

- **New Tab or Blank Page:** Badge will generally be empty as no connections occur.
- **Regular Website with Minimal Third-Parties:** Badge shows a low number.
- **Content-Rich Sites or Social Media:** Badge may show a higher count reflecting multiple third-party services.

## 3. Viewing Detected Remote Connections in the Popup

After clicking the uBO Scope icon to open the popup, you'll see categorized lists and a summary count.

### Key Sections of the Popup Interface:

- **Domain Hostname:** The main top-level hostname of the active tab is displayed prominently.
- **Summary Count:** Displays the total number of distinct third-party remote server domains connected (not blocked).
- **Connection Categories:**
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which connections were successfully allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were silently redirected or stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly blocked (errors or failures).

Each category shows domains along with the count of requests made.

<AccordionGroup title="Popup Sections Explained">
<Accordion title="Domain Hostname">
Shows the current tab’s main hostname — useful to confirm you're looking at the right tab’s data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Summary Count">
Total number of distinct allowed third-party domains connected — reflected also on the toolbar badge.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Not Blocked">
Lists third-party domains successfully contacted by the page’s content.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth-Blocked">
Shows third-party domains where attempts to connect were redirected or hidden from the page.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Blocked">
Shows third-party domains for which connections failed or were explicitly blocked.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### How to Interpret These:

- If your badge count seems unexpectedly high, opening the popup helps you identify exactly which third-party domains are involved.
- You can use this insight to better understand your web exposure and troubleshoot unexpected connections.

## 4. What Happens During the First Browsing Sessions

### Initial Data Gathering

- uBO Scope starts monitoring and categorizing connections as soon as you load or interact with a webpage.
- Badge counts and popup details update dynamically per tab to reflect the latest network activity.

### Expectations:

- There may be a slight delay (a few seconds) on page load for the counts to appear and the popup to fill with data.
- The extension tracks only network requests that go through the browser’s `webRequest` API, so some internal browser connections may not appear.

<Tip>
On the first use, some tabs may show 'NO DATA' if no detectable network activity has occurred yet.
</Tip>

## 5. Common First-Run Scenarios and User Tips

| Scenario                       | What to Expect                                   | Suggested Action                      |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| New Tab or Empty Page          | Badge is empty; popup shows "NO DATA"         | Try loading a webpage with remote content |
| Popular Website with CDNs      | Badge shows small-digit count; multiple domains appear under "Not Blocked" | Open popup to inspect connected domains   |
| Sites with Tracking Elements   | Badge count higher; multiple domains in all categories | Review stealth and blocked domains for additional insights |

### Best Practices for First Run

- **Start with trusted websites** to familiarize yourself with the type and count of connections.
- **Open the popup frequently** to learn how domains are categorized.
- **Understand the badge count reflects distinct domains, not individual requests.**

## 6. Troubleshooting Common First-Run Issues

### Issue: Badge Count Never Appears or Popup Shows No Data

- Ensure the extension is enabled and has the necessary permissions.
- Reload your active tab and then open the popup again.
- Confirm you are viewing a tab with network activity (some pages like `about:blank` have none).
- If problems persist, try restarting your browser.

### Issue: Badge Count Seems Too High or Suspicious

- Open the popup to view the domains and investigate suspicious third parties.
- Consider additional privacy tools or content blockers if you find unwanted connections.

<Tip>
Remember, uBO Scope **does not block connections itself**; it only reports on observed network activity.
</Tip>

## Summary

Your first run with uBO Scope reveals the number and nature of third-party remote server connections made by the current tab. The badge count on the toolbar icon gives immediate insight, while opening the popup lets you inspect detailed domain classifications by connection outcome. This guide prepares you to interpret this data meaningfully and sets expectations for typical scenarios encountered during initial browsing.
