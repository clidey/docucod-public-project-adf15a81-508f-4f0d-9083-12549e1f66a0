# Validating Measurements & Badge Counts

Understanding the badge count on the uBO Scope toolbar icon and interpreting the popup panel results are crucial to ensure the extension accurately reports third-party remote server connections. This guide walks you through quick sanity checks and detailed interpretation methods to verify the reliability of uBO Scope's measurements.

---

## 1. Understanding the Badge Count

The toolbar badge shows the **number of distinct third-party domains** to which the current tab has made successful network connections that were **not blocked**.

- **Distinct means unique domains:** Even if multiple requests occur to the same domain, they count only once.
- **Third-party means different from the main site domain:** The main site itself is excluded from this count.
- **Only successful connections count:** Domains from which resources were blocked or stealth-blocked do not increase the badge.

### Why the Badge Count Matters

This count provides a high-level privacy exposure metric. A lower number generally means fewer external domains were contacted, which usually implies better privacy.

> The badge count does *not* indicate blocked requests or total requests â€” it strictly reports distinct allowed third-party domains.

## 2. Inspecting the Popup Panel Results

Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel showing three categorized domain lists:

- **Not blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which network requests succeeded.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains involved in redirects or filtered silently.
- **Blocked:** Domains from which requests were blocked or failed.

Each domain is accompanied by a count representing how many times it appeared during the current tab session.

### Interpreting the Lists

- Allowed domains represent third parties that successfully connected.
- Stealth-blocked domains may reflect subtle filters or redirects.
- Blocked domains account for connections the content blocker or browser denied.

The total distinct domains connected (badge count) equals the number of entries in the Allowed list.

## 3. Quick Sanity Checks for Validation

Follow these practical steps after browsing to a website to validate uBO Scope's measurement accuracy.

<Steps>
<Step title="Check the Badge Count Visibility">
1. Visit a popular website with expected third-party content (e.g., https://example.com).
2. Look at the uBO Scope icon badge in your browser's toolbar.
3. Confirm the badge shows a numeric count, not empty or a nonsensical value.
4. If empty, reload the page and wait a few seconds for updates.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel and Review Domains">
1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
2. Observe the counts in three sections: `not blocked`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked`.
3. Verify that numerous third-party domains appear under these categories.
4. The `domains connected` summary count at the top matches the number of domains listed under `not blocked`.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Correct Domain Attribution">
1. Observe the top header showing the main tab's hostname and domain.
2. Domains in the popup should be different from the main site's domain.
3. Ensure no unexpected or suspicious domains dominate unless typical for that website.
</Step>
<Step title="Test with Known Content Blocking Behavior">
1. Disable or enable content blockers (if any) and reload the page.
2. Notice changes in block and stealth-block sections.
3. The badge count should correspondingly adjust.
4. If no changes appear, verify uBO Scope extension permissions and browser compatibility.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating or Missing">
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled in your browser extension settings.
- Confirm the current browser tab domain is supported and active.
- Reload the page to trigger measurement updates.
- If persistent, revisit installation instructions or troubleshooting guides.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Panel Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Sections">
- This can occur if the page has not triggered network requests.
- Navigate to a different website with more complex third-party content.
- Check browser permissions to confirm uBO Scope can intercept web requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Discrepancies Between Expected and Reported Domains">
- Some domains may not be recorded due to network request types outside browser API reach.
- Some resources may be loaded natively by the browser or other software.
- Validate against expected behavior as per real-world browsing scenarios.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpectedly High Badge Count">
- Some websites use multiple CDN or 3rd-party analytic/tracking services.
- This is expected; however, if suspicious domains appear, investigate further.
- Use related documentation to understand stealth-blocked and blocked domains.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Best Practices for Accurate Validation

- **Validate on popular, content-rich websites** with multiple third-party networks.
- **Compare results before and after enabling/disabling other blockers** to see effect.
- **Refresh the page fully** and wait at least 5 seconds for the extension to process all network events.
- **Check for browser updates** as older versions may affect webRequest API behavior.
- **Regularly consult the uBO Scope popup** for instantly updated connection summaries.

## 6. When to Seek Additional Help

If validation steps fail or you encounter inconsistent information:

- Review the [Troubleshooting Installation & First Use](../getting-started/first-use-validation/troubleshooting-setup) guide.
- Verify your browser and system meet [System Requirements](../getting-started/installation-setup/system-requirements).
- Reference [Understanding the Popup Panel](../../guides/interpreting-results/understanding-popup) for deep result interpretation.
- Ensure no conflicting privacy extensions interfere with uBO Scope.
