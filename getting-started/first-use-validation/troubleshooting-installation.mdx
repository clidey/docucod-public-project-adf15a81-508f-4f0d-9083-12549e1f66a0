# Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve common obstacles encountered during the installation and initial use of uBO Scope. Whether the extension does not appear after installation, the popup does not show expected connection data, or permissions seem insufficient, this page offers clear, actionable steps to get you back on track.

---

## 1. Extension Does Not Appear After Installation

If you have installed uBO Scope but do not see its icon on your browser toolbar:

### Step 1: Confirm Installation
- Open your browser's extensions or add-ons page:
  - **Chrome/Chromium:** `chrome://extensions/`
  - **Firefox:** `about:addons`
  - **Safari:** Safari Preferences → Extensions
- Verify that "uBlock Origin Scope" is listed and enabled.

### Step 2: Pin or Enable the Toolbar Icon
- Some browsers hide newly installed extensions by default.
- Pin the uBO Scope icon to your browser's toolbar:
  - Chrome: Click the puzzle icon and click the pin next to uBO Scope.
  - Firefox: Click the extensions button and drag uBO Scope to the toolbar.

### Step 3: Restart Your Browser
- Restart the browser to ensure extension activation.

<Note>
If uBO Scope is not listed in your extensions page, the installation may have been incomplete or blocked by browser policies.
</Note>

## 2. Permissions Not Granted or Working

uBO Scope requires permissions to observe network requests and show data correctly.

### Step 1: Check Permissions
- Verify that the extension has requested and been granted these permissions:
  - `activeTab`
  - `storage`
  - `webRequest`
  - Host permissions for URLs such as `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, and `ws://*/*` (browser-dependent)

### Step 2: Grant Permissions Manually if Prompted
- Some browsers may prompt for permission upon first use.
- Accept all permission prompts for uBO Scope.

### Step 3: Browser Version Compatibility
- Confirm your browser's version meets uBO Scope's minimum version:
  - Chrome/Chromium: version 122.0 or higher
  - Firefox: version 128.0 or higher
  - Safari: version 18.5 or higher

<Warning>
Older browser versions often have incomplete or incompatible WebRequest APIs, which will prevent uBO Scope from functioning.
</Warning>

## 3. Popup Does Not Display Expected Data

If clicking on uBO Scope's icon shows "NO DATA" or unexpected results, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Confirm You Are on an Active Webpage
- uBO Scope reports only on active tabs displaying websites using network requests.
- Open a commonly used website that makes several remote connections (e.g., a news site).

### Step 2: Reload the Webpage
- Reload or navigate on the tab to trigger new network requests for uBO Scope to record.

### Step 3: Wait for Data Processing
- Data processing occurs asynchronously; wait a few seconds for the popup panel to update.

### Step 4: Check for Extension Conflicts
- Some content blockers or privacy extensions may interfere with network request reporting.
- Temporarily disable other extensions to see if data appears correctly.

### Step 5: Inspect Console for Errors
- Open the browser’s developer console on the popup window (right-click on uBO Scope popup → Inspect).
- Look for error messages that might indicate loading or communication issues.

## 4. Troubleshooting Tips & Best Practices

- **Clear Extension Cache:** Remove and reinstall uBO Scope if persistent issues occur.
- **Check Browser Logs:** Inspect your browser's extension logs for runtime errors.
- **Validate Network Activity:** Confirm that the browser exposes network requests to extensions via the WebRequest API.
- **Keep Browser Updated:** Ensure your browser is always up to date for optimal extension support.

<Info>
Remember, a low or zero badge count often means fewer third-party connections, which can be a positive privacy signal.
