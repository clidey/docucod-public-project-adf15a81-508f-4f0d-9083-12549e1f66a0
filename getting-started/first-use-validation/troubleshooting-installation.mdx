# Troubleshooting Installation & Setup

This guide addresses the most common issues users encounter during the installation or initial activation of uBO Scope. If you experience problems such as the extension popup missing, no connection data appearing, or the toolbar badge not updating, follow the troubleshooting steps below to resolve these issues quickly.

---

## 1. Extension Popup is Missing or Not Opening

The uBO Scope extension’s popup should appear when you click the toolbar icon. If this does not happen:

### Steps to Fix

1. **Verify Installation**: Confirm uBO Scope is installed properly by checking your browser's extension page:
   - **Chrome**: `chrome://extensions/`
   - **Firefox**: `about:addons`
   - **Safari**: Safari > Preferences > Extensions

2. **Pin the Extension Icon**: The extension icon may be hidden if not pinned.
   - Open the extensions menu in your browser toolbar.
   - Pin uBO Scope to the toolbar for easy access.

3. **Ensure Correct Permissions**:
   - uBO Scope requires `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` permissions to function correctly.
   - If permissions were denied at install time or later revoked, the popup will not function.
   - Go to the extension details page and ensure all required permissions are granted.

4. **Reload or Reinstall**:
   - Try disabling and re-enabling the extension.
   - If the popup still doesn’t show, remove and reinstall the extension.

5. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Verify your browser version meets the minimum requirements (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
   - Some older browser versions may not support Manifest V3 extensions properly.

<Note>
If you installed the extension manually or via developer mode, ensure the installation process was completed without errors.
</Note>

## 2. No Connection Data Appears in the Popup

When opening the popup, if it shows “NO DATA” or the domain list sections are empty, this means uBO Scope is not capturing network activity.

### Steps to Fix

1. **Browse a Webpage First**:
   - uBO Scope gathers data per tab for active browsing sessions.
   - Open a new page or refresh an existing tab before opening the popup.

2. **Check Browser Permissions**:
   - The extension depends on the `webRequest` API to monitor network connections.
   - Some browsers or configurations may restrict this API, blocking data collection.
   - Enable permissions explicitly in the extension settings.

3. **Verify Host Permissions**:
   - uBO Scope requires access to all URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, and `wss://*/*`) as declared in the manifest.
   - If your browser restricts or limits extension host access, adjust settings to allow this.

4. **Disable Conflicting Extensions Temporarily**:
   - Other extensions with network monitoring or strict privacy controls might interfere.
   - Temporarily disable other content blockers or privacy tools to test.

5. **Test on Known Websites**:
   - Use popular sites with known third-party connections (e.g., news sites, social media) to trigger network traffic.

<Warning>
No data will appear if browsing occurs in private/incognito mode without allowing the extension to run in that mode.
</Warning>

## 3. Toolbar Badge Does Not Update

The badge on the toolbar icon shows the count of distinct third-party domains connected. If the badge is not updating:

### Steps to Fix

1. **Verify Tab Is Active and Supported**:
   - The badge is updated per active tab.
   - Confirm you have navigated to a webpage that makes external connections.

2. **Refresh the Tab**:
   - Sometimes the badge does not update until the tab reloads.

3. **Check Extension Background Service**:
   - The background script captures network events.
   - If the background script stops or crashes, data and badge updates cease.
   - Restart the browser or reload the extension to recover.

4. **Check Browser Version**:
   - Extension APIs used for badges require recent browser versions.

5. **Clear Extension Storage Data**:
   - Corrupt or large storage data might interfere.
   - Navigate to your browser’s storage settings and clear uBO Scope’s local or session storage.

<Info>
In some cases, the badge clears automatically when switching tabs or when no third-party requests were observed.
</Info>
