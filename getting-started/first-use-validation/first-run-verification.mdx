# Validating Installation

This guide helps you verify that uBO Scope is correctly installed, active, and monitoring your browser's network connections. By following these steps, you will see the extension in action during your first browsing session, confirm the toolbar badge updates as expected, and access detailed connection data via the popup panel.

---

## What to Expect After Installation

Once uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your browser, it immediately begins monitoring network requests from the active tab. You will notice:

- A badge on the browser extension toolbar icon showing a numeric count.
- A popup panel showing live data when you click the extension icon.

These indicators reflect the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connects to on the current page.

---

## Step 1: Confirm uBO Scope is Active in Your Browser

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's extension toolbar. It should appear with the uBO Scope logo.

2. Verify the icon is not grayed out or disabled. The extension should be enabled and active.

3. If the icon is missing:
   - For Chromium-based browsers and Firefox, open the extensions page (`chrome://extensions` or `about:addons`), ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
   - For Safari, verify installation via Safari Preferences under the Extensions tab.

> <Check>If you do not see the uBO Scope icon, revisit installation instructions to confirm the extension installed correctly.</Check>

## Step 2: Understand the Toolbar Badge

The badge on the uBO Scope icon displays the **number of distinct third-party domains** contacted by the active tab:

- The count increments as your page requests resources from new third-party domains.
- A lower badge count indicates fewer distinct third-party connections.
- If the badge is empty (no number), it indicates zero detected third-party connections.


<Tip>
The badge count excludes first-party domains and focuses exclusively on third-party connections, providing a clear snapshot of external network activity related to privacy and content blocking.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Open the Popup Panel to View Real-Time Connection Data

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.

2. The popup panel opens, showing:
   - The hostname and domain of the current active tab.
   - Three categorized sections:
     - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which connections were allowed.
     - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were redirected or stealthily blocked.
     - **Blocked:** Domains for which connection errors or blocking were detected.

3. Each section lists domains with how many times connections were attempted.

4. The summary section at the top shows the total count of connected domains.

> <Info>Use this popup to understand exactly which remote servers your browser interacts with, categorized by connection outcomes.</Info>

## Step 4: Verify Extension Monitoring With a Test Browsing Session

1. Open a new tab and navigate to a website with known third-party content, such as a news site or a page with embedded social media widgets.

2. Observe the uBO Scope badge count updating dynamically during page load.

3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup and see detailed connection data.

4. Confirm that domains are listed under the appropriate categories (Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, Blocked).
