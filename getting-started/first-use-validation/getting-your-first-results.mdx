# Getting Your First Results with uBO Scope

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with uBO Scope! This guide will show you how to observe and interpret the remote server connections gathered by the extension as you browse the web. Understanding what the badge count and popup UI display will empower you to get meaningful insights into your browsing privacy and third-party exposure.

---

## 1. Understanding What You Will See

When you open any webpage with uBO Scope active, it immediately starts tracking all network connections made by that page. This includes both successful and blocked connections to third-party remote servers.

The two main UI elements you will engage with are:

- **Toolbar Badge Count:** Displays the number of distinct third-party domains that had allowed (successful) connections on the current tab.
- **Popup UI Panel:** Offers a detailed breakdown of connected third-party domains grouped by outcome categories: **Not Blocked**, **Stealth-Blocked**, and **Blocked**.


## 2. Open a Webpage and Observe uBO Scope

### Step 1: Navigate to Any Webpage

- Open your browser with uBO Scope installed and enabled.
- Visit any website that you regularly use or want to analyze.

<Tip>
Pick a site known to load external content from multiple domains, such as news sites or online stores, to better observe diverse third-party connections.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Check the Toolbar Badge

- Look at the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
- The badge number indicates the count of unique third-party remote server domains contacted successfully by this tab.

<Note>
A lower badge number typically means fewer external connections, which often corresponds to better privacy or less tracking exposure.
</Note>

### Step 3: Open the Popup UI

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- The popup will display:
  - The primary domain you are viewing (top heading).
  - A summary showing the total count of distinct domains contacted.
  - Three sections labeled:
    - **Not Blocked**: Domains with allowed connections.
    - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where requests were redirected silently.
    - **Blocked**: Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.


## 3. Interpreting the Popup UI and Data

The popup panel gives you a rich, detailed picture of what third-party entities your current webpage interacts with.

### Key Points:

- **Domain Names and Counts:** Each domain listed shows how many request instances were observed.
- **Allowed vs Blocked:** Helps you distinguish between resources fetched and those prevented from loading.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** These are requests redirected or blocked in a way invisible to the webpage, important for understanding silent privacy protection.

<Info>
The domain names displayed use Unicode conversion for easier reading, handling internationalized domain names gracefully.

## 4. Practical Example Walkthrough

Suppose you open "https://example.com":

- You see the badge shows "5".
- Opening the popup, the headline shows "example.com" with a count of "5 domains connected".
- The "Not Blocked" section lists domains like:
  - cdn.example.net (12 times)
  - analytics.thirdparty.com (3 times)
- The "Stealth-Blocked" section might list:
  - ads.tracker.com (4 times)
- The "Blocked" section may be empty or show domains blocked by your content blocker setup.

This instantly informs you which external domains your current page is interacting with and which ones are effectively blocked.

## 5. Tips for Successful Use

- **Refresh the Page:** After opening the popup, reload the page to see fresh connection data.
- **Browse Multiple Tabs:** Each browser tab keeps its distinct connection counts and breakdown.
- **Use Consistent Browsing Patterns:** This yields comparable data across sessions.

<Warning>
If the badge shows no number or the popup shows "NO DATA," ensure uBO Scope has the required permissions and is enabled on the current page.
</Warning>


## 6. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common First Results Issues">
<Accordion title="No Badge Number or Popup Data">
- Verify uBO Scope is installed correctly and listed among your browser extensions.
- Confirm it has active permissions for the webpage's domain (check permissions section in browser extension settings).
- Reload the tab after confirming permissions.
- Disable conflicting extensions that may interfere with network request monitoring.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Connections Not Appear in Popup Despite Badge Count">
- Data is updated asynchronously; wait a few seconds after page load.
- Reload popup after waiting.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unexpectedly High Number of Connected Domains">
- Understand that some websites legitimately use multiple third-party content services (CDNs, analytics, fonts).
- Consider privacy settings or additional blockers if you desire fewer connections.
- Cross-reference with other documentation pages on filter lists and content blocker myths.
