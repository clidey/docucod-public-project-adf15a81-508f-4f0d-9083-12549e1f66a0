# Using the Popup: First Run

Welcome to your first interaction with the uBO Scope extension popup. This guide walks you through activating the extension, understanding the connection summary, interpreting the allowed, blocked, and stealth domain counts, and decoding the toolbar badge. By the end of this walkthrough, you will confidently verify that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browser’s third-party network connections.

---

## 1. Activating uBO Scope for the First Time

1. **Install the Extension**
   - Ensure you have installed uBO Scope from the appropriate store for your browser:
     - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
     - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
   - The extension adds its icon to your browser toolbar.

2. **Open the Popup Panel**
   - Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
   - The popup loads and displays data related to the current active tab.

3. **Initial State**
   - On the very first run, the popup may briefly show “NO DATA” in the header and question marks in connection counts as it gathers data.
   - The extension uses browser APIs to monitor network requests, so it needs a moment to collect observable network activity from the page.

<Tip>
If you see “NO DATA” persistently, try refreshing the current tab to trigger network activity that uBO Scope can detect.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface

The popup is divided into clear sections representing the outcome of network connections initiated by the active tab:

### Header: Tab Hostname

- Displays the hostname of the current tab.
- Shows the full hostname and separates the base domain portion.
- Example: For `assets.example.com`, it will show `assets.` as prefix and `example.com` as the main domain.

### Summary: Domains Connected

- Shows the number of distinct third-party domains with which the tab has made connections.
- This number reflects **allowed** connections only (i.e., successful fetches).

### Outcome Sections

There are three categories represented, each with its own headed section:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
  - Lists domains from which connections were successful.
  - A lower count here is typically better for privacy.

- **Stealth-Blocked**
  - Domains where connection attempts were stealth-blocked, usually via redirects or subtle blocks.

- **Blocked**
  - Domains where connections were explicitly blocked and did not succeed.

Each domain listed displays the count of connection attempts.

<Tip>
Use these lists to quickly identify which third-party domains are active or blocked on the current webpage.
</Tip>

## 3. Decoding the Toolbar Badge

- The badge on the extension icon shows the count of distinct third-party domains from which resources were successfully fetched in the active tab.

- **Important:** This count is always about distinct domains contacted, not the number of requests. A lower badge number implies fewer third-party server contacts and typically indicates better privacy control.

- Counts will dynamically update as network activity changes or the tab is refreshed.

## 4. Example: Confirming uBO Scope Operation

Follow these steps after installing and opening the popup:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open any website">
Navigate to a popular website that loads third-party content, such as a news or social media site.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar to reveal the popup panel.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the header">
Verify that the header shows the current tab's hostname properly.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the domains connected count">
Confirm that the number displayed under 'domains connected' matches the number in the popup and that the toolbar badge reflects this number.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the lists">
Scroll through Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked domain lists to see domain names and their connection counts.
</Step>
<Step title="Refresh the page">
Reload the tab and watch the badge and popup data update, confirming live monitoring.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
To see meaningful data in the stealth and blocked sections, configure your browser or use content blockers that interact with network requests. Without blockers, stealth and blocked lists may remain empty.
</Tip>

## 5. Best Practices for First Use

- **Refresh New Tabs:** Always reload a newly opened tab after installing uBO Scope to kick-start connection tracking.
- **Interpret Counts Carefully:** A low badge number is better — it means fewer third-party domains are loaded.
- **Validate with Popular Sites:** Test on multiple well-known sites to understand the typical connection patterns.
- **Use Known Content Blockers:** For meaningful data in blocked or stealth-blocked outcomes, run uBO Scope alongside your content blocker.

## 6. Troubleshooting First Run Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Popup shows NO DATA or question marks persistently">
- Refresh your current tab.
- Ensure the extension has the required permissions.
- Check your browser version meets minimum requirements.
- Open the extension popup **after** the page has started loading.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Toolbar badge does not update">
- Reload the tab.
- Close and reopen the popup to force refresh.
- If problem persists, disable and re-enable the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No stealth or blocked domains show up">
- Confirm you have an active content blocker installed.
- Understand that stealth-blocked connections require specific blocking behavior.
- This is expected behavior on freshly installed extensions without blockers.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
