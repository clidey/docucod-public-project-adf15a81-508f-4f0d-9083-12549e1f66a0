# Troubleshooting Installation & Setup Issues

When installing and activating uBO Scope, some users may encounter issues like missing badge counts, empty popup windows, permission errors, or difficulty accessing the extension from official marketplaces. This guide walks you through common problems and how to resolve them to ensure uBO Scope functions correctly from the start.

---

## 1. Verifying Installation and Activation

Follow these steps to confirm that uBO Scope has been installed and activated correctly before troubleshooting:

- **Locate the Extension Icon:**
  - Check your browser's toolbar for the uBO Scope icon (usually shaped with a badge showing counts).
  - If missing, confirm the extension is installed by visiting the extensions page (`chrome://extensions/`, `about:addons`, or Safari Extensions).

- **Pin the Icon for Easy Access:**
  - In browsers like Chrome or Firefox, pinning the extension ensures the badge and popup are accessible.

- **Open the Popup:**
  - Click the icon to open the popup interface.
  - It should display domain stats with counts under "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" sections.

- **Confirm Toolbar Badge:**
  - The badge shows the count of distinct third-party domains connected.
  - A blank badge usually means no connections detected yet or data not correctly loaded.


## 2. Common Issues and Solutions

### 2.1 No Badge Count or Blank Badge

- **Cause:** Extension may not have permission to monitor web requests or has not processed recent network activity.

- **Solutions:**
  - Ensure you granted required permissions: `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`.
  - Visit a website that generates third-party requests (e.g., a content-rich site).
  - Reload the tab or open a new tab to trigger activity.
  - Reload or restart the browser to reinitialize the extension.

<Tip>
Make sure no other extension is interfering with `webRequest` permissions, as that may block uBO Scope from tracking requests.
</Tip>

### 2.2 Empty or Partially Loaded Popup

- **Cause:** Data might not have been gathered or deserialized due to session or storage access issues.

- **Solutions:**
  - Refresh the popup window by closing and reopening it.
  - Reload the browser tab and then reopen the popup.
  - Check browser storage permissions under extension settings.
  - Ensure your browser supports session storage APIs used by uBO Scope.

<Warning>
If you see "NO DATA" in the popup header consistently, verify the extension is enabled and has permission to run on the current tab's site.
</Warning>

### 2.3 Permission Errors or Extension Refuses to Activate

- **Cause:** Browser might block the extension due to missing host permissions or security settings.

- **Solutions:**
  - Confirm your browser version meets the minimum supported version requirements:
    - Chromium-based browsers 122+
    - Firefox 128+
    - Safari 18.5+
  - Check if the extension has host permissions for HTTP and HTTPS URLs.
  - Enable permissions manually if prompted by the browser.
  - Disable conflicting content blockers temporarily to verify no interference.

### 2.4 Unable to Access or Install from Marketplace

- **Cause:** Extension might be unavailable due to browser compatibility or regional restrictions.

- **Solutions:**
  - Use official extension stores for your browser:

    | Browser | Installation Link |
    | --- | --- |
    | Chrome | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
    | Firefox | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |
    
  - Verify you are running a supported browser version.
  - If issues persist, download and install the extension manually from the GitHub repository in developer mode.


## 3. Reloading and Resetting the Extension

If problems remain unresolved, try these steps:

1. Go to the browser extensions management page.
2. Disable then re-enable uBO Scope.
3. Restart your browser.
4. Clear browser cache and reload the browser tab.

<Tip>
Reloading often resolves transient issues related to extension activation or session storage.
</Tip>

## 4. Checking Browser Console for Errors

- Open the browser's developer console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Option+I).
- Look for errors related to uBO Scope or permissions.
- Common errors include inability to access storage or webRequest APIs.
- Share logs with support or report issues with reproduction steps to aid diagnosis.

## 5. When to Consult Browser Settings

- Ensure content blocking privacy settings do not restrict extension access.
- Verify that uBO Scope is allowed to run on all websites or specifically on the sites you want to monitor.
- Check for any browser flags or experimental features that might affect extension execution.
