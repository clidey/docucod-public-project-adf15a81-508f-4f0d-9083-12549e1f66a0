# Troubleshooting & Quick Validation

This guide helps you swiftly resolve common installation or activation issues with **uBO Scope**, such as missing toolbar icon, absence of data in the popup, or permissions errors. Additionally, it provides a straightforward checklist to verify that uBO Scope is functioning correctly, ensuring you gain immediate and accurate insights into third-party network connections.

## 1. Common Issues and How to Resolve Them

### 1.1 Toolbar Icon Missing

If you cannot see the uBO Scope toolbar icon, follow these steps:

- **Ensure the extension is installed and enabled:**
  - In Chrome and Edge: Go to `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`, locate uBO Scope, and confirm it is enabled.
  - In Firefox: Visit `about:addons`, find uBO Scope, and ensure it is enabled.
  - In Safari: Open Safari Extensions Preferences and verify uBO Scope is active.

- **Pin the icon to the toolbar:**
  - In Chromium browsers, click the "Extensions" puzzle icon and click the pin icon next to uBO Scope.

- **Restart the browser:**
  - Sometimes, a browser restart is required for the icon to appear after installation or enabling.

- **Verify minimum browser version:**
  - uBO Scope requires at least Chrome 122, Firefox 128, or Safari 18.5. Check your browser version and update if necessary.

<Note>
Older browser versions can silently prevent the icon and extension from functioning properly.
</Note>

### 1.2 No Data Appearing When Opening the Popup

If the popup panel shows "NO DATA" or remains blank:

- **Activate the extension on the current tab:**
  - Make sure the webpage you are viewing is fully loaded and that uBO Scope has permission to monitor it.

- **Check permissions:**
  - uBO Scope requires permissions for `webRequest` and host URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
  - Navigating to `chrome://extensions` (Chromium) or `about:addons` (Firefox) to verify permissions.

- **Disable conflicting extensions:**
  - Other extensions that heavily modify network requests or content blocking might interfere. Temporarily disable them to check if uBO Scope starts reporting.

- **Reload the tab:**
  - Refresh the webpage to trigger new network requests.

- **Open the popup after activity:**
  - Network requests are recorded in real time. If you open the popup immediately on a blank or static page, there may be no data.

<Warning>
If your browser settings or privacy mode block `webRequest` access or disable extensions on certain pages (e.g., incognito), data may not appear.
</Warning>

### 1.3 Permissions Errors or Request Failures

If uBO Scope fails to work due to permissions errors:

- **Review Extension Permissions:**
  - Confirm the extension has been granted `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` permissions.

- **Host Permissions:**
  - uBO Scope needs permission to monitor requests on all HTTP and WS origins (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
  - In some browsers, explicitly allow these in the extension settings.

- **Restart the browser or reinstall:**
  - Sometimes, permission issues resolve after restart or reinstall.

- **Check browser policy:**
  - Some managed or corporate browsers restrict permissions for security.

<Info>
Permissions errors are often due to security settings at the browser or OS level, and are not issues with uBO Scope itself.

## 2. Quick Validation Checklist: Confirming uBO Scope is Working

Use this checklist to confirm uBO Scope is correctly installed, activated, and tracking network requests.

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm the Toolbar Icon is Visible">
Look for the uBO Scope icon on your browser's toolbar. If missing, see Section 1.1.
</Step>
<Step title="Pin the Icon for Easy Access">
Make sure the icon is pinned so it is always visible.
</Step>
<Step title="Open a Website with Active Network Requests">
Visit any website that loads content over the network (e.g., news site, media portal).
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Toolbar Badge Count">
Check the badge number on the uBO Scope icon. It shows the count of distinct third-party domains contacted.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel and Verify Data Display">
Click the toolbar icon; the popup should show domains under the categories: not blocked, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Data Correctly">
Confirm the 'domains connected' count matches the badge and that lists of domains appear populating each section.
</Step>
<Step title="Refresh the Page and Observe Changes">
Reload the webpage and see if the badge count updates accordingly.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
If the popup remains blank or badge does not update after refresh, revisit troubleshooting steps.
</Check>

## 3. Additional Tips and Best Practices

- **Use trusted websites for initial tests:** Busy websites with many resources provide clear activity for validation.

- **Be patient:** Data aggregation updates happen within about a second after requests complete.

- **Understand what badge counts mean:** The badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains successfully contacted, not total requests.

- **Remember network requests outside `webRequest` API scope are not visible:** Some browser features or protocols might not expose requests to uBO Scope.

- **Consult detailed guides:** For deeper understanding of the popup UI or validating with your content blockers, see related documentation.
