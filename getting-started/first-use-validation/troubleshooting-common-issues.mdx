# Troubleshooting Installation Issues

This guide addresses common problems you might encounter during the installation or initial use of uBO Scope. Whether you notice missing toolbar icons, unexpected permission prompts, or no data being displayed in the popup, this checklist will help you quickly identify and fix issues. It also provides methods to verify that core extension functionality is working as expected.

---

## 1. Verify Toolbar Icon Presence

uBO Scope installs a toolbar extension icon that provides quick access to its popup interface and displays badge counts.

### Steps to Check:

1. **Locate the Toolbar Icon:**
   - On Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge), find the 'uBO Scope' icon next to the address bar.
   - On Firefox, look near the address bar or the overflow menu for the uBO Scope icon.
   - On Safari, verify the icon appears in the toolbar after installation.

2. **If the Icon is Missing:**
   - Ensure the extension is enabled:
     - Go to your browser's Extensions or Add-ons page.
     - Confirm 'uBO Scope' is installed and enabled.
   - Check browser version compatibility (minimum versions required):
     - Chromium: 122.0+
     - Firefox: 128.0+
     - Safari: 18.5+
   - Restart the browser after installation.

<Check>
If after restarting the browser the icon remains missing, try reinstalling the extension via the official store:

- [Chrome Web Store for uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
</Check>

## 2. Address Permission Prompts

Upon installation and first use, the extension requests permissions to access active tabs and web requests.

### What to Expect:

- Permissions for `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` are required for full functionality.
- The extension may request host permissions to access URLs with `https://*/*`, `http://*/*` (and WebSocket URLs on supported browsers).

### Troubleshooting:

- **Declining Permission Requests:** The extension will not work properly if required permissions are denied.
- **Review Permissions Manually:**
   1. Open your browser's Extensions page.
   2. Find uBO Scope and inspect its permissions.
   3. Make sure it has `webRequest` and host permissions.

<Warning>
If you accidentally denied permissions, you may need to remove and reinstall the extension to trigger the prompts again.
</Warning>

## 3. Confirm Popup Displays Data

The uBO Scope popup shows network connection summaries: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

### Steps to Validate:

1. Click the toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
2. Check the hostname shown at the top, along with the counts and lists of connected domains.

### Troubleshooting No Data Display:

- **Browser Version & Compatibility:** Confirm your browser meets the minimum required version.
- **Extension Activation:**
  - Make sure uBO Scope is enabled.
  - Reload the current tab and interact with websites to generate network requests.
- **Content Blocking & WebRequest API:**
  - If other extensions or browser settings block WebRequest API access, data may not appear.

<Info>
The popup displays 'NO DATA' when no network request information is available for the current tab.
After browsing a few sites, the data should update automatically.
</Info>

## 4. Verify Core Extension Functionality

To ensure uBO Scope is capturing network events, you can perform a simple check.

### Validation Steps:

1. **Open a new browser tab.**
2. **Visit a popular website, for example, https://example.com.**
3. **Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.**
4. **Look for domain counts and lists populating under allowed, stealth, and blocked sections.**

### Expected Results:

- The domain for the page (e.g., example.com) appears under 'not blocked'.
- Connected third-party domains (like CDN providers) show under allowed or blocked categories.
- The badge on the toolbar icon updates with a non-zero count corresponding to distinct connected domains.

<Note>
If no domains appear but your network traffic exists, it suggests an issue with WebRequest event listening or permissions.
</Note>
