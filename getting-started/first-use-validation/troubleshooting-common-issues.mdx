# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This troubleshooting guide addresses frequent problems users may encounter during or after installing and setting up uBO Scope. Whether you see no badge on the toolbar, missing or empty data in the popup panel, permission warnings, or have compatibility questions with your browser, this guide provides clear, actionable solutions to help you get uBO Scope operating smoothly.

---

## 1. No Badge or Toolbar Icon Missing

If the extension icon does not appear on your browser's toolbar or the badge with number counts is missing:

- **Verify Installation:**
  - Confirm you have installed uBO Scope from the official store for your browser (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari Extensions).
  - After installation, restart your browser to ensure the extension loads properly.

- **Check Extension is Enabled:**
  - In your browser's Extensions or Add-ons page, ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
  - Some browsers may disable extensions after update or restart.

- **Toolbar Visibility:**
  - Some browsers require you to pin the extension manually to the toolbar. Look for an extensions menu (puzzle icon) and pin uBO Scope to make it visible.

- **Browser Compatibility:**
  - Ensure your browser version meets the minimum required version:
    - Chrome: version 122 or later
    - Firefox: version 128 or later
    - Safari: version 18.5 or later

- **Permissions:**
  - The extension needs permissions to interact with web requests and tabs. Denied permissions can prevent badge updates.
  - Check permissions granted for uBO Scope on the Extensions page.

<Tip>
If the badge number is not updating, try restarting the browser. Sometimes the background service worker (in Chromium) or extension process needs a restart to initialize.
</Tip>

## 2. Popup Panel Shows No Data or "NO DATA"

If opening the popup shows empty data or the text "NO DATA" where domains and counts should appear:

- **Reload the Page:**
  - uBO Scope monitors active tabs. If you have not navigated to any webpage after installing, there won't be data to display.
  - Visit any website that makes network connections (e.g., https://example.com).

- **Active Tab Focus:**
  - The popup only shows data for the active tab. Switch to a tab with an active webpage and open the popup again.

- **Permission Issues:**
  - Verify that the extension has the `webRequest` and `activeTab` permissions enabled, as these are necessary to monitor network requests.

- **Browser or Extension State:**
  - Sometimes extensions don't receive messages properly immediately after installation.
  - Close and reopen the popup or restart the browser.

- **Content Blocking Conflicts:**
  - Although uBO Scope reports data independently, very restrictive privacy setups, proxies, or third-party security tools may interfere with network event reporting.

<Warning>
If data never appears after these steps, consider checking the browser console for errors by inspecting the popup or background extension pages.
</Warning>

## 3. Permissions or Access Denied Warnings

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to function properly. If you encounter warnings or denials:

- **Host Permissions:**
  - Ensure the extension has host permissions for `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and WebSocket schemes (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) where applicable.
  - These are necessary to listen to network requests from websites.

- **Storage Permissions:**
  - The extension uses session storage to maintain data. Denied storage permissions can cause failures.

- **Check Manifest Permissions:**
  - Confirm you installed the version of uBO Scope compatible with your browser that includes required permissions.

- **Manual Permission Granting:**
  - Some browsers allow granular permission management. If you revoked certain permissions, restore them from the browser's extension settings.

## 4. Browser Compatibility Issues

uBO Scope is designed to run on major browsers with modern MV3-compatible extension APIs.

- **Supported Browsers & Minimum Versions:**
  - **Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Chrome, Edge) - minimum version 122
  - **Firefox** - minimum version 128
  - **Safari** - minimum version 18.5

- **Check Running Browser Version:**
  - Visit the About page in your browser to confirm you meet the minimum version.

- **Manifests Differences:**
  - The extension manifest files differ slightly for each platform but maintain required permissions and entry points.
  - Use only official distribution channels to ensure compatibility.

- **Safari Manual Installation:**
  - Safari might require manually enabling the extension via the Extensions preferences pane after installing.

- **Platform-Specific Limitations:**
  - Some browsers may restrict background scripts differently (service workers in Chromium, background scripts in Firefox).
  - Extension APIs may behave subtly differently; these are handled by the extension author, but updating browsers helps.

## 5. Badge Count Does Not Update or Shows Strange Numbers

If the number on the toolbar badge seems stuck or unusually high or low:

- **Understanding Badge Meaning:**
  - The badge shows the number of distinct third-party remote domains the active tab connected to without being blocked.
  - Lower numbers indicate fewer unique remote servers connected.

- **Reload the Tab:**
  - Badge updates on new network activity. Reload the page or navigate to a new page to trigger updates.

- **Background Script Status:**
  - In Chromium, MV3 uses service workers that can unload — ensure it's active by opening or reloading uBO Scope popup.

- **Conflicts with Other Extensions:**
  - Extensions that modify network requests or inject scripts may alter behaviors. Temporarily disable other extensions to test.

## 6. Empty or Broken Popup UI

If UI elements in the popup appear broken or missing:

- **Clear Browser Cache:**
  - Sometimes cached files cause UI problems. Clearing cached resources can help.

- **Check Console Errors:**
  - Open the developer tools console for the popup page via the browser extension inspector to identify UI errors.

- **Reload the Popup:**
  - Close and reopen the popup. If persistent, reload the entire extension.

- **Updates or Corruption:**
  - Reinstall the extension from official sources to ensure files are intact.

## 7. General Troubleshooting Tips

- **Restart Browser:**
  - A full browser restart resolves many transient extension issues.

- **Check Extension Version:**
  - Use latest stable release version 1.0.1 for best compatibility.

- **Review Browser Console Logs:**
  - For advanced users, browser console logs, background page logs, and extension internal logs reveal errors.

- **Uninstall and Reinstall:**
  - If problems persist, uninstall the extension completely, restart the browser, then reinstall.

- **Verify Network Access:**
  - uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API. Third-party firewalls or security software blocking browser networking may cause issues.
