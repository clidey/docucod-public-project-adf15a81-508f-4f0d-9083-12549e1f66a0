# Troubleshooting Common Issues

When setting up and using uBO Scope, you might encounter some common issues related to permissions, browser compatibility, or unexpected behavior in the extension's user interface. This guide helps you identify and resolve these typical problems efficiently to ensure smooth operation and accurate connection visibility.

---

## 1. Permissions and Browser Settings Issues

uBO Scope relies on specific browser permissions and APIs to monitor network traffic accurately. Missing or denied permissions often cause the extension to malfunction or not display connection data.

### Symptoms
- The toolbar badge shows no count or remains empty after browsing.
- The popup panel displays 'NO DATA' or no domains.
- The extension icon is present but inactive or unresponsive.

### Resolutions
<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Required Permissions">
- Ensure uBO Scope has been granted the necessary permissions: `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`.
- In most browsers, visit the extension management page (`chrome://extensions`, `about:addons` in Firefox, or Safari Extensions Preferences).
- Check that the extension is enabled and permissions are not blocked.
- If permissions were denied earlier, remove the extension and reinstall it to trigger permission requests again.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Host Permissions">
- uBO Scope needs access to monitor network requests across all sites.
- Check that host permissions include `https://*/*` and `http://*/*` (also `wss://*/*` and `ws://*/*` in Chromium and Firefox).
- If running on Safari, note host permissions are limited to HTTP and HTTPS only.
- Reinstall or update the extension if host permissions are missing or incomplete.
</Step>

<Step title="Update Browser to Supported Version">
- Verify your browser version meets the minimum requirement:
  - Chromium: version 122 or later
  - Firefox: version 128 or later
  - Safari: version 18.5 or later
- Upgrading the browser ensures full support for the Manifest V3 APIs uBO Scope uses.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
In case permission issues persist, try disabling other conflicting extensions that may interfere with access or network monitoring, then restart your browser.
</Tip>

## 2. Extension UI Does Not Update or Shows Outdated Data

Sometimes the popup or the badge count does not reflect recent browsing activity, leading to confusion about whether uBO Scope is working.

### Causes
- Browser pauses or unloads the background service worker (common in Chromium-based browsers). 
- Temporary issues with browser APIs or slow response to network events.

### Solutions
<Steps>
<Step title="Reload the Extension">
- Manually reload uBO Scope via your browser’s extensions management page.
- This restarts the background script and clears stale session data.
</Step>

<Step title="Close and Reopen the Popup Panel">
- Close the uBO Scope popup and open it again on the active tab.
- The popup fetches fresh data upon opening.
</Step>

<Step title="Restart Your Browser">
- A full browser restart ensures all service workers and extension background scripts reload properly.
- This often resolves transient issues affecting the extension UI.
</Step>

<Step title="Clear Browser Cache and Extension Storage">
- In rare cases, corrupted storage data may cause display issues.
- Clear browser cache and reset extension storage via browser’s extension debugging tools.
- You may also remove and reinstall the extension to start fresh.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Network Requests Not Being Reported Correctly

If uBO Scope does not capture network requests as expected, or shows discrepancies with other tools, investigate these aspects.

### Key Points
- uBO Scope monitors network requests exclusively through the browser `webRequest` API.
- Network requests made outside this API's reach cannot be captured (e.g., certain WebSocket patterns or resource fetching done by some browser features).

### Troubleshooting Steps
<Steps>
<Step title="Verify `webRequest` API Availability">
- Some browsers or browser configurations might restrict or modify access to `webRequest`.
- Check browser developer documentation and settings that might affect the API.
</Step>

<Step title="Inspect Content Blockers and Proxy Settings">
- Other content blockers or proxy configurations may interfere with the network monitoring.
- Temporarily disable other blocking extensions to compare results.
</Step>

<Step title="Check for Browser Errors or Warnings">
- Open your browser’s developer console and inspect any warnings or errors related to uBO Scope.
- If errors involve permissions or failed background script execution, address according to error messages.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Remember that uBO Scope is designed to work alongside any content blocker and does not itself block or alter network requests. It only reports their outcomes.
</Warning>
