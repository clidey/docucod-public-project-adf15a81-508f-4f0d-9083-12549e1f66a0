# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide helps you resolve frequent first-time problems that may prevent uBO Scope from working correctly, including missing extension icons, permission errors, or no data being displayed. Use these practical checks to confirm that uBO Scope is active and collecting data as expected, and learn where to find help if issues persist.

---

## 1. Verify uBO Scope is Installed and Enabled

Before troubleshooting deeper issues, confirm that the extension is properly installed and active in your browser.

### Steps:
1. Open your browser's extensions or add-ons manager:
   - **Chrome:** `chrome://extensions/`
   - **Firefox:** `about:addons`
   - **Safari:** Preferences > Extensions
2. Search for 'uBO Scope' or 'uBlock Origin Scope' in the list.
3. Ensure the extension is enabled (toggle switch is ON).
4. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.

<Check>
If the extension icon is missing, try restarting your browser or reinstalling the extension from the official store to restore it.
</Check>

## 2. Confirm Required Permissions are Granted

uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions to monitor network connections accurately. Lack of these permissions can cause permission errors or prevent data from being displayed.

### What Permissions Are Required?
- Access to all HTTP and HTTPS sites (`http://*/*` and `https://*/*`)
- WebSocket URL access (`ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*`) for Chrome and Firefox
- Permissions to use the `webRequest` API

### How to Check:
1. Open the extension's details page in your browser.
2. Locate the **Permissions** or **Host Access** section.
3. Verify that uBO Scope has access to "All sites" or similar broad access.

<Warning>
Some browsers might require you to explicitly allow access to all sites for this extension. Make sure this setting is enabled.
</Warning>

## 3. Understand Why No Data Is Displayed

If you see **NO DATA** in the popup or the badge count does not update, this often indicates the extension isn't receiving network request data.

### Common Causes & Fixes:

| Cause                              | Solution                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Extension installed but inactive  | Reload or restart the browser; make sure the extension icon appears and is clickable.                      |
| Permissions incomplete            | Grant all required permissions as described above.                                                       |
| Browser version incompatible      | Use a supported browser and version (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).                       |
| Content blocking interfering      | Test with other content blockers disabled; uBO Scope listens to all but some extreme blockers may interfere. |
| Network requests inaccessible     | Verify you are browsing real-world sites that generate third-party network connections for uBO Scope to monitor. |

<Tip>
The toolbar badge shows the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected; zero or no update means no data captured.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshoot Browser-Specific Issues

### Chrome & Chromium-Based Browsers
- Minimum Chrome version **122.0** is required.
- WebSocket permissions (`ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*`) must be allowed.
- If background service worker crashes or unloads, the extension may appear inactive until the next event triggers it.

### Firefox
- Requires Firefox version **128.0** or higher.
- Ensure the extension has state access on all hosts.

### Safari
- Requires Safari version **18.5** or higher.
- Only `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` permissions are requested (no WebSocket).
- Extension behavior depends heavily on macOS and Safari settings; check Safari extension preferences.

## 5. Practical Checks to Ensure uBO Scope is Working

### Step-by-step Validation:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Load a Known Website">
Open a popular, complex website (e.g., a news site or large portal) in a new tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Badge Count">
Look at the uBO Scope toolbar badge; it should show a number reflecting third-party connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Open Popup and Verify Data">
Open the popup again and verify that domains are listed under "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", or "blocked".
</Step>
<Step title="Refresh the Webpage">
Reload the webpage to trigger new network requests.
Check that the popup updates accordingly.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If after these steps the badge remains empty or the popup shows 'NO DATA', review permissions as described above, or try disabling other extensions to avoid interference.
</Tip>
