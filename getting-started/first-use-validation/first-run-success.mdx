# Your First Run: Seeing uBO Scope in Action

Welcome to your first experience with uBO Scope! This guide walks you through activating the extension, opening its popup on a sample website, and understanding how to interpret the initial connection and blocking statistics it presents. By the end, you'll confidently recognize what the badge count means and how uBO Scope visualizes your browsing connections.

---

## 1. Activate uBO Scope in Your Browser

Before using uBO Scope, you must ensure it is installed and active in your browser. If you have not yet installed it, please refer to the [Installing uBO Scope](../installation-setup/installing-ubo-scope) guide.

### Steps to Activate:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
   - It appears as a shield or a badge with a number.
2. If the icon is grayed out or missing:
   - Open your browser's extensions/add-ons page.
   - Find uBO Scope and enable it.
3. Make sure you have granted needed permissions (like `webRequest` and host permissions). Refer to [Quick Configuration & Permissions](../installation-setup/quick-configuration) if needed.

<Tip>
Activating uBO Scope ensures it can monitor network requests in real time and populate the badge and popup with accurate data.
</Tip>

## 2. Open a Sample Website to Monitor

To see uBO Scope in action, visit any website with known external network activity (for beginners, a popular news site or large content site works well).

### Steps:

1. Open a new tab in your browser.
2. Navigate to your chosen website (e.g., https://example.com).
3. Allow the page to fully load.
4. Watch uBO Scope’s toolbar icon badge update with a number.

<Note>
The badge number represents the count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted during browsing.
</Note>

## 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

The popup panel gives detailed insight into the types of connections made by the page and their blocking status.

### How to Open the Popup:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
2. The popup panel will appear centered on your screen.
3. You will see several sections showing connection statistics.

## 4. Understanding the Popup Panel Components

The popup is organized into key sections that summarize network connections.

### Components Explained:

- **Hostname Display**:
  - Shows the active website’s hostname and domain.
  - Helps confirm which site’s data you are viewing.

- **Domains Connected Count**:
  - At the top labeled "domains connected:" shows a numeric count.
  - Represents unique third-party remote domains that were connected to.

- **Outcome Sections:**
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains from which resources were allowed through.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where requests were redirected stealthily.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where requests were explicitly blocked.

Each section lists the domains with a count badge indicating how many requests succeeded or were blocked from that domain.

<Tip>
Remember, a lower badge count on the toolbar generally signals fewer third-party connections, which often indicates better privacy.
</Tip>

## 5. Interpreting the Badge Count and Visual Data

The badge on the uBO Scope toolbar icon reflects **the number of distinct third-party remote servers that established a connection** for the current tab.

### Key Points:

- The count updates dynamically as you navigate and browse.
- It includes allowed connections and those that may have been stealthily redirected.
- Blocked connections do not increase the badge count.

Understanding this helps you:

- Recognize the true exposure to third-party servers on any site.
- Avoid common misconceptions that more blocked requests mean better blocking.
- See the real scope of domain connections independent of other content blockers.

<Warning>
Do not confuse block counts from other content blockers with the badge count here. uBO Scope reports actual distinct connected third parties, not just the number of blocked requests.
</Warning>

---

## 6. Quick Example Walkthrough

Here’s a practical example of what you might see on your first run:

- Visit https://example.com
- uBO Scope toolbar badge shows "12" indicating 12 distinct third-party servers connected.
- Open the popup:
  - You see 8 domains under “not blocked.”
  - 2 domains show under “stealth-blocked.”
  - 2 domains appear under “blocked.”

This represents a total of 12 unique third-party domains involved in network activity for the page.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common First-Run Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Your First Run with uBO Scope">
<Accordion title="Popup Panel Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty">
- Make sure the current tab is a webpage and not a blank page or browser internal page.
- Refresh the tab and try opening the popup again.
- Confirm uBO Scope is active and permissions are granted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Toolbar Badge Does Not Update">
- Check that the extension has permissions for the URL’s domain.
- Ensure your browser is at or above the minimum supported version.
- Try restarting the browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpectedly High Badge Counts">
- Some websites load resources from many legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs).
- Cross-check with the popup panel to understand which domains are considered ‘allowed’.
- Refer to the [Core Concepts & Terminology](../../overview/architecture-core-concepts/core-concepts-terminology) page for domain classification explanation.
