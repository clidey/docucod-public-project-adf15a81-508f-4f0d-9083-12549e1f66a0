# Your First Run

Welcome to your first active session with uBO Scope. This guide walks you through what happens after installation and basic configuration, showing you how to observe and interpret your extension’s initial activity. You will learn how to launch the extension on a website, use the toolbar badge as your live indicator, and open the popup panel to analyze domains with network activity.

---

## 1. Start Browsing and Observe the Toolbar Badge

Once uBO Scope is installed and enabled, it immediately starts monitoring network connections initiated by your browser tabs.

### Steps:

1. Open your preferred browser and visit any website you want to monitor.
2. Look at the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. This icon displays a badge count reflecting the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the webpage.

   - **What the Badge Count Means:** A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, which generally suggests better privacy.
   - The count updates dynamically as the page loads and network activity occurs.

<Tip>
If the badge is empty (no count shown), it means no third-party connections have been detected or recorded for the active tab yet.
</Tip>

### What to Expect:

- As the page loads, the badge count will increase or update to reflect unique third-party domains encountered.
- The extension tracks all connection attempts and their outcomes regardless of other content blockers in use.

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

The popup panel provides a detailed summary of the domains contacted by the website currently active in your tab.

### Steps:

1. Click the uBO Scope browser toolbar icon.
2. The popup panel will open, showing information related to the active tab:

   - **Hostname(s):** The domain of the webpage you are currently on.
   - **Domains Connected:** The total number of distinct domains contacted from this tab.
   - **Domain Lists by Outcome:** Domains are categorized into three groups:
     - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which connections were allowed and succeeded.
     - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with network requests that were redirected stealthily.
     - **Blocked:** Domains where network requests failed or were explicitly blocked.

### How to Read the Popup:

- Domains are listed with count badges indicating the number of requests involving each domain.
- The popup updates as network activity continues during your browsing session.

<Tip>
Hover over or examine the domain lists to better understand which third-parties are interacting with your current page.
</Tip>

## 3. Verify a Successful First Run

A successful first run confirms that uBO Scope is monitoring network activity and displaying accurate information.

### Confirmation Checklist:

- You see a badge count on the toolbar icon when visiting a webpage with third-party content.
- The popup panel shows the active tab’s hostname and a summary count of connected domains.
- Domains are correctly categorized under "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked" sections.

<Check>
If these appear as described, your first run is successful.
</Check>

## 4. Practical Example

Suppose you visit `https://example.com`. During loading:

- The uBO Scope icon badge displays `5`, indicating five distinct third-party domains contacted.
- Opening the popup reveals `example.com` as the active hostname.
- The summary section shows "domains connected: 5".
- You see domains listed under:
  - "not blocked" (like `cdn.example.net`),
  - "stealth-blocked" domains,
  - and possibly some "blocked" domains.

This real-time insight helps you immediately understand third-party network interactions on the page.

## 5. Tips for Your First Run

- **Refresh the page**: Sometimes, initial network activity is incomplete until you reload the tab.
- **Try multiple sites**: Observe different badge counts to build familiarity with what each figure represents.
- **Use alongside content blockers**: uBO Scope works independently of blockers, so compare its reports to your blocker’s activity.

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Your First Run">
<Accordion title="No Badge Appears on Toolbar">
If the badge remains empty even on sites with third-party content:

- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled in your browser extensions.
- Reload the current tab.
- Check that required permissions were granted during installation.
- Try visiting a different website.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Panel Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists">
This can happen if the extension hasn’t received tab data yet.

- Click the popup again after a few seconds.
- Refresh the page.
- Ensure you’re viewing the popup on the active tab.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpectedly High Badge Count">
Remember this number reports **unique third-party domains contacted**, not blocked requests.

- Some legitimate sites load resources from many distinct third parties.
- Review the popup panel for detailed domain lists to understand the count.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
