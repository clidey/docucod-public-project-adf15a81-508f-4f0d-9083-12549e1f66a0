# Quick Validation: Is uBO Scope Working?

Use this guide to **confirm** that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browser's network requests and accurately reporting connections to remote third-party servers. This step-by-step walkthrough will help you check visual indicators, interpret the popup panel, and validate that the extension is functioning as intended.

---

## 1. Verify Extension Installation and Activation

1. **Check Toolbar Icon:** After installing uBO Scope from the relevant browser extension store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari Extensions), look for the uBO Scope icon on your browser's toolbar.

2. **Badge Count Meaning:** The icon's badge displays the number of distinct third-party domains contacted by the active tab.
   
   - A **non-empty number** indicates the extension is tracking connections.
   - A **lower count** is preferable and represents fewer distinct third-party servers contacted.

3. **Click the Icon:** Clicking the icon should open the popup panel for the current tab. If this popup appears, your extension is active.

<Check>
If there is no icon visible, ensure the extension is enabled in your browser's extensions manager.
</Check>

## 2. Understand the Popup Panel Layout

The popup panel categorizes domains connected by the active tab into three groups:

- **Not Blocked:** These domains represent active connections that were allowed.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains for which network requests were stealthily blocked or redirected.
- **Blocked:** Domains for which network requests were explicitly blocked (errors).

### Popup Panel Elements

- **Header:** Shows the full hostname of the current tab and its domain.
- **Summary:** Displays the count of connected domains.
- **Domains List:** Each outcome section lists domains with an associated request count badge.

<Info>
The domains shown correspond to third-party servers contacted during page load and interaction.
</Info>

## 3. Perform Basic Validation by Browsing

### Step 1: Open a Popular, Trusted Website

- Navigate to a common website such as https://www.wikipedia.org or https://www.mozilla.org.

### Step 2: Observe the Badge Number

- Watch the badge on the uBO Scope icon change, reflecting the number of connected domains.
- Click the icon to open the popup panel.

### Step 3: Review Domain Categorization

- Check which domains appear in each category (Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, Blocked).
- Valid domains for major content-delivery networks (CDNs) should typically appear under **Not Blocked**.

<Note>
Expect some domains to be allowed (e.g., wikimedia.org) and possibly a smaller number to be blocked or stealth-blocked depending on your content blockers.
</Note>

## 4. Confirm Popup Data Update Behavior

- Reload the active tab and observe:
  - The badge updates correctly.
  - The domain lists refresh with updated counts.

- Navigate to another active tab and click uBO Scope’s icon:
  - Confirm the popup displays network data for the current tab.
  - The domain counts and lists reflect the appropriate tab context.

<Warning>
If the popup always shows “NO DATA” or does not update, the extension may lack necessary permissions or be malfunctioning.
</Warning>

## 5. Troubleshoot Common Validation Issues

### Problem: No Badge or Popup Data

- Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extension manager.
- Verify uBO Scope has the required permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`).
- Confirm you are using a supported browser version:
  - Chromium 122+ for Chrome-like browsers.
  - Firefox 128+.
  - Safari 18.5+.

### Problem: Badge Count Does Not Change

- Restart the browser to ensure the background service worker is active.
- Disable other extensions that might conflict with `webRequest` API usage.

### Problem: Domain Lists Stay Empty or Incomplete

- Make sure you're on a page that makes outbound network requests.
- Try visiting a different, resource-rich website.

## 6. Understanding the Values and Visual Indicators

| Section           | Meaning                                                        | What to Expect                                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Badge Number      | Count of distinct third-party domains connected                | Number changes as you browse different sites                  |
| Not Blocked       | Domains with successful connections (allowed)                  | Common CDNs and essential third parties listed                |
| Stealth-Blocked   | Domains with redirects or stealth blocking                      | Usually fewer domains; indicates indirect blocking or redirects |
| Blocked           | Domains explicitly blocked with errors in network requests     | Only domains blocked by content blockers or network errors   |

## 7. Sample User Flow: Validate uBO Scope on Wikipedia

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Wikipedia">
Navigate to https://www.wikipedia.org in your browser after installing uBO Scope.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe Toolbar Badge">
Look at the uBO Scope icon badge – note the number indicating connected third-party domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Open Popup Panel">
Click the uBO Scope icon to see the popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domain Lists">
Verify that Wikipedia and related CDN domains appear in the 'Not Blocked' list.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload and Confirm Updates">
Reload the page and ensure the badge and popup data refresh accordingly.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Appendix: Quick Tips

- **Lower badge counts** generally mean fewer third-party connections, enhancing your privacy.
- uBO Scope works independently from content blockers and reports actual network activity.
- Not all third-party connections are bad; some are necessary for site functionality.
