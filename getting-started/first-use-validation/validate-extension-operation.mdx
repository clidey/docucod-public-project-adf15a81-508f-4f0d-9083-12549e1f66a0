# Validate uBO Scope Is Working

Ensure your uBO Scope extension is actively monitoring network requests by opening common websites and using the extension's popup interface to inspect reported connections. This guide walks you through confirming the extension’s operation, interpreting badge counts, understanding domain listings, and recognizing signs of normal behavior.

---

## 1. Open Websites to Generate Network Activity

To see uBO Scope in action, start by visiting a few popular websites that load multiple third-party resources. This triggers network requests that the extension will monitor and categorize.

**Suggested steps:**

- Open your browser with uBO Scope installed and enabled.
- Visit websites such as `https://www.wikipedia.org`, `https://news.ycombinator.com`, or other common sites you trust.
- Navigate through different pages to generate diverse network requests.

<Check>
Why these websites?

They typically connect to multiple third-party servers, allowing you to see varied network request outcomes in uBO Scope.
</Check>

---

## 2. Access the uBO Scope Popup Interface

Once the network requests occur, use the toolbar icon to open the uBO Scope popup.

### Steps:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar. (You may have pinned it during initial setup.)
2. Click the icon to open the popup panel.

You should now see a detailed summary reflecting network requests from the active tab.

<Tip>
If the popup says 'NO DATA' or is blank, refresh the current tab and give it a few seconds for data collection.
</Tip>

## 3. Interpret Badge Count and Popup Content

### Understanding the Badge Count

The badge displays a number indicating **the count of distinct third-party domains allowed (not blocked) to load for the active tab**.

- A higher number means more third-party domains connected.
- A lower number typically indicates better privacy or fewer external connections.
- The badge is blank if no third-party allowed domains are detected.

### Popup Sections Explained

The popup panel breaks down network requests by three categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which content loaded successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were silently redirected or stealthily blocked without explicit user notification.
- **Blocked:** Domains from which requests were blocked.

For each category, the popup lists domains and shows the count of requests made to each.

<Check>
Note: The domain count includes only third-party servers, not the primary site domain.
</Check>

---

## 4. What Normal Operation Looks Like

- **Badge reflects the count of distinct allowed third-party domains**.
- The popup lists domains with request counts accurately reflecting all network activity.
- The hostname displayed at the top shows the current page's domain.
- Counts update as you browse to new sites or refresh existing pages.

### Sample Scenario

For example, visiting a news website might show:
- Allowed domains: content delivery networks like `cdn.example.com`, analytics servers, ad networks.
- Stealth-blocked domains: some trackers silently blocked by the browser or other blockers.
- Blocked domains: explicitly blocked third parties that the content blocker or browser prevents loading.

This variety is expected and illustrates uBO Scope’s transparency into network activity.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Verification Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting Steps">
<Accordion title="No badge number appearing after visiting sites">
- Confirm uBO Scope extension is enabled and running.
- Refresh the active tab and wait at least 10 seconds.
- Ensure the site is loading third-party resources (check developer tools network tab).
- Check browser permissions to verify uBO Scope access to network requests.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' or is empty">
- Reload the current tab and reopen the popup.
- Make sure your browser's privacy settings do not restrict the extension.
- Disable other extensions that may conflict with webRequest API usage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge count does not change when navigating">
- Verify you have the latest uBO Scope version.
- Confirm no errors appear in the browser console related to uBO Scope.
- Restart the browser to refresh background processes.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Tips for Effective Validation

- **Use real-world sites with diverse third-party loads** for more meaningful data.
- **Refresh and revisit pages** to trigger updated network requests.
- Regularly check the badge and popup to familiarize yourself with the typical range of connected domains.
- Use uBO Scope values as privacy indicators: a lower allowed domain count generally improves privacy.

---

## 7. Next Steps After Validation

- Explore the popup further to understand which domains are connecting and how frequently.
- Review related guides such as [Understanding the Popup: Reading Domain Data](/guides/getting-started-guides/first-look-at-popup) for deeper insight.
- Proceed to [Troubleshooting Your Setup](/getting-started/first-use-validation/troubleshooting-setup) if anomalies arise.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with your content blocker settings for optimized privacy.
