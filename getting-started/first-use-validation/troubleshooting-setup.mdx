# Troubleshooting Your Setup

This page addresses the most frequent issues users encounter when setting up uBO Scope. If you find the extension icon missing, the badge count not updating, or no connections detected, follow the step-by-step guidance below to quickly identify and resolve common problems. These actionable solutions are designed to have you up and running with uBO Scope’s network visibility within minutes.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Icon Visibility

If you do not see the uBO Scope toolbar icon after installation, follow these steps:

1. **Check Browser Extension Toolbar**
   - **Chrome/Chromium**: Click the puzzle piece icon to view hidden extensions. Pin uBO Scope for easier access.
   - **Firefox**: Click the overflow menu on the toolbar and pin the uBO Scope extension.
   - **Safari**: Confirm that the extension is enabled in Safari Preferences under Extensions.

2. **Verify Installation Status**
   - Open your browser’s extensions list and confirm uBO Scope appears and is enabled.

3. **Restart Your Browser**
   - Sometimes a restart is required after installation.

<Tip>
Pinning the extension icon ensures you can quickly check the badge count and access the popup interface.
</Tip>

## 2. Badge Count Not Updating

The badge on the toolbar icon shows the count of distinct third-party domains connected by your browser. If this count stays empty or static, try the following:

### Step 1: Verify Browser Compatibility

- uBO Scope requires minimum browser versions:
  - **Chrome/Chromium**: 122.0 or later
  - **Firefox**: 128.0 or later
  - **Safari**: 18.5 or later

If your browser version is below these, update to the latest stable version.

### Step 2: Check Extension Permissions

uBO Scope relies on the `webRequest` API and requires permission to access all http(s) and ws(s) URLs.

- Confirm permissions include:
  - `activeTab`
  - `storage`
  - `webRequest`
  - Host permissions over `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and for Firefox also `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`

To check:
- Open your browser's extension details page for uBO Scope
- Verify listed permissions

### Step 3: Ensure No Conflicts with Other Extensions

Other extensions or content blockers might interfere with uBO Scope’s ability to monitor network requests.

- Temporarily disable other network monitoring or blocking extensions.
- Reload some active webpages and check if the badge count updates.

### Step 4: Force a Browser Restart and Clear Extension Data

If the badge still does not update:

- Remove and reinstall uBO Scope.
- Restart the browser fully.

<Tip>
Browser updates and extension reinstalls often resolve permissions and API access conflicts.
</Tip>

## 3. No Connections Detected in Popup

When you open the uBO Scope popup, if it shows “NO DATA” or zero domains connected:

### Step 1: Generate Network Activity

- Visit commonly used websites known to load multiple third-party resources.
- Refresh the active tab multiple times.

### Step 2: Verify Network Event Processing

- uBO Scope processes network request events asynchronously. It may take a few seconds after page loads to update.

### Step 3: Confirm Tabs Are Not Isolated

- Extensions cannot monitor requests from some internal browser pages or certain privacy-focused contexts.
- Try testing with publicly accessible, normal websites.

### Step 4: Permission and API Limitations

- Confirm permission grants as mentioned earlier.
- Some browsers restrict `webRequest` on certain URLs (e.g., `chrome://` pages).

<Tip>
Use popular, resource-rich websites (news sites, social networks) to confirm data collection.
</Tip>
