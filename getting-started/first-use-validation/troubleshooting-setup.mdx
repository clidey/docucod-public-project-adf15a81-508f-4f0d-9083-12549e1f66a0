# Troubleshooting Installation & First Use

This guide addresses common issues encountered during the installation and initial use of **uBO Scope**, helping you quickly identify problems and apply effective solutions to get the extension up and running.

---

## 1. Badge Icon Not Appearing in Browser Toolbar

If you don’t see the uBO Scope icon or badge in your browser toolbar after installation, follow these steps:

1. **Verify Installation Success**
   - Open your browser's extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions`, `about:addons` in Firefox, or Safari Extensions menu).
   - Confirm that uBO Scope is installed and enabled.

2. **Pin/Show the Extension Icon**
   - In browsers like Chrome or Firefox, if the icon is hidden:
     - Click the extensions puzzle icon and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.
   - In Safari, check in the Safari Extensions preferences.

3. **Reload or Restart the Browser**
   - Sometimes a restart is necessary for the icon to appear.

4. **Confirm Permissions**
   - Ensure that the extension has permission to access the current tab and storage.
   - You can verify this from the extension details page.

<Note>
  If the extension appears disabled or permissions were not granted, re-enable it or reinstall addressing permission prompts.
</Note>

## 2. Popup Panel Does Not Load or Shows “NO DATA”

If clicking the uBO Scope icon opens the popup but the panel remains empty or displays 'NO DATA,' try the following:

1. **Ensure Active Tab is a Web Page**
   - The popup shows data for the active tab.
   - Ensure the active tab is a valid webpage (not a browser internal page like `chrome://settings/`).

2. **Refresh the Active Tab**
   - Sometimes the extension has not collected network data yet.
   - Reload the webpage to generate network requests.

3. **Wait a Few Seconds**
   - uBO Scope collects connection data asynchronously.
   - Give it a moment after page load for data to become available in the popup.

4. **Check Internet Connection**
   - Without internet, no network requests will be measured.

5. **Verify Extension Update Status**
   - If the extension is outdated, remove and reinstall from official stores:
     - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
     - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

<Warning>
  The popup cannot show data for tabs where the webRequest API does not track network requests (certain browser pages or web apps).
</Warning>

## 3. Toolbar Badge Shows No Count or Unexpected Numbers

The badge count reflects the number of unique third-party domains contacted.

If the count is always zero or seems unusually high:

1. **Confirm Network Activity**
   - Visit several popular websites that load resources from multiple domains.
   - The badge should increase accordingly.

2. **Verify Browser Compatibility and Version**
   - Ensure your browser meets minimum version requirements:
     - Chrome 122+
     - Firefox 128+
     - Safari 18.5+

3. **Check Extension Permissions**
   - Missing `webRequest` or `storage` permissions prevent data collection.

4. **Disable Conflicting Extensions Temporarily**
   - Extensions affecting network requests or blocking APIs might interfere.

5. **Check Browser Settings**
   - Some privacy settings or configurations disable the webRequest API or limit extension access.

<Info>
  A lower badge count generally means fewer distinct third-party connections, indicating better privacy exposure.

## 4. Extension Appears Inactive or Not Measuring Network Requests

If you suspect uBO Scope is not reporting network requests correctly:

1. **Reload the Browser and Reopen the Popup**

2. **Inspect Browser Extension Console**
   - For Chromium:
     - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
     - Enable 'Developer mode'
     - Click **Background page** or **Service worker** link
     - Check for errors or warning messages

   - For Firefox:
     - Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
     - Find uBO Scope and inspect background logs

3. **Look for Background Service Worker Eviction**
   - The extension’s background can be unloaded by the browser, which is normal.
   - When inactive, data collection pauses but resumes automatically when browsing.

4. **Reinstall the Extension**
   - Remove and reinstall from official browser stores to ensure clean installation.

## 5. Common Fixes and Tips

- **Clear Browser Cache and Restart**
  - Sometimes stale session data or corrupted cache can cause issues.

- **Check Network Restrictions**
  - If you’re behind VPNs, firewalls, or proxies, some network requests might be blocked or hidden.

- **Grant Storage Permissions**
  - Storage is necessary for session data persistence.

- **Keep Browser Updated**
  - Always use the latest stable browser version to avoid API incompatibilities.

- **Avoid Interfering with Content Blockers**
  - uBO Scope measures network requests independently but could be affected if content blockers heavily modify traffic.
