# Troubleshooting Setup Issues

This guide helps resolve common installation and first-run problems encountered with uBO Scope, such as the extension not appearing, the badge count not updating, or permission-related issues. Follow these practical steps to diagnose and fix setup problems quickly, ensuring uBO Scope runs smoothly and delivers full network connection transparency.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation and Activation

Before diving deeper, verify that uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled in your browser.

- **Check Extension Presence:**
  - Open your browser’s extension page:
    - Chrome/Chromium: `chrome://extensions/`
    - Firefox: `about:addons`
    - Safari: Preferences > Extensions
  - Look for 'uBO Scope' listed and ensure it is enabled.

- **Verify Toolbar Icon:**
  - The uBO Scope icon should be visible in the browser toolbar.
  - If hidden, use your browser’s toolbar customization to show the icon.

- **Reload the Browser:**
  - Sometimes restarting the browser ensures the extension fully activates.

<Note>
If you do not see uBO Scope in the extension list, reinstall it via the official browser extension store or follow the installation instructions in the documentation.
</Note>

## 2. Check Permissions and Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope requires specific permissions and minimum browser versions to function correctly.

- **Required Permissions:**
  - `activeTab` — Access to the active tab to monitor network requests.
  - `storage` — To save session data.
  - `webRequest` — To listen to network events.

- **Validate Permissions Granted:**
  - On the extension management page, confirm all required permissions are granted.
  - Some browsers allow granular permission management; ensure uBO Scope has access to relevant URLs.

- **Supported Browsers and Versions:**
  - Chrome and Chromium-based browsers, minimum version 122.
  - Firefox, minimum version 128.
  - Safari, minimum version 18.5.

Check that your browser meets these requirements.

<Warning>
Using older browser versions or unsupported browsers will lead to incomplete or no functionality.
</Warning>

## 3. Verify Badge Count and Popup Functionality

The badge count on the extension icon indicates how many distinct third-party domains have been connected to in the current tab.

- **Open a Website:**
  - Load a popular website that typically connects to third-party servers.

- **Check Badge Count:**
  - The badge should show a number reflecting active connections or remain empty if none.

- **Open Extension Popup:**
  - Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
  - Confirm that domains are listed under the categories: "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked".

- **No Data or "NO DATA" Displayed:**
  - Refresh the tab and popup.
  - Make sure the tab has completed loading or has active network requests.

<Tip>
If the badge never updates and the popup shows no data, the extension may not be correctly monitoring requests due to permissions or environment issues.
</Tip>

## 4. Common Issues and Diagnostic Steps

### Issue: Extension Not Appearing in Toolbar

- **Cause:** Extension may be disabled or hidden in the toolbar.
- **Solution:** Enable it via the Extensions page and unhide the icon using the browser’s toolbar settings.

### Issue: Badge Count Not Updating

- **Cause 1:** Permissions for `webRequest` or host access not granted.
- **Cause 2:** Browser version is incompatible or has bugs.
- **Diagnostic Step:**
  - Navigate to your browser’s permissions for the extension and verify access for HTTP/S and WebSocket URLs.
  - Test on different websites including both HTTP and HTTPS.
- **Solution:** Grant permissions and/or update your browser.

### Issue: Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Empty Data Sections

- **Cause:** Network requests are either not captured or session data is corrupted.
- **Diagnostic Step:**
  - Reload current tab.
  - Open a new tab and test on a website with active third-party connections.
  - Disable and re-enable the extension.
- **Solution:** Restart the browser and verify permissions.

### Issue: Extension Conflicts

- Having multiple content blockers or similar network-monitoring extensions can interfere with uBO Scope’s data.
- Consider temporarily disabling other extensions to isolate the issue.

## 5. Advanced Diagnostics Using Browser Console

For users comfortable with developer tools, you can check for extension errors or logs.

- Open Developer Tools (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
- Switch to the Console tab.
- Look for any errors or warnings related to uBO Scope.

Common errors might relate to storage access, message passing, or background script failures.

<Warning>
Do not ignore repeated or fatal errors; these indicate installation or compatibility problems needing correction.
</Warning>

## 6. Resetting uBO Scope Session Data

If persistent issues remain, resetting the extension's stored session data may help.

- **Manual Reset:**
  - Open your browser's extension storage viewer or use developer tools to clear uBO Scope's storage.

- **Programmatic Reset:**
  - Disable and re-enable the extension to clear session caches.

<Info>
Resetting will erase all recorded network connection data but will not affect installation or permissions.
</Info>
