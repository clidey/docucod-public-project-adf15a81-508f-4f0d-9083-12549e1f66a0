# Validating Your Installation

Quickly verify that uBO Scope is correctly capturing and displaying network connections for your active browser tabs. This guide walks you through triggering data collection by browsing websites, interpreting the toolbar badge count, and understanding the popup UI panels.

---

## 1. Triggering Data Capture

To ensure uBO Scope is actively monitoring network connections:

1. **Open your browser to any active tab.**
2. **Navigate to a website** by entering a URL or refreshing the current page.

This browsing activity causes network requests to be generated, which uBO Scope captures behind the scenes.

<Check>
If you do not see any activity reflected after browsing, confirm that the extension is installed and enabled following the [Extension Installation](../installation-basics/installation-instructions) guide.
</Check>

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count

The uBO Scope toolbar icon displays a numeric badge representing how many unique third-party domains successfully connected from the current webpage.

- **Badge shows a number:** Indicates the count of distinct allowed remote domain connections.
- **No badge (empty):** Means no successful connection has been recorded yet on the active tab.

This count excludes domains that were blocked or involved in stealth blocking.

For deeper insight on this, see [Understanding the Toolbar Badge](../../overview/introduction-and-value/badge-count-meaning).

## 3. Interpreting the Popup Interface

Clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon opens the popup panel presenting detailed connection outcomes for the active tab:

### Hostname Display

- At the top, the **hostname of the active tab** is prominently displayed.
- If the hostname consists of a subdomain, it is shown separately for clarity.

### Summary Section

- Shows the total number of distinct domains connected (allowed) for the current tab.

### Outcome Sections

The popup is divided into three distinct sections to categorize connection outcomes:

| Section          | Description                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Not blocked**  | Domains with successful network connections. |
| **Stealth-blocked** | Domains where requests were redirected stealthily, hiding their presence. |
| **Blocked**      | Domains where connections were explicitly blocked or failed.              |

Each section lists the domains alongside a small count badge representing the number of connection attempts.

### Domain Rows

- Each domain row shows:
  - The domain name (decoded to Unicode if internationalized).
  - The count of connection attempts.

- Domains are sorted for easier scanning.

<Note>
Domains are classified based on the effective top-level domain rules defined by the Public Suffix List to ensure accurate domain extraction.
</Note>

## 4. Step-by-Step Validation Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Active Tab in Browser">
Make sure your browser window is focused on the tab you want to validate.
</Step>
<Step title="Browse or Refresh a Website">
Navigate to a new URL or refresh the current page to trigger network activity that uBO Scope can capture.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe Toolbar Badge">
Look at the uBO Scope toolbar icon; a numeric badge should appear reflecting active third-party domain connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Open Popup Panel">
Click the toolbar icon to open the popup displaying detailed network connection outcomes.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Sections and Domain Counts">
Verify that the popup shows the hostname, connection summary, and categorized lists of "Not blocked", "Stealth-blocked", and "Blocked" domains with counts.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or empty domains after following these steps, re-check the extension installation or tab permissions as outlined in the [Extension Installation](../installation-basics/installation-instructions) and [Troubleshooting Installation Issues](../first-use-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues) guides.
</Check>

## 5. Tips and Best Practices

- **Use popular websites:** For robust testing, browse commonly visited websites with multiple third-party elements (e.g., news or social media sites).
- **Reload tabs:** If the badge count doesn’t update, try refreshing the tab to restart activity logging.
- **Close unused tabs:** uBO Scope tracks data per tab; closing and reopening tabs can reset connection data.

## 6. Common Issues & How to Recognize Them

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Problems">
<Accordion title="No Badge Count Appears">
- Verify that the extension is enabled.
- Ensure your browser supports required permissions (see [Prerequisites & System Requirements](../installation-basics/prerequisites-system-requirements)).
- Confirm you’re on a supported browser version.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA'">
- Refresh the page to generate new network activity.
- Switch to a tab with active browsing activity.
- Check for extension conflicts that might block network event capture.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains Not Updating Even After Browsing">
- Check network connectivity.
- Restart your browser.
- Try visiting different websites to ensure network traffic.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Visual Reference of Popup Panel

Here is an example layout of the popup interface to help visualize the described components:

```
+-------------------------------------------------
| Hostname: example subdomain.example.com          |
|                                                 |
| Domains connected: 25                            |
|                                                 |
| Not blocked                                    |
|  - domain1.com (5)                             |
|  - domain2.net (3)                             |
|                                                 |
| Stealth-blocked                                |
|  - stealth1.com (2)                            |
|                                                 |
| Blocked                                        |
|  - blocked1.org (1)                            |
+-------------------------------------------------
```

This UI presents a clear summary of real-time network connection statuses for your current tab.
