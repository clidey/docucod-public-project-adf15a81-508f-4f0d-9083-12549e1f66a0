# First Run & Quick Validation

This guide helps you confirm that uBO Scope is properly installed, active, and reporting network data as intended. It walks you through locating the extension icon, pinning it for easy access, interpreting the toolbar badge, and understanding the popup interface for immediate insights into third-party connections on the current browser tab.

---

## 1. Confirming uBO Scope Is Active in Your Browser

### Step 1: Locate and Pin the uBO Scope Icon

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's extension toolbar, usually near the address bar.
- The icon uses the distinct uBO Scope logo (as shown below):

  ![uBO Scope Icon](img/browsericons/logo32.png)

- If you do not see the icon immediately:
  - Click the extension menu (puzzle piece icon) in the toolbar.
  - Find uBO Scope in the list.
  - Click the pin icon next to it to make it visible at all times.

<Tip>
Pinning the extension icon ensures you have quick access to uBO Scope's popup and can constantly monitor your third-party connections.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Observe the Toolbar Badge Count

- Once active, uBO Scope shows a numeric badge on its icon that represents the **number of distinct third-party remote servers currently connected to on the active tab**.
- A higher number means more distinct connections; a lower number generally indicates fewer third-party requests, which could be more privacy-friendly.

<Info>
The badge count reflects only successful, active connections to third-party domains, not total requests or blocked attempts.
</Info>

### Step 3: Click the Icon to Open the Popup Interface

- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup window.
- The popup shows a summary and detailed lists of domains connected, categorized by their outcome:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Connections permitted and established.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections that were redirected or silently altered.
  - **Blocked**: Connections that were explicitly blocked.

- The top header shows the active tab's hostname and its base domain for context.

## 2. Interpreting the Popup UI for Your First Tab Analysis

### What You See in the Popup

- **Domains Connected**: Total count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Sections with Lists**: Each outcome category lists domain names with counts of connections.

### Using the Popup to Validate Functionality

- If you see counts populating in the **not blocked** section and the domain names updating, uBO Scope is properly tracking network activity.
- If all counts remain at zero or show *NO DATA*, ensure you have browsing activity on the current tab or try reloading the page.

<Tip>
Reload the active tab or visit a site with rich third-party content (e.g., news sites, social media) to trigger network requests and observe updates.
</Tip>
