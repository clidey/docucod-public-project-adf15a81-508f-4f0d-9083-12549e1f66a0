# Quick Start: See uBO Scope in Action

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with **uBO Scope**. This quick start guide will walk you through opening a popular website to observe uBO Scope’s badge behavior and popup panel, confirming that the extension accurately reports third-party network activity in real time.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before we dive in, ensure you have completed the following:

- **uBO Scope is installed and enabled** in your web browser.
  - See [Installing uBO Scope](../../getting-started/installation-setup/installation-instructions) for detailed steps.
- Your browser version meets the minimum requirements.
  - See [System Requirements](../../getting-started/installation-setup/system-requirements).
- You have a stable internet connection to load real websites.

<Check>
If this is your very first launch, review [First Launch & Basic Configuration](../../getting-started/installation-setup/first-launch-setup) to understand permissions and toolbar badge basics.
</Check>

## 2. Open a Popular Website

To see uBO Scope in action, we need to trigger real-world network requests.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to a Well-Known Site">
Open your browser and load a popular website such as https://www.wikipedia.org or https://www.nytimes.com.

This will cause multiple network requests, some originating from the main website and others from third-party domains.
</Step>

<Step title="Watch the Toolbar Badge"> 
Look at the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. 

- You should see a **badge number** indicating the count of distinct third-party domains connected to by that site.
- Remember, a **lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, which usually means better privacy exposure**.

If the badge is empty or missing, confirm the extension is active and you have permission to monitor network requests.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.

The panel will display:
- The main domain of the active tab’s webpage
- Summarized counts of connected third-party domains grouped by their network request outcomes:
  - `not blocked` (allowed connections)
  - `stealth-blocked` (connections subtly redirected or modified)
  - `blocked` (connections that were blocked)

This live summary helps you understand which hosts your browser communicates with during web navigation.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Understanding What You See

- **Tab Hostname & Domain**: At the popup’s top, the webpage hostname appears, showing the exact host and its base domain.
- **Domains Connected**: The count under "domains connected" indicates total unique third-party domains contacted.
- **Outcome Sections**:
  - "not blocked" shows connections that succeeded.
  - "stealth-blocked" shows requests that were redirected or modified stealthily.
  - "blocked" shows third-party domains where network requests were blocked by your content blocker or system.

Each section lists domains and the number of requests made.

<Tip>
Use the popup to compare how different websites behave and see how your content blocking rules or privacy settings impact third-party connections.
</Tip>

## 4. Verify uBO Scope Is Working Correctly

Use the following validation checklist:

- The toolbar badge number updates after loading a webpage.
- The popup panel’s hostname matches the active webpage.
- Domains are grouped visibly under "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked."
- Counts shown beside each domain match the request frequency.

<Warning>
If the badge remains blank and the popup shows "NO DATA," verify:
- The extension is enabled (not disabled or blocked by another extension).
- Browser permissions to intercept web requests are granted.
- You are browsing HTTP/HTTPS or WebSocket sites (uBO Scope listens to network protocols starting with http(s) and ws(s)).
- Content blockers or privacy settings in your browser do not completely mask network requests from the WebRequest API (this is uncommon in modern browsers).
</Warning>

<Accordion title="What if I see unexpected domains in the blocked or stealth-blocked sections?">
These are domains your content blocker or network configuration prevents connections to. Use this info to audit your privacy settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use uBO Scope alongside my content blocker?">
Yes, uBO Scope complements content blockers by reporting actual third-party connections regardless of the blocker in use.
