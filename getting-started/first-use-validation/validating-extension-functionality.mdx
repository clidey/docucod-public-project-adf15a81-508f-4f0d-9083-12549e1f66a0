# Validating Extension Functionality

This guide leads you through quick, practical tests to confirm that uBO Scope is accurately recording network connections from the browser, regardless of which content blocker you have enabled. You'll learn how to use the extension’s popup interface to verify that both allowed and blocked connections are reported correctly, ensuring the extension's monitoring works as expected.

---

## 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup

To start, open the uBO Scope popup while you are browsing an active webpage:

1. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup will appear, summarizing the network connection information for the active tab.

Expected Result:

- The popup header shows the current tab’s hostname and domain.
- Sections are labeled **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
- Each section lists domains contacted with counts of requests.
- The summary shows the total number of distinct connected domains.

<Tip>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty lists, reload the webpage and open the popup again. The extension needs to capture network requests during the page load to display data.
</Tip>


## 2. Confirming Allowed Connections

The **not blocked** section displays domains from which network requests were successful and allowed by the content blocker.

Steps:

1. Visit a popular website with content loading from multiple domains (e.g., a news site).
2. Open the uBO Scope popup.
3. Review the list under the **not blocked** heading.

Expected Outcome:

- You will see several third-party domains listed with their respective request counts.
- This list corresponds to domains your browser contacted successfully while loading the page.

<Tip>
A lower count of allowed third-party domains is typically better for privacy. However, some legitimate services (like CDNs) will normally appear here.
</Tip>

## 3. Inspecting Blocked and Stealth-Blocked Connections

uBO Scope categorizes blocking outcomes into two: **blocked** and **stealth-blocked**.

- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked by your content blocker.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections that were silently redirected or prevented without typical block signals.

Steps:

1. Make sure your content blocker is active and configured with blocking rules.
2. Visit a webpage known to load ads or trackers.
3. Open the uBO Scope popup.
4. Check the **blocked** and **stealth-blocked** sections.

Expected Outcome:

- Domains present under these sections indicate that the extension is detecting when requests are blocked or stealth-blocked.
- Counts next to domains show how many requests were affected.

<Tip>
Seeing domains in **blocked** or **stealth-blocked** confirms that the extension is accurately measuring requests regardless of your blocker.
</Tip>

## 4. Using the Toolbar Badge for Quick Verification

The uBO Scope toolbar icon badge displays the number of distinct third-party domains contacted (allowed connections).

Steps:

1. Observe the badge number while browsing.
2. Click the extension icon and compare the badge count to the number shown in the popup summary.

Expected Result:

- The badge's number should match the count of domains listed as **not blocked**.
- If the badge is missing or incorrect, it may indicate the extension is not functioning or the tab data is unavailable.

<Warning>
Browser restrictions or session issues can delay or prevent badge updates. Try refreshing the tab or restarting the browser if inconsistencies occur.
</Warning>

## 5. Performing a Real-World Test

To validate comprehensive functionality:

1. Disable all content blockers except uBO Scope.
2. Visit a frequently updated news or social website.
3. Open the popup and observe all connection outcomes populated.
4. Enable another content blocker and reload the page.
5. Confirm that blocked and stealth-blocked domains list changes accordingly in the popup.

This test shows uBO Scope operates independently and transparently alongside other blockers.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Guide">
<Accordion title="No Data or 'NO DATA' Shown in Popup">
- Ensure the tab is active and fully loaded.
- Reload the webpage and re-open the popup.
- Check extension permissions to confirm the `webRequest` and `activeTab` permissions are granted.
- Restart the browser if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Toolbar Badge Missing or Incorrect">
- Verify the extension is enabled and running.
- Refresh the active tab.
- Confirm no conflicting extensions prevent badge updates.
- Wait a few seconds; badge updates may be deferred.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Blocked or Allowed Sections Are Empty">
- Visit websites known to load third-party content.
- Ensure other content blockers are properly enabled and configured to block ads or trackers.
- Confirm uBO Scope is active in the correct browser profile or container.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding What You See

- **Hostname and Domain:** The popup header breaks down the exact hostname of the active tab and its base domain.
- **Domains Lists:** Grouped by outcome — what connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- **Request Counts:** Each domain entry shows how many requests were made during the tab session.
- **Summary:** A total listing of distinct third-party domains contacted, helping you gauge network reach.
