# First-Time Configuration & Permissions

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through the first-run experience, explains the permissions you'll need to grant, describes what you can expect as default behavior, and helps you verify that the extension is correctly installed and ready to reveal your browser's remote server connections.

---

## 1. Understanding the Permissions Prompt

When you install uBO Scope for the first time, your browser will prompt you to grant the extension specific permissions. These permissions are essential for the extension to track all network connections your browser attempts during web browsing.

### Permissions Requested:
- **Access to active tab**: Allows uBO Scope to read details about the currently active tab to report its outgoing connections.
- **Storage**: Lets the extension save session data securely, preserving the connection report with each tab.
- **webRequest**: Enables monitoring of web and WebSocket requests in real-time, which is crucial to accurately detect remote server connections.

### What These Mean for You
These permissions ensure uBO Scope fully captures connection attempts, even those blocked or stealthily redirected by your content blockers. This results in an accurate, real-time report of all third-party servers your browser interacts with.

<Tip>
Granting these permissions does **not** give uBO Scope access to your browsing data beyond network connection metadata. The extension focuses exclusively on domains contacted by your browser tabs.
</Tip>

## 2. Default Behavior on First Launch

When you first enable uBO Scope, it will begin monitoring active tabs immediately without requiring additional setup.

- The extension starts fresh with no cached data.
- Your browser’s tabs will be observed for all remote server connections.
- The extension icon will appear in your browser toolbar, ready for you to click and open the popup report.

At this stage, no manual configuration is necessary. The extension leverages default host permissions applicable to all HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket URLs.

<Note>
The extension supports major browsers including Chrome (version 122+), Firefox (128+), and Safari (18.5+). Ensure your browser meets these minimum versions for optimal operation.
</Note>

## 3. Verifying the Extension Icon in Your Browser

Successful installation and permission granting will display the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. Here’s how you can confirm:

### Google Chrome / Chromium-based browsers
1. Look for the uBO Scope icon (a shield-like symbol) near the address bar, typically alongside other extensions.
2. If not visible, click the Extensions puzzle icon and pin uBO Scope for easy access.

### Mozilla Firefox
1. The uBO Scope icon appears on the right side of the address bar.
2. If you don’t see it, open the Extensions panel (`about:addons`) and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.

### Safari
1. Check Safari’s toolbar customization to add the uBO Scope icon if it’s not visible.
2. The icon confirms the extension is enabled and monitoring network connections.

<Check>
If you cannot find the icon after installation, ensure the extension is enabled and that you have granted all requested permissions.
</Check>

## 4. What to Expect When You Click the uBO Scope Icon

Clicking the toolbar icon opens the extension popup (`popup.html`), which reports:

- The current tab's hostname and public domain
- Counts of domains connected during the tab's session
- Lists of "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked" domains based on network request outcomes

The popup dynamically updates as you browse, reflecting real-time network activities.

### Key UI Elements:
- **Hostname display**: Shows the tab's actual hostname along with its registrable domain
- **Summary**: Total distinct domains connected
- **Outcome sections**: Separate lists for allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains

This immediate feedback helps you understand your actual exposure to third-party connections.

## 5. Troubleshooting First-Time Setup Issues

If you experience problems, try the following steps:

### Missing Permissions Prompt
- Make sure your browser settings allow extensions to request the needed permissions.
- Try reloading the extension or reinstalling it from the official browser store.

### The Icon Doesn't Appear
- Confirm the extension is enabled in the browser's extension manager.
- Restart your browser to refresh the extension state.

### No Data Shown in Popup
- Ensure you have visited secure or non-local web pages (e.g., `https://example.com`) so the extension can detect connections.
- Reload the active tab and open the popup again.

### Browser Compatibility
- Check your browser version meets the minimal requirements:
  - Chrome 122 or newer
  - Firefox 128 or newer
  - Safari 18.5 or newer

### Persistent Issues
- Visit the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/wiki/Troubleshooting-Common-Setup-Issues) page for detailed help.
