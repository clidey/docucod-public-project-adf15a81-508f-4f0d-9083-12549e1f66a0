## 3. Confirming the Installation

To ensure uBO Scope is installed correctly:

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. It uses a distinctive logo with a small shield and magnifying glass.
- Click the icon to open the popup panel, which initially may display messages like “NO DATA” until network activity is captured.
- If the icon is not visible, check your browser’s extensions menu or pin the extension to the toolbar.


## 4. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<Tip>
If installation fails or uBO Scope does not appear in your toolbar:
- Ensure your browser is updated to the minimum supported version (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+).
- Verify you have a stable internet connection during installation.
- Restart your browser after installing the extension.
- Check browser extension settings or permissions if the icon remains hidden.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Installing from stores outside the official Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons page is not supported and may compromise security or functionality.
