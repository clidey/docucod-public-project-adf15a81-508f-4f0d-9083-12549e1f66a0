# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

To use uBO Scope effectively, it is crucial to ensure your environment meets the minimum system and browser requirements, and that you are aware of the necessary permissions and platform support. This page details the foundational prerequisites so you can confidently prepare your system for installation and usage.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension with broad compatibility across major browsers, currently supporting:

- **Google Chrome (and Chromium-based browsers)**
- **Mozilla Firefox**

Support for other browsers like Safari exists but may require specific versions and settings.

### Browser Version Requirements

| Browser          | Minimum Version             |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Google Chrome    | Version 122.0 or newer       |
| Mozilla Firefox  | Version 128.0 or newer       |
| Safari           | Version 18.5 or newer (experimental)

> Browsers earlier than these versions do not support the WebExtension APIs or permissions that uBO Scope requires to function correctly.

## 2. Permissions Required

### Essential Permissions

To monitor and report network connections accurately, uBO Scope requires the following permissions:

- **`webRequest`**: Allows uBO Scope to listen to and analyze all network requests made by webpages, including their outcomes.
- **`activeTab`**: Grants access to read details of the active browser tab, linking network requests to specific tabs.
- **`storage`**: Enables persistent storage of session data and settings.

### Host Permissions

uBO Scope requests permission to access all HTTP and WebSocket URLs:

```json
"host_permissions": [
  "https://*/*",
  "http://*/*",
  "wss://*/*",
  "ws://*/*"
]
```

This broad host access is necessary to track all network connections made from webpages across these protocols.

> Note: The permissions and host permissions are specified in the browser extension manifests and must be approved during installation.

## 3. Operating Systems & Environment

uBO Scope runs inside modern web browsers. As such, it inherits the compatibility from the browser itself. It supports all operating systems compatible with the browsers above, including:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Android (via Firefox Nightly or compatible browsers supporting required APIs)

Use the latest stable browser versions on your OS to maximize compatibility.

## 4. Network & Security Considerations

- Ensure your network environment does not block WebSocket or HTTP requests needed for browsing.
- Firewall or proxy configurations should allow the browser full network access for uBO Scope to capture all traffic.

## 5. Browser Feature Dependencies

uBO Scope relies primarily on browser support for:

- The **`webRequest` API**, which allows interception and monitoring of network requests.
- **WebExtension background service workers or scripts** to process requests continuously.
- **Browser action UI elements** for displaying badges and popup windows.

These features are supported starting from the browser versions listed above.

## 6. Summary of Minimum Requirements

| Requirement                      | Details                                   |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Browser                        | Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+ |
| Permissions                   | webRequest, activeTab, storage             |
| Network Access                | Unrestricted HTTP(s) and WebSocket access |
| Operating Systems             | Any OS supported by target browsers       |

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- If the extension fails to install or operate, verify browser version and update if needed.
- Ensure permissions are granted fully at installation to avoid incomplete network data.
- Some browsers may require manual enabling of the `webRequest` API or extension settings.
- If you encounter missing data, check for conflicting extensions or security policies blocking access.
