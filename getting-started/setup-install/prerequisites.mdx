# Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

Ensure your system and browser meet the minimum requirements before installing uBO Scope. This page helps you verify compatibility by detailing supported browsers, necessary permissions, and critical notes that must be addressed for a smooth installation and usage experience.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers & Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a lightweight browser extension that monitors and displays all remote server connections your browser initiates. It currently supports the following browsers with minimum version requirements:

- **Google Chrome (Chromium-based browsers)**: Version 122.0 or later
- **Mozilla Firefox (Desktop & Android)**: Version 128.0 or later
- **Apple Safari**: Version 18.5 or later


| Browser       | Minimum Version | Notes                              |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Google Chrome | 122.0+          | Requires Manifest V3 support      |
| Firefox       | 128.0+          | Includes Android compatible builds|
| Safari        | 18.5+           | WebExtension with Safari-specific settings |

> Browsers older than these versions do not support the necessary APIs uBO Scope leverages, so installation or proper functioning may fail.


## 2. Required Permissions

To capture and report connection data, uBO Scope requests the following browser permissions during installation:

- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to access information about the currently active tab.
- **storage**: Enables saving session and configuration data persistently.
- **webRequest**: Grants access to observe and analyze web requests your browser performs.

Additionally, the extension requires **host permissions** scoped to all HTTP(S) and WebSocket URLs:

- `http://*/*`
- `https://*/*`
- `ws://*/*` *(Firefox and Chromium only)*
- `wss://*/*` *(Firefox and Chromium only)*

> These permissions allow uBO Scope to observe network connections broadly, capturing all web requests made by the browser on pages you visit.


## 3. System Requirements

While uBO Scope is lightweight, ensure your system is running one of the supported browsers on an operating system supported by that browser. There are no explicit memory or disk requirements beyond what modern browsers typically need.


## 4. Important Notes Before Installation

- uBO Scope relies heavily on the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network activity. Some browsers or future versions may change or restrict this API, which can impact the extension's capabilities.

- On browsers that restrict `webRequest` access or do not provide permissions for WebSocket URLs, connection tracking for WebSocket traffic may not be available.

- For Safari, the minimum version requirement is strict due to the differences in WebExtension support compared to other browsers.

- You cannot expect full network visibility on platforms or browsers that do not expose network requests through the `webRequest` API.

- Network requests made outside the browser's scope (e.g., system DNS, other apps) will not be captured.

 
## 5. Verifying Compatibility

Before proceeding to the installation, verify your platform compatibility with these quick checks:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Version">
Open your browser's "About" or "Help" section and confirm the version is equal or higher than the required minimum (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
</Step>
<Step title="Permissions Availability">
Start installing the extension and verify that it requests the permissions listed above. If your browser warns about unsupported permissions, compatibility may be limited.
</Step>
<Step title="Network Connection Access">
Confirm that your browser allows access to the `webRequest` API by using developer tools or similar extensions.
</Step>
<Step title="WebSocket Support (Optional)">
Note that on some platforms, WebSocket capture may be unavailable due to API restrictions.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 6. Next Steps

Once you have confirmed your system and browser meet the criteria outlined here, proceed to the [Installing uBO-Scope](https://your-docs-domain/getting-started/setup-install/install-browser) guide to download and install the extension.

After installation, you can continue to the [Launching the Extension](https://your-docs-domain/getting-started/first-run-usage/launch-extension) page to start exploring its features.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Extension Fails to Install or Enable**:
  - Verify your browser version.
  - Ensure your browser is up to date.
  - Check for conflicting extensions that might block `webRequest` access.

- **Missing Permissions Prompt**:
  - Some browsers can disable extensions without proper permissions. Try reinstalling or updating your browser.

- **No Data After Installation**:
  - Confirm you have visited web pages with network activity.
  - Reload the active tabs or restart your browser.

- **WebSocket Connections Not Tracked**:
  - Some browsers restrict tracking WebSocket traffic; confirm if your browser supports this.
