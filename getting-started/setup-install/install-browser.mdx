# Installing uBO-Scope

This guide provides direct, actionable instructions to install uBO-Scope on your preferred browser platform: **Chrome (Chromium-based), Firefox, or Safari**. Follow the steps below to add this privacy-focused extension with confidence and start monitoring your remote server connections immediately.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

Make sure your browser version meets the minimum requirements for uBO-Scope:

| Browser           | Minimum Version |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Google Chrome / Chromium | 122.0+         |
| Firefox           | 128.0+          |
| Safari            | 18.5+           |

uBO-Scope relies on the `webRequest` API support available in these versions to report network connections accurately.

<Tip>
If you are unsure of your browser version, check the "About" section in your browser settings and upgrade if necessary before continuing.
</Tip>

## 2. Review Required Permissions

uBO-Scope requires certain permissions to function correctly:

- **activeTab**: Access to the current active tab for monitoring network requests.
- **storage**: To save session data and load the Public Suffix List for domain parsing.
- **webRequest**: To listen for and report remote server connection outcomes.

Additionally, uBO-Scope requests host permissions for matching URLs such as:
- `https://*/*` and `http://*/*` (all web requests), and
- For Firefox and Chromium: also WebSocket URLs (`ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*`).

<Info>
These permissions are essential to provide precise tracking of network connections initiated by your browser during web browsing.

## 5. Troubleshooting Installation Issues

If installation does not proceed as expected, consider the following:

- **Browser version too low**: Confirm your browser meets the minimum version stated above.
- **Permissions denied**: Ensure you accept all requested permissions during installation.
- **Icon not visible**: In some browsers, you may need to pin or enable the extension explicitly from the extensions page.
- **Conflicts with other extensions**: Temporarily disable other extensions that manage network or privacy to test for interference.

<Accordion title="Common Problems and Fixes">

**Problem:** Extension icon missing after install

**Solution:** Open your browser's Extensions or Add-ons page and pin the uBO-Scope icon to the toolbar.
