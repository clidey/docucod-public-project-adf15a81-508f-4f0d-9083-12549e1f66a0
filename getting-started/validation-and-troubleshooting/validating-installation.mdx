# Validating Your uBO Scope Setup

Ensuring uBO Scope is working correctly after installation is crucial to reliably monitor your browser’s network connections. This guide provides straightforward steps to confirm the extension actively tracks remote server connections without requiring deep technical knowledge or diagnostics.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation

Before validation, ensure uBO Scope is installed from an official source:

- **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.)**: Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
- **Firefox**: Install from [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
- **Safari**: Install from the official Safari Extensions Gallery.


<Tip>
Always verify you installed the extension from the appropriate official browser store to guarantee authentic, unaltered updates.
</Tip>

## 2. Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

Look for the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar. It uses the default icon set shown below:

- Smallest icon size is 16x16 pixels, scaling up to 128x128 pixels depending on your display.

Hover your cursor over the icon; it should display the tooltip 'uBO Scope'.

<Info>
If the icon is missing, check your browser's extension management page to confirm the extension is enabled.

## 3. Visit Popular Websites to Generate Network Activity

To verify uBO Scope is monitoring and reporting network connections:

1. Open a new browser tab.
2. Navigate to widely-used websites that load various third-party resources. Recommended examples:
   - https://www.wikipedia.org
   - https://www.nytimes.com
   - https://www.youtube.com

3. After the page is fully loaded, observe the badge count on the uBO Scope icon.

The badge number represents the count of distinct third-party remote domains connected for that tab.

<Tip>
Choose well-known sites with diverse content to generate meaningful third-party network requests and verify robust reporting.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Interpret the Badge Count

- **Non-zero Badge**: Indicates active network connections to one or more distinct remote third-party domains.
- **Zero or No Badge**: Means no third-party connections detected or extension is not monitoring properly.


<Callout>
Remember, a lower number of third-party connections is generally better for privacy.
</Callout>

## 5. Open the uBO Scope Popup for Detailed Summary

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
2. The popup window shows detailed domains categorized by: 
   - **Not Blocked:** Connections allowed.
   - **Stealth Blocked:** Connections silently redirected or stealth-blocked.
   - **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked.

3. Verify that the number of domains in the popup corresponds with the badge count.

<Note>
If you see ‘NO DATA’ or the popup appears unresponsive, reload the current tab or restart your browser and try again.
</Note>

---

## 6. Verify Functionality Across Multiple Tabs

Open additional tabs with different websites and observe:

- The badge count updates independently per tab.
- The popup reflects the current tab’s network connection details.

This confirms per-tab monitoring is functioning as intended.

## 8. Additional Validation Tips

- Use the browser’s Developer Tools Network panel concurrently to cross-check external connections; the domains uBO Scope reports should match or correlate.
- Test on multiple browsers if feasible to ensure consistent behavior.
- Understand that uBO Scope reports only connections visible via the browser’s webRequest API.
