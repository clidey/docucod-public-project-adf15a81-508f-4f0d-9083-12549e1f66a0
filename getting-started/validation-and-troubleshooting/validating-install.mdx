## How to Confirm uBO Scope Is Active and Working

After installing uBO Scope and completing initial setup, validating its operation helps you gain confidence that your privacy monitoring tool is functioning correctly.

### 1. Check the Toolbar Icon

- **Locate the uBO Scope extension icon** in your browser toolbar. It displays the extension's logo.
- **Observe the badge count** on the icon. The badge number represents the count of distinct third-party remote domains your current tab is connecting to.

  - If you see a **non-empty badge count**, it confirms that uBO Scope is actively monitoring and recording network requests.
  - If the badge is **empty or missing**, uBO Scope might not be capturing any data, which could indicate an issue.

### 2. Interpret the Badge Count

- The badge count shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected to by the active tab.
- A **lower badge count is preferable**, indicating fewer external connections.
- Remember, uBO Scope reports connections regardless of any content blocker in place; this number reflects real network activity.

<Tip>
The badge count is a key indicator of the extension’s monitoring performance. Seeing a number means uBO Scope is actively analyzing your web traffic.
</Tip>

### 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup UI

- Click the toolbar icon to open the popup dashboard.
- The popup displays:

  - **Current tab hostname** at the top — the webpage being analyzed.
  - **Domains connected:** a summary count matching the badge.
  - Categorized sections showing third-party domains under:
    - **Not blocked (allowed)**
    - **Stealth-blocked** (network requests redirected or hidden)
    - **Blocked** (requests blocked by content blockers or errors)

### 4. Verify Session Data in the Popup

- Review each category to see if domains are populated.
- This detailed data confirms uBO Scope is successfully tracking and categorizing network outcomes.

<Check>
If all sections are empty or the popup shows 'NO DATA', this indicates uBO Scope is not capturing session network data correctly.
</Check>

### 5. Perform a Simple Network Activity Test

- Navigate to a popular, media-rich website (e.g., a news site).
- Watch the badge count increase as the page loads.
- Open the popup and observe the domains categorized.
- This real-world activity ensures uBO Scope is monitoring network requests across tabs.

### 6. Troubleshooting Quick Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Checks for Validation Issues">
<Accordion title="Extension Icon Missing or Not Responding">
- Ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your browser’s extension manager.
- Restart your browser to reload the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Appear">

- Check content blocker conflicts or browser permission restrictions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Displays NO DATA or Empty Lists">
- Reload the current page and open popup again.
- Verify the extension has all required permissions (see installation prerequisites).
