# Troubleshooting Common Issues

Welcome to the troubleshooting guide for uBO Scope. This section provides practical solutions and actionable advice to resolve common issues users may face, such as missing badge counts, unresponsive popup UI, failed permissions, or a lack of network request data. Follow these steps to quickly diagnose and fix problems to get your extension running smoothly.

---

## 1. Badge Count Not Showing or Not Updating

The toolbar badge reflects the number of distinct third-party domains connected during the current tab session. If the badge is missing or not updating:

### Check Browser Compatibility
- Confirm you are using a supported browser and version. uBO Scope requires:
  - Chrome 122+ or Chromium-based browsers
  - Firefox 128+
  - Safari 18.5+

### Verify Extension Permissions
- uBO Scope requires `activeTab`, `storage`, and especially `webRequest` permissions.
- Ensure you accepted the permissions prompt on first run.

### Restart the Browser or Reload the Extension
- Sometimes the background service may not initialize properly.
- Restart your browser or manually reload the extension from your browser’s extension management page.

### Confirm Monitoring Is Active
- The extension listens for network events only on tabs with active monitoring.
- Open the popup dashboard to see if domain data is listed. If empty, monitoring may not be running.

### Interference from Other Extensions
- Some extensions or browser settings might block or restrict access to network requests.
- Try disabling other content blockers temporarily to isolate the issue.


## 2. Popup UI Is Blank or Shows "NO DATA"

The popup dashboard should display a categorized connection summary for the active tab. If it appears empty:

### Ensure You Have an Active Tab with Network Activity
- uBO Scope reports connections only for the currently active tab.
- Switch to a tab with active webpage content and reload it.

### Check for JavaScript Errors
- Open your browser’s developer console on the popup (usually by right-clicking the popup and choosing “Inspect”).
- Look for errors related to `popup.js` or failures in messaging the background script.

### Ensure Background Script Is Running
- If `background.js` is stopped or crashed, the popup cannot retrieve data.
- Reload the extension or restart the browser to restore background script functionality.


## 3. Extension Fails to Acquire Necessary Permissions

Without proper permissions, uBO Scope cannot report network requests.

### Accept Permissions Prompt
- On first install and run, browsers will prompt for required permissions.
- Confirm all requested permissions to enable extension functionality.

### Check Browser Policy Restrictions
- In some environments (e.g., corporate or managed devices), permission prompts may be blocked.
- Consult your administrator or test on a personal device.

### Reinstall the Extension
- If permissions got rejected or corrupted, uninstall and reinstall uBO Scope.
- Follow the official installation guides carefully.


## 4. No Network Request Data Is Shown or Recorded

If the extension’s popup or badge shows zero connections, but you suspect network activity:

### Confirm Website Uses Supported Protocols
- uBO Scope monitors HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS protocols.
- Network activity using other protocols or outside browser context won’t be tracked.

### Disable Privacy Features Blocking Extensions
- Some privacy settings or browser flags can prevent extensions from accessing network requests.

### Verify Content Blocker Compatibility
- uBO Scope works alongside other blockers but depends on `webRequest` API data.
- If you use DNS-based blocking or other stealth filters, certain requests may not be visible through `webRequest`.

### Test With Known Active Sites
- Open sites with known many third-party requests, such as content-heavy news or media websites.
- Reload the tab and observe the popup and badge.


## 5. Common Quick Fixes and Tips

- **Reload the Active Tab:** Sometimes tab reloads trigger capture of network requests.
- **Open the Popup After Tab Refresh:** This forces the extension to fetch fresh data from the background.
- **Clear Browser Cache:** Cached resources might bypass network listening.
- **Check Extension Version:** Ensure using the latest stable version.

<Tip>
Troubleshooting often starts with verifying permissions and reloading the extension. Ensuring you are on an active tab with network requests is critical to seeing meaningful data.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Do not rely on network data from pages with no third-party requests or heavily cached content. This will appear as no activity in uBO Scope.
</Warning>
