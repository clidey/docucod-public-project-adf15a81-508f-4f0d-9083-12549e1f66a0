# Common Issues & Quick Fixes

This page provides practical solutions to frequent problems users may encounter while using uBO Scope. If you face issues such as missing badge counts, the extension not appearing, or permissions errors, follow the steps below to quickly diagnose and resolve them. When problems persist, clear next steps and support options are provided.

---

## 1. Badge Count Not Showing or Always Empty

### Cause:
- The badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party domains connected by the active tab. If the count is missing or always empty, it often means the extension isn't receiving network request data properly.

### Fix Steps:
<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Extension is Enabled and Installed Correctly">
- Confirm that uBO Scope appears in your browser's extensions list and is enabled.
- For Chromium browsers, visit `chrome://extensions`.
- For Firefox, visit `about:addons`.
- For Safari, verify in Safari Extensions preferences.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload the Current Tab">
- Reload the webpage you are testing to trigger network request tracking.
- Badge counts update on network events after page reload.
- If you navigate to different websites, observe if the badge updates accordingly.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Browser Permissions and Version">
- Ensure your browser version meets the minimum required: Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+.
- Confirm the extension has requested proper permissions: `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
- If prompted by the browser for permissions, accept them.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If you use private/incognito mode, make sure the extension is enabled to run in incognito/private windows.
</Note>

## 2. Extension Icon Not Visible in Toolbar

### Cause:
- Extension may be installed but its icon is hidden in the browser UI.

### Fix Steps:
<Steps>
<Step title="Check Toolbar Overflow or Extension Menu">
- On Chromium and Firefox, extensions may be accessible from an extension dropdown menu near the address bar. Open it and pin uBO Scope for easy access.
</Step>
<Step title="Pin uBO Scope in Browser Toolbar">
- For Chromium, click the puzzle-piece icon, find uBO Scope, and click the pin icon to show it in the toolbar.
- For Firefox, right-click the toolbar area, choose Customize Toolbar, and drag uBO Scope icon to the toolbar.
</Step>
<Step title="Restart Browser if Needed">
- Restarting the browser after installation can help the extension icon appear.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Permissions Errors or Blocked Access to Network Events

### Cause:
- The extension requires network permissions to monitor requests (e.g., `webRequest` API access).
- Restrictions or misconfigurations can prevent these permissions from being granted or used correctly.

### Fix Steps:
<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Manifest Permissions">
- The extension’s manifest declares required permissions including `webRequest` and host permissions for `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, and `ws://*/*`.
- Ensure that your browser did not block or disable these permissions.
</Step>
<Step title="Check for Conflicting Extensions or Policies">
- Disable other extensions that may interfere with webRequest or browser permissions.
- If on a managed device, confirm no policies block extensions from accessing network data.
</Step>
<Step title="Reinstall or Update the Extension">
- Uninstall and reinstall uBO Scope from the official browser stores.
- Make sure you are running the latest version (at least v1.0.1).
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Certain browser security or privacy configurations might block access to some network data.
</Warning>

## 4. Data Not Updating or Stuck on Previous Results

### Cause:
- The extension caches session data and may sometimes have outdated information.

### Quick Fix:
<Steps>
<Step title="Reload Webpage and Extension Popup">
- Reload the browser tab you want to analyze.
- Close and reopen the uBO Scope popup to refresh the data display.
</Step>
<Step title="Clear Extension Data Cache">
- Although automatic, if problems persist, try restarting the browser to clear temporary session data.
- The extension stores session data locally but manages it automatically.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Extension Interface Shows "NO DATA"

### Cause:
- This indicates uBO Scope could not gather data for the active tab.

### Troubleshooting:
- Verify the active tab is a normal website (not a browser internal page such as `chrome://` or `about:`), since these cannot be monitored.
- Refresh the page.
- Confirm the extension’s toolbar icon badge is not showing as empty.
