## 1. Badge Count Missing or Not Updating

The badge count on the toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected during webpage browsing. If you do not see this count or it doesn't update properly, follow these checks:

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Verify Extension Permissions**
   - Ensure the extension has the required permissions: `webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab`.
   - To check permissions:
     - Chrome/Edge: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, find uBO Scope, and click `Details`. Ensure all host permissions (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) are granted.
     - Firefox: Go to `about:addons`, find uBO Scope, and review permissions.

2. **Reload the Extension**
   - Disable and then re-enable the extension.
   - Alternatively, remove and reinstall it using the official extension store links.

3. **Browser Version Compatibility**
   - Confirm your browser meets minimum requirements:
     - Chrome 122+
     - Firefox 128+
     - Safari 18.5+

4. **Check for Conflicting Extensions or Settings**
   - Some privacy or network extensions might interfere with proper badge updates.
   - Try disabling other extensions temporarily to see if badge appears.

5. **Restart the Browser**
   - Completely close and reopen your browser to refresh all extension activities.

6. **Test on Different Websites**
   - Navigate to a few commonly visited sites to generate network requests.
   - The badge count should update reflecting third-party connections.

### Common Pitfalls

- Extensions installed in developer mode can sometimes become unstable.
- Network requests made outside browser's `webRequest` API (e.g., native apps or some sandboxed environments) will not trigger badge updates.

## 2. Popup Appears Empty or Shows 'NO DATA'

If clicking the extension icon opens a popup that is empty or displays a 'NO DATA' message, it indicates the extension has not captured or processed network information for the active tab.

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Refresh the Webpage**
   - Reload the active tab to allow the extension to capture network requests anew.

2. **Check Tab Permissions and Activity**
   - The extension tracks network requests on active browser tabs.
   - Ensure the tab is fully loaded and is not a special browser page (e.g., `chrome://` or `about:` pages) where extensions have limited access.

3. **Wait a Moment**
   - The extension batches network event processing every second; wait a couple of seconds after page load.

4. **Verify No Blocking in Browser Settings**
   - Some browsers or security software settings might prevent extensions from accessing network data.

5. **Try a Different Website**
   - Navigate to a standard website (like https://example.com) and check if popup data appears.

### Troubleshooting UI Issues

- If the popup remains stuck or blank even after refresh and different sites, reload or reinstall the extension.

- Clear browser cache and restart your browser if problems persist.

## 3. Permission Errors During Operation

If you encounter notifications or errors about missing permissions, it usually stems from incomplete permissions granted during installation or from browser security policies.

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Reinstall Extension with Full Permissions**
   - Remove and reinstall uBO Scope directly from your browser's official extension store:
     - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
     - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

2. **Manually Review and Grant Permissions**
   - During installation, accept all permission requests relating to `webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab`.
   - If you previously denied any, remove the extension and reinstall.

3. **Browser Profile and Security Settings**
   - Strong privacy settings or management policies (especially in corporate environments) may restrict extension permissions.
   - Consult your system or browser administrator if applicable.

4. **Confirm Browser Version Meets Requirements**
   - Permissions behavior can vary by browser version.
   - Update browser to the supported minimum version.

5. **Check for Known Browser Bugs**
   - Occasionally browser updates may introduce bugs affecting extension permissions. Refer to your browser's support channels for updates.

## 4. Extension Not Responding or Inactive

If uBO Scope does not activate or cease to respond: toolbar icon is missing or popup won't open.

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Verify Installation**
   - Confirm uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your browser's extensions list.

2. **Restart Browser**
   - Relaunch your browser and see if extension icon appears.

3. **Check Browser Profile or Sync Status**
   - Sometimes profile corruption or sync errors can disable extension functionality.

4. **Update/Reinstall Extension**
   - Install the latest version from official extension stores.

5. **Inspect Browser Logs**
   - For advanced users, check browser console logs for extension errors.

## 5. Additional Tips

- **Use uBO Scope Alongside Other Content Blockers**
  - uBO Scope is designed to work passively alongside your existing ad blockers or DNS-based blocking.
  - It uses your browser’s `webRequest` API, so it can reflect network realities regardless of blocking.

- **Public Suffix List (PSL) Handling**
  - uBO Scope groups domains based on the PSL to provide meaningful domain-level network connection reports.
  - Issues with domain grouping are rare but may relate to outdated PSL data, which the extension updates internally.

- **Check Browser Console for Error Messages**
  - Open developer tools (usually `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`) then the Console tab to see any error messages related to uBO Scope.
