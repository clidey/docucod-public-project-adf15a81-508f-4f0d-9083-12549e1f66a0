# Extension Setup & Configuration

Ensure uBO Scope delivers accurate and insightful reporting on all third-party remote server connections by correctly setting up the extension with required permissions and browser configurations. This guide walks you through the essential configuration steps, proactive permissions handling, and optimization tips to guarantee consistent network request tracking from the moment you start.

---

## 1. Verify Required Extension Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions to function correctly. Without these, the extension cannot observe network requests or save your session data.

### Essential Permissions

- **WebRequest**: Captures network requests, including redirects and errors.
- **Storage**: Saves session data and the Public Suffix List for domain grouping.
- **ActiveTab**: Accesses current active tab details.
- **Host Permissions**: Access to all HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket URLs.

These permissions are declared in the extension's `manifest.json` and, once granted, enable full functionality.

<Tip>
If you deny or restrict these permissions during installation or later, uBO Scope will not accurately report connections.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Allowing Permissions Upon Installation

When you install uBO Scope, your browser will prompt for the necessary permissions. Follow these steps to ensure permissions are granted:

1. **During installation**, when prompted by your browser, click 'Allow' or 'Add Extension' to grant permissions.
2. **Post-installation**, verify that permissions are enabled by visiting your browser's extension management page.

### Manual Permission Checks (All Browsers)

- Open your browser's extensions settings.
- Locate uBO Scope in the list.
- Check if 'Permissions' include `webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab`, and access to URLs (host permissions).

<Tip>
If any required permissions are missing, disable and re-enable the extension or reinstall it to trigger permission prompts.
</Tip>

## 3. Adjust Browser Settings for Optimal Operation

To ensure uBO Scope tracks network activity comprehensively:

- **Enable third-party cookies** or equivalents to avoid interference with network request reporting.
- **Avoid browser privacy modes** that block network request observation.
- Confirm that **webRequest API** is fully supported by your browser version (minimum versions: Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

<Tip>
uBO Scope passively observes requests via the browser API; aggressive privacy settings or external DNS-level blocking may limit its visibility on network activity.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Configure Extension Settings (If Applicable)

Currently, uBO Scope operates with minimal internal configuration. However, to enhance your experience:

- Regularly update the extension to benefit from improvements related to configuration options.
- Monitor the popup UI for real-time summaries and categorized connection outcomes.

<Info>
Future versions may introduce advanced configuration options; stay tuned via the project repository or release notes.
</Info>

---

## 5. Understand the Role of the Public Suffix List

uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List (PSL) to group hostnames accurately by their domain for meaningful aggregation.

- The PSL data is stored and automatically updated in the extension's session storage.
- No manual action is required to refresh the PSL; it updates automatically on extension load.

<Tip>
If you notice unusual or inconsistent domain grouping, ensure your extension is up to date to have the latest PSL data.
</Tip>

---

## 6. Usage Tips for Reliable Network Tracking

- Open and keep the uBO Scope popup accessible while browsing to view live network connection outcomes.
- Reload tabs if you adjust permissions or browser settings to reset the captured session data.
- Clearing browser or extension storage will reset session data; this can be useful to start fresh.

<Warning>
Avoid disabling the extension or closing the browser without saving session data if you want to preserve ongoing connection tracking.
</Warning>

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Configuration Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Configuration Issues & Solutions">

<Accordion title="Missing or Denied Permissions">
If uBO Scope does not show any data or badge counts remain empty:
- Revisit the extension permissions and ensure all required permissions are granted.
- Reinstall the extension to trigger permissions prompts.
- Check browser security or privacy extensions that might block permission dialogs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Browser Version Incompatibility">
- Verify your browser version meets minimum requirements: Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+.
- Update your browser to the latest stable release.
- Use supported browsers as the extension relies on the `webRequest` API which might not be available or fully functional on unsupported platforms.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Limited Network Request Visibility in Private Mode">
- Some browsers limit extension network tracking in private or incognito modes.
- Use normal browsing mode for full visibility.

If private mode tracking is essential, check browser settings for allowing extensions to run in private mode and enable uBO Scope accordingly.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Outdated Public Suffix List">
- Ensure the extension updates properly to refresh the PSL.
- If network issues or domain grouping problems persist, try disabling and re-enabling the extension to reload PSL data.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Verifying Configuration

After completing setup:

1. Navigate to any active website.
2. Observe the uBO Scope toolbar badge â€” it should display a count representing distinct third-party remote server connections.
3. Open the popup interface by clicking the toolbar icon.
4. Confirm that connection details are shown and categorized as "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", or "blocked".

<Check>
A populated popup and a changing badge count confirm correct permission setup and extension operation.
</Check>
