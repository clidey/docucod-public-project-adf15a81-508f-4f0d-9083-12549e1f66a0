# Troubleshooting Installation & Setup

This guide helps you resolve the most frequent issues encountered when installing and setting up uBO Scope. If the extension icon does not appear, badge counts are missing, or connection data is not visible, follow these practical steps to identify and fix common problems. This ensures you can quickly get uBO Scope running and start monitoring your browser’s third-party connections.

---

## 1. Extension Icon Not Appearing

### Cause
The extension icon is essential to access uBO Scope’s popup interface. If it does not show on your browser’s toolbar after installation, this can happen due to permissions restrictions, browser UI settings, or conflicts with other extensions.

### How to Fix

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm Successful Installation">
- Open your browser's extension or add-ons management page:
  - **Chrome**: `chrome://extensions/`
  - **Firefox**: `about:addons`
  - **Safari**: Safari menu > Preferences > Extensions
- Verify that uBO Scope is listed and enabled.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Toolbar or Extension Menu">
- Some browsers hide new extensions by default:
  - In **Chrome**, click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions menu) and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.
  - In **Firefox**, click the toolbar overflow menu (three dots or arrows) and customize the toolbar to add the uBO Scope icon.
  - In **Safari**, verify that the toolbar icon is enabled via Preferences.
</Step>

<Step title="Restart Your Browser">
- Sometimes a browser restart fully activates a new extension.
- Close all browser windows and restart before checking again.
</Step>

<Step title="Check for Conflicts with Other Extensions">
- Disable other extensions temporarily to test if any prevent uBO Scope’s icon from appearing.
- Re-enable them one by one to identify conflicts.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the icon still does not appear after these steps, verify that you installed the extension from the official source matching your browser:
- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- Safari extensions via the App Store
</Tip>

## 2. Missing Badge Counts on the Toolbar Icon

### Cause
uBO Scope uses the badge count to show the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected by your browser. A missing badge or empty count usually means the extension is not tracking network requests properly due to permission issues or browser capability limitations.

### How to Fix

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Required Permissions">
- uBO Scope requires these permissions to operate:
  - **activeTab**, **storage**, and **webRequest**
- On installation, your browser should have prompted you to grant these. If denied, the extension cannot monitor network requests.
- Reinstall or update permissions via your browser extension settings.
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Host Permissions">
- Confirm that the extension has access to HTTP(S) and WebSocket URLs.
- These include `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, and `ws://*/*`.
- Some browsers require explicit granting of these at install or runtime.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Minimum Browser Version">
- uBO Scope requires the following minimum browser versions:
  - Chrome: 122.0+
  - Firefox: 128.0+
  - Safari: 18.5+
- Using older versions can cause API compatibility issues, preventing badge updates.
- Update your browser to at least these versions.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Browser Restrictions or Policies">
- Some enterprise or managed browser policies restrict extension capabilities.
- Verify your environment does not block webRequest API usage.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the badge remains blank after these steps, try disabling other privacy or content-blocking extensions that may interfere with network request listeners.
</Tip>

## 3. No Connection Data Visible in the Popup

### Cause
After clicking the toolbar icon to open the popup, seeing "NO DATA" or empty records indicates uBO Scope is not capturing or retrieving network connection details.

### How to Fix

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to a Website to Generate Network Activity">
- The extension reports connections on the active tab only.
- Open any site and ensure it initiates network requests (e.g., a common webpage).
</Step>

<Step title="Refresh the Page after Opening the Popup">
- Refresh the tab to trigger new connection data collection.
- The popup updates dynamically with allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked domains.
</Step>

<Step title="Ensure Browser APIs Are Functioning">
- The extension relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API.
- In some browsers or contexts (private browsing, restrictive profiles), this API may be limited.
- Test the extension in a normal browsing window.
</Step>

<Step title="Clear Extension Data and Restart">
- Sometimes stored session data can become corrupted.
- To reset, disable and re-enable the extension or clear its storage via browser extension settings.
- Restart the browser afterward.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Connection data for certain background requests or extensions using non-standard network methods might not appear due to browser API constraints.
</Warning>

## 4. Resolving Permission Errors

If you encounter permission error dialogs or logs related to `webRequest` or URL access:

- Confirm that you granted all requested permissions at install.
- Check if your browser’s security settings block extensions from accessing certain sites.
- On Chromium, verify your extension's manifest includes the `host_permissions` for HTTP, HTTPS, and WS protocols.
- On Firefox and Safari, confirm `browser_specific_settings` for minimum version and permissions.


---

## 5. Browser Limitations & Known Issues

- **Private Browsing Sessions**: Some browsers restrict network monitoring in private mode.
- **Browser Version Compatibility**: Versions older than specified minimums will not support all extension APIs.
- **Conflicts with Other Extensions**: Extensions that also hook `webRequest` or aggressively block network traffic can interfere.
- **Platform-Specific Permission Models**: Safari has a more restrictive extension permission system requiring explicit approval.
