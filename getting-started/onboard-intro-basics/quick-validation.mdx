# Validating Installation & Operation

Ensure that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browser's network requests and presenting accurate badge counts. This guide walks you through verifying your installation and operation with straightforward steps, practical tips, and troubleshooting advice to get you confident and up to speed swiftly.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation

Your very first step is to confirm that uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled in your browser.

### Steps:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. The icon typically appears as a distinct badge or symbol (default title: "uBO Scope").
2. Click the icon to open the popup interface.
3. If the popup opens and displays a heading with a domain or 'NO DATA', uBO Scope is installed and loaded.

<Tip>
If you don't see the extension icon, check whether uBO Scope is enabled in your browser's extensions page. Also verify you're running a supported browser (e.g., Chromium 122+, Firefox, Safari).
</Tip>

## 2. Verify Active Monitoring with Badge Counts

uBO Scope actively tracks network requests per browser tab, dynamically updating the badge count on the extension icon to reflect distinct remote server connections.

### How to Verify Badge Counts:

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to a widely-used, content-rich site (e.g., https://www.wikipedia.org).
2. Observe the badge count on the uBO Scope icon. It should display a number representing the count of distinct remote domains contacted.
3. Click the extension icon to open the popup.
4. See the count of domains connected and their classification: `not blocked`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked`.

<Tip>
Badge count shows only the number of distinct **allowed** domains detected in the current tab. If the count is zero, uBO Scope either has no network data yet or no allowed domains were contacted.
</Tip>

## 3. Test on Different Websites

To ensure uBO Scope is functioning consistently, test it on various types of websites:

- **Simple, single-domain websites:** Badge should be low or zero.
- **Complex, multi-third-party sites:** Badge count should increase reflecting third-party domains contacted.
- **Sites known for blocking or specialized content:** Check if stealth-blocked or blocked categories populate in the popup.

### Practical Example:
Try inspecting the popup on:

- https://news.ycombinator.com  — expect a moderate number of allowed and possibly some blocked domains.
- https://example.com — typically shows minimal domains.

## 4. Understand the Popup UI

The popup interface provides a clear, categorized view of network outcomes:

### Sections:

- **Domains Connected:** A summary count of distinct domains contacted in the tab.
- **Not Blocked:** Domains allowed and successfully contacted.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were stealth-blocked (requests redirected or masked).
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests were blocked (errors).

Each listed domain has a badge showing the number of times connections occurred.

<Tip>
If any section has no entries, that section is hidden for clarity.
</Tip>

## 5. Signs of Potential Issues

If you suspect uBO Scope isn't working correctly, watch for these symptoms:

- Badge count stays empty or zero despite browsing multi-domain sites.
- Popup always shows "NO DATA" for domain or zero counts.
- No categorized domains (allowed/blocked/stealth) appear.
- Badge count doesn't update when switching tabs or loading new pages.

## 6. Troubleshooting Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Extension Icon Not Visible">
- Verify the extension is installed and enabled.
- Check browser's extensions/settings page.
- Restart the browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
- Confirm you are browsing sites with network requests.
- Reload the tab to trigger events.
- Disable other extensions that may interfere.
- Update browser to a supported version.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA Continuously">
- Ensure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions.
- Reload the browser tab and open the popup again.
- Restart the browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Domains Categorized in Popup">
- Check network activity is happening on the tab.
- Access different websites with varied content.
- Confirm content blockers do not fully block network requests (which uBO Scope tracks).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Verifying Data Persistence

uBO Scope maintains session data for each tab and persists it temporarily.

To test:

1. Open multiple tabs with different domains.
2. Switch between tabs and observe badge counts update accordingly.
3. Close a tab; the badge count for that tab should be cleared.

This behavior confirms the extension tracks per-tab network requests live.

## 8. Next Steps

Once you've validated that uBO Scope is installed and actively tracking network requests:

- Explore detailed usage guidance in the [First Use & Configuration]( /getting-started/onboard-intro-basics/first-use-and-configuration ) guide.
- Learn to interpret badge numbers and categorized domains in-depth through the [Interpreting Badge Numbers]( /guides/workflows-usage/interpreting-badge ) instructions.
- Visit the [Troubleshooting Setup Issues]( /getting-started/onboard-intro-basics/troubleshooting-setup ) page if you encounter problems beyond initial validation.

## How uBO Scope Tracks and Displays Network Activity (Advanced Explanation)

While not required for most users, understanding the tracking mechanism enhances confidence:

- uBO Scope monitors network requests from browser tabs via the `webRequest` API.
- Requests are categorized into 'allowed', 'blocked', or 'stealth-blocked' based on their response or outcome.
- The badge count represents the number of unique allowed domains contacted in the current tab.
- The popup presents a detailed breakdown with real-time updates.

This efficient monitoring happens transparently without interfering with browsing experience or blocking content.
