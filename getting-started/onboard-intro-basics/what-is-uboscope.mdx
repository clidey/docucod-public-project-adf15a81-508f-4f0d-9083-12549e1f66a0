# What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension that provides clear, real-time visibility into network connections initiated by webpages. Whether these connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked, uBO Scope shows all distinct third-party remote servers a webpage attempts to connect with, helping users understand the true extent of web traffic happening behind the scenes.

---

## Purpose and Value

Modern browsing often involves numerous background connections to third-party servers, affecting privacy, security, and page behavior. However, these connections are rarely transparent by default, especially when other content blockers or DNS filters are in use.

**uBO Scope's core purpose is to reveal *all* third-party connection attempts and successes, regardless of which content blocker or DNS filtering is active.** This transparency empowers users to:

- Objectively assess network activities on any page.
- Validate the effectiveness and limitations of content blockers.
- Detect stealth blocking strategies used by some blockers.
- Understand the real-world network footprint of webpages beyond simplified block counts.

Unlike traditional ad blockers or privacy tools that only show blocked URLs or counts, uBO Scope shows the *number of distinct third-party domains* successfully connected to — the key metric that truly matters for privacy exposure.

## Who Should Use uBO Scope?

uBO Scope serves a broad spectrum of users who want clarity on third-party network activity:

- **Privacy-Conscious Browsers:** Gain unbiased insights into which external servers a visited page reaches out to.
- **Content Blocker Enthusiasts:** Objectively compare blocking implementations without being misled by block counts.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Debug and validate filtering rules with transparent connection data.
- **Developers & Auditors:** Inspect network behavior on webpages, even where conventional developer tools are limited or unavailable.

This extension does not replace content blockers; it complements them by showing what actually happens under the hood.

## How uBO Scope Works

uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to listen for network events related to HTTP and WebSocket connections:

- Tracks all network requests initiated by webpages
- Categorizes outcomes as allowed (successful connections), stealth-blocked (redirected or suppressed without visible blocking), or blocked (failed connections)
- Aggregates connection data by domain and hostname, avoiding redundant details
- Updates badge count on the browser toolbar to show the number of unique third-party domains connected
- Presents comprehensive details in an easy-to-read popup interface

Because it monitors at the network request level, uBO Scope detects connections regardless of which content blocker or DNS filter is in place, or even if stealth-blocking techniques are used.

## Debunking Common Myths

### Myth 1: "Higher block count means better blocking"

Block count badges often mislead users. A higher block count might actually indicate a blocker is allowing more third-party connections, while a lower block count means fewer resources were allowed.

uBO Scope focuses on the count of **distinct third-party servers actually connected to**. This metric more accurately reflects privacy exposure than simple block counts.

### Myth 2: "Ad blocker test pages reliably assess blocker effectiveness"

Many 'ad blocker test' websites use artificial or fabricated scenarios not representative of real-world browsing. They cannot correctly detect stealth blocking techniques and often produce misleading results.

uBO Scope shows real connection attempts from real pages in your browsing context, providing meaningful, unbiased information.

## When to Use uBO Scope

Use uBO Scope anytime you want to:

- Instantly see all third-party domains a webpage interacts with
- Verify if your content blocker or DNS filtering setup is working as expected
- Understand why a particular page might be slower or connecting to unexpected servers
- Investigate privacy leaks or suspicious network behaviors

Its unobtrusive popup and badge updates make it easy to keep network visibility top of mind without disrupting your browsing flow.

## Overview of User Experience

- After installing uBO Scope, the browser toolbar icon shows a badge with the number of distinct third-party domains connected on the active tab.
- Clicking the icon opens the popup interface listing domains sorted by their outcome categories:
  - **Not blocked**: Domains successfully connected
  - **Stealth-blocked**: Domains whose requests were redirected or suppressed silently
  - **Blocked**: Domains whose connection attempts failed
- The interface updates dynamically as you browse.

This makes it effortless to visualize the true network footprint of any webpage and assess privacy impact.

## Additional Information

- uBO Scope supports Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers with tailored manifests and integrates independently of other content blockers.
- The badge count reflects the number of distinct connected third-party domains; a lower number usually indicates a better privacy state.
- The extension uses a background script to track network requests and a popup to display live data.

<Tip>
Remember: uBO Scope shows *all* network connection attempts independently of any content blocker, bringing transparency, not blocking.

<Note>
The badge count reports distinct third-party domains connected. Reducing this count indicates better privacy protection.
