# Prerequisites & Supported Browsers

This page outlines the essential prerequisites and system requirements you must meet to use **uBO Scope** effectively. It provides a clear, quick-reference overview of supported browsers, their minimum versions, and necessary permissions. Use this guide to confirm your environment is ready before installation and daily use.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers & Minimum Version Requirements

uBO Scope is designed to work seamlessly across the three major browser platforms: Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari. Each platform requires specific minimum browser versions to ensure full compatibility with the extension's capabilities.

| Browser Platform       | Minimum Version | Notes                                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Chromium (Chrome, Edge, etc.) | 122.0           | Requires Manifest V3 support and `webRequest` API    |
| Firefox               | 128.0           | Uses modern WebExtension APIs with strict version enforcement |
| Safari                | 18.5            | Requires Safari 18.5 or later for extension support      |

<Note>
Ensure your browser is updated to at least the minimum version listed above. Older versions may lack the necessary APIs or security features required by uBO Scope.
</Note>

## 2. Required Permissions & Extension Access

uBO Scope leverages browser APIs to monitor network requests at a granular level. To operate as intended, the extension requires specific permissions granted during installation.

### Core Permissions:

- **`webRequest`**: Essential to observe and report all network requests initiated from webpages.
- **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to access the currently active tab to collect real-time data.
- **`storage`**: Used for saving session data such as tracking information and public suffix lists.

### Host Permissions:

- Access to all HTTP and HTTPS URLs (`http://*/*` and `https://*/*`) is mandatory to monitor all page requests.
- Additionally, Chromium and Firefox platforms require websocket URL patterns (`ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*`) to track websocket connections.

<Info>
Safari's manifest specifies the required permissions in "permissions" and "host_permissions" sections, matching Chromium and Firefox in capability except for websocket URLs.

## 3. Quick Reference: Browser-Specific Details

Below are the manifest highlights and essential points for each browser platform. This quick comparison helps you verify your environment.

### Chromium-based Browsers

- **Minimum Version:** 122.0
- **Manifest:** Uses Manifest V3 with background service worker module.
- **Permissions:** `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`
- **Host Permissions:** HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS

### Firefox

- **Minimum Version:** 128.0
- **Manifest:** Manifest V3 with background script module.
- **Permissions:** `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`
- **Host Permissions:** HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS
- **Browser-specific settings:** Extension ID and strict version enforcement.

### Safari

- **Minimum Version:** 18.5
- **Manifest:** Manifest V3 with background script module.
- **Permissions:** `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`
- **Host Permissions:** HTTP and HTTPS only (no explicit websocket permissions).

<Callout>
Check your browser's extension page and update policies to confirm these permissions are granted before proceeding.

## 4. System & Network Environment Requirements

While uBO Scope itself is lightweight and does not impose heavy system demands, ensure the following for optimal performance:

- **Operating System:** Compatible with any OS supported by your browser (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android).
- **Network Access:** No specific firewall or proxy settings are required; however, network restrictions that block browser extensions’ access to `webRequest` events will impair functionality.

<Tip>
Since uBO Scope relies on browser-provided data, ensure that no other privacy or security tools interfere with the `webRequest` API or manipulate network layers invisibly.
</Tip>

## 5. Verifying Your Environment Before Installation

1. **Check Browser Version**
   - Open your browser's "About" page.
   - Verify the version meets or exceeds the minimum stated.

2. **Confirm Permissions Support**
   - Review extension permission prompts during install.
   - If installing from source or .zip, verify the `manifest.json` matches your browser platform and version.

3. **Review Host Permissions**
   - Confirm that your browser supports the full range of URLs uBO Scope monitors.

4. **Perform a Dry Run**
   - After installation, test accessing common webpages to ensure the badge count updates and popup displays connection info.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues & Fixes">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
Update your browser to the latest stable release. Older browsers lack support for Manifest V3 and crucial APIs, causing failures or missing data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Required Permissions on Install">
Ensure you accept all permission prompts. If using developer mode, verify the `manifest.json` is correctly configured with permissions and host permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Layers Blocking webRequest API">
Avoid tools or proxies that intercept or mask network requests from the browser’s APIs as this will prevent uBO Scope from capturing network data.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
