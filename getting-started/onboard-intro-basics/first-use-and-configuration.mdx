# First Use & Configuration

Welcome to your first experience with uBO Scope! This guide walks you through opening the extension's popup interface, understanding the data displayed, and ensuring the extension has proper browser permissions and settings to function flawlessly. By the end of this guide, you will confidently confirm that uBO Scope is active and reporting remote server connections correctly.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

uBO Scope operates as a browser extension accessible from your browser's toolbar. Its popup interface provides a live summary of network connections relevant to the active browser tab.

### Steps to Open the Popup:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope toolbar icon:** Look for the icon labeled "uBO Scope" or "uBO" in your browser's extensions area, usually near the address bar.
2. **Click the icon:** Single-clicking the icon opens the popup window showing connection data.

> <Check> If the icon is not visible:
>  - In Chrome or Chromium browsers, click the Extensions puzzle piece icon and pin uBO Scope for easy access.
>  - In Firefox, check your toolbar settings to enable the extension icon.
>  - In Safari, enable the extension from Safari Preferences > Extensions.

## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface

Once the popup opens, you will see real-time information about remote server connections initiated by the current webpage tab.

### Key Elements Explained:

- **Hostname Display:** At the top, the extension shows the active tab's hostname and domain. If the hostname and domain differ, the part outside the main domain is also displayed.

- **Domains Connected:** This count shows the number of _distinct third-party domains_ the page has connected to.

- **Outcome Sections:** There are three categorized lists representing the status of connections:
  - **Not blocked (Allowed):** Domains where connections succeeded without interference.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where redirects or subtle blocking occurred.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where network requests failed due to blocking.

- **Domain Rows:** Each domain listed has a count showing how many times the site connected to it.

### Practical Tip:

- A lower domains connected count often indicates fewer third-party connections, which usually correlates with better privacy.
- The badge on the toolbar icon reflects the count of _allowed_ connections, helping you monitor third-party access quickly.

## 3. Verifying uBO Scope is Working Correctly

To confirm uBO Scope is active and monitoring properly, follow these verification steps.

### Verification Steps:

1. **Open uBO Scope popup for the active tab.**
2. **Visit a website known for loading third-party content**, such as a news webpage or a site with embedded media.
3. **Observe the "domains connected" number update** reflecting the external servers contacted.
4. **Check the domain lists under each outcome category**. You should see a populated "not blocked" list for allowed connections.
5. **Look for badge number on the extension icon:** confirms the count of distinct third-party domains contacted.

> <Warning> If the popup shows "NO DATA" for the active tab or domain lists remain empty:
> - The extension might be inactive or lacks proper permissions.
> - The webpage may not contain third-party connections.
> - Ensure you have reloaded the tab after installing uBO Scope.

## 4. Adjusting Browser Permissions and Settings

uBO Scope requires certain permissions to monitor network requests effectively.

### Permissions Needed:

- Access to active tabs.
- Storage for session data.
- WebRequest permissions to listen to network activity.

### What to Check:

- **Installation Source:** Confirm you installed uBO Scope from your browser's official extension store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari Extension Gallery).
- **Permissions Granted:** The browser should prompt for necessary permissions during installation. You can check granted permissions via your browser's extension management page.

### How to Grant or Review Permissions:

- **Chrome/Chromium:**
  1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
  2. Find uBO Scope
  3. Click "Details"
  4. Ensure "Site access" is set to "On all sites"

- **Firefox:**
  1. Go to `about:addons`
  2. Find uBO Scope
  3. Click the gear icon > Manage
  4. Confirm permissions include "Access your data for all websites"

- **Safari:**
  1. Open Safari Preferences > Extensions
  2. Select uBO Scope
  3. Confirm "Allow extension to run on webpages" is enabled
  4. Confirm minimum Safari version is met (18.5 or higher)

<Tip> Reload any open webpages after adjusting permissions to let uBO Scope capture fresh requests.

## Appendix: Example Use Case

Imagine you install uBO Scope in your Firefox browser and visit a news website. You open the extension popup and immediately see a number indicating multiple domains connected. Domains from large CDNs appear under "not blocked," while some advertising-related domains might appear under "blocked."

This real-time insight confirms uBO Scope’s effective monitoring and helps you quickly assess the web page’s external contacts. Viewing the distinction between allowed and blocked domains empowers you to understand your browser’s network footprint better.
