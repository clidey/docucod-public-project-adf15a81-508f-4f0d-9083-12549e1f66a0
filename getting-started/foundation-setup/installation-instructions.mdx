# Installing uBO Scope on Supported Browsers

This guide will walk you through installing the uBO Scope browser extension on Chromium-based browsers (such as Google Chrome and Edge), Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari. It covers platform-specific nuances to ensure a seamless installation experience.

---

## 1. Introduction

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to expose all network connections initiated by webpages. Installing it allows you to monitor allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections in real-time within your favorite browser. The extension is developed to support the latest versions of Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers.

Before proceeding with installation, please verify your browser and system meet the required versions and have the necessary permissions as explained in the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/foundation-setup/prerequisites-system-requirements) guide.

## 2. Supported Browsers & Version Requirements

- **Chromium-based browsers**: Minimum Chrome version 122.0
- **Firefox**: Minimum version 128.0
- **Safari**: Minimum version 18.5

These versions ensure compatibility with the extension's use of modern web extension APIs, especially the webRequest API necessary for accurate network connection reporting.

## 4. Common Questions & Platform Differences

### Why different browser versions?
uBO Scope relies on browser APIs available only in recent versions. Older versions may not support the latest Manifest V3 or webRequest APIs.

### What permissions does uBO Scope require?
- Access to active tab content to monitor network connections.
- Storage permission to save settings and session data.
- webRequest permission to intercept and log network requests.

### Why might the extension not work after installation?
- Insufficient browser version.
- Extension disabled accidentally.
- Conflicts with other extensions or browser settings.

See the [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](/getting-started/first-run-success/troubleshooting-setup-issues) page for detailed help.
