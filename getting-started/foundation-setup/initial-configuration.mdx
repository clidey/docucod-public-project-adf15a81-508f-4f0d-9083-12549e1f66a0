# Configuring uBO Scope for First Use

Welcome to the first step after installing uBO Scope. This guide walks you through activating the extension, reviewing key settings (if any are present), and familiarizing yourself with the toolbar icon and popup interface. Our goal is to ensure you quickly verify that uBO Scope is properly working in your browser so you can begin monitoring network connections effortlessly.

---

## 1. Activating uBO Scope

uBO Scope activates automatically upon installation, but to ensure it's running and ready:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It typically appears as an eye-shaped icon with the label `uBO Scope` on hover.
2. Click the icon to open its popup interface.
3. If the popup loads and displays placeholder text or connection data, the extension is active.

Because uBO Scope integrates as a browser extension, no additional manual enabling is required beyond installation. However, confirm permissions during installation as they allow uBO Scope to monitor network requests.

<Check>
Ensure the extension icon is visible and clickable in the toolbar. If missing, revisit the [Installation on Supported Browsers](/getting-started/foundation-setup/installation-instructions) guide to verify successful installation.
</Check>

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Icon and Popup Interface

The toolbar icon is your gateway to uBO Scope's real-time connection insight:

- **Badge Count**: The small number over the icon indicates the count of unique domains with connections detected on the current active tab.
- **Popup Panel**: Clicking the icon opens a detailed popup showing three categories of connections:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains with allowed connections.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains whose connections were stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked**: Domains whose connections were explicitly blocked.

These categories reflect connections monitored and classified by the extension as you browse, providing transparency regarding third-party network activity.

## 3. Key Settings Review

Currently, uBO Scope operates with minimal configurable settings to maintain simplicity and immediate-use readiness.

### What to Expect:

- There are no user modifiable settings required immediately after installation.
- Configuration and filter options, if they exist, will be surfaced in future updates or in advanced guides.

For now, your primary interaction is through the toolbar icon and popup interface.

## 4. Verifying Extension Functionality

Follow these steps to confirm uBO Scope is correctly monitoring network connections:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Website">
Navigate to any website (for example, https://example.com).
</Step>
<Step title="Click the uBO Scope Icon">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe Connection Data">
You should see the domain name of the website you visited along with domains listed under 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' categories.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Badge Count">
The badge number on the toolbar icon should reflect the count of unique domains connected to from the opened webpage.
</Step>
</Steps>

If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or remains blank, try refreshing the page to allow data collection.

<Tip>
Remember, uBO Scope updates connection data dynamically as you browse; initial values may take a moment to appear after navigating to a page.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

Here are some common scenarios and how to resolve them:

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope Functionality">
<Accordion title="Extension Icon Missing from Toolbar">
Check that the browser has not disabled the extension after installation. Re-enable it via your browser's extensions or add-ons page.

Verify that your browser version meets minimum requirements from the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/foundation-setup/prerequisites-system-requirements).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Empty">
This indicates the extension hasn't detected any network activity yet.

- Refresh the current tab.
- Ensure that no restrictive privacy settings or other extensions are blocking communication unexpectedly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Reflect Expected Connections">
The badge updates based on monitored network activity. Some scenarios:

- Private browsing or incognito may limit data collection.
- Other blockers may affect visibility but uBO Scope works independently using browser APIs.
- Wait a few seconds after page load for badge to update.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps

Now that you've confirmed uBO Scope is active and displaying data, consider:

- Exploring the [Understanding the Popup Panel and Connection Lists](/guides/analyzing-network-connections/understanding-popup-ui) guide to master reading connection details.
- Learning about interpreting the badge counts through [Interpreting Badge Counts and What They Mean for Privacy](/guides/analyzing-network-connections/interpreting-badge-counts).
- Running real-world audits with the help of [Common Use Cases: Auditing and Troubleshooting Network Requests](/guides/analyzing-network-connections/real-world-use-cases).

Continuing your journey will help you maximize privacy insights effectively.
