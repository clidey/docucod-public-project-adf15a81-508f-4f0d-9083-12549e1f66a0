# Prerequisites & System Requirements for Installing uBO Scope

Before installing and using uBO Scope, ensure your system and browser meet the necessary requirements to deliver a seamless and fully functional experience. This guide outlines supported browsers, version requirements, permission needs, and system considerations necessary to operate uBO Scope efficiently.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed to work across major modern browsers, each with explicit minimum version requirements to ensure compatibility with its core features such as network request monitoring.

| Browser            | Minimum Version | Notes                                                       |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Google Chrome      | 122.0           | Supports Chromium Manifest V3, including service worker mode |
| Microsoft Edge     | 122.0           | Based on Chromium; follows same requirements as Chrome      |
| Mozilla Firefox    | 128.0           | Supports Manifest V3 with module background scripts         |
| Firefox for Android| 128.0           | Same requirements as desktop Firefox                         |
| Safari             | 18.5            | Supports Manifest V3 and required extension APIs           |


### Notes:
- Always keep your browser updated to the latest stable version to ensure compatibility and security.
- Some browsers may require additional steps to enable extension installation from outside official stores.

## 2. System Requirements

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension, so the system requirements primarily depend on your browser and operating system:

- **Operating Systems Supported:**
  - Windows 10 and 11
  - macOS 11 and later
  - Linux distributions supporting the latest versions of Chromium or Firefox
  - iOS/iPadOS Safari (limited extension support starting with iOS 15+)
  - Android (via Firefox for Android)

- **Hardware Requirements:**
  - Minimum 2 GB RAM; recommended 4 GB or more for smooth multitasking
  - At least 100 MB free disk space for extension installation and caching

- **Network:**
  - Active internet connection for extension installation and fetching the Public Suffix List
  - Ensure firewalls or network proxies do not block browser extension updates or network monitoring APIs

---

## 3. Permissions Required by uBO Scope

uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions to monitor and report network connections accurately.

### Host Permissions
These allow uBO Scope to observe web requests going to the following URL patterns:

- `https://*/*`
- `http://*/*`
- `wss://*/*` (WebSocket Secure connections) *(Chromium and Firefox only)*
- `ws://*/*` (WebSocket connections) *(Chromium and Firefox only)*

### Extension Permissions
- **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to access the currently active tab to display connection summaries relevant to the user’s current browsing.
- **`storage`**: Used to save session data, including network request summaries and Public Suffix List caching for efficient domain parsing.
- **`webRequest`**: Core permission to listen to and analyze network requests directly from the browser.

### Important:
- WebSocket permissions (`wss://*/*` and `ws://*/*`) are not supported in Safari due to browser limitations.
- Permissions are granted during extension installation or first run; you may need to enable them explicitly in your browser’s extension settings if declined.

---

## 4. System Setup Considerations

### Browser Configuration
- **Enable Extension Installation:** In some browsers (especially Firefox and Chrome-derived browser forks), you may need to enable developer mode or allow extensions from outside the official marketplace if installing manually.
- **Update Browser:** New browser releases often include improvements to extension APIs; using the latest supported version avoids incompatibility.

### Network and Security
- Firewalls or network monitoring tools may interfere with the extension’s ability to observe requests; ensure that blocking rules do not impact browser extension traffic.
- In corporate or highly restricted environments, additional permissions or policies may be required.

### Storage
- uBO Scope caches the Public Suffix List (PSL) for domain parsing efficiency. This requires some local storage access, handled automatically by the extension.

## 5. Preparing for Installation

Follow these steps to be ready for installing uBO Scope:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Compatibility">
Verify you have one of the supported browsers listed above and it meets the minimum version requirements.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Permissions">
Ensure you understand the permissions requested (network access and storage). Prepare to allow these during installation.
</Step>
<Step title="Network Availability">
Make sure you have a reliable internet connection. The extension will download necessary data like the Public Suffix List during initial setup.
</Step>
<Step title="Sufficient Disk Space">
Check that your device has at least 100 MB of free disk space to accommodate the extension’s files and cached data.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Common Prerequisite Pitfalls

### Permission Denials
- If you reject permissions during install, the extension cannot monitor network requests properly. Reset permission grants via your browser’s extension management page.

### Outdated Browser
- Using older browser versions will prevent installation or cause runtime errors. Update your browser before proceeding.

### Network Blockages
- Restrictive firewalls or proxy servers may interfere with extension communication or data fetching. Temporarily disable or adjust rules if problems occur.

## 7. Where to Go Next

Once your system meets the prerequisites and permissions are ready, proceed to the [Installation on Supported Browsers](/getting-started/foundation-setup/installation-instructions) guide to install uBO Scope quickly and begin monitoring network connections.

For a thorough understanding of what the extension monitors and its data presentation, consult the [Understanding the Popup Panel and Connection Lists](/guides/analyzing-network-connections/understanding-popup-ui).

---

<Tip>
Keeping your browser updated and reviewing permissions during installation prevents most common issues. uBO Scope’s efficient use of storage and advanced permission handling means minimal system overhead.
</Tip>

<Note>
If you use Safari, be aware that WebSocket monitoring is limited due to browser API restrictions.
</Note>
