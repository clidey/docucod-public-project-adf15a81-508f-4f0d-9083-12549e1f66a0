# Interpreting the Badge and Popup Data

Welcome to your first hands-on exploration of uBO Scope's core interface elements — the toolbar badge and the popup panel. This guide helps you understand what the badge count means, how domains are grouped and displayed, and practical tips to interpret your network privacy health at a glance.

---

## 1. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The badge on uBO Scope's toolbar icon is your instant privacy snapshot for the active browser tab:

- **What It Shows**: The badge number represents the **count of distinct third-party domains** contacted by the webpage you're viewing.
- **Why It Matters**: A lower badge count correlates with fewer third-party network connections, which generally means better privacy.
- **What Are Third-Party Domains?** Domains **different** from the main site you’re visiting.

### How the Badge Works

- If the count is zero (no third-party connections), the badge remains **empty**.
- The count updates dynamically as the page loads and network requests are made.
- It tracks only distinct domains — repeated connections to the same domain count only once.

<Tip>
Remember, a high badge count means more third parties are contacted. This does not necessarily indicate malicious activity but often reveals which external servers your browser interacts with.
</Tip>

## 2. Exploring the Popup Interface

Click the toolbar icon to open the popup, detailing precise network connection data for the current tab. The popup groups domains by their request outcome, reflecting how your content blockers and browser responded.

### Popup Sections Explained

The popup is divided into three main categories, each representing one of uBO Scope’s connection outcomes:

| Section         | Meaning                                           | Implication                              |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked** | Domains to which connections were allowed         | Resources successfully fetched          |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains with stealthy network blocking attempts | Requests suppressed transparently       |
| **Blocked**     | Domains where connections were explicitly blocked | Requests prevented from completing      |

Each domain listed shows:

- The domain name (e.g., example.com)
- The number of connection attempts made to that domain

### Header Information

At the top, the popup displays:

- The full hostname of the current tab (including any subdomains)
- The summarized main domain part
- The total count of distinct third-party domains contacted summarized below as **domains connected**

### Example Scenario

If you visit `news.example.com`:
- The header shows `news.` as subdomain and `example.com` as main domain.
- The popup will list domains contacted, categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- The badge shows the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.

## 3. Tips for Basic Interpretation

This section guides you on how to interpret the data with privacy and troubleshooting in mind.

### Key Insights

- **Low badge count and few allowed domains**: Indicates strong privacy protection, fewer third parties receiving data.
- **Allowed domains list is usually short and contains legitimate CDNs** (e.g., Google's fonts, analytics).
- **Presence of stealth-blocked domains**: Means some requests were suppressed by your content blockers or browser to enhance privacy without alerting the page.
- **Blocked domains**: Shows overtly blocked network attempts, useful for debugging blocking rules or conditions.

### What You Should Look Out For

- Unexpectedly high allowed domain counts can indicate broad third-party tracking or resource loading.
- Large stealth-blocked or blocked lists with many entries might suggest aggressive content blocking, which might affect site functionality.

<Tip>
Use this data to evaluate the efficacy of your content blockers and understand how many and which third-party domains your activity triggers.
</Tip>

## 4. Step-by-Step: Review Your Badge and Popup Data

<Steps>
<Step title="Check the Toolbar Badge">
Observe the number displayed directly on the extension icon in your browser toolbar.

- If blank, your tab made no third-party connections.
- If a number, it reflects the count of allowed third-party domains contacted.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel">
Click the toolbar icon to open uBO Scope's popup.

- Review the hostname sections at the top.
- Scroll through the three domain outcome sections: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
Look at domains under **not blocked**.

- These domains allowed connections.
- Check counts to understand connection frequency.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Examine the **stealth-blocked** section.

- These requests were silently suppressed to enhance privacy.
- Recognize this as subtle blocking beyond visible block lists.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Blocked Domains">
See the **blocked** section for overt blocking occurrences.

- Useful for diagnosing why certain resources did not load.
</Step>
<Step title="Summarize Privacy Health">
Use the overall count and domain distribution to judge your current privacy exposure.

- More allowed domains means more external data sharing.
- More stealth-blocked or blocked domains means stricter network omission.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Badge Count Doesn't Update

- **Cause:** Browser limitations or tab switching can delay updates.
- **Solution:** Refresh the page or switch tabs back and forth to trigger badge refresh.

### Notice Many Domains But You Expect Fewer

- Complex webpages often rely on multiple external resources.
- Consider your content blocker settings or add custom filters to limit third-party contacts.

### Empty Popup or "NO DATA" Message

- This usually means no network data was recorded yet for the active tab.
- Reload the page and wait a few seconds.

<Tip>
Always test with uBO Scope enabled on various websites to build familiarity with normal versus suspicious domain counts.
</Tip>
