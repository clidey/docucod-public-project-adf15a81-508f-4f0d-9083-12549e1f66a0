# Interpreting Network Insights with uBO Scope

Discover what the badge count and popup window reveal about network requests your browser makes per tab. This guide helps you quickly understand the outcomes of connections to remote servers—whether allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked—so you can gain clear visibility into third-party activity with uBO Scope.

---

## 1. Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count

The badge on the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar shows a **count of distinct third-party domains that were connected to (allowed) by the current tab**.

- **Goal:** A lower badge count signals fewer distinct third-party remote servers accessed.
- **What it reports:** The number of unique remote domains for which network requests succeeded or were allowed.
- **Why it matters:** It provides a realistic measure of connection exposure beyond simple block counts.

<Info>
The badge count updates live per tab, helping you instantly assess how many distinct third-party servers a webpage reaches.

## 2. Overview of the Popup Interface

Click the uBO Scope extension icon to open the popup, which breaks down connection data for the active tab into intuitive sections:

### a. Tab Hostname Display

At the top, you’ll see the tab’s current hostname:

- The **highlighted domain name** represents the main site you’re visiting.
- The prefix shows any subdomain details.

This confirms exactly which website’s network activity you are viewing.

### b. Summary Section

The summary shows:

- **Domains connected:** The total count of unique remote domains contacted.

This snapshot corresponds closely to the toolbar badge count.

### c. Outcome Sections (Connections Categorized)

The popup sorts connected domains into three clear outcome categories:

| Section           | Meaning                                              | Example Scenario                        |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**   | Requests that succeeded and were allowed.            | Content loaded successfully from CDN. |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Requests that were redirected or blocked by stealthy means, possibly by content blockers operating silently. | Requests redirected elsewhere without user-visible blocking. |
| **Blocked**       | Requests that failed or were expressly blocked.       | Connection to ad server denied.        |

Each section lists domains contacted along with a **count** of how many times each domain was contacted.

<Note>
The categorization helps you identify which third parties your browser successfully connected to versus those blocked or stealthily intercepted.

## 3. Navigating and Using the Popup

Follow these practical steps to explore and understand the popup data:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to bring up the popup window showing current tab data.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Tab Hostname">
Confirm the hostname displayed to make sure you are analyzing the intended webpage.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Summary Count">
Look at the domains connected count as a quick indicator of exposure.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze Each Outcome Section">
Expand each "Not Blocked", "Stealth-Blocked", and "Blocked" section to see lists of connected domains and connection counts.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Domain Counts">
Higher counts for a domain mean multiple requests were made — this can help identify especially active third parties.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Use this overview to quickly spot suspicious or excessive third-party connections on any webpage.

## 4. Real-World Example

Imagine visiting a news website with various advertisements and analytics:

- The **Not Blocked** section lists legitimate CDNs serving images, fonts, and scripts.
- The **Stealth-Blocked** section may include trackers silently redirected by your content blocker.
- The **Blocked** section highlights requests your content blocker fully denied, such as known ad servers.

This detailed breakdown informs your privacy assessment far better than simple block counts.

---

## 5. Tips for Effective Use

- **Check the badge count regularly** when browsing to monitor connection exposure.
- **Investigate unusual spikes** in domain counts or unexpected domains in the Not Blocked list.
- **Remember stealth-blocking is subtle,** so pay attention to that section if present.
- **Use alongside your content blocker** to validate which connections go through and which don’t.

<Warning>
The extension only tracks requests visible to the browser’s webRequest API. Connections outside this scope (e.g., WebSocket extensions not reported) may not appear.
</Warning>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions">
<Accordion title="Why is the badge count sometimes zero even when websites load content?">
The badge counts only distinct third-party domains contacted. First-party domains or cached content may not affect this count.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does stealth-blocked mean exactly?">
Stealth-blocked refers to requests redirected or blocked silently, often by content blockers avoiding webpage breakage or detection.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why aren’t some remote connections showing up?">
Connections not visible to the browser’s webRequest API, such as some WebSocket connections or OS-level DNS blocking, are not reported.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I see detailed request info through the popup?">
Currently, the popup focuses on domain and count overview per tab. Future versions may provide more request-level details.
</Accordion>
