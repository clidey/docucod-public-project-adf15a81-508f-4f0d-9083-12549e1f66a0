# Launching and Accessing the uBO Scope Extension

This guide helps you locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser after installation and shows how to open its popup window. Confirming the extension is installed and accessible is your first step to start monitoring third-party remote server connections.

## 1. Locating the uBO Scope Icon in Your Browser

Once installed, uBO Scope places an icon in your browser interface toolbar. The icon represents the extension's presence and gives you immediate, at-a-glance feedback about network connections through the badge count.

### Browser Toolbar Locations

- **Chromium-based Browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)**
  - The icon appears near the upper-right corner of the browser window, typically alongside other extension icons.
  - If the icon is not visible, click the puzzle-piece menu (Extensions icon) and look for "uBO Scope".
  - You can pin the icon to the toolbar by clicking the pin next to uBO Scope in the Extensions menu.

- **Firefox**
  - The icon appears in the toolbar near the address bar, or inside the overflow panel if you have many icons.
  - To quickly find it, click the puzzle-shaped "Extensions" icon and pin uBO Scope for easier access.

- **Safari**
  - The icon appears in the Safari toolbar, usually on the right side.
  - If not visible, ensure extensions are enabled in Safari Preferences > Extensions.

### Icon Appearance

The uBO Scope icon is identifiable by its distinct logo:

- A shield-like or badge-like icon matching the branding seen in the extension store.
- The icon displays a numeric badge indicating the count of distinct third-party domains connected.

## 2. Opening the uBO Scope Popup Window

The popup provides detailed information about the network connections of the current active tab.

### How to Open the Popup

1. **Click the uBO Scope icon** in the browser toolbar.
2. The extension's popup window will appear immediately below the icon.
3. The popup displays:
   - The hostname of the current active tab.
   - A summary count of connected domains.
   - Lists of domains categorized as "allowed," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked."

> The popup updates dynamically as network activity is detected on the active tab.

## 3. Verifying Your Extension is Installed and Ready

### Steps to Confirm Installation and Access

1. Install uBO Scope from your browser's official extension store.
2. Locate the icon in the browser toolbar or extension menu as described above.
3. Click the icon to open the popup window.
4. Verify the popup loads with the current tab's data (initially may show "NO DATA" if no network activity).
5. Visit a website and check if the badge count on the toolbar icon updates.
6. Reopen the popup to see updated domain connection information.

### What to Expect in the Popup

- **Hostname Display:** Shows the current page's domain.
- **Domains Connected:** Number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- **Connection Categories:** Separate sections for domains labeled:
  - **Not blocked:** Resources allowed through.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Connections quietly blocked by browser or filters.
  - **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked connections.

## 4. Tips and Best Practices

- **Pin the uBO Scope icon** for fast, continuous access.
- Refresh your current tab after installing the extension to start tracking network requests.
- If you see "NO DATA" for a site that usually loads resources, wait a moment or refresh the page; the popup data populates asynchronously.
- Be aware the badge count updates as new connections happen during your browsing session.
