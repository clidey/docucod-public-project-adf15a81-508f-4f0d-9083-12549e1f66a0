# First Run: Accessing the uBO Scope Extension

Welcome to your first interaction with uBO Scope, the powerful extension that reveals all network connections to remote servers while you browse. This guide walks you through how to locate, open, and use the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar, understand the badge count, and explore the popup interface to view detailed third-party connection information for the active webpage.

## 1. Locating and Pinning the uBO Scope Icon

Before you can start monitoring network connections, you need to ensure uBO Scope is easily accessible in your browser toolbar.

### 1.1 Pinning the Extension (Browser Toolbar Access)

- **Chrome and Chromium-based Browsers:**
  1. Click the **Extensions** (puzzle piece) icon at the top right of the browser.
  2. Find **uBO Scope** in the dropdown list.
  3. Click the pin icon next to uBO Scope to pin it to your toolbar.

- **Firefox:**
  1. Click the **Extensions** menu button (looks like a puzzle piece).
  2. Locate **uBO Scope** in the list.
  3. Click the pin icon to keep it visible in the toolbar.

- **Safari:**
  1. Go to the Safari menu > **Settings...** > **Extensions**.
  2. Ensure **uBO Scope** is enabled.
  3. To access, click the toolbar icon if visible, or add it via Safari’s Customize Toolbar option.

<Tip>
Pinning uBO Scope ensures you have instant, one-click access to the extension whenever you want to monitor connections on a webpage.

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

Once uBO Scope is enabled and running, you will see a numeric badge overlay on its toolbar icon. This badge is your at-a-glance key metric.

### What the Badge Shows:

- The badge number represents **the count of distinct third-party remote servers that your current active tab has connected to**.

- A **lower badge count is better**, indicating fewer external connections and typically less tracking or content loading from third parties.

- If the badge is empty or missing, it means no connections to third-party servers have been observed yet for that tab.

<Info>
The badge only counts distinct *third-party* domains, meaning servers different from the site you are currently visiting.
</Info>

## 3. Opening the uBO Scope Popup Interface

To dive deeper into connection details, click the uBO Scope icon in your toolbar. This opens the popup window where a detailed report is shown.

### What You See in the Popup:

- **Site hostname display:** At the top, the popup clearly shows the domain of the active tab.

- **Domain Connection Counts:**
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains where network connections succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections stealthily redirected or limited without full blocking.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests were actively blocked.

- **Summary:** The total number of unique connected domains is displayed prominently.

### How to Use the Popup:

1. Click the toolbar icon to open the popup when browsing a site.
2. Observe the site hostname at the top.
3. Review each section (not blocked, stealth-blocked, blocked) to see which domains are involved.
4. Use this information to understand third-party connections your browser made for that page.

<Tip>
Refreshing the page will update the popup data to reflect new or changed network activity as you browse.
</Tip>

## 4. Practical Example: Viewing Third-Party Connections

Imagine you're visiting https://example.com.

- You click the uBO Scope icon.
- The popup shows "example.com" at the top.
- You see 5 not-blocked domains: cdn.example.com, analytics.example.net, fonts.gstatic.com, google-analytics.com, and a third-party ad network domain.
- The badge says "5".
- You notice 1 stealth-blocked domain and 2 blocked domains.

This instantly reveals exactly which remote servers your current site is reaching and the status of those connections.

## 5. Tips for Getting the Most Out of Your First Run

- **Browse a range of sites:** The badge and popup will vary depending on the site’s use of third-party resources.
- **Refresh actively:** Network connection data is tied to the active tab and session. Refresh the page to see fresh data.
- **Note stealth connections:** Domains listed under stealth-blocked might indicate subtle redirections or filters in action.
- **Use the popup to audit:** This tool lets you audit third-party connections, which is valuable for security-conscious users.
