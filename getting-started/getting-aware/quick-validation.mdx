# Quick Start & Validation

Welcome to your first hands-on session with uBO Scope. This guide walks you through the essential steps of opening a webpage, launching the uBO Scope popup, and understanding the network activity reported by the extension. By the end, you'll confidently interpret what third-party domains your browser has contacted, how the toolbar badge reflects those contacts, and what to expect on typical websites.

---

## 1. Launching uBO Scope for the First Time

Before diving into analysis, ensure uBO Scope is properly installed and active in your browser. Once installed:

1. Open any website in your active browser tab.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup interface.

The popup displays detailed information about network connections made by the page you're viewing.

<Tip>
If the toolbar icon does not appear, confirm installation using the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/setup-installation/installation) and verify that your browser version meets [Supported Browsers & Requirements](/getting-started/setup-installation/prerequisites-browsers).
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface

The uBO Scope popup offers a straightforward overview of connections:

- **Top header**: Shows the hostname of the active webpage, split into subdomain and main domain parts if applicable.
- **Summary count**: Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- **Connection sections**: Three separate lists categorize domains by the outcome of the network requests:
  - **Not blocked**: Third-party domains your browser successfully connected to.
  - **Stealth-blocked**: Domains where network requests were redirected stealthily (hidden from the webpage).
  - **Blocked**: Domains where requests failed or were blocked outright.

Each domain entry includes the domain name and a count of how many requests were made.

<Info>
The popup automatically updates when you navigate or reload the page. The data reflects network activity specific to the current browser tab.
</Info>

## 3. Interpreting the Badge Count and Domain Summaries

- The **toolbar badge number** reflects the *count of distinct third-party domains* that successfully connected during the page load — shown under the "not blocked" category in the popup.
- A **lower badge count** indicates fewer third-party network connections, generally representing a smaller network exposure surface.
- The list of domains in each section allows you to explore exactly which servers were contacted, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

### Typical Outcomes

- On most websites, you will see several third-party domains under "not blocked" — these include content delivery networks, analytics providers, ads, or other third-party services.
- The "stealth-blocked" list may be empty or contain domains if the browser or another extension redirected requests quietly.
- The "blocked" list shows domains where requests failed or were explicitly blocked.

<Note>
The badge count excludes stealth-blocked and blocked domains to focus on active network exposure.
</Note>

## 4. Step-by-Step: Running Your First Validation

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Webpage">
Navigate in your browser to a commonly visited website, such as a news homepage or a popular blog.
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon near your browser’s address bar to open the popup and load current tab network data.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Hostname Display">
Confirm the hostname shown matches the domain of the page you are viewing. The subdomain (if any) will appear separately.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Domains Connected Summary">
Note the total number of distinct third-party domains contacted. This count is also shown on the toolbar badge.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Allowed Domains">
Review the "not blocked" section to see which third-party domains your browser connected to successfully. Each includes a count of requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Stealth-Blocked and Blocked">
If present, view which domains were stealth-blocked or blocked entirely. This provides insight on network requests that were prevented or redirected.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or no domains, try reloading the page or verifying that uBO Scope is active and has permissions to monitor the active tab.
</Check>

## 5. Tips for Effective Validation

- **Use Real-World Sites**: Avoid artificial "ad blocker test" pages. Real websites provide meaningful network requests and reflect typical third-party exposure.
- **Reload Tabs**: Refresh the page to update connection details after navigating.
- **Understand Badge Counts**: Remember the badge reflects allowed distinct third-party domains, not total request counts or blocked domains.
- **Compare Across Sites**: Viewing different websites highlights how network exposure varies.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Quick Start Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA or Empty Results">
- Confirm you have navigated to a valid HTTP(S) or WebSocket page.
- Verify uBO Scope is enabled and has required permissions (check browser extensions settings).
- Reload the page and re-open the popup.
- If issue persists, try restarting your browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update as Expected">
- The badge updates after network requests complete and may have a slight delay (~1 second).
- Some pages with very few or no third-party requests will have a blank or zero badge.
- Make sure you are viewing the popup and tab data for the active tab.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected High Number of Third-Party Domains">
- Some websites load many third-party resources (ads, trackers, CDNs).
- This is normal and helps you understand the site's network exposure.
- See related guide on [Interpreting the Icon Badge Count](/guides/core-usage/interpreting-badge-count) for deeper insight.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. What’s Next?

After successfully validating your first webpage connections:

- Explore [Monitoring Network Connections on Any Page](/guides/core-usage/monitoring-network-connections) to learn how to observe real-time network requests across many sites.
- Review [Interpreting the Icon Badge Count](/guides/core-usage/interpreting-badge-count) to better understand what the badge signals about your privacy and tracking.
- Visit [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/getting-aware/troubleshooting) if you encounter problems during use.

By understanding the visible network connections through uBO Scope, you gain transparency on how websites interact with third-party servers — a foundational step in protecting your online privacy.

### Example: How Data is Displayed

```plaintext
Tab Hostname: sub.example.com

Domains connected: 5

Not Blocked Domain List:
 - cdn.examplecdn.com (12 requests)
 - analytics.othersite.net (7 requests)
 - fonts.googleapis.com (3 requests)

Stealth-Blocked Domain List:
 - trackers.hiddentracker.com (2 requests)

Blocked Domain List:
 - ads.adserver.com (5 requests)
```

This indicates the current tab's page contacted 5 distinct third-party domains successfully, while some requests to trackers were stealth-blocked and ads were blocked entirely.
