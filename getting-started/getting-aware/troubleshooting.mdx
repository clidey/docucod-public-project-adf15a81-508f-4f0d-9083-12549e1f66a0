# Troubleshooting Common Issues

Ensuring uBO Scope operates correctly from the start is critical to realizing its full value in revealing third-party connections your browser makes. This troubleshooting guide targets the most common issues users may face during setup, installation, and initial use of the extension. Follow the actionable steps here to swiftly resolve problems and get real-time network visibility working smoothly.

## 1. Toolbar Icon Not Visible

If you cannot see the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar, it might indicate installation or permission issues.

### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Verify Installation**
   - Confirm uBO Scope is installed successfully by visiting your browser's extension/add-ons page:
     - **Chromium**: `chrome://extensions/`
     - **Firefox**: `about:addons`
     - **Safari**: Safari menu > Preferences > Extensions

2. **Pin/Enable the Extension Icon**
   - In Chromium browsers, the icon may be hidden by default. Click the puzzle piece icon and pin uBO Scope for easy access.
   - In Firefox, check if the icon is hidden in the overflow menu.

3. **Check Browser Version and Permissions**
   - Ensure your browser version meets the minimum requirements (Chromium >= 122, Firefox >= 128, Safari >= 18.5).
   - uBO Scope requires permissions such as `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`. Ensure no permission prompts were declined.

4. **Restart the Browser**
   - Sometimes a browser restart is necessary for changes to take effect.

### Common Pitfalls:

- Installing the extension but not pinning the icon in Chromium browsers.
- Browser blocking extension icons due to permission restrictions.

## 2. No Domains Being Reported in the Popup

When opening the extension popup, seeing no data (`NO DATA` message) indicates uBO Scope is not receiving or processing network request details.

### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Confirm Browser Supports `webRequest` API**
   - uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API to capture network events.
   - Some browsers or modes (e.g., private browsing with restrictions) may limit or disable this API.

2. **Validate Host Permissions**
   - Review the extension manifest for host permissions to ensure they cover the URLs you are visiting (e.g., `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, `ws://*/*`).

3. **Check if Website Uses Supported Protocols**
   - uBO Scope tracks requests over HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS protocols only. Requests outside these will not appear.

4. **Verify Extension is Active on the Page**
   - Ensure uBO Scope is not disabled on the current website.
   - Some security or privacy extensions or browser options may conflict or block uBO Scope.

5. **Reload the Webpage**
   - After installing the extension, reload the site to allow uBO Scope to capture requests.

6. **Check Browser Console for Errors**
   - Open developer tools and look for errors related to the extension that may indicate runtime issues.

### Common Pitfalls:

- Browsers with restrictive privacy settings may block network request tracking.
- Navigating to pages before installing the extension or without reloading after installation.

## 3. Installation Errors or Extension Not Installing

Users might face errors during installation or the extension fails to install.

### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Confirm Browser Compatibility**
   - Check that your browser version matches the supported versions.
   - Older or beta versions might have incompatible or buggy extension handling.

2. **Install from Official Stores**
   - Always use official extension stores for installation:
     - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
     - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
     - Safari Extensions Gallery or Safari Preferences for Safari.

3. **Clear Cache and Restart Browser**
   - Sometimes clearing the extension cache or data and restarting the browser resolves stalled installs.

4. **Disable Conflicting Extensions Temporarily**
   - Extensions that alter network permissions or block extension APIs might prevent successful installation.

5. **Developer Mode Installation**
   - For power users building from source, ensure you follow build instructions carefully and load the unpacked extension using developer mode.

### Common Pitfalls:

- Installing through unofficial or unsupported sources.
- Insufficient browser permissions or outdated versions.

## 4. Badge Count Not Updating

The numeric badge on the toolbar icon should reflect the number of distinct allowed third-party connections. If this is not updating:

### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Reload the Active Page(s)**
   - Badge updates rely on fresh network request capturing.

2. **Ensure Background Script Runs Correctly**
   - The background service worker or script processes data and updates the badge; errors here block updates.

3. **Check for Extension Conflicts**
   - Other extensions that disable or interfere with `webRequest` listeners could stop badge updates.

4. **Wait a Moment**
   - uBO Scope batches requests and processes them with a small delay (up to 1 second). Allow a few seconds for badge updates.

### Common Pitfalls:

- Navigating between tabs without network activity.
- Extensions or browser settings disabling APIs uBO Scope depends on.

---

## 5. The Extension Appears to Work But Shows No Blocked or Stealth-Blocked Domains

This indicates the extension is capturing network requests but none are being blocked or stealth-blocked.

### Explanation and Checks:

- uBO Scope reports three categories: **allowed (not blocked), blocked, stealth-blocked**.
- If you do not use a content blocker or have little blocking activity, blocked counts may be zero.
- Ensure that uBlock Origin or other content blockers are active to observe blocked outcomes.

---

## 6. General Troubleshooting Tips

- **Keep Your Browser Updated**: Browser updates often fix extension API issues.
- **Check uBO Scope Version**: Use the latest published version.
- **Verify Network Connectivity**: Some internal or offline pages won't generate monitored network traffic.
- **Review Settings of Other Privacy Tools**: VPNs or privacy extensions may hide or modify requests.

# Appendix: Quick Command to Check Installed Extensions in Chromium

If you suspect an installation issue in Chromium-based browsers, visit `chrome://extensions/`, enable 'Developer mode,' search for uBO Scope, and verify it is enabled or reload it.

# Summary
