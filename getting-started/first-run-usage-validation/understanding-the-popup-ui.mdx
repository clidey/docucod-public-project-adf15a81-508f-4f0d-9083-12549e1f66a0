# Understanding the Popup Interface

Discover how to interpret the data shown in the uBO Scope popup interface. This guide explains what each count and domain list means, clarifies the key metrics you see, and guides you through the toolbar badge’s role in reflecting your browsing exposure.

---

## 1. What the Popup Interface Shows

When you click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon, a popup appears summarizing network activity recorded for the active browser tab. This popup helps you understand exactly which remote servers your browser connected to, and whether those connections were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

### Key Sections in the Popup

- **Hostname Header:** Displays the hostname of the current active tab. It translates internationalized domain names into readable text.
- **Domains Connected Count:** Shows the total number of distinct domains contacted by the current tab.
- **Allowed:** Lists third-party domains your browser successfully connected to during page load.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Lists domains where connections were redirected or hidden (stealth blocking), indicating complex network activity.
- **Blocked:** Lists domains for which connections were explicitly blocked.

### Example Popup Layout

```text
+---------------------------------------------+
| Active Tab Hostname (e.g. example.com)      |
| domains connected: 12                         |
|---------------------------------------------|
| not blocked                                  |
|   - cdn.example.net     3                    |
|   - analytics.sample.org 1                    |
|---------------------------------------------|
| stealth-blocked                              |
|   - tracking.example  2                       |
|---------------------------------------------|
| blocked                                      |
|   - ads.badsite.com  4                        |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

## 2. Understanding Key Metrics

### Domains Connected Count

- Reflects the **number of distinct third-party domains** your browser established or attempted connections with.
- Lower numbers reflect **lower exposure** to external servers, which may imply better privacy.

### Allowed Connections

- These domains represent successful network requests that fetched content or resources.
- Includes legitimate third-party services like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) or analytics providers.

### Stealth-Blocked Connections

- Domains where connection activity was redirected or concealed from standard blocking.
- Covers complex network behaviors such as redirects that bypass blocking or delayed connection attempts.
- Indicative of network requests that were not outright blocked but managed stealthily to limit detectability.

### Blocked Connections

- Domains where network requests were explicitly stopped by content blocking mechanisms.
- These prevented connections usually represent trackers, ads, or suspicious third parties.

## 3. The Toolbar Badge Explained

- The badge number shown on the uBO Scope toolbar icon reflects **the count of distinct allowed third-party domains** for the active tab.
- This count **does not include blocked or stealth-blocked domains**, focusing on what succeeded.
- A **lower badge count signals reduced exposure** to third-party servers, which is preferred for privacy.

<Info>
If the badge is blank (no number), it means no allowed third-party connections were detected for the tab.
</Info>

## 4. How to Interpret Domain Lists

Each domain list section shows rows of domains with an associated count:

- The **domain** is the third-party domain contacted (e.g., "cdn.imageservice.com").
- The **count** represents how many requests were made or affected by the given outcome for that domain.

### Practical Example

If you see "cdn.example.net 5" under Allowed, it means 5 network requests succeeded to cdn.example.net.

## 5. Using the Popup for Privacy Insights

- **Scan the domain lists** regularly to understand which third parties your visited webpages connect to.
- A sudden increase in allowed connections or new domains may indicate changes in site composition or increased tracking.
- **Compare allowed vs. blocked** lists to assess how effectively your content blocker is functioning.

<Tip>
Note that not all third-party domains are harmful; CDNs and some analytics are often necessary for proper webpage functionality.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Cases

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Tips"> 
<Accordion title="No Data or Popup Shows 'NO DATA'"> 
Make sure you have an active tab open and that it is a webpage (not a browser internal page). Refresh the page after installing the extension to allow it to collect data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Shows Unexpected Numbers"> 
Understand badge counts represent allowed third-party domains only; if you see many, it may be due to the website including numerous external resources. Consider reviewing the domain lists in the popup for details.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Blocked Section is Empty" > 
This means no network connections were blocked on the active tab. If you expect blocking, check if your main content blocker is enabled and working.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth Section is Empty"> 
This is normal if no stealth blocking occurred. It represents edge cases with redirects or hidden network activities.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Best Practices for Using the Popup Interface

- Use the popup during active browsing sessions to spot unusual third-party connections in real time.
- Refresh the page and reopen the popup to get fresh data after site navigation.
- Combine insights here with your knowledge of trusted sites for effective privacy audits.
- Use the domain counts to understand the volume of requests per domain, which can help identify heavy trackers.
