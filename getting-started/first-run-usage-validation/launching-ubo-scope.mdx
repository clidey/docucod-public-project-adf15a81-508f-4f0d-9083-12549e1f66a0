# Launching uBO Scope for the First Time

Discover how to access uBO Scope immediately after installation and verify that it is active and ready to reveal your browser's remote server connections. This guide will help you open the extension’s popup interface, confirm it is functioning, and ensure a smooth start with uBO Scope.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation

Before you can launch uBO Scope, verify you have successfully installed the extension in your browser.

### For Chromium-based Browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)

1. Open your browser’s Extensions page by navigating to `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Locate **uBO Scope** in the list.
3. Ensure the toggle switch is set to **On** (enabled).

### For Mozilla Firefox

1. Open the Add-ons Manager via `about:addons`.
2. Find **uBO Scope** under Extensions.
3. Confirm it is **Enabled**.

### For Safari

1. Open Safari Preferences (⌘ + ,).
2. Select the Extensions tab.
3. Verify **uBO Scope** is checked and active.


> <Tip>
> If you installed from the official browser stores, the extension should be enabled by default. If you manually loaded the extension, double-check that it appears in the extensions list and is active.
> </Tip>


## 2. Locate the uBO Scope Icon in the Browser Toolbar

The uBO Scope icon is your door to accessing its popup interface and insights.

- It features a custom icon resembling the uBO logo, in multiple resolutions from 16x16 to 128x128 pixels.
- By default, it appears in your browser’s toolbar area near your address bar.

If you do not see the uBO Scope icon:

- Check your browser’s extension customization menu (e.g., Chrome’s "Extensions" puzzle piece icon) to pin or show the uBO Scope icon.
- For Firefox, check the toolbar customization options and drag the icon into the visible toolbar.


## 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface

Once the icon is visible and active, you can open the extension’s popup to interact with it.

### Step-by-Step:

1. Click the **uBO Scope** icon in the toolbar.
2. A popup window will appear showing the extension’s interface.

This popup (`popup.html`) displays the data collected about remote server connections for the active tab, divided into categories such as **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** domains.


## 4. Verify the Extension is Functioning Correctly

When you open the popup for the first time, confirm the following:

- The heading displays a current hostname or domain associated with the active tab. If it reads **NO DATA**, either the extension hasn’t collected data yet or the active tab does not contain eligible network requests.

- The section **domains connected** shows a number representing distinct domains accessed.

- Domains are categorized and listed under:
  - **Not blocked** — resource connections that succeeded
  - **Stealth-blocked** — connections redirected or stealthily handled
  - **Blocked** — resource connections that were blocked


> <Check>
> If all fields are populated with realistic domain counts and lists, uBO Scope is active and tracking.
> </Check>


## 5. Refresh or Navigate to Trigger Data Collection

If you see **NO DATA** or zero connections initially:

- Reload your current web page to trigger new network requests.
- Navigate to sites known to actively load resources from multiple third-party domains.

The extension listens to network requests via the browser’s `webRequest` API, updating its data dynamically.


## 6. Understanding the Popup Interface Basics

The popup interface includes the following elements:

- **Hostname header**: Shows the domain and subdomain of the active tab.
- **Summary**: Highlights the count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Outcome Sections**:
  - **Not blocked**: Domains for which connections were allowed.
  - **Stealth-blocked**: Domains silently redirected or stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where connections failed due to blocking.

Each domain entry shows the domain name and a badge indicating the number of connection occurrences.
