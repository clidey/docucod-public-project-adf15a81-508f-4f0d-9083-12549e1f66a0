# Quick Validation Checklist for uBO Scope

Ensure your uBO Scope extension is functioning correctly with this concise checklist. It guides you through verifying the toolbar badge, inspecting filtered domains via the popup, and confirming that data collection is accurate for websites you visit.

---

## 1. Confirm Toolbar Badge Display

The toolbar badge is your quickest indicator of uBO Scope’s activity for the current tab.

- **Look for the Badge**: After loading a webpage, check that the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar displays a number (badge).
- **Badge Meaning**: The number represents the count of distinct third-party domains from which your browser attempted or succeeded in making network connections.
  - A **lower number** is typically better, indicating fewer distinct third-party connections.
  - No badge or an empty badge means no third-party connections were detected or the extension may not be active.

> <Tip>
> If the badge is missing, ensure the extension is installed correctly and enabled. Refer to the [Installation Steps](../introduction-installation/installation-steps) guide.
> </Tip>

## 2. View Filtered Domains in the Popup Interface

The popup interface breaks down connections into categories, giving you detailed insight:

1. **Open the Popup**
   - Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup window.
   - The popup automatically loads connection data for the active tab.

2. **Confirm Domain Information**
   - At the top, the popup displays the tab's domain and hostname.
   - Ensure it matches the website you just visited.

3. **Interpret the Sections**
   - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which resources were successfully loaded.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were redirected stealthily (usually due to content blockers).
   - **Blocked:** Domains that were blocked outright.

4. **Check Domain Counts**
   - The total count of connected domains is shown next to “domains connected”. Compare this count to the toolbar badge number.

> <Note>
> The popup uses Unicode-friendly domain names for display; you might see some domains in non-ASCII characters.
> </Note>

## 3. Verify Data Accuracy for Visited Sites

To ensure data integrity and that uBO Scope functions as intended, follow these steps:

1. **Open Several Websites**
   - Visit popular or trusted websites that are known to connect to third-party servers (e.g., news sites, social media).

2. **Monitor Badge Updates**
   - Observe the toolbar badge update dynamically as you navigate between sites.
   - The count should reflect new distinct third-party domains for each tab.

3. **Open Popup for Each Site**
   - Confirm the domain breakdown matches expected network activity.

4. **Refresh & Recheck**
   - Reload the page and observe if domain counts and popup data update accordingly.

> <Warning>
> If counts do not change upon page reload or navigation, uBO Scope might be inactive or permissions may be restricted by your browser settings. Review permissions and restart the browser.
> </Warning>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Quick Validation">
<Accordion title="Toolbar Badge Doesn't Appear or Update">
- Confirm that uBO Scope is enabled in your browser’s extension settings.
- Make sure you have granted required permissions, especially `activeTab` and `webRequest`.
- Restart your browser to refresh extension state.
- Check for browser version compatibility per the [Supported Browsers](../introduction-installation/supported-browsers-prerequisites) guide.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Empty">
- Verify you opened the popup on an active tab where network requests occurred.
- Refresh the page and reopen the popup.
- If the popup is still empty, try disabling other extensions that may interfere.
- Clear browser cache and reload.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count and Popup Counts Differ Significantly">
- The badge only counts distinct allowed domains, while the popup shows allowed, stealth, and blocked lists.
- Confirm that you are interpreting counts correctly: badge reflects allowed distinct domains only.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Tips for Effective Validation

- **Test with Real Websites:** Avoid synthetic 'ad-block test' sites; instead, use commonly visited sites with known third-party content.
- **Understand Badge Context:** Remember that a lower badge number is better as it represents fewer distinct third-party connections.
- **Use Multiple Tabs:** Validate that each tab’s badge and popup accurately reflect the active webpage.
