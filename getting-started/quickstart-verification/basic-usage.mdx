# Viewing Remote Connections

Discover how to open the uBO Scope extension popup and interpret the information it presents. This guide walks you through understanding the badge count, domain connection summaries, and the classification of connections as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked. By following a simple workflow, you will validate that uBO Scope is successfully capturing and displaying relevant network connection data.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

The uBO Scope extension displays real-time connection information about the active browser tab through its popup interface.

### Steps to Open the Popup:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope toolbar icon** in your browser. It typically appears near the address bar and looks like the uBO Scope logo.
2. Click the icon to open the popup window.
3. The popup will load, showing connection data for the currently active tab.

<Tip>
If you do not see the toolbar icon, ensure the extension is installed and enabled. Refer to the [Installing uBO Scope](../getting-started/installation-basics/installing-extension) guide for installation help.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface

Once the popup is open, it presents a concise summary of remote server connections associated with the active tab.

### Primary Interface Elements:

- **Badge Count (Toolbar Icon)**: Displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected to. A **lower count indicates fewer third-party connections**.
- **Tab Hostname and Domain**: The header shows the current tab's hostname with the base domain highlighted.
- **Summary Section**: Reports the total number of distinct domains connected to.
- **Outcome Sections**: Three categorized groups detailing network requests:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Third-party domains successfully connected.
  - **Stealth Blocked**: Requests that were redirected stealthily by other blockers or means.
  - **Blocked**: Explicitly blocked network connections.

### Domain Rows:
Each domain entry shows:
- The domain name (rendered in Unicode for readability)
- The count of connection attempts made to that domain

This breakdown helps identify which third-party servers are interacting with the page and their connection outcomes.

<Info>
The badge count reflects **distinct third-party domains with successful connections** (allowed). It excludes blocked and stealth-blocked requests since the goal is to reveal connections made, not blocked.
</Info>

## 3. Sample Workflow: Validating Data Capture

To ensure that uBO Scope is correctly capturing and displaying remote connection data, follow these practical steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a New Tab and Navigate">
Navigate to a website of your choice in a new tab. Choose a site known to load resources from third-party servers (e.g., popular news sites or social platforms).
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup to view connections for this tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Badge and Connection Counts">
- Observe the toolbar badge number. This shows how many distinct third-party domains have established connections.
- Check the summary section in the popup showing the total connected domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domain Connections by Category">
- Look at the "Not Blocked" section to identify domains successfully reached.
- Review "Stealth Blocked" for any requests silently redirected or blocked by stealth techniques.
- Note any domains listed under "Blocked," indicating explicitly blocked network requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Data Updates on Navigation or Refresh">
Navigate to a different website or refresh the tab. Reopen the popup to verify that connection data updates accurately.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Interpreting Connection Outcomes

Understanding the different connection statuses unlocks the full value of uBO Scope’s reporting.

| Outcome          | Description                                               | User Impact                                            |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**  | Requests that successfully reached remote domains.         | Indicates actual connections made, essential for privacy insights.|
| **Stealth Blocked** | Requests that were redirected or silently blocked by other blockers or browser behavior. | Represents attempts masked from normal detection; useful for advanced analysis.|
| **Blocked**      | Requests explicitly blocked due to rules or content blockers. | Shows where resource requests were prevented.

<Tip>
Users should expect that the number of Not Blocked domains is the primary metric in the badge count on the toolbar.
</Tip>

## 5. Common Questions and Troubleshooting

### Why is the badge count zero, but I see network activity?
- uBO Scope counts only **third-party remote servers** connections — requests to the first-party domain are excluded.
- The page might not load external resources or all requests are stealth-blocked or blocked.

### The popup shows "NO DATA" or is empty.
- Ensure you opened the popup on a tab with network activity.
- Wait a few seconds for uBO Scope to collect data after navigation or page load.
- Confirm the extension has required permissions and is enabled.

### Data does not update after navigation.
- Close and reopen the popup to refresh data.
- Refresh the tab or open a new tab to generate new connection data.

<Warning>
If the extension’s badge or popup fails to update consistently, verify your browser version meets the [Requirements & Supported Browsers](../getting-started/installation-basics/prerequisites) and uBO Scope is correctly installed and has activeTab and webRequest permissions.
</Warning>

## 6. Next Steps

- Explore the [Core Concepts & Terminology](../overview/concepts-architecture/core-concepts-terminology) page to deepen your understanding of connection types and domain grouping.
- After validating connections, visit [Interpreting Connection and Blocked Server Data](../guides/getting-started-essentials/interpreting-connection-data) to learn how to make informed decisions based on the data.
- For troubleshooting issues related to setup or permissions, refer to [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](../getting-started/quickstart-verification/troubleshooting-setup).

## Summary

Opening the uBO Scope popup provides a live, categorized view of third-party remote server connections initiated by the active tab. By interpreting the badge count and domain summaries under allowed, stealth, and blocked categories, users gain transparent insight into what servers their browser interacts with and the success or failure of network requests. Following the outlined workflow confirms that uBO Scope works as intended, presenting actionable data that empowers privacy-conscious browsing and filter list validation.
