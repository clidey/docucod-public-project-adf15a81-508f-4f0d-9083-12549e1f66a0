# Validating Installation of uBO Scope

Once uBO Scope is installed, the next essential step is confirming that it is actively monitoring your browser's network connections. This page guides you through quick, practical checks ensuring your installation works correctly, focusing on real-world validation by observing the extension's badge and network activity indicators.

---

## 1. Check the Extension Badge

After installing uBO Scope and granting necessary permissions (see the [First Launch & Basic Setup](../installation-setup/first-launch-basic-setup) guide), the extension icon appears in your browser toolbar. This icon includes a dynamic badge showing the count of remote server connections detected.

### Steps to verify the badge:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon** in your browser toolbar.
2. **Open any website** that typically loads remote resources (e.g., news sites, social media).
3. **Observe the badge number** overlaying the extension icon:
    - A non-zero count means uBO Scope is detecting network connections.
    - The count updates live as you navigate through tabs.

<Tip>
If the badge number remains zero after browsing several sites, uBO Scope may not have the required permissions or could be inactive. Review permissions under your browser’s extension settings.
</Tip>

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup to Inspect Connections

The extension popup provides a detailed view of active remote connections by category: allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

### How to open and interpret the popup:

1. **Click the uBO Scope icon** in the browser toolbar.
2. **Review the displayed summary:**
    - The total number of connected domains for the active tab.
    - Lists of domains grouped by connection outcome.
3. **Verify domain activity:**
    - Confirm you see domains relevant to the current webpage.
    - Confirm the connections are categorized correctly.

<Tip>
Try browsing a few popular and ad-heavy sites to see varied connection outcomes reflected instantly.
</Tip>

## 3. Real-World Validation Scenario

Perform a simple test browsing session to verify uBO Scope operates as expected.

<Steps>
<Step title="Start from a Clean Slate">
Close all tabs or restart your browser after installation to ensure a fresh monitoring session.
</Step>
<Step title="Navigate to a Common Website">
Open a popular site such as https://example.com or any news portal.
</Step>
<Step title="Watch uBO Scope Badge Update">
Notice the numeric badge appear or increase, representing active connections detected.
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the extension icon and review the domains and their connection statuses.
</Step>
<Step title="Change Tabs or Websites">
Switch between tabs or load different web pages to observe real-time badge and popup updates.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Confirm uBO Scope is Actively Monitoring

If you observe badge updates aligned with your browsing and see connection data reflected in the popup for active tabs, your installation is successful and actively monitoring.

### What to do if the badge does not update or displays no data:

- Ensure all extension permissions were granted during installation (refer to the [First Launch & Basic Setup](../installation-setup/first-launch-basic-setup)).
- Reload the browser or restart to activate background processes.
- Check for browser compatibility and version requirements as noted in [Prerequisites & System Requirements](../installation-setup/prerequisites-system-requirements).

<Tip>
Some browsers may suspend background extension processes during inactivity; interacting with the extension icon often reactivates monitoring.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Validation Steps">
<Accordion title="The Badge is Not Visible or Shows Zero Always">
