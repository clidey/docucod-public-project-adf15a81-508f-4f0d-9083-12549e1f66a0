# Troubleshooting Common Issues in uBO Scope

This guide helps you quickly resolve frequent problems encountered during the setup and use of uBO Scope, such as missing extension icons, badge count not updating, or absence of connection data in the popup interface. Follow the step-by-step solutions below to get uBO Scope working smoothly, with guidance on where to seek further help if problems persist.

---

## 1. Extension Icon Missing or Not Visible in Toolbar

If you cannot find the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar after installation, complete these steps:

1. **Check Browser Extension Toolbar:**
   - Chrome, Firefox, and Safari sometimes hide newly installed extensions under an overflow menu or extensions submenu. Look for the extensions puzzle icon in Chrome or the addons menu in Firefox.

2. **Pin the Extension:**
   - In Chrome, click the puzzle icon, find 'uBO Scope', and click the pin icon to make it permanently visible on the toolbar.
   - In Firefox, open the Add-ons Manager (`about:addons`), find uBO Scope, and ensure it is enabled. Drag the icon to the toolbar if needed.
   
3. **Restart the Browser:**
   - Fully close and restart your browser to refresh extension loading.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Confirm the extension is properly installed by navigating to your browser’s extension list page (`chrome://extensions/` or `about:addons`).

<Warning>
Hiding or disabling the extension icon prevents you from seeing the badge count and opening the popup UI, which are essential to use uBO Scope effectively.
</Warning>

## 2. Badge Count Is Not Updating or Always Zero

The badge number reflects the count of distinct third-party domains connected by the active tab. If it does not update or remains zero:

1. **Active Tab Check:** Ensure the tab you are viewing is active and has network activity. Reload the tab or visit a new site.

2. **Permissions Confirmation:**
   - uBO Scope requires ‘webRequest’ permission to monitor network requests.
   - Verify that the extension has permissions enabled by checking the extension details page in your browser.

3. **Browser Compatibility and Version:**
   - uBO Scope supports Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, and Safari 18.5+. Check your browser version and update if outdated.

4. **Content-Security and Network Policies:**
   - Certain enterprise or security policies may block extensions from accessing network requests.
   - Test in another browser profile or disable conflicting extensions to isolate the problem.

5. **Reload or Reinstall Extension:**
   - Toggle the extension off and on in your browser's extensions page.
   - As a last resort, uninstall and reinstall uBO Scope.

<Note>
The badge only counts third-party remote servers. Some pages with little or no third-party content will naturally show zero.
</Note>

## 3. Popup UI Shows "NO DATA" or Blank Connections

If clicking the uBO Scope icon opens the popup but it shows "NO DATA" or empty domain lists:

1. **Ensure You Are on an HTTP(S)/WSS Tab:**
   - uBO Scope monitors standard web protocols. Pages with unsupported protocols will yield no data.

2. **Refresh the Tab:**
   - Load or reload the page fully to generate network events.

3. **Verify Network Activity:**
   - Try browsing to popular websites that have known third-party connections.

4. **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies:**
   - Sometimes stale data or browser caching can interfere with network request monitoring.

5. **Check Extension Storage:**
   - uBO Scope saves session data locally. Issues with local browser storage can prevent data display.
   - Restart your browser to reset storage.

6. **Disable Other Content Blockers Temporarily:**
   - Other extensions actively blocking network requests could prevent uBO Scope from seeing connections. Temporarily disable other blockers to check.

## 4. Unexpected or Incorrect Badge Counts

If the badge count seems higher or lower than expected:

- Remember the badge counts **distinct third-party domains** connected by the active tab.
- Some domains, like popular CDNs, legitimately serve many sites.
- Content blockers can alter network requests, impacting counts.

If you suspect incorrect counts:

- Compare results after restarting your browser.
- Test on different websites to verify consistency.

## 5. Common Fixes to Try Immediately

- **Restart your browser completely.**
- **Refresh the current tab or open a new one.**
- **Verify extension permissions and ensure it is enabled.**
- **Disable potentially conflicting extensions temporarily.**
- **Update your browser to the latest version.**

## 6. Reporting Issues or Getting More Help
