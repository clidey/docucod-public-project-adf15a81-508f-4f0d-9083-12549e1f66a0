# Interpreting the Badge and Popup

Understanding the toolbar icon badge and popup UI in uBO Scope is essential to quickly evaluating the third-party connections a webpage makes. This page guides you through what the badge numbers mean, how to interpret the three categories of domains displayed—allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked—and how to use this insight to assess the privacy and network activity of websites.

---

## 1. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The toolbar badge on the uBO Scope icon represents **the number of distinct third-party domains that your browser has successfully connected to from the active tab.** 

- **Lower counts are generally better** — fewer third-party connections mean less exposure.
- The count reflects only the domains that were **allowed** and actually connected, not those blocked or stealth-blocked.

### Key Points
- The badge shows only the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.
- It excludes first-party domains (the website you’re actively visiting).
- It does **not** count blocked or stealth-blocked domains.

### What You See
- If the badge is empty (no number), either no third-party connections are detected or the tab has not yet loaded or triggered any network requests.

<Tip>
The badge helps you quickly gauge the breadth of third-party connections made by the current webpage at a glance, without diving deep into details.

## 2. The Popup UI: Detailed Breakdown of Connections

Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup. This interface provides a categorized view of the third-party domains contacted:

| Section           | Meaning                                                      | Use Case                                                             |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**   | Domains connected successfully without interference          | Indicates allowed third-party servers and how many requests each made |
| **Stealth-Blocked**| Domains where requests were redirected or stealthily blocked | Shows requests blocked in subtle or non-obvious ways, e.g., stealth blocking
|
| **Blocked**       | Domains with network requests that failed or were actively blocked | Represents explicit blocks preventing resource loading |

### Popup Structure
- **Header**: Displays the current tab’s hostname and its base domain.
- **Summary**: Shows the total count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Domains Sections**: Each categorizes domains with the count of requests for that domain.

### How to Read Counts
- Counts next to each domain indicate how many individual requests were made to that domain.
- These counts provide context about the prevalence of each third-party connection.

### Examples
- A CDN domain with many requests may be common and legitimate.
- A blocked domain may point to trackers or unwanted advertisers.
- Stealth-blocked domains suggest behind-the-scenes blocks which may be harder to detect otherwise.

## 3. Using Badge and Popup to Evaluate Webpages

With this information, you can:

- **Identify Potential Privacy Concerns**: Large counts of allowed third-party domains could indicate higher tracking exposure.
- **Verify Blocker Effectiveness**: Confirm that known trackers or unwanted domains appear under 'Blocked' or 'Stealth-Blocked'.
- **Spot Unusual Connections**: Unexpected allowed domains might warrant scrutiny or additional blocking.

### Practical Workflow
<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the Toolbar Badge">
    Observe the badge number after loading a webpage. A high count might mean many third-party connections.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Popup for Details">
    Click the icon to see the detailed list of connected domains separated by their status.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
    Look for domains you recognize as legitimate or necessary (e.g., common CDNs).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Blocked and Stealth-Blocked Sections">
    Ensure trackers or suspicious domains appear here, confirming your blocker is active.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Informed Decisions">
    If you notice suspicious allowed domains, consider updating your filters or adjusting blocking rules.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Remember that not all third-party connections are bad. Some are essential for site functionality, like fonts or content delivery networks.

## 4. Glossary of Terms

| Term             | Description                                                                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Allowed**      | Domains where network requests succeeded without being blocked                       |
| **Blocked**      | Domains where network requests failed due to active blocking                         |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains with requests redirected or blocked implicitly without obvious failure       |
| **Third-party Domain** | Any domain different from the site you are currently visiting                       |

## 5. Troubleshooting and Tips

### If the Badge Shows No Number
- The page may not have made any third-party connections yet.
- The extension might not have permission or could be paused.
- Verify installation and that the tab is fully loaded.

### If Expected Domains Are Missing
- Some network requests might bypass the browser’s `webRequest` API (e.g., certain WebSocket connections).
- Content blockers or browser privacy settings might interfere.

### Best Practices
- Refresh the page to get updated data.
- Use the popup combined with other uBO Scope pages (like 'Validating Installation') to troubleshoot.
- Regularly review your content blocker’s filters based on insights gathered.

<Note>
The badge and popup provide a snapshot of network dynamics but should be combined with other tools for comprehensive analysis.
