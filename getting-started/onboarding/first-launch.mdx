# Launching uBO Scope for the First Time

Welcome to your first interaction with **uBO Scope** — a powerful yet lightweight browser extension designed to reveal all network connections your browser tabs make, whether allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked. This guide helps you open the extension popup, understand the toolbar badge count, and take your first look at the user interface so that you can immediately start appreciating your browser’s network transparency.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

Upon installation, uBO Scope adds its icon to your browser's toolbar. The icon acts as your gateway to detailed network connection information for the active tab.

### Steps to Open:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar—it typically appears as the extension logo.
2. Click the icon once to open the **popup window**.

<Tip>
If you do not see the icon immediately, it might be in your extension overflow menu or hidden. Pin or enable it via your browser's extensions/preferences menu.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The numeric badge on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon represents the **number of distinct third-party remote servers to which the active tab has connected successfully and were not blocked**.

- A **lower badge count is better**, indicating fewer third-party connections.
- This count **excludes** stealth-blocked or explicitly blocked servers.

### Why this matters:

This badge gives you a simple, at-a-glance view of how many external servers your browsing session interacts with, providing transparency beyond what traditional content blockers reveal.

<Note>
The badge count updates in near-real-time as your browsing activity triggers network requests.
</Note>

## 3. First Look at the Popup User Interface

Opening the popup reveals a clean, categorized summary of network connections made by the active tab:

### Main Elements:

- **Hostname Header**: Displays the current tab's main hostname or 'NO DATA' if no requests are captured yet.
- **Summary Section**: Shows the total number of distinct connected domains.
- **Outcome Sections**: Divided into three categories:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains whose network requests succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains that were stealth-blocked, meaning the extension detected blocking that is intentionally hidden.
  - **Blocked**: Domains with network requests that were outright blocked.

Each outcome section lists the domains contacted alongside a badge indicating the number of requests made to each.

### Viewing Domain Details

- Domains appear as rows with their names and request counts.
- You can hover or visually scan these sections to understand the distribution of connections.

<Tip>
The categorization helps isolate which domains could be privacy concerns or have been affected by content blocking.
</Tip>

## 4. What to Expect After Your First Launch

- Initially, the popup might display 'NO DATA' if no network events have occurred yet.
- As you browse, domains will populate under the three outcome categories.
- The toolbar badge will reflect the count of allowed third-party domains dynamically.

<Warning>
If the badge remains empty or the popup shows no data after extensive browsing, verify that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions and is enabled correctly in your browser.
</Warning>

## 5. Practical Tips for Using uBO Scope Efficiently

- **Browse actively on multiple tabs and different sites to see the extension in action.**
- **Check the badge often** to watch changes in third-party connections as you navigate.
- Use the popup's categorization to understand how your content blocker or network setup affects the traffic.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Initial Issues

### Issue: Popup shows "NO DATA" continuously
- Ensure the extension is enabled for the current browser profile.
- Confirm uBO Scope has permissions for `webRequest` and `activeTab` in your browser settings.
- Reload the tab or restart the browser if necessary.

### Issue: Badge does not update
- Check network activity in the browser developer tools to verify if requests are happening.
- Verify that your browser version meets the minimum requirement (e.g., Firefox 128+, Chromium 122+).
- Ensure no other extension conflicts interfere with uBO Scope's network monitoring.

<Tip>
Refer to the `System Requirements & Prerequisites` and `Troubleshooting Common Issues` guides for detailed environment validation and fixes.
</Tip>
