# Installation on Supported Browsers

This guide leads you through installing uBO Scope on the three major supported browsers: **Chrome**, **Firefox**, and **Safari**. You will find step-by-step instructions for both installing from official browser stores and manual installation methods for advanced users or testing purposes.

The extension is available for:

- **Google Chrome (Chromium-based browsers)**
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Apple Safari**

### Important Notes

- Minimum browser versions are required for smooth operation: Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+.

## 3. Manual Installation (Developer or Advanced Users)

Manual installation is helpful if you want to test development versions or sideload the extension without using official stores.

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
cd uBO-Scope
```

### Step 2: Build the Extension Package

Depending on your target browser, run one of the following scripts in a Linux environment:

- **For Chrome:**
  ```bash
  ./tools/make-chromium.sh
  ```
  This generates a `.zip` package inside `build/uBO-Scope.chromium.zip`.

- **For Firefox:**
  ```bash
  ./tools/make-firefox.sh
  ```
  This produces an `.xpi` file inside `build/uBO-Scope.firefox.xpi`.

- **For Safari:**
  ```bash
  ./tools/make-safari.sh
  ```
  The packaged `.zip` will be located in `build/uBO-Scope.safari.zip`.

<Note>
Make sure you have necessary tools installed like `zip` and Git.
</Note>

### Step 3: Load the Extension Manually into Your Browser

#### Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions` in your browser.
2. Enable **Developer mode** toggle (top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the unpacked extension folder (e.g., `build/uBO-Scope.chromium`).
5. Confirm it is loaded and enabled.

#### Firefox

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Select the `.xpi` file generated (`build/uBO-Scope.firefox.xpi`).
4. The extension will load temporarily until Firefox restarts.

#### Safari

1. Open Safari and go to **Preferences** > **Extensions**.
2. Click **More Extensions…** to open the App Store or install manually by extracting the package.
3. If sideloading, use Safari’s **Extensions Developer Mode** to add the unpacked extension.

<Warning>
Manual installs do not receive automatic updates. Use official stores for production.
</Warning>

## 4. Verifying Installation Success

Once installed, verify uBO Scope is working:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar.
2. The icon badge will appear when you navigate to any webpage that connects to remote servers, showing the count of distinct third-party domains.
3. Click the icon to open the popup UI and observe connection details.
4. Check the browser’s extension page to ensure uBO Scope is enabled and permissions granted.

<Check>
If the extension icon does not show up or no badge appears, verify the browser version and confirm network permissions.
</Check>
