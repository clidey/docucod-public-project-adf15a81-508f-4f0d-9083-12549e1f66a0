# First Run & Quick Validation

Welcome to your first run of uBO Scope! This guide will help you confirm that your installation is working correctly, teach you how to open the extension popup, interpret the toolbar badge, and view your initial report of remote server connections. You'll also find basic troubleshooting tips for any common issues that might arise when you launch uBO Scope for the first time.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

After installing uBO Scope in your browser, you can begin monitoring third-party remote server connections immediately.

### Steps:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like the extension's logo (refer to your browser's extension area).
2. Click the uBO Scope icon once to open its popup window.

### What You’ll See:

- A header displaying the current tab’s hostname and domain.
- A summary of the number of distinct connected domains.
- Three sections categorizing domains as **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

<Tip>
You can keep the popup open and observe how it updates dynamically as you navigate to different tabs or reload pages.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The number displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon represents the count of distinct third-party remote servers your browser has connected to from the active tab.

### Key Points:

- **This count reflects successful connections** — it is _not_ the number of blocked connections.
- A lower number means fewer third-party connections, which is generally better for privacy.
- The badge updates automatically as network activity changes in the current tab.

<Info>
The badge count excludes the main site domain and counts only third-party domains.
</Info>

## 3. Viewing Your First Report of Remote Connections

When the extension popup opens, it will display detailed lists of domains encountered in the current tab’s network activity, divided as follows:

- **Not Blocked**: Domains the browser successfully connected to without interference.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where blocking occurred but in a stealth mode to avoid detection.
- **Blocked**: Domains explicitly blocked or resulting in network errors.

### How to Read the Report:

- Each domain entry shows the domain name and the number of requests made.
- The main domain of the active tab is displayed at the top.

### Example:

```plaintext
Host: example.com
Domains connected: 12

Not blocked
 - cdn.examplecdn.com (5)
 - tracker.analytics.com (2)

Stealth-blocked
 - ads.blockedtracker.net (3)

Blocked
 - adserver.blockedads.com (1)
```

This helps you grasp exactly which third-party servers are active, stealth-blocked, or blocked on the current page.

## 4. Quick Validation Checklist

Use this checklist to verify your installation is functioning:

- [ ] The uBO Scope icon appears in your browser toolbar.
- [ ] Clicking the icon opens the popup showing the hostname for the current tab.
- [ ] The toolbar badge shows a numeric count or is empty (indicating zero third-party connections).
- [ ] The popup lists domains under the three categories with count values.
- [ ] Navigating to a known site triggers domain updates in the popup and badge.

<Tip>
If you don’t see data, try refreshing the active tab or opening a different website.
</Tip>

## 5. Basic Troubleshooting Tips

Encountering issues on your first run? Here are common problems and how to resolve them:

### Problem: Extension icon missing or popup doesn’t open
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled in your browser’s extensions/settings area.
- Check your browser version meets the minimum (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Restart your browser to refresh extension state.

### Problem: Badge count remains blank or no data appears
- Confirm network permissions are granted (webRequest, activeTab, storage).
- Try loading a different website; minimal or no third-party connections may show as empty.
- Some network requests might not be observable due to browser or content blocker restrictions.

### Problem: Domains not updating
- Refresh the page to trigger new network events.
- Wait a few seconds as the extension batches and processes network data periodically.
- Verify your browser’s privacy settings do not block the extension’s network monitoring.

<Warning>
uBO Scope relies on the browser’s native webRequest API. Private browsing or incognito mode may limit visibility.
</Warning>
