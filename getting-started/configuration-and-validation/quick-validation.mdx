# Quick Validation & Troubleshooting

This guide provides simple, actionable steps to confirm that uBO Scope is correctly tracking third-party connections as intended. It also addresses common issues new users might face during installation or first use and offers targeted troubleshooting tips to resolve them swiftly.

## 1. Confirming uBO Scope Is Tracking Network Connections

Follow this straightforward workflow to ensure uBO Scope is active and monitoring third-party connections on your browser:

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Icon

- Look for the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser's toolbar.
- The icon displays a badge counter indicating how many third-party domains uBO Scope detected as allowed on the active tab.

### Step 2: Open the Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope icon to open its popup panel.
- You should see a domain summary for the current tab including:
  - The main site domain name
  - Counts of domains in categories: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**

### Step 3: Visit a Known Network-Active Page

- Navigate to a popular website known to load third-party content (e.g., news site or popular social media).
- Refresh the page.
- Confirm that the badge count on the uBO Scope icon updates with a number greater than zero.
- Reopen the popup panel to verify domains are listed under the appropriate categories.

### Step 4: Validate Domain Listing Updates

- Perform a few website reloads and tab switches.
- Confirm that the popup data updates dynamically with network connection activity per tab.

<Tip>
If you do not see any data or the badge count remains empty after visiting websites, this indicates uBO Scope might not be monitoring correctly.

## 2. Common Issues and How to Fix Them

Below are frequent problems and their resolutions encountered during initial installation or first use.

### Issue 1: Badge Counter Does Not Appear or Stays Empty

**Cause:** Browser permissions not granted, extension not fully installed, or version incompatibility.

**How to Fix:**

1. Verify your browser version meets the minimum requirements:
   - Chromium 122+
   - Firefox 128+
   - Safari 18.5+
2. Ensure uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled (see the [Installing uBO Scope](../setup-overview/installing) guide).
3. Confirm that the browser has granted the `webRequest` and `storage` permissions to the extension.
4. Reload or restart your browser to refresh extension states.
5. Revisit a network-active web page and check the badge again.

<Tip>
Check for any conflicting extensions that might interfere with webRequest listeners; temporarily disabling other extensions can help isolate the problem.
</Tip>

### Issue 2: No Domain Data in Popup Panel (Shows NO DATA)

**Cause:** Extension not capturing network events or corrupted session data.

**How to Fix:**

1. Try refreshing the active tab.
2. Close and reopen the uBO Scope popup panel.
3. Restart the browser.
4. Clear session data by disabling and re-enabling the extension or reinstalling.

### Issue 3: Unexpected or Missing Domains in the Lists

**Cause:** Delays in network event processing or popup refresh timings.

**How to Fix:**

- Wait a few seconds after page load before opening the popup panel to ensure all connections are recorded.
- Refresh the popup manually by closing and opening it again.

### Issue 4: Extension Not Functioning on Certain Websites

**Cause:** Browser-specific limitations or manifest host permissions.

**How to Fix:**

- Confirm that the extension has host permissions matching the site’s URL (includes HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket protocols).
- Check the [Browser Support & Compatibility](../feature-overview/browser-integration) documentation for platform-specific notes.

## 3. Quick Troubleshooting Checklist

Use this checklist when you run into problems:

- Is uBO Scope installed and enabled in your browser’s extensions page?
- Does your browser version meet minimum requirements?
- Does the uBO Scope icon show in the toolbar?
- Are the correct permissions granted? (webRequest, activeTab, host permissions)
- Have you visited a page known to load third-party connections?
- Does the badge show a count? If not, try refreshing or restarting the browser.
- Can you see domain lists inside the popup panel after page load?
- Have you tried disabling other extensions temporarily to rule out conflicts?

## 4. Additional Diagnostic Steps

If the above fixes do not work, consider these advanced checks:

- Open your browser’s developer tools and monitor the **Console** for errors related to uBO Scope.
- Check the extension background page/service worker status and logs.
- Backup and reset extension settings if corrupted data storage is suspected.
- Visit the [First Launch and Verifying Installation](../setup-overview/first-launch) page to repeat validation steps.

<Tip>
Use the popup UI regularly to confirm real-time monitoring after any browser or extension changes.
</Tip>
