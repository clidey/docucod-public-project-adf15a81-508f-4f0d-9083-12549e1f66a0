# Quick Validation Steps for uBO Scope

Welcome to your first validation check of uBO Scope! This guide walks you through confirming that uBO Scope is actively tracking remote domain connections when you visit websites. By following these steps, you'll verify your installation is functioning correctly, understand what the toolbar badge counts signify, and learn how to interpret the domain connection results shown in the extension popup.

---

## 1. Confirm Your Installation Is Active

Before verifying connection tracking, ensure uBO Scope is installed and active in your browser.

### Steps:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It appears as a small icon labeled `uBO Scope`.
2. Check for the badge count overlay on the icon, which shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected for the current tab.
3. If the icon is not visible:
   - For Chrome and Firefox, verify the extension is enabled via `chrome://extensions` or `about:addons`.
   - For Safari, check in Safari Extensions preferences.
4. Open the extension popup by clicking the uBO Scope icon.

### Success Criteria:

- The extension icon is visible and active.
- The badge may show a number or be blank (both are normal depending on site activity).
- The popup window opens when you click the extension icon.

<Tip>
If the icon is missing, restart your browser and ensure uBO Scope is installed from the official store:

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- Safari Extensions (via Safari settings)
</Tip>

## 2. Visit a Website and Open uBO Scope Popup

To observe how uBO Scope tracks connections, load any website and inspect the popup UI.

### Steps:

1. Open a new tab in your browser.
2. Navigate to any website of your choice (e.g., `https://example.com`).
3. Wait a few seconds for network requests to register.
4. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.

### What You Will See:

- **Domains Connected:** At the top, the summary shows the total number of distinct domains connected on the current tab.
- **Domain Status Sections:** The popup is divided into three sections:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains to which connections were allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains blocked silently to avoid page breakage.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were explicitly blocked.

<Tip>
The badge count on the icon corresponds to the number of distinct allowed domains, focusing on third-party connections.
</Tip>

## 3. Understanding the Badge Counts

The badge number reflects the number of distinct third-party domains your current tab is connecting to.

### Key Points:

- A **lower badge count** is generally better, indicating fewer third-party connections.
- **Not all third-party domains are harmful**; many are CDNs or legitimate services.
- The count **excludes first-party domains** directly associated with the website.

<Tip>
Check the 'Not blocked' section first to identify which domains your browser communicates with and assess if they align with your privacy expectations.
</Tip>

## 4. Interpreting the Popup Outcome Sections

The connection outcomes are categorized to give insight into network activity:

| Section          | Meaning                                                               |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked      | Connections initiated and successfully completed (allowed domains).   |
| Stealth-Blocked  | Connections silently blocked to prevent disruption (hidden from page).|
| Blocked          | Connections explicitly blocked by your content blocker or extension.  |

### Tips for Effective Interpretation:

- **A domain listed under 'Not Blocked'** indicates successful communication.
- **'Stealth-Blocked' domains** may still load content unobtrusively without user awareness.
- **Blocked domains** confirm your content blocker or uBO Scope prevented the connection.

<Note>
Opacity or invisibility of stealth-blocked domains in some interfaces is deliberate, and you should consider them when evaluating your privacy posture.
</Note>

## 5. Verify Tracking Is Working

To confirm that uBO Scope is actively tracking connections:

### Steps:

1. Open a known content-heavy site with many third-party requests (e.g., news, e-commerce).
2. Open the uBO Scope popup and observe domain sections populate.
3. Reload the page and repeat the check to see fresh domain data.
4. Monitor the badge number on the icon—it should update to reflect the count of allowed connections.

### Success Criteria:

- You see domains listed under the 'Not Blocked' section.
- The badge count changes according to the number of distinct connected domains.
- Domains appear or update after page reloads, indicating active monitoring.

<Warning>
If the popup remains empty or the badge never changes after multiple page loads, your browser may restrict the webRequest API or uBO Scope extension permissions might be disabled. See the Troubleshooting guide for help.
</Warning>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Symptom: uBO Scope popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty domain lists
- Make sure the extension is granted necessary permissions and is enabled.
- Reload the website and wait a few seconds for data.
- Verify your browser version meets the minimum requirements (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

### Symptom: Badge count never changes or stays zero
- Check if uBO Scope has access to network request data.
- Disable other conflicting extensions that might interfere with webRequest.

### Symptom: Domains do not categorize correctly
- uBO Scope relies on the browser's network API; some network requests outside its scope won't appear.
