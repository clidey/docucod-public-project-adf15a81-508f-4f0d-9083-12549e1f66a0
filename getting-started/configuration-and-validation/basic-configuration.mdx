# Basic Configuration

Discover how uBO Scope is configured by default, the permissions it requires, what data you can view in its popup interface, and the extent of user customization. This page guides you through settings that affect your experience without diving into the internal implementation.

---

## 1. Extension Permissions Overview

uBO Scope requires a concise set of permissions to monitor and present network request data effectively while respecting your privacy and browser security:

- **`activeTab`**: Enables uBO Scope to interact with the active browser tab to display connection data scoped to the current page.
- **`storage`**: Allows storing session data locally for retaining connection info per tab.
- **`webRequest`**: Provides access to observe network requests made by pages.
- **`host_permissions`**: Grants permission to access URLs matching `http://*/*`, `https://*/*` and WebSocket URLs on supported browsers. This allows tracking of connections across a wide range of sites.

<Tip>
These permissions are minimal and focused strictly on capturing network activity relevant to the tab you are analyzing. uBO Scope does not require broad or invasive permissions unrelated to its core functionality.
</Tip>

## 2. Default Settings and Behaviors

uBO Scope operates with sensible default settings to ensure ease of use and immediate value upon installation:

- Automatically listens to all network requests matching the permissions and records three categories based on network outcome:
  - **Allowed (not blocked)** — requests that succeeded.
  - **Stealth-blocked** — requests redirected or rendered stealthy by blocking.
  - **Blocked** — requests that did not complete due to explicit blocking or errors.
- Tracks connection data per browser tab separately, keeping data fresh and isolated to the active content.
- Displays a real-time **toolbar badge** with the count of distinct third-party domains allowed on the current tab.
- Shows detailed domain lists categorized by their outcome in the popup UI with counts.

<Check>
No manual configuration is required to start seeing data. Installation and activation instantly enable these default behaviors.

## 3. Popup Interface Information Display

The popup window displays live, tab-specific network connection data in three clear categories:

| Category          | Description                               | Visual Cue                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**   | Domains that loaded successfully          | Green section with domain counts   |
| **Stealth-blocked** | Domains that were silently blocked or redirected | Red section showing stealth blocking |
| **Blocked**       | Domains explicitly blocked or failed      | Red section with blocked domains   |

Each entry shows the domain and a badge with the count of connections from that domain.

### What You See in the Popup

- The **top heading** shows the top-level domain or hostname of the current tab, or 'NO DATA' if no information is available.
- The **summary section** displays the total number of distinct connected domains.
- Individual sections group domains by connection outcome, helping you quickly identify which third-party connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

<Info>
The popup UI refreshes dynamically with your browsing activity to maintain accurate, session-scoped visibility.

## 4. Customization and User Control

uBO Scope emphasizes privacy transparency and minimal user intervention, which means:

- **No extensive settings panel**: The extension is designed for zero-configuration.
- **No user-defined filtering** inside uBO Scope — it passively reports outcomes from the browser and content blockers.
- **Data Reset:** Session data is automatically managed per tab, clearing when tabs close.

### What You Can Customize

Currently, users cannot customize how domains are classified or filtered within the popup. The extension’s behavior reflects real-time browser network outcomes.

### Recommended Usage Tips

- Use uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blocker to audit filter effectiveness.
- Regularly review the popup’s domain categories to spot unexpected or stealthy connections.

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **No data in popup:** This usually means uBO Scope does not have permission for the current tab’s site or the tab has no network activity tracked yet.
- **Badge count missing:** Ensure the extension is enabled and the browser supports its permissions; some restrictive environments (corporate settings or private windows) might limit functionality.
- **Unexpected domains:** Domains in the "Not Blocked" list represent allowed connections by your current blocker settings.

For configuration troubleshooting, refer to the setup guides and troubleshooting documentation.

### Example: Viewing Connection Data

1. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
2. See the top heading showing your current tab’s domain.
3. Review the number of distinct third-party domains connected in the summary.
4. Inspect domains under each section:
   - Green (allowed)
   - Red (stealth-blocked or blocked)
5. Use this live data to understand and audit your web traffic.

<Tip>
If you notice unexpectedly allowed domains, consider adjusting your content blocker settings to improve privacy.
