# Basic Configuration and Settings

Welcome to the basic configuration guide for uBO Scope. This guide walks you through essential and optional settings after installation to ensure uBO Scope operates effectively and provides meaningful insights. You'll learn how to manage permissions, understand badge count behavior, and customize notifications to suit your workflow.

---

## 1. Granting Required Permissions

uBO Scope requires several permissions to reliably monitor network connections across websites. These must be granted during or after installation for full functionality.

### Required Permissions

- **activeTab**: Allows uBO Scope to access the currently active tab to correlate network activity.
- **storage**: Enables saving session data and user settings.
- **webRequest**: Essential for monitoring network requests and classifying them.

### Browser Permission Checks

To verify permissions:
1. Open your browser's extension management page:
    - **Chrome/Chromium**: `chrome://extensions/`
    - **Firefox**: `about:addons`
    - **Safari**: Safari Extensions Preferences
2. Locate uBO Scope and ensure the above permissions are enabled.

<Tip>
If permissions were denied during installation or if uBO Scope displays "No Data", revisit this page to re-grant permissions or reinstall the extension.
</Tip>

## 2. Badge Count: What It Means and When It Appears

The uBO Scope badge count is a powerful visual indicator summarizing allowed remote domains connected by the active tab. Understanding its logic helps you quickly assess network activity without opening the popup.

### Badge Count Logic

- **Represents:** The number of unique domains that the current tab's page has connected to and were **allowed** (not blocked or stealthily blocked).
- **Shown When:** There is at least one allowed domain.
- **Hidden When:** There are no allowed domains to report.

### How Badge Updates Occur

- The badge updates dynamically as network requests complete.
- Navigating to a new page resets counts, reflecting fresh network activity.

### Badge Color and Style

- The badge text shows the count as a number.
- No color changes are applied normally; it blends with the browser's standard extension icon.

<Info>
The badge does *not* count blocked or stealth-blocked domains to avoid confusion and to focus on actual allowed server connections.
</Info>

## 3. Optional Customization and Notifications

uBO Scope’s current configuration focuses on lightweight monitoring and minimal user disruption. However, you may want to customize some behaviors indirectly through browser features or extension settings.

### Notifications

- uBO Scope does not provide automatic popup or system push notifications for network events.
- Use the badge count and popup panel to monitor activity interactively.

### Settings and Preferences

- No configurable options exist within the extension UI for notifications or alerts.
- For advanced control, consider browser-level notifications or companion tools.

### Suggested Workflow

- Rely on the badge count as a passive alert that connections have occurred.
- Click the extension icon to open the popup panel for detailed domain status.

<Tip>
Keep the badge visible to get immediate visual feedback on network activity per tab.
</Tip>

## 4. How to Reset or Clear Session Data

uBO Scope stores connection details per browser tab during active sessions. You can clear this data to start fresh or troubleshoot.

### Clearing Session Data

1. Close the browser tab monitored by uBO Scope; it automatically clears associated data.
2. Restart the browser to clear all in-memory data.
3. For deeper clearing of stored sessions:
    - Use browser settings to clear extension storage data.
    - Alternatively, uninstall and reinstall the extension.

<Warning>
Clearing stored session data removes all historical connection counts and domain tracking for open tabs.
</Warning>

## 5. Understanding When uBO Scope Is Monitoring

Knowing when uBO Scope actively monitors network requests helps you interpret badge and popup data accurately.

### Active Monitoring Criteria

- The tab must be active and loaded with a webpage.
- The domain must be accessible under the configured host permissions (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, etc.).
- Requests initiated by the page or its frames are monitored and classified as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

### When Monitoring Pauses or Stops

- If the tab closes, monitoring for that tab stops automatically.
- If the extension service worker or background script is evicted by the browser, monitoring temporarily halts but resumes automatically.

<Note>
The badge may not update instantly if the browser delays background processes; allow a few moments after navigation to see refreshed counts.
</Note>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Configuration Issues

Encountering issues with the badge not appearing or no connection data shown can frustrate new users. Here’s how to resolve frequent problems.

### Symptom: Badge Count Missing or Shows Zero Despite Active Connections

- Ensure uBO Scope has the `webRequest` and `activeTab` permissions.
- Refresh or reload the browser tab.
- Confirm you are visiting an HTTP or HTTPS page; monitoring may not work on certain local or internal URLs.

### Symptom: No Data in Popup Panel

- Verify the extension icon is enabled and working.
- Check for conflicting extensions that might interfere with permissions.
- Restart the browser to reset extension state.

### Symptom: Badge Not Clearing Between Tabs or Navigations

- Wait a few seconds after navigation; the extension clears and updates counts asynchronously.
- Ensure no browser caching or session-restoration features are interfering.
