# Troubleshooting Installation & First Use

This guide helps you resolve common issues encountered during the installation and initial use of **uBO Scope**. Whether the toolbar badge is missing, the popup does not function, or the extension doesn’t seem to work in your browser, follow these practical steps to identify and fix these problems quickly.

---

## 1. Confirm Installation and Browser Compatibility

Before troubleshooting deeper issues, verify that your environment meets **uBO Scope**'s system requirements and that the extension is correctly installed.

### Steps to Verify:

1. **Check Supported Browsers and Versions:**
   - **Chrome:** Version 122 or later.
   - **Firefox:** Version 128 or later.
   - **Safari:** Version 18.5 or later.

2. **Verify the Extension is Installed:**
   - Open your browser’s extensions page.
   - Confirm "uBlock Origin Scope" is listed and enabled.

3. **Confirm Permissions:**
   - The extension requires `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` permissions.
   - Your browser should automatically grant these on installation.

4. **Restart Your Browser:**
   - After installation, restart your browser to ensure all components initialize.

<Tip>
If your browser version is older than the minimum required, update the browser first. Unsupported versions will prevent **uBO Scope** from working correctly.
</Tip>

## 2. Toolbar Badge Icon Not Showing

The toolbar badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party domains connected to the active tab. If the badge does not appear:

### Troubleshooting Steps:

- **Verify Extension Icon Visibility:**
  - Ensure the extension icon is not hidden behind overflow menus or disabled.
  - Pin the extension to your toolbar for easy access.

- **Check Active Tab Status:**
  - Badge updates only on active, web page tabs (not internal browser pages).
  - Try loading a common website (e.g., https://example.com) to generate network data.

- **Clear Extension Data:**
  - Sometimes stale data can cause badge anomalies.
  - Disable and re-enable the extension to reset.

- **Check Conflicting Extensions:**
  - Other extensions may interfere with webRequest API usage.
  - Temporarily disable other content blockers and test again.

<Warning>
Browsers might limit extension API usage or block webRequest calls when in private/incognito mode unless enabled explicitly.
</Warning>

## 3. Popup Not Opening or Showing 'No Data'

The popup user interface displays detailed domain connections and their statuses. If it does not open or shows "NO DATA":

### Resolution Steps:

1. **Open Popup Correctly:**
   - Click the **uBO Scope** icon in the toolbar.
   - Wait 1-2 seconds for data to load (popup may initially show loading state).

2. **Reload Active Tab:**
   - Network requests populate the popup data.
   - Reload the currently active web page to generate fresh network activity.

3. **Check for JavaScript Errors:**
   - Inspect the popup page (right-click the popup and select "Inspect").
   - Look for errors in the console that might indicate issues.

4. **Restart Browser or Extension:**
   - Restarting helps clear session data lingering in memory.

5. **Verify Extension Storage Availability:**
   - Errors reading session or public suffix lists can prevent data display.
   - Confirm that your browser supports storage APIs fully.

<Note>
The popup uses the "webRequest" API to collect connection data. If network requests are blocked or filtered by policies or other extensions, the popup may remain empty.
</Note>

## 4. Network Connection Data Not Updating or Showing Incorrect Counts

If you notice no updates or inaccurate counts for connections:

### What to Check:

- **Are You Viewing the Correct Tab?**
  - The badge and popup data reflect the active browser tab only.

- **Content Blockers or Privacy Settings:**
  - Some privacy tools restrict or modify webRequest responses.

- **Browser API Limitations:**
  - Some browsers restrict listening to WebSocket connections or only provide partial webRequest data.
  - For example, Safari has specific API constraints.

- **Refresh Tab After Installation:**
  - Network data collection only starts when the extension is active.
  - Reload tabs after extension installation.

<Warning>
Remember that **uBO Scope** counts distinct third-party domains. A low badge count is good; a high count indicates many external connections.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Unsupported Browser or Platform

If **uBO Scope** is unavailable or fails to install:

1. **Check Browser Version and Compatibility:**
   - Only recent Chrome (122+), Firefox (128+), and Safari (18.5+) versions support the extension.

2. **Use Official Browser Stores:**
   - Install directly from official stores to ensure compatibility.
   - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
   - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

3. **Alternative Browsers:**
   - Chromium-based browsers supporting Chrome extensions may work but verify version requirements.

4. **Review Extension Manifest:**
   - The extension manifest explicitly declares supported browser versions and required permissions.

<Tip>
If you are unsure about your browser or environment, consult the [System Requirements & Browser Compatibility guide](../../getting-started/installation-basics/system-requirements).
</Tip>

## 6. Advanced Troubleshooting Tips

If problems persist after basic troubleshooting:

- **Reset Extension Data:**
  - Clear local and session storage used by the extension.

- **Check Developer Console Logs:**
  - For background scripts and popup logs, use browser developer tools to inspect runtime errors.

- **Confirm Network Listener Operation:**
  - The extension uses `webRequest` API listeners that track redirects, errors, and response starts.
  - Verify these APIs are not blocked by browser security policies.

- **Review GitHub Repository:**
  - Check [uBO-Scope GitHub](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) for known issues or report bugs.

- **Update Browser and Extension:**
  - Keep both browser and the extension up to date to benefit from fixes and improvements.
