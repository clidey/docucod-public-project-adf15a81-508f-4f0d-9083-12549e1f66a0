# Understanding What uBO Scope Does

uBO Scope is a specialized browser extension designed to reveal the full picture of network connections initiated by web pages. Unlike most content blockers, it transparently reports all attempted and successful connections to remote servers, independently of any blocking in place. This page explains how uBO Scope monitors third-party connections, what the toolbar badge and popup data mean, and how to correctly interpret the information you see.

---

## 1. Core Value: Real-Time Monitoring of Third-Party Connections

Every modern webpage loads resources — scripts, images, fonts, trackers — from numerous servers. Some are first-party (the domain you are visiting), but many are third-party servers owned by advertisers, analytics providers, CDNs, or other services.

uBO Scope’s primary value lies in its ability to list **all** these connections in real time, categorizing them by their outcome:

- **Allowed connections:** These remote servers successfully delivered resources.
- **Blocked connections:** Requests that failed due to active blocking (by content blockers, DNS filters, etc).
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Redirected or altered connections that were subtly blocked without obvious failures.

By surfacing these details transparently, uBO Scope empowers you to understand exactly which third parties are present on any webpage and how they interact.

---

## 2. Monitoring Third-Party Connections Independently of Content Blocking

uBO Scope uses your browser's `webRequest` API to observe every network request a webpage attempts, including those blocked or allowed by any active content blocker. This enables it to provide an accurate and complete report unaffected by how other extensions operate.

> **Important:** Some network requests occur outside the reach of the browser’s `webRequest` API (e.g., DNS-only blocking or internal browser mechanisms). Such requests won’t appear in uBO Scope's reports.

This broad visibility ensures you are never in the dark about connections, regardless of your content blocking configuration.

## 3. How to Interpret the Toolbar Badge Count

The uBO Scope toolbar icon displays a numeric badge, which reports the **number of distinct third-party remote domains with active connections on the current webpage.**

This count reflects only third-party domains — domains different from the main site you're visiting — for which at least one connection was allowed.

### Why is this important?

- A **lower count** typically suggests fewer distinct external servers are being contacted, which often correlates with better privacy.
- A **higher count** means the webpage is fetching resources from many different third-party sources.

<Tip>
The badge count does *not* indicate how many requests were blocked or failed. It shows the number of distinct third-party domains that successfully connected. Use it to understand network exposure, not block efficiency.
</Tip>

## 4. Understanding the Popup Panel Data

By clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup interface opens a detailed breakdown of third-party domains connected to and categorized by their connection outcomes.

### Popup Sections:

- **Not Blocked:** Lists third-party domains from which network requests succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Shows connections that were obscured via redirection or subtle blocking, often invisible to the webpage.
- **Blocked:** Displays domains with network requests that were explicitly blocked or failed.

Each domain is accompanied by a count of how many requests were made to it during your current browsing session for the active tab.

## How to read this data practically:

- Use this data to identify which third parties your browser communicates with and how your blockers affect them.
- Cross-check the "Not Blocked" list to verify if any unexpected third parties are receiving your data.
- Review the "Blocked" and "Stealth-Blocked" sections to understand what is being prevented.

## 5. Practical Scenario: You Visit Example.com

1. uBO Scope detects the `main_frame` request for "example.com" and resets previous data.
2. As the page loads scripts, images, fonts, etc., each request to third-party servers (e.g., `cdn.examplecdn.com`, `tracker.adsite.com`) is logged.
3. Allowed connections increment the count for that third party domain.
4. If a request is blocked or redirects stealthily, it is categorized accordingly.
5. Toolbar badge updates to show the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.
6. Clicking the toolbar icon displays detailed counts and categories in the popup.

---

## 6. Tips for Getting the Most from uBO Scope

- **Use alongside your blocker** to verify which third parties are truly blocked or allowed.
- **Monitor the badge count** as a quick privacy indicator per site.
- **Open the popup whenever suspicious activity arises** on a page to see detailed insights.
- **Remember** that some third-party domains are legitimate (CDNs, payment gateways), so a high count alone does not necessarily indicate a problem.

<Note>
Stealth-blocked connections reflect advanced network events like redirects or network-layer filtering. Seeing these means your blocker or network setup is preventing some connections invisibly.
</Note>

## 7. Common Misunderstandings Clarified

| Myth | Reality |
|---|---|
| **Badge count = number of blocked requests** | Badge count shows *allowed* distinct third-party domains only. Blocking activity is detailed in the popup. |
| **More blocks mean a better content blocker** | High block counts can mean more requests are *allowed* overall, as block counts do not reflect block efficiency accurately. |
| **Ad blocker test websites reflect real-world blocking** | Such tests often create artificial conditions and don’t reflect actual browsing or blocking behavior. |

## Appendix: How uBO Scope Collects Data (Brief Overview)

uBO Scope listens to network request events using the browser’s `webRequest` API. It categorizes each request outcome and updates per-tab counts:

- On page load (`main_frame` request), previous data resets.
- Allowed requests increment domain counts.
- Redirects/count as stealth-blocked.
- Errors or blocked requests increment blocked counts.

The toolbar badge and popup UI reflect these datasets in real time, providing actionable insights.
