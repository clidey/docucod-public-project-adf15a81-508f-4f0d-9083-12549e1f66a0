# Quick Tour: Monitoring Third-Party Connections with uBO Scope

uBO Scope’s popup interface is your window into every network connection made by the active browser tab. This quick tour guides you through how to use the popup UI to instantly review the remote servers your browser communicates with, understand the connection outcomes, and gain real-time insights to strengthen your privacy awareness.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

- Locate the uBO Scope extension icon on your browser’s toolbar.
- Click the icon to open the popup window.

This popup shows live, categorized data about third-party domains connected by the current tab you are viewing.

<Check>
If the popup does not open or shows "NO DATA", ensure that uBO Scope is properly installed and that the tab is fully loaded. See the [First Launch & Verifying Installation](../installation-basics/first-launch) guide for troubleshooting.
</Check>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Layout

The popup UI consists primarily of:

- **Hostname Header:** Shows the domain of the active tab you are inspecting.
- **Summary Section:** Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Connection Outcome Sections:** Divided into three areas — `not blocked (allowed)`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked` — showing the third-party domains grouped by connection outcome.

Each section lists the domains along with how many connections were made.

---

## 3. Reviewing Connection Outcomes

The three key sections help you quickly understand the nature of network activity:

- ### Not Blocked (Allowed)
  These are third-party domains to which your browser successfully connected and fetched resources.

- ### Stealth-Blocked
  Domains where connection was redirected or filtered stealthily, meaning an attempt was made but the browser did not fully block all evidence. This typically represents connections modified to be less detectable.

- ### Blocked
  Domains where connection attempts were outright blocked, either by uBO Scope or other mechanisms in place.

---

## 4. Exploring Domain Connection Details

- Each entry shows the domain name and a badge with the number of connection attempts or responses.
- Domains are sorted alphabetically within each section.

This detail enables you to quickly spot which third parties are most active or persistent.

<Tip>
Hover over or carefully read domain names to ensure you recognize if they are expected services (e.g., CDNs, analytics) or potentially unwanted trackers.
</Tip>

## 5. Typical Usage Flow

1. **Open a website you want to inspect.**
2. **Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.**
3. **Observe the domains appearing in each section as the page loads.**
4. **Review the count badges to understand connection volume per domain.**
5. **Use these insights to evaluate which third parties are active and how content blockers affect them.**

This live monitoring is invaluable for privacy-conscious users, filter list maintainers, and anyone wanting to see what goes on behind the scenes during web browsing.

---

## 6. Practical Tips to Maximize Value

- Always reload the page after opening the popup to capture fresh connection data.
- Pay attention to the toolbar badge count, which indicates the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.
- Use the connection outcome sections to correlate what your content blocker allows or blocks.
- Remember stealth-blocked domains indicate subtle connection modifications—not outright blocks.

<Note>
The counts and domains reflect real-time network activity and update as you navigate between tabs and reload pages.
</Note>

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Usage">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA'">
 - Ensure the current tab is fully loaded and uses a supported protocol (http, https, ws, wss).
 - Verify that uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
 - Reload the tab and reopen the popup.
 - Check browser console for extension errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains Not Appearing as Expected">
 - Confirm network requests are allowed through the browser’s webRequest API.
 - Understand that some connections may happen outside the API scope (e.g., service workers).
 - Refer to the [Core Concepts & Terminology](../../overview/product-architecture/core-concepts-terminology) guide to clarify connection outcomes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Counts Seem Incorrect or Outdated">
 - The popup updates when opened, but some lag may occur.
 - Close and reopen the popup for latest data.
 - Check if other content blockers interfere with webRequest monitoring.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Where to Go Next

- Dive deeper into interpreting the popup details in the [Understanding the Popup: Reading Connection Insights](../../guides/core-workflows/understanding-the-popup) guide.
- Learn about the [Toolbar Badge Count](../../guides/core-workflows/toolbar-badge-guide) to contextualize total third-party connections.
- For installation help, visit the [Installing uBO Scope](../installation-basics/installing-extension) page.
- Explore the [Core Features & Capabilities](../../overview/intro-basics/core-features) for a broader understanding.

## Appendix: Example Popup Snapshot

```plaintext
Hostname: example.com

Summary: domains connected: 5

not blocked:
 - cdn.example.net  (5)
 - analytics.service.org  (3)

stealth-blocked:
 - tracking.example.net  (2)

blocked:
 - ads.example.com  (4)
```

This display shows which domains the current site connected to, grouping by the connection state, helping you immediately spot privacy-relevant endpoints.
