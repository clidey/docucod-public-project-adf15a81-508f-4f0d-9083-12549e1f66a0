## 3. Post-Installation Verification

Once installed, confirm uBO Scope is active and ready to report your third-party connections:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It will appear as the uBO Scope logo.

If you see the popup with these elements, your installation succeeded!

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Icon does not appear | - Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extension manager.  
- Restart your browser. |
| Popup shows "NO DATA" and remains empty | - Refresh the active browser tab or visit a website that loads network resources.  
- Confirm that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (activeTab, webRequest). |
| Installation fails or is blocked | - Check your browser version meets minimum requirements.  
- For managed devices, verify any browser policies do not block extension installation. |
