# Installing uBO Scope on Your Browser

Welcome to the first step of using uBO Scope, your transparent companion for monitoring all remote server connections made by your browser tabs. This guide walks you through the straightforward installation process for major browsers, verification techniques to confirm successful installation, and points you to alternatives if your browser is unsupported.

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed for modern browsers that support [Manifest Version 3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/) extensions and provide access to the `webRequest` API. You can install the extension on the following browsers:

- **Google Chrome:** Version 122 or later
- **Mozilla Firefox:** Version 128 or later, including Firefox for Android
- **Apple Safari:** Version 18.5 or later

<u>Note:</u> Older versions or other browsers without the required APIs are not supported.

## 2. Installation Methods

### 2.1 Installing from Official Stores

The easiest and most secure method to install uBO Scope is via your browser’s official extension marketplace.

| Browser         | Installation Link                                                                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Google Chrome   | [Chrome Web Store - uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Mozilla Firefox | [Firefox Add-ons - uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)                |

**Steps:**

1. Click the link for your browser above.
2. Click **Add to Chrome** or **Add to Firefox**.
3. Confirm any permission dialogs.
4. Wait for the extension to install—usually a few seconds.

### 2.2 Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

If you need to build or install from source, you can clone the repository and use platform-specific instructions:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
   cd uBO-Scope
   ```
2. Use the provided packaging script for your platform (Linux environment assumed):
   ```bash
   ./tools/make-package.sh <platform> <version>
   ```
   Replace `<platform>` with one of `chromium`, `firefox`, or `safari` and `<version>` with the desired version string.
3. Load the unpacked extension manually in your browser’s developer mode.

<Tip>
Manual installation is recommended only for advanced users who need custom builds or are testing development versions. For general users, the official store installations are preferred for security and automatic updates.
</Tip>

## 3. Verifying Installation

After installation, confirm that uBO Scope is working correctly with the following steps:

### 3.1 Check the Toolbar Icon

- Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s extension toolbar. It should display the uBO Scope logo.
- Click the icon to open the popup panel.

### 3.2 Open uBO Scope Popup

- The popup window displays:
  - The hostname and domain for the current active tab.
  - A summary showing the count of connected domains.
  - Three categorized sections listing domains:
    - **Not Blocked** — domains where connections succeeded.
    - **Stealth-Blocked** — domains affected by stealth blocking (redirects).
    - **Blocked** — domains with blocked requests.

- If the popup shows "NO DATA" or a question mark, try reloading the tab or visiting a different site to trigger network activity.

### 3.3 Observe Badge Count

- The extension icon’s badge shows a number representing distinct third-party domains with successful connections.
- This number updates as you browse.

<Tip>
A lower badge count generally means fewer third-party connections, indicating stricter privacy controls or fewer external resources.
</Tip>

## 4. What to Expect After Installation

- uBO Scope actively monitors network requests from all tabs.
- The extension does not interfere or block any connections itself—it reports outcomes.
- The badge count dynamically reflects third-party connections per tab.
- The popup provides easy-to-read insights about successful, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains seen by the browser.

## 5. Recommendations for Alternative Browsers

If you use a browser that does not yet support Manifest V3 or the required permissions, consider switching to one of the supported browsers listed earlier for full functionality.

## 6. Troubleshooting Installation

If installation fails or uBO Scope does not behave as expected:

- Verify your browser version meets the minimum required version.
- Check that you have enabled necessary permissions when adding the extension.
- Try restarting your browser.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](https://your-docs-domain/getting-started/using-validating/troubleshooting-setup-issues) page for detailed help.
