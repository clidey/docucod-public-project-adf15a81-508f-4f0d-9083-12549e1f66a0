5. After installing, the uBO Scope icon will appear near the browser’s address bar.

### For Mozilla Firefox

1. Open Firefox, preferably version 128.0 or above.
2. Navigate to the official uBO Scope page on the **Firefox Add-ons** site:

   [uBO Scope on Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

3. Click **Add to Firefox** and permit required permissions.
4. Once installed, uBO Scope’s icon will appear in your toolbar.

### For Safari (macOS)

1. Ensure you are running Safari 18.5 or later.
2. Open Safari and access the **App Store** or the Safari Extensions section.
3. Search for **uBO Scope** and install the extension.
4. Enable the extension via Safari Preferences > Extensions.

<Warning>
Safari’s extension installation flow differs from other browsers and may require you to enable the extension manually after installing.
</Warning>

## 3. Verifying Installation

After installation, verify that uBO Scope is ready to use:

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
- Click the icon; the extension popup should open, showing a **NO DATA** message initially (until network requests are monitored).
- Browse a website and observe the badge count incrementing to reflect distinct remote connections.

<Check>
If the popup doesn’t open or the badge doesn’t show any number after browsing, refer to troubleshooting tips or ensure you have proper permissions granted.
</Check>

## 4. Additional Installation Notes

- **Automatic Updates:** Installing from official stores ensures you receive automatic updates.
- **Manual Builds:** Developers or advanced users can build the extension manually; scripts like `tools/make-package.sh` and `tools/make-firefox.sh` assist in packaging the extension for respective platforms.
- **Permissions:** During installation, permissions requested include access to the active tab, storage, and webRequest API, which are essential for uBO Scope to monitor network connections.

## 5. Next Steps

Once installed, proceed to:

- Explore the extension’s popup UI to understand the connection count.
- Review the [Understanding the Popup & Badge](https://your-docs-link/getting-started/first-steps-usage/interpreting-the-popup) guide to interpret data effectively.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](https://your-docs-link/getting-started/first-steps-usage/troubleshooting-setup) page if you encounter any problems.
