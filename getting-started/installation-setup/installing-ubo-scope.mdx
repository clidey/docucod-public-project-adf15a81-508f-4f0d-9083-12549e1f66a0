## 3. Permissions Overview

Upon installing uBO Scope, the extension requests the following permissions required for its core functionality:

- **Web Request:** Monitors all network requests your browser makes to detect which servers are contacted.

Granting these permissions is essential for uBO Scope to accurately report remote server connections across all visited sites.
