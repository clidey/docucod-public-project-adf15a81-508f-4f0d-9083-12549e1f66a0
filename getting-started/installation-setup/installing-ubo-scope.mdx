# Installing uBO Scope

Step-by-step guidance to install uBO Scope from the official browser stores for Chromium-based browsers and Firefox. This guide will walk you through the installation process, explain what to expect during permission prompts, and provide basic troubleshooting tips for common extension installation issues.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Version Requirements

Before installation, please ensure your browser meets these minimum version requirements:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge): version 122.0 or later
- **Firefox** (desktop and Android): version 128.0 or later
- **Safari**: version 18.5 or later

These versions are necessary as uBO Scope relies on manifest version 3 features and webRequest API changes available only on these browsers.

## 2. Installing uBO Scope

uBO Scope is distributed officially through the browser extension stores. Follow the steps below to install it in your preferred browser.

### 2.1 Installing in Chromium-based Browsers

1. Open your Chromium-based browser.
2. Visit the [Chrome Web Store page for uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
3. Click **Add to Chrome** (or equivalent for your browser).
4. When prompted, review the permissions uBO Scope requests and click **Add extension**.

### 2.2 Installing in Firefox

1. Open Firefox (desktop or Android supported).
2. Visit the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
3. Click **Add to Firefox**.
4. Confirm the permissions and accept to install the extension.

### 2.3 Installing in Safari

- Safari support requires version 18.5 or greater.
- Installation follows the same approach as other Safari extensions through the App Store or extensions preferences, but note that support and availability might be limited. Refer to the latest Safari documentation or extension store.

## 3. Permissions Explained

During installation, uBO Scope will request the following permissions:

- **webRequest**: Allows the extension to monitor network requests across websites to detect connections to remote servers.
- **activeTab**: Enables the extension to operate on the active tab for reporting network connections.
- **storage**: Stores session data and configuration locally for persistence.
- **Host permissions**: Access to all HTTP and HTTPS URLs (`http://*/*` and `https://*/*`) and WebSocket protocols (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) on Firefox and Chromium browsers to track network requests properly.

It is critical to accept these permissions; otherwise, uBO Scope cannot capture network activity.

<Tip>
Always install uBO Scope from official browser stores to ensure you get the authentic extension with correct permissions and future updates.
</Tip>

## 4. Verifying Successful Installation

After installation:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. It displays a badge count indicating the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connects to on the active tab.
2. Click the icon to open the popup UI.
3. The popup will display domains categorized as **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked** based on network request outcomes.

If you see "NO DATA" or an empty panel immediately, visit a website with external content (e.g., a news site with ads or analytics).

### Troubleshooting Verification

- If the icon is missing, check your browser’s extensions page and ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
- Confirm your browser version meets the minimum required.
- Reload the browser or restart it entirely to complete the installation.

## 5. Common Installation Issues & Solutions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues and How to Fix Them">
<Accordion title="Extension Not Appearing in Toolbar">
Ensure that uBO Scope is enabled in your browser’s extensions or add-ons manager. Sometimes new extensions are installed but hidden by default. Pin the extension icon to your toolbar if your browser supports this.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Denied During Installation">
Check that your browser version supports the permissions requested by uBO Scope. Older versions may block webRequest permission or manifest v3 extensions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Browser Compatibility Problems">
Verify you are using a supported browser version:
- Chromium 122+
- Firefox 128+
- Safari 18.5+

Using unsupported browsers or versions will cause installation failure or improper functioning.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extension Not Capturing Network Requests">
Make sure that:
- You have not blocked uBO Scope from running on certain sites.
- Other content blockers don’t interfere with the extension’s permissions.

Reload the webpage or open a new tab to trigger network recording.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Best Practices for Installation

- Always update your browser to the latest stable version before installing uBO Scope.
- Avoid side-loading extensions from non-official sources.
- Monitor any permission dialogs carefully to understand what access the extension requires.
- Disable conflicting extensions temporarily to verify uBO Scope operates correctly.

<Tip>
If you manage multiple profiles or browsers, install uBO Scope separately in each to maintain consistent monitoring and avoid cross-profile conflicts.
