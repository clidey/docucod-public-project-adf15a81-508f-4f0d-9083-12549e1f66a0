## 3. Verifying the Installation

After installation, confirming that uBO Scope is correctly added and active will empower you to start observing network connections right away.

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Toolbar Icon">
Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It should display no badge number initially or a count reflecting network connections on your current tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the toolbar icon to open the popup interface. You should see sections labeled **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** with placeholder content or live connection counts if you have active tabs.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify in Browser Extensions List">
- Chrome: Navigate to `chrome://extensions` and confirm uBO Scope is listed and enabled.
- Firefox: Go to `about:addons` and check the Extensions tab for uBO Scope.
- Safari: Open Safari Preferences &rarr; Extensions and ensure uBO Scope is checked.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the icon does not show up immediately, try restarting your browser. Some browsers require a restart after extension installation.

## 4. Permissions and Privacy Considerations

uBO Scope requires the following to operate effectively:

- Access to all URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`), including websocket protocols where supported.
- Permissions to read network request details while respecting your privacy.

<Info>
These permissions allow uBO Scope to observe outgoing network connections but do not modify any data or block any connections by themselves.
