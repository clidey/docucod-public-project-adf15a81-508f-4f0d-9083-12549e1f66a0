Welcome to the step-by-step guide to installing **uBO Scope** on **Mozilla Firefox**. This guide walks you through the exact process to add the extension via the Firefox Add-ons site and verify a successful setup, ensuring you’re ready to monitor remote server connections effectively.

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installation, ensure your environment meets the following:

- **Browser Version:** Mozilla Firefox version **128.0** or newer.
- **Permissions:** The extension requires permission for `webRequest` and `storage` APIs, which it will request during installation.

## 3. Initial Setup & Permissions

Upon installation, uBO Scope activates automatically. Key points to understand:

- It requires access to the active tab and storage to save session data.

## 4. Verifying Your First Operation

To ensure uBO Scope works correctly right after installation, perform this quick check:

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Open any website** in a new tab (for example, https://www.mozilla.org).
2. **Look at the uBO Scope toolbar icon:**
   - The icon badge number indicates how many distinct third-party remote servers your current tab is connected to.
3. **Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon** to open the popup:
   - You should see sections labeled **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**, listing domains with connection counts.

### What to Expect:

- The badge number dynamically updates based on the page's network activity.
- The popup shows the details of allowed and blocked third-party connections clearly.

<Check>
If you see "NO DATA" or no badge count after visiting a site, try reloading the page and verifying again.
</Check>
