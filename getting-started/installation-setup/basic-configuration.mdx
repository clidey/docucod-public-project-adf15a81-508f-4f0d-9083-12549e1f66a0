# Initial Configuration & Permissions

Welcome to the first setup stage of uBO Scope. This guide walks you through configuring the extension correctly after installation, so you understand the permissions it requires and how to tailor its settings for optimal performance and privacy insights.

---

## 1. Understanding uBO Scope Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions to function effectively. These permissions allow it to monitor and report all remote server connections your browser attempts, including those blocked by content blockers or other network filters.

### Required Permissions Explained

| Permission    | Purpose                                                                                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `activeTab`   | Grants access to the information about the currently active browser tab, enabling tab-specific monitoring.      |
| `storage`     | Allows the extension to save and retrieve configuration, session data, and user preferences securely.           |
| `webRequest`  | Enables uBO Scope to observe network requests made by webpages, including successes, redirects, and errors.      |
| Host Access  | Access to URLs matching `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, and `wss://*/*` is needed to track all requests. |

<Tip>
These permissions are essential because uBO Scope analyzes network requests on a per-tab basis and cannot report connection outcomes without `webRequest` access.
</Tip>

### Why These Permissions Are Safe

- **No Modification:** uBO Scope observes network traffic but does not modify or block requests.
- **Limited Data Usage:** Data collected is local to the extension unless you explicitly export or share it.
- **Open Source:** The extension's source code is publicly available for review on [GitHub](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).

## 2. Granting Permissions in Your Browser

Depending on your browser, the extension may prompt you for permissions at install or first use. Here’s how to ensure the required permissions are granted.

### For Chromium-based Browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave):

1. Install uBO Scope from the Chrome Web Store or load unpacked from source if developing.
2. Upon installation, accept the permission prompts displayed.
3. If permissions were denied, open your browser's extension management page:
   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Locate uBO Scope, click "Details".
   - Enable **Site access** for "On all sites" or manually add sites if preferred.

### For Firefox:

1. Install uBO Scope from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Accept the permission requests when prompted.
3. To verify or adjust permissions:
   - Go to `about:addons`.
   - Find uBO Scope and click "Preferences" or "Options".

### For Safari:

1. Install uBO Scope from the Safari Extensions Gallery or trusted sources.
2. Enable the extension in Safari Preferences → Extensions.
3. Assign permission for website access if prompted.

<Warning>
If permissions are not granted fully, uBO Scope will not be able to monitor connections accurately and the extension's badge and popup data will be incomplete.
</Warning>

## 3. Reviewing Initial Configuration Options

On first run, uBO Scope has minimal manual configuration but a few key options can be reviewed to customize your experience.

### Available Settings Location
Currently, all configurations are handled automatically by the extension; there is no dedicated user-configurable settings page in the UI.

### What You Can Expect:
- **Automatic Tab Monitoring:** As you browse, uBO Scope tracks all network requests made by the active tab.
- **Domain Grouping:** Requests are grouped by domain and hostname, simplifying analysis.
- **Badge Display:** The toolbar icon badge shows a count of distinct third-party domains with successful connections.

### How to Tailor Behavior
Since there is no direct config UI:
- Ensure you have granted **full site access** for comprehensive monitoring.
- Manage site permissions in your browser to control which sites uBO Scope tracks.
- Use the extension only on desired tabs/windows for focused data.

<Info>
Future updates may introduce more granular settings. Keep uBO Scope updated to benefit from enhancements.

## 4. Step-by-Step Initial Setup Workflow

Follow these immediate actions after installation to complete setup and verify permissions:

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm Permission Grants">
Open your browser’s extension management page and verify uBO Scope has been granted the following permissions: `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`, and host access for all URLs.
</Step>
<Step title="Restart Your Browser">
After installation and permissions adjustments, restart your browser to ensure all changes take effect.
</Step>
<Step title="Open and Activate uBO Scope">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup interface. Your latest tab’s network connection data should appear, or show "NO DATA" if the tab has no captured requests yet.
</Step>
<Step title="Browse a Website">
Navigate to a popular site (e.g., news or social media). Then click uBO Scope’s icon to view real-time connected domains being recorded.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Badge Count">
Observe the badge count on the toolbar icon. It should reflect the number of distinct third-party domains connected from the active tab.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
If you see "NO DATA" consistently, revisit your permission settings and confirm host permissions and `webRequest` access are granted.
</Check>

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Configuration & Permissions">
<Accordion title="Popup Says 'NO DATA' After Multiple Page Loads">
- Verify that uBO Scope permissions include full URL access.
- Confirm the tab you are viewing the popup for is active and has network activity.
- Reload the tab or try opening a new tab to ensure network requests are captured.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Remains Zero Despite Network Activity">
- Make sure the browser’s API is not restricted (some privacy settings or other extensions may block `webRequest`).
- Restart browser to reset extension state.
- Ensure you are running a supported browser version (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension Requests Excessive Permissions">
- All requested permissions are strictly necessary to monitor network traffic fully.
- Review the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) to audit the source and confirm no malicious activity.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Security and Privacy Considerations

uBO Scope only observes network requests and does not interfere with them. All data is stored locally using your browser's storage APIs.

Your browsing data is never sent outside your device unless you explicitly export logs or connection data.

Maintain regular updates to the extension to benefit from security patches.

## 7. Next Steps

- Proceed to [First Launch & User Interface Overview](/getting-started/first-run-usage/first-run) to learn how to interpret uBO Scope data.
- Explore [Validating Extension Functionality](/getting-started/first-run-usage/validate-functionality) for confirming your setup.
- Visit [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-run-usage/troubleshooting) for deeper problem-solving.

<Tip>
Begin monitoring your browsing with uBO Scope to gain immediate insights into third-party connections, enhancing your privacy awareness.

## Appendix: Permissions in Manifest Files

For reference, here’s the key section of the extension’s manifest file describing required permissions:

```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "storage",
    "webRequest"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://*/*",
    "http://*/*",
    "wss://*/*",
    "ws://*/*"
  ]
}
```

This structure applies across supported platforms (Chromium, Firefox, Safari) with minimal variation.
