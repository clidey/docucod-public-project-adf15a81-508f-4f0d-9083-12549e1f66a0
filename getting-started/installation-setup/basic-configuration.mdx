## 3. Review and Understand Required Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to fulfill its purpose of monitoring network requests transparently while respecting user privacy.

### Key Permissions Explained:

| Permission  | Purpose                                                                                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `activeTab` | Allows the extension to interact with the currently active browser tab when invoked.            |
| `storage`   | Enables saving your session data and preferences locally for persistent monitoring.            |
| `webRequest`| Grants the ability to observe network requests made by web pages, which is core to uBO Scope.  |

### Host Permissions:

- uBO Scope requires access to all HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket URLs (`https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, `ws://*/*`). This wide scope is necessary to track all connections initiated by pages.


> <Note>
> These permissions only allow uBO Scope to observe remote server connections—no modifications or blocking are performed by the extension.
> The focus is solely on reporting and transparency.
> </Note>

## 5. Tips for Effective Use

- **Keep your toolbar uncluttered:** Pin only essential extensions like uBO Scope for quick access.
- **Understand badge counts:** The icon badge shows the count of distinct third-party domains connected on your active tab. A lower number generally indicates fewer third-party connections.
- **Privacy transparency:** uBO Scope does not block or interfere with requests; it strictly reports connection activity.
