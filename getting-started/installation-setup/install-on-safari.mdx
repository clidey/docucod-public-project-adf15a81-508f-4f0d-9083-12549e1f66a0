# Installing uBO Scope on Safari

This guide walks you through the process of installing and configuring uBO Scope on Safari. It covers necessary prerequisites, platform considerations unique to Apple ecosystems, installation steps, and troubleshooting tips to ensure a smooth experience.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing uBO Scope on Safari, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- **Supported Safari Version:** Safari 18.5 or later is required. This minimum version supports the extension's features and API usage.
- **Operating System:** Compatible with macOS versions that support Safari 18.5 and later.
- **Permissions Needed:** The extension requires `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` permissions to monitor web traffic.
- **Network Access:** Internet access is required to fetch extension resources and to enable live updating of the public suffix list (used for domain parsing).

<Tip>
Make sure your Safari browser is updated to version 18.5 or newer. You can verify this by opening Safari and selecting “About Safari” from the Safari menu.
</Tip>

## 2. Installing uBO Scope on Safari

The installation process for Safari involves obtaining the extension package and installing it through Safari’s Extensions preferences.

### Step 1: Obtain the Safari Extension Package

uBO Scope's Safari extension is delivered as a packaged `.safariextension` or `.zip` file created via a Linux-based build process. You may:

- Download the prebuilt package from the official [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/releases) if available.
- Or build the extension yourself using the `tools/make-safari.sh` script from the source repository (for advanced users).

### Step 2: Install the Extension

1. Open Safari.
2. Go to **Safari > Settings > Extensions**.
3. Click the “More Extensions” or the gear icon to find the option to install from file.
4. Select the downloaded `.safariextension` or `.zip` file.
5. Follow prompts to add and enable the extension.

<Tip>
If you built the package manually, the `tools/make-safari.sh` script automates packaging. The archive `uBO-Scope.safari.zip` will be found under `build/uBO-Scope.safari/`.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Verify the Extension Installation

Once installed, Safari should display the uBO Scope icon in its toolbar.

- Click the uBO Scope icon to verify the popup loads correctly.
- On first use, the extension will request permission to access the current active tab.

<Check>
A working installation shows the extension’s toolbar icon and a functional popup that reports third-party remote server connections immediately after loading a webpage.
</Check>

## 3. Configuration & Setup Specific to Safari

### Initial Configuration

uBO Scope does not require complex user configurations to operate. It works out of the box once installed and enabled.

### Apple Platform Considerations

Safari extensions are built and run with specific constraints:

- The extension uses a background script defined as a module (`background.scripts` with type `module`).
- Minimal required Safari version (18.5) ensures compatibility with Manifest V3 and extended webRequest APIs.
- The extension requires permissions for network monitoring (`webRequest`), which Safari explicitly asks the user to approve.

<Tip>
If you use other content blockers or system-wide blockers on macOS/iOS, uBO Scope functions purely as a reporting tool and does not interfere with blocking behavior.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Safari Installation Issues

### Problem: Extension Not Appearing in Safari Toolbar

- Confirm Safari is version 18.5 or newer.
- Check **Safari > Settings > Extensions** to ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
- If missing, reinstall the extension.

### Problem: Permissions Not Granted

- Upon first use, Safari prompts for permissions; ensure you grant these.
- You can review and adjust permissions in **Safari > Settings > Extensions > uBO Scope**.

### Problem: Popup Not Loading or Showing "NO DATA"

- Verify that the webpage has finished loading; the extension gathers data as pages load.
- Refresh the tab and reopen the popup.
- Disable and re-enable the extension if the issue persists.

### Problem: Outdated Public Suffix List

- The extension updates the public suffix list automatically for domain parsing.
- If network issues prevent update, reload Safari after restoring connectivity.

<Tip>
Restart Safari to reset the extension if you encounter persistent anomalies.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Safari's extension architecture can sometimes cache states; if problems persist, try rebooting your macOS device.
</Warning>
