### 2.2 Manual Build and Installation (Advanced Users)

If you prefer or require manual installation (e.g., for testing or source code modifications), follow these steps.

#### Prerequisites
- A Linux environment or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for script compatibility.
- Git and Node.js installed if you wish to pull and build the extension yourself.
- jq installed for JSON manipulation.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
cd uBO-Scope
```

#### Step 2: Create the Extension Package

Run the provided build script for your platform: `chromium`, `firefox`, or `safari`.

```bash
./tools/make-package.sh chromium 1.0.1
```

Replace `chromium` with your browser platform.
The optional second argument `1.0.1` sets the extension version in manifest.json.

The extension files will be assembled into `build/uBO-Scope.chromium` (or corresponding platform folder).

#### Step 3: Load the Extension into Your Browser

**For Chromium-based browsers:**

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right toggle).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the folder `build/uBO-Scope.chromium`.
5. The extension will load and be ready to use.

**For Firefox:**

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Select `build/uBO-Scope.firefox/manifest.json`.

**For Safari:**

Manual loading requires **Safari Extension Developer** tools and developer certificates. Refer to Apple's official guide to load unpacked Safari extensions.

## 3. Verifying Installation

Once installed, confirm uBO Scope is active and ready.

### Step 1: Toolbar Icon

- Look for the **uBO Scope** icon in your browser’s toolbar. It shows a badge with a number representing distinct third-party remote servers connected.

### Step 2: Open the Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup panel.
- You should see domain statistics broken down into three categories:
  - **Not blocked** — servers with allowed connections.
  - **Stealth-blocked** — servers blocked stealthily.
  - **Blocked** — servers explicitly blocked.
- The popup loads your active tab’s connection data dynamically.

<Tip>
If the popup displays 'NO DATA', try loading or refreshing a website tab to generate connection reports.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Check Badge Count Behavior

- While browsing, observe the badge count adjust as uBO Scope detects connections.
- A count of zero means no distinct third-party connections detected for the current tab.
