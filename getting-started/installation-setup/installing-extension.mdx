## Post-Installation Verification

Confirm that uBO Scope is properly installed and active:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. Click the icon to open the uBO Scope popup interface.
3. You should see a panel with "NO DATA" initially, which updates as you browse.

- **Multiple Browsers:** You can install uBO Scope on different browsers on the same machine to compare connection data.

- **Updates:** To get new features or fixes, update the extension regularly through your browser’s extension manager.

- **Privacy:** uBO Scope only monitors network requests locally within your browser; no data is sent externally.
