# Validating Your Installation

Ensure that uBO Scope has been installed correctly and is ready to provide you with realtime insight on your browser's third-party server connections. This guide walks you through confirming that the extension is active, locating its icon, understanding the badge counter, and accessing the popup interface for your first inspection.

---

## 1. Locate the uBO Scope Extension Icon

After installation, the uBO Scope extension shows its icon in your browser's toolbar:

- **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)**: Look for the uBO Scope icon near the address bar, usually in the extensions area. If it's hidden, use the extensions menu (puzzle piece icon) to pin it for quick access.
- **Firefox**: The uBO Scope icon appears to the right of the address bar. You may need to customize your toolbar to pin it permanently.
- **Safari**: The icon appears in the Safari toolbar. You might need to enable the extension in Safari preferences first.

<Tip>
If you cannot find the uBO Scope icon, verify that the extension was installed successfully by checking your browser's extension or add-ons page.
</Tip>

## 2. Understand the Badge Counter

The badge number on the uBO Scope icon displays the count of **distinct third-party remote servers** that your browser has connected to or attempted to connect to during the current tab's session.

- A **higher badge count** means more third-party servers were contacted by the webpage.
- A **lower badge count** generally indicates fewer third-party connections, which may align with better privacy.

<Info>
The badge does not count connection attempts blocked by uBO Scope or other content blockers. It purely reflects the volume of unique third-party domains contacted.
</Info>

## 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup

Click the uBO Scope extension icon to open the popup interface. This popup presents a categorized list of domains contacted by the current webpage, divided into three groups:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains the browser connected to successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where the connection was redirected silently.
- **Blocked:** Domains for which connections failed or were blocked.

## 4. Verify the Data Display

Upon opening the popup:

- The top header shows the hostname of the active tab.
- The "domains connected" count summarizes the total unique third-party domains contacted.
- Each category section displays the domains and number of connections.

If you see "NO DATA" or the summary shows "?", this means no data is available yet. Try refreshing the webpage to generate new connection data.

## 5. Perform a Quick Sanity Check

To confirm uBO Scope is tracking properly:

1. Visit a known website (e.g., https://example.com).
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
3. Observe the badge count and domains list.

You should see a non-zero badge count and some domains listed under "Not Blocked".

<Tip>
If the badge never updates or the popup shows no data, ensure permissions were granted during installation and your browser version meets the minimum requirements.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation Validation">
<Accordion title="The uBO Scope icon is missing">

- Make sure other privacy tools are not interfering with uBO Scope’s ability to monitor requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup shows NO DATA or '?' in summary">
- This often occurs if the tab has no network activity yet.
- Reload the page to generate fresh data.
- Verify that uBO Scope has permission to read the active tab and network requests.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
