# First Run & Validation

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide will walk you through launching the extension for the first time, confirming it is active, and verifying that you can access its popup interface. These initial checks are essential for ensuring uBO Scope is installed correctly and ready to provide transparent visibility into remote connections initiated by your browser.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation

Before launching uBO Scope for the first time, ensure it is properly installed in your browser following the installation guide. Supported browsers include:

- Chromium-based browsers (Chrome 122+)
- Mozilla Firefox (128+)
- Safari (18.5+)

If you haven't installed uBO Scope yet, please refer to the [Installing uBO Scope](./installing-extension) page.

<Check>
If you cannot find uBO Scope in your browser’s extension manager, the installation is incomplete or failed.
</Check>

## 2. Locate the Toolbar Icon

After a successful installation, uBO Scope will add an icon to your browser's toolbar. This icon is your gateway to the extension's features.

### How to identify the icon:

- **Appearance**: The icon uses the uBO Scope logo in multiple resolutions (16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128 pixels) for clarity at any DPI.
- **Location**: Usually found near the address bar or pinned toolbar area depending on your browser setup.

### Confirm icon presence:

- Look for the uBO Scope icon.
- Hover over it to see the tooltip 'uBO Scope'.

If the icon is missing:

- Check your browser’s extension toolbar customization.
- Verify the extension is enabled.

## 3. Launch the Popup Interface

Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup window. This popup provides a real-time overview of domains your current browser tab connects to, categorized by connection outcome.

### What to expect in the popup:

- **Hostname display**: Shows the main domain of the current tab.
- **Summary section**: Number of connected domains displayed.
- **Connection Outcome Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked**: List of domains with allowed successful connections.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were stealthily redirected or blocked.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where connections failed or were explicitly blocked.

If the popup shows “NO DATA”:

- It means no connections were registered yet for the current tab.
- Reload the current webpage to trigger network requests.

---

## 4. Verify Toolbar Badge Count

uBO Scope uses a badge on the toolbar icon to display the count of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections.

- **Badge numbers indicate**:
  - The count of unique 3rd-party domains where connections were established.
  - A lower count generally signifies better content blocking or fewer remote connections.

### Steps to verify badge functionality:

1. Open any webpage (e.g., https://example.com).
2. Observe the badge number on the uBO Scope icon.
3. The number updates dynamically as the page loads connections.

If the badge is empty or not updating:

- Ensure uBO Scope has required permissions (`webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab`).
- Try reloading the page and waiting briefly.

## 5. Quick Tips to Confirm Proper First Run

- **Try multiple websites**: Open different tabs to observe domain connection changes.
- **Reload pages**: This triggers network requests to be recorded.
- **Open the popup again**: Ensure data updates after navigation or reload.

<Tip>
If you notice the badge count staying constant across sites or no data in the popup, double-check that your browser supports the required APIs and that the extension has permissions enabled.
</Tip>
