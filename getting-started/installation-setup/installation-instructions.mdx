### 2.2 Manual Installation (Developers & Advanced Users)

If you prefer manual control or are preparing a custom build, follow the steps below.

#### Prerequisites

- Linux environment (manual packaging script works in Linux shells)
- Git installed to clone the repository
- Node.js and npm if you plan to build or customize

#### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
cd uBO-Scope
```

2. **Build the extension package for your platform:**

The provided script `make-package.sh` creates a distributable folder containing all necessary files.

Use the following command, replacing `platform_name` with `chromium`, `firefox`, or `safari`:

```bash
./tools/make-package.sh platform_name
```

Example for Chromium:

```bash
./tools/make-package.sh chromium
```

3. **Load the extension in your browser:**

- **Chrome:** Go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable Developer Mode, click **Load unpacked**, then select the `build/uBO-Scope.chromium` directory.

- **Firefox:** Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click **Load Temporary Add-on**, select any file within `build/uBO-Scope.firefox`, such as the `manifest.json`.

- **Safari:** Use Safari's Extension Builder to load `build/uBO-Scope.safari`. Refer to the official Apple developer guide for detailed steps.

<Tip>
When loading manually, temporary installations will be removed when the browser restarts. For persistent use, package and distribute via official stores.
</Tip>

## 3. Verifying Installation
