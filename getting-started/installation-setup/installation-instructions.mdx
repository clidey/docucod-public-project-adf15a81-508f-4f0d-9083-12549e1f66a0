## Verifying a Successful Installation

After installing, confirm that uBO Scope is ready to use:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It should resemble the uBO Scope logo.

2. Click the icon. The popup window opens showing connection stats and categories:
   - Domains connected
   - Lists of domains that are _not blocked_, _stealth-blocked_, and _blocked_

3. At first launch, the popup may show beta or zero data if no browsing activity has been tracked yet.

4. You can also confirm installation by:
   - Opening the browser's extensions/add-ons page and verifying uBO Scope is listed and enabled.
   - Verifying that the extension requests permissions such as `webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab` (the browser will show these during installation).

- Visit the [First Run: What to Expect](https://your-docs-site/getting-started/first-use-validation/first-run-verify) page to learn what the extension tracks initially.

- Learn how to interpret the badge count and popup UI in [Understanding the UI: Badge & Popup Explained](https://your-docs-site/guides/getting-started-core-flows/understanding-ui-badge-popup).

## Additional Installation Methods (for Advanced Users)

If you prefer to build or package the extension yourself (e.g., for Safari or manual installation), see the related make-package and build scripts in the repository:

- `tools/make-package.sh` (core packaging script)
- `tools/make-chromium.sh` (build for Chromium browsers)
- `tools/make-firefox.sh` (build for Firefox)
- `tools/make-safari.sh` (build for Safari)

These scripts automate packaging but require familiarity with command-line tools and Linux environments.
