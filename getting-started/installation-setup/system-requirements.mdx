# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

This page outlines the browsers and operating systems supported by uBO Scope, along with necessary permissions and browser capabilities required for the extension's full functionality. Understanding these requirements ensures a smooth installation and optimal operation without unexpected compatibility issues.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to function as a browser extension across major browser platforms, leveraging the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network connections made by web pages. Below are the supported browsers with minimum version requirements:

- **Google Chrome (Chromium-based browsers)**
  - Minimum Version: 122.0 or later
  - Extension available via [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - Uses service worker background scripts to listen to network requests.

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum Version: 128.0 or later
  - Extension available via [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
  - Uses module-based background scripts.

- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum Version: 18.5 or later
  - Requires Safari’s strict minimum version due to compatibility with module-based extensions.


## 2. Supported Operating Systems

Since uBO Scope is a browser extension, it inherits compatibility from the browsers it supports. Practically, this means:

- Windows 10 or later
- macOS versions compatible with Safari 18.5, Chrome 122, or Firefox 128
- Linux distributions that support recent versions of Chromium or Firefox
- iOS and iPadOS where the browsers meet the minimum requirements and support WebExtensions (note: Safari on iOS has stricter extension API limits, see browser notes below).


## 3. Required Permissions & Capabilities

uBO Scope relies on specific browser permissions to monitor and report all network connections. These are critical for full transparency of remote connections:

- **`webRequest` Permission**
  - Essential to listen to all outgoing web requests initiated by web pages.
  - Allows detection of connection outcomes such as success, error, or redirect.

- **`activeTab` Permission**
  - Grants the extension access to the currently active tab to collect and show data relevant to that page.

- **`storage` Permission**
  - Required for saving session data and the public suffix list for efficient domain parsing.

- **Host Permissions**
  - Grant broad access to all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and WebSocket equivalents in Chrome and Firefox).
  - Enables the extension to observe and analyze connections regardless of the destination.


## 4. Browser API Support

uBO Scope requires browsers to fully implement and expose the `webRequest` API to extensions, enabling it to observe network activity accurately:

- The extension uses listeners on these webRequest events:
  - `onBeforeRedirect`
  - `onErrorOccurred`
  - `onResponseStarted`

- Browsers that do not report network requests through `webRequest` API for certain protocols or contexts (e.g., some sandboxed environments, secure contexts, or iOS restrictions) cannot guarantee full visibility.



## 5. Key Compatibility Considerations

- **Chromium browsers**
  - Support WebSocket (`ws://` and `wss://`) monitoring in addition to HTTP(S).
  - Use of Manifest V3 with a service worker background script.

- **Firefox**
  - Full `webRequest` support including WebSocket monitoring.
  - Extension uses module-based background script.

- **Safari**
  - Support starts from Safari 18.5, mandatory use of module background scripts.
  - Limited by Safari’s extension environment, but full `webRequest` permission required.


## 6. Security and Privacy

- The extension requires broad permissions to achieve its purpose of transparently revealing remote server connections.
- uBO Scope does **not** block content or interfere with network requests; it only observes and reports outcomes.
- Users should be aware that its operation depends on browser APIs whose scope and accessibility may vary.


## 7. Summary Table of Requirements

| Browser          | Minimum Version | Required Permissions                    | Special Notes                               |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Chrome/Chromium  | 122.0+          | activeTab, storage, webRequest         | Manifest V3, service worker background     |
| Firefox          | 128.0+          | activeTab, storage, webRequest         | Supports WebSocket events                   |
| Safari           | 18.5+           | activeTab, storage, webRequest         | Module background script, strict min version|


## 8. Troubleshooting Tips Prior to Installation

- Confirm your browser version meets or exceeds the listed minimums.
- Ensure that no other extensions or browser policies block access to the `webRequest` API.
- Verify your browser supports Manifest V3 extensions.
