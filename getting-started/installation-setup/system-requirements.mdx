# Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

Welcome to uBO Scope! Before you proceed to installing and using uBO Scope, it’s essential to ensure your environment meets the necessary requirements. This page guides you through everything you need to get uBO Scope running smoothly: browser compatibility, system requirements, user permissions, and platform-specific notes.

---

## 1. Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope is designed as a lightweight browser extension focused on revealing all attempted or successful remote server connections made by your browser.

### Supported Browsers

- **Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave): Requires minimum version **122.0** or later.
- **Mozilla Firefox**: Minimum version **128.0** or later.
- **Apple Safari**: Minimum version **18.5** or later.

These minimum versions reflect the browsers’ support for Manifest V3 extensions and the required APIs (such as `webRequest` with minimal blocking abilities).

### Platform-Specific Notes

| Browser Family | Notes |
| -------------- | ----- |
| Chromium       | Requires Manifest V3 support; extension runs with a service worker background script.
| Firefox        | Manifest V3 support available from Firefox 128 onwards; runs background as module.
| Safari         | Requires Safari 18.5 or higher; background scripts run as modules.

Make sure your browser is updated to these minimum versions to ensure full compatibility.

## 2. System Requirements

uBO Scope is lightweight and does not require extensive system resources. Here’s what you need:

- **Operating System:** Compatible with any OS that supports the compatible browsers mentioned above.
- **Memory:** Minimal RAM usage; typical browser extension memory footprint.
- **Disk Space:** Negligible storage; primarily for extension files and transient data storage.
- **Network:** Requires active internet connectivity to monitor network requests effectively.

### Performance Impact

Because uBO Scope works by observing network requests via browser APIs, it adds almost no perceptible overhead to your browsing experience.

---

## 3. Permissions & Access Requirements

To function properly, uBO Scope requires explicit permissions granted via the browser when installing or first running the extension.

### Required Permissions

- **`webRequest`**: To listen and track all web requests initiated by pages.
- **`storage`**: To store session data such as network request summaries.
- **`activeTab`**: To access details of the currently active browser tab.
- **Host Permissions:**
  - Access to all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) to monitor network activity globally.

### User Consent

During installation or at first launch, your browser will prompt you to grant these permissions. Without them, uBO Scope cannot observe or report network connections.

---

## 4. Network Requirements

- **Firewall and Proxy Settings:** Ensure your firewall or proxy allows your browser to send and receive network requests normally. uBO Scope monitors network requests inside the browser and does not itself initiate external connections.

- **Restrictions:** If your environment uses network monitoring or restrictive security policies, some network events may not be captured correctly.

## 5. Platform-Specific Manifest Highlights

To clarify what is expected for each platform, here are key manifest entries for uBO Scope:

### Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Google Chrome)
- Minimum Chrome version: **122.0**
- Background runs as a module service worker
- Permissions: `webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab`
- Host permissions: `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`

### Firefox
- Minimum Firefox version: **128.0**
- Background runs as a module script
- Permissions and host permissions same as Chromium

### Safari
- Minimum Safari version: **18.5**
- Background scripts loaded as modules
- Permissions: `webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab`
- Host permissions limited to `http://*/*` and `https://*/*`; WS protocols may be limited

<Note>
Browser-specific support and permissions ensure uBO Scope functions as expected. Some APIs may behave slightly differently depending on the browser vendor.
