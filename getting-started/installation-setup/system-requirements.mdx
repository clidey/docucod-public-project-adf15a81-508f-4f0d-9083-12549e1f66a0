# System Requirements for uBO Scope

Ensure your environment meets the following prerequisites before installing and using uBO Scope. This will guarantee the extension functions reliably and you avoid compatibility issues from the start.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to monitor and report connections to remote servers. Because it relies on the browser's `webRequest` API and Manifest Version 3 support, it has specific browser requirements:

| Browser  | Minimum Version |
| -------- | --------------- |
| **Chrome / Chromium-based browsers** | 122.0 or higher |
| **Firefox (Desktop and Android)** | 128.0 or higher |
| **Safari** | 18.5 or higher |

These minimum versions are critical because uBO Scope uses modern browser APIs and manifest capabilities only available from those versions onward.

### How to Check Your Browser Version

- **Chrome/Chromium**: Go to `chrome://settings/help`
- **Firefox**: Go to `about:support` or `about:preferences`
- **Safari**: Click 
  - *Safari Menu* > *About Safari*


## 2. System and Network Prerequisites

uBO Scope runs as a browser extension and does not require any separate software or backend services. However, for seamless operation:

- Ensure your system is running a compatible OS that supports one of the browsers listed above.
- Internet connectivity is required since the extension monitors live network requests.
- The browser must allow installation of extensions and have permissions to access `webRequest` API and active tab information.


## 3. Permissions Required by uBO Scope

During installation, uBO Scope requests the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: To read data from the current browsing tab.
- **storage**: To save session data locally.
- **webRequest**: To monitor network requests made by the browser.

These permissions are fundamental for uBO Scope’s core function as a transparency and measurement tool. No additional credentials or accounts are needed.


## 4. Browser-Specific Notes

### Chrome / Chromium
- Only runs on version 122.0 or greater.
- Uses a background service worker (`background.service_worker` in the manifest).
- Supports network protocols including `http`, `https`, `ws`, and `wss`.

### Firefox
- Requires version 128.0 or later on both desktop and Android platforms.
- Operates with background scripts in module type.
- Monitors network protocols: `http`, `https`, `ws`, and `wss`.

### Safari
- Requires version 18.5 or newer.
- Uses background scripts in modules (`background.scripts`).
- Supports `http` and `https` protocols (no WebSocket protocol permissions declared).


## 5. Important Compatibility Details

- uBO Scope relies heavily on the browser’s native WebRequest API to capture network events. If your browser version is older or stripped of this functionality, uBO Scope will not work as intended.
- Browsers with custom restrictions on network monitoring extensions may limit uBO Scope’s effectiveness.
- Since uBO Scope counts distinct third-party domains for connections, incompatible browsers or versions might yield inaccurate counts or no data.


## 6. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

If you encounter issues such as:
- The extension shows “NO DATA” or no connections are reported.
- Installation warnings about unsupported browser versions.
- Extension fails to load or crashes shortly after launch.

Try these steps:

- Verify your browser is updated to the latest supported version.
- Confirm that extensions are enabled and that uBO Scope is granted necessary permissions.
- Restart your browser after installation.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions that may restrict webRequest API access.


## 7. Summary

Meeting these system requirements ensures a smooth installation and accurate network connection measurement by uBO Scope. Take a moment to check your browser version and permissions before continuing with installation to avoid frustration and ensure the tool works as intended.
