# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Before installing and using uBO Scope, ensure your browser and system meet the necessary requirements to guarantee smooth installation and optimal performance. This section outlines supported browsers, minimum version requirements, required permissions, and platform compatibility.

---

## Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension with compatibility tailored to modern web browsers that support the WebExtensions API and the `webRequest` API. Below are the officially supported browsers along with their minimum version requirements:

| Browser               | Minimum Version | Notes                                            |
|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Google Chrome**     | 122.0           | Supports manifest v3 with service workers.        |
| **Mozilla Firefox**   | 128.0           | Includes support for desktop and Android versions. |
| **Safari**            | 18.5            | Safari 18.5+ supports manifest v3 and required APIs. |


> These versions guarantee compatibility with uBO Scope's use of service workers and required webRequest events.


## Required Permissions

uBO Scope requires the following permissions to operate effectively:

- **activeTab**: Access to the active browser tab to monitor network requests per tab context.
- **storage**: For storing session data and user state securely within the extension.
- **webRequest**: Core permission that allows monitoring network requests to report remote server connections.

Additionally, the extension declares `host_permissions` allowing it to monitor network requests for all HTTP and HTTPS URLs, including WebSocket connections:

- `http://*/*`
- `https://*/*`
- `ws://*/*`
- `wss://*/*`


## Platform Compatibility

uBO Scope runs on desktop and compatible mobile versions of supported browsers. The extension has tailored manifest and background script configurations for each platform:

- **Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Chrome)** use a service worker background script on manifest version 3.
- **Firefox** uses a module-based background script; compatible with Firefox desktop and Android.
- **Safari** utilizes a module-based background script and requires a minimum Safari version 18.5.


> Note that uBO Scope is a browser extension and does not support standalone installation or functionality outside the supported browsers.


## Network and Browser Environment Requirements

To function correctly and give accurate connection insights, the following environment conditions are also required:

- The browser must support and expose the `webRequest` API for network request monitoring.
- Network conditions should allow the extension to observe outgoing connections; restrictions like VPNs or network-level filtering might affect data accuracy.
- Firewalls or antivirus software should not block the extension or the browser's network monitoring APIs.


## Ensuring Compatibility Before Installation

Follow these steps to verify your environment supports uBO Scope before installation:

1. Check your browser's version:

   - In **Chrome**: Go to `chrome://settings/help`
   - In **Firefox**: Navigate to `about:support`
   - In **Safari**: Open `Safari` > `About Safari`

2. Confirm the required permissions are allowed or prompt by the browser upon installing uBO Scope.

3. Verify that extensions are enabled and that no policies restrict extension installation or network monitoring.


## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Outdated Browsers:** Older browsers or versions lower than minimum required will fail to install or function properly.

- **Unsupported Browser Variants:** Some Chromium-based browsers might lack complete API support, leading to malfunction.

- **Restricted Permissions:** Denying permissions requested by uBO Scope at install time will prevent it from operating correctly.

- **Network Filters:** Corporate or restrictive network environments may obscure or block monitoring of connections.


## Summary Checklist

Before proceeding to install uBO Scope, ensure:

- Your browser matches or exceeds the listed minimum versions.
- All extension permissions (`activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`) can be granted.
- Host permissions cover HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS protocols.
- Your browsing environment does not block extension activities or network monitoring.


<Tip>
If you're unsure about any environment or compatibility aspect, first try installing the extension from the official browser store and observe any installation warnings or errors.
