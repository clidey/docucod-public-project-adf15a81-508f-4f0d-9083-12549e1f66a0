# System Requirements for uBO Scope

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure your system and browser environment meet the necessary requirements for optimal performance and compatibility. This page details supported browsers, minimum version requirements, and any platform-specific considerations to prepare you for a smooth setup.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with major browsers that support Manifest Version 3 and the necessary webRequest APIs. Below is the list of officially supported browsers and their minimum version requirements:

| Browser            | Minimum Version | Notes                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Google Chrome      | 122.0+          | Supports full webRequest interception   |
| Mozilla Firefox    | 128.0+          | Supports both desktop and Android       |
| Safari             | 18.5+           | Limited to HTTP/HTTPS URLs; no WebSocket support |


## 2. Platform-Specific Limitations

The extension has variations in behavior and support due to browser architecture differences. Be aware of the following:

- **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)**
  - Full support for webRequest API including HTTP, HTTPS, as well as WebSocket (ws:// and wss://).
  - Minimum Chrome version 122 required due to Manifest V3 specification and APIs.

- **Firefox (Desktop and Android)**
  - Full webRequest API support similar to Chromium.
  - Minimum Firefox version 128 ensures all MV3 APIs and background script support.

- **Safari**
  - Requires Safari 18.5 or newer.
  - WebRequest support limited to HTTP and HTTPS schemes only; WebSocket connections are not tracked.
  - Background scripts run differently but otherwise similar functionality.


## 3. Prerequisites Before Installation

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- You must use a compatible browser as listed above.
- Your browser must be updated to the minimum required version or newer.
- Extension installation permissions are allowed in your browser settings.
- If you use browser policies or enterprise controls, verify that installing third-party extensions is permitted.


## 4. Additional Notes on Compatibility

- uBO Scope leverages browser `webRequest` APIs which intercept network requests made within browser tabs.
- Connections originating from outside of these tabs or via internal browser APIs not exposed through `webRequest` will not be tracked.
- Running other content blockers does not affect uBO Scope’s ability to observe network requests; it operates independently.


## 5. How to Check Your Browser Version

If you are unsure if your browser meets the version requirements, follow these quick checks:

- **Google Chrome**: 
  1. Click the three dots menu > Help > About Google Chrome
  2. Confirm the version number is 122 or greater

- **Mozilla Firefox**:
  1. Click the menu button > Help > About Firefox
  2. Confirm the version number is 128 or greater

- **Safari**:
  1. Click the Apple menu > About This Mac > Software Update
  2. Ensure the macOS version supports Safari 18.5 or later

## Troubleshooting System Compatibility

If you encounter issues installing or running uBO Scope, consider the following:

- **Extension fails to install or enable**
  - Confirm the browser version meets the minimum requirement.
  - Ensure that third-party extensions are allowed (Check browser policy settings).
  - Restart your browser and try reinstalling.

- **No network data shown in the popup**
  - Verify you are using a supported browser and version.
  - Make sure you have visited pages that make network requests after installation.
  - Check that the extension has necessary permissions (activeTab, webRequest).

- **Unexpected behavior on Safari**
  - Understand that WebSocket connections won’t appear due to API limitations.
  - Confirm the Safari version is 18.5 or newer.
