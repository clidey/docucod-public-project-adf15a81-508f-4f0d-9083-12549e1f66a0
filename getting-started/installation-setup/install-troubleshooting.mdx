# Troubleshooting Installation Issues

When installing uBO Scope, the process is generally smooth thanks to browser extension stores providing streamlined installation. However, on occasion, issues related to permissions, compatibility, or browser settings can impede a successful setup. This guide helps you identify and resolve common installation hurdles to get uBO Scope running optimally.

---

## 1. Confirm Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope requires modern browsers with support for Manifest Version 3 and the `webRequest` API.

- **Supported Browsers & Minimum Versions:**
  - **Chrome**: Version 122 or later
  - **Firefox**: Version 128 or later
  - **Safari**: Version 18.5 or later

<Tip>
If you are using a browser version earlier than the above, the extension will either not install or will not function correctly.
</Tip>

### How to Check Your Browser Version

- **Chrome & Edge:** Go to `chrome://settings/help`
- **Firefox:** Go to `about:support`
- **Safari:** Click "Safari" in the menu, select "About Safari"


## 2. Verify Permissions Granted

uBO Scope depends on several browser permissions to monitor network requests and store session data.

**Essential permissions include:**

- Access to monitor network requests (`webRequest` and host permissions like `https://*/*`)
- Ability to read the active tab
- Storage access for session and persistent data

### Common Permission Issues

- During installation, your browser should prompt for required permissions. Ensure you **accept** all permission requests.
- In some cases, extension permissions may get revoked or disabled by enterprise policies or security software.

<Warning>
If the extension cannot access the `webRequest` API, it will be unable to detect network requests, which breaks uBO Scope's core functionality.
</Warning>

### How to Review and Re-enable Permissions

- Chrome/Edge: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, find "uBO Scope", click "Details", and confirm permissions.
- Firefox: Go to `about:addons`, click on "Extensions", find uBO Scope, and check "Preferences".
- Safari: Use Safari Extensions preferences to verify permissions.

If permissions are missing, try reinstalling or resetting the extension.

## 3. Extension Visibility and Toolbar Icon

Sometimes after installation, the uBO Scope icon might not appear in your browser toolbar immediately.

### Steps to Ensure Icon Visibility

- **Chrome/Edge:**
  1. Click on the puzzle piece (extensions menu) in the toolbar.
  2. Locate "uBO Scope".
  3. Pin it to the toolbar by clicking the pin icon.

- **Firefox:**
  - Customize the toolbar by right-clicking on the toolbar area and selecting "Customize Toolbar" to drag uBO Scope icon into the visible area.

- **Safari:**
  - In Safari Preferences â†’ Extensions, ensure uBO Scope is enabled and added to the toolbar.

<Note>
Without the toolbar icon, you cannot easily access the popup interface to see connection details.
</Note>

## 4. Handling Installation Failures

If installation fails or the extension is disabled by the browser:

- **Check for Conflicting Extensions:** Some extensions that deeply modify network requests or browser APIs might conflict with uBO Scope.
- **Disable Security Software Temporarily:** Certain antivirus or security tools may block extension installation.
- **Clear Browser Cache/Restart Browser:** Sometimes stale data or temporary glitches cause problems.
- **Install from Official Sources Only:** Ensure you are installing from the official browser stores or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).

## 5. Debugging in Developer Mode

If problems persist, enable developer mode in your browser's extensions page to check for errors:

- **Chrome/Edge:**
  1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
  2. Toggle "Developer mode".
  3. Click "Inspect views" under uBO Scope's background page to view console logs.

- **Firefox:**
  1. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
  2. Find uBO Scope.
  3. Click "Inspect" on the background script.

Watch for errors related to permissions, manifest issues, or network request handling.
