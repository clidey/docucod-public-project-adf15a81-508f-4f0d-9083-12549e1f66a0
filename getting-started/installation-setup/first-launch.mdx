# First Launch & Activation

Welcome to your first experience with uBO Scope. This guide walks you through enabling, verifying, and accessing the extension right after installation. You'll confirm that uBO Scope is active, visible in your browser toolbar, and has the necessary permissions to begin monitoring remote server connections.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation

After installing uBO Scope via your browser's official extension store or manual method, verify the installation:

- **For Chromium-based Browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave):**
  1. Click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions menu) near the address bar.
  2. Find `uBO Scope` in the list.
  3. Ensure it is enabled (toggle is on).
  4. Optionally, click the pin icon next to `uBO Scope` to keep its icon visible on the toolbar.

- **For Firefox:**
  1. Click the menu button (three horizontal lines) and choose `Add-ons and Themes`.
  2. Select `Extensions` and locate `uBO Scope`.
  3. Confirm it is enabled.
  4. Right-click the toolbar area, and select `Customize Toolbar` to drag the `uBO Scope` icon onto the toolbar if it’s not visible.

- **For Safari (version 18.5 or later):**
  1. Open Safari Preferences and navigate to the `Extensions` tab.
  2. Ensure `uBO Scope` is checked/enabled.
  3. The uBO Scope icon should appear in Safari’s toolbar.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the extension icon on your browser’s toolbar after enabling, it may be hidden in overflow menus or require pinning to the toolbar.
</Tip>

## 2. Verify Extension Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to function:

- **Host permissions:** Access to all HTTP and HTTPS sites
- **Permissions:** Active tab, storage, and web request monitoring

To verify these permissions:

1. Access your browser’s extensions management page:
   - Chrome/Chromium: `chrome://extensions/` or via menu > Extensions
   - Firefox: `about:addons`
   - Safari: Preferences > Extensions

2. Open the details page for uBO Scope.
3. Confirm that the permissions listed include: 
   - Access to `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` URLs
   - Permissions: `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`

<Warning>
Without these permissions, uBO Scope cannot monitor your web traffic. If missing, try reinstalling the extension or updating your browser to a compatible version.
</Warning>

## 3. Enable the Extension Icon on the Toolbar

Once enabled, ensure easy access by displaying the uBO Scope icon:

### On Chromium Browsers:

1. Click the Extensions puzzle icon.
2. Click the pin icon next to uBO Scope to pin it.
3. The icon should now be visible near the address bar.

### On Firefox:

1. Open browser menu > Customize Toolbar.
2. Locate the uBO Scope icon.
3. Drag and drop it onto your preferred toolbar location.
4. Click `Done`.

### On Safari:

1. Open Safari > Preferences > Extensions.
2. Select uBO Scope and ensure the checkbox is ticked.
3. The icon should appear automatically in the toolbar.

<Tip>
Pinning the icon provides quick access to the popup interface and reduces confusion about whether the extension is active.
</Tip>

## 4. Access and Use uBO Scope for the First Time

After confirming the icon's presence:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon on your browser’s toolbar.
2. The popup panel opens, displaying:
   - The current tab’s hostname
   - Count of remote domains contacted
   - Lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains

3. Browse to a website and click the icon again to refresh connection data.

<Note>
The badge number on the extension icon indicates the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected to by the active tab.
</Note>

---

## 5. Confirm Extension Functionality

To verify uBO Scope is working correctly:

- Visit several websites that load external content (e.g., news sites, e-commerce stores).
- Click the extension icon to check the popup for updated domain counts and connection status.
- The badge count should reflect the number of unique third-party domains connected during page load.

<Tip>
If the badge remains empty and no connection data appears:

- Ensure your browser version meets the extension’s minimum requirements (Safari ≥18.5, Chromium ≥122.0, Firefox ≥128.0).
- Confirm no other security software or browser settings are blocking extension APIs.
</Tip>
