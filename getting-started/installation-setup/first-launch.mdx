# Initial Configuration & First Launch

Welcome to your first encounter with uBO Scope — a browser extension designed to reveal every third-party connection attempted or made by the websites you visit. This guide will walk you through launching the extension for the first time, understanding its intuitive popup layout, and verifying that it's running as expected. No complex setup is required, allowing you to effortlessly start gaining valuable insights into your browsing privacy.

## 1. Accessing the uBO Scope Popup

Once you have installed uBO Scope on your supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+), follow these steps to open the popup:

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon">
The extension icon appears in your browser's toolbar. It features the uBO Scope logo and will be near other extensions or the address bar.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Icon to Open the Popup">
Simply click the uBO Scope icon to reveal the popup interface, which displays live data for your current active tab.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If the icon is not visible, verify that the extension is installed and enabled. You can re-enable or pin it via your browser's extensions or add-ons menu.
</Note>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Layout

The uBO Scope popup organizes network connection data into a clear, user-centric summary, focusing on meaningful privacy metrics rather than complex terminology.

### Key Components:

- **Hostname Header**
  - Displays the current tab's hostname and its base domain prominently.
  - Non-base domain portions are shown separately for clarity.

- **Summary Section**
  - Shows the total count of distinct third-party domains connected to by the current page.
  - A lower count generally indicates fewer third-party connections.

- **Connection Outcome Sections**
  - **Not Blocked**: Lists allowed connections by domain with the count of requests.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Shows connections that triggered stealth-blocking behavior.
  - **Blocked**: Displays the third-party domains successfully blocked by your content blocker or browser.

### Example Layout Snapshot

```

<Info>
Counts next to domains represent how many requests to that domain have been observed in the current tab session.

## 3. Verifying the Extension is Running Properly

uBO Scope works quietly in the background tracking network requests. Verification is straightforward:

<Steps>
<Step title="Visit a Website">
Open any webpage in a tab where you want to monitor third-party connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the extension icon to view tracked data for that page.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Domain Count and Lists">
Confirm the badge count on the toolbar icon matches the number shown in the popup summary.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe Real-Time Updates">
Navigate to different sites or reload the page and see the popup update accordingly.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
A visible number on the extension’s badge and meaningful domain data in the popup confirms the extension is functioning correctly.

## 4. What You Don't Need to Do
