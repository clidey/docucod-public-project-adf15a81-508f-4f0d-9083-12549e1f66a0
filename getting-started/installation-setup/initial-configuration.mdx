# Initial Configuration

Welcome to your first step in using uBO Scope! This page guides you through the initial configuration and setup actions you will encounter after installing the extension. You'll learn about permissions requested, the toolbar badge indicator, and how to access and understand the popup panel—key elements for a smooth start.

---

## 1. First-Run Prompts and Permissions

### What to Expect

When you first install uBO Scope in your browser, you might see permission prompts. These are essential because uBO Scope needs to monitor network requests to reveal remote server connections accurately.

### Permissions Requested

- **Network Access (`webRequest` permission):** Allows uBO Scope to listen to all network requests, including HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket (where supported), to detect connections to remote servers.
- **Storage Access:** Enables storing session data locally to persist information about your browsing activity during your browsing session.
- **Active Tab Access:** Allows the extension to collect and display connection data relevant to your currently active browser tab.


> <Warning>
> Approve these permissions only if you trust uBO Scope. The extension strictly reads network requests; it does not modify web page content.
> </Warning>

## 2. Understanding and Using the Toolbar Badge

The toolbar badge on the uBO Scope icon provides a live count of distinct third-party remote servers your browser has connected to from the active tab.

- The count increases as new unique third-party domains are contacted.
- An empty badge means no third-party connections were recorded for the active tab.

### Why This Matters

Tracking the number of third-party servers helps you understand the privacy impact and the complexity of connections involved when you browse websites.

<Tip>
A **lower badge number** generally means fewer external networks contacted, which often aligns with better privacy.
</Tip>

## 3. Popup Panel: Your Window Into Network Connections

Clicking the uBO Scope extension icon opens the popup panel, your detailed dashboard for connections associated with the active tab.

### What You Will See

- **Domain Summary:** Number of distinct domains connected.
- **Connection Status Sections:**
  - *Not blocked* — Domains for which network requests succeeded.
  - *Stealth-blocked* — Connections that were redirected stealthily (e.g., by content blockers).
  - *Blocked* — Domains where connections failed or were explicitly blocked.
- **Domain Lists:** Each section lists domains with a count of how many requests were observed.

### How to Use It

1. Click the extension icon to open the popup.
2. Look at the summary count to gauge overall third-party connections.
3. Explore each section to identify which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

> <Note>
> The popup does not require any additional setup. It will auto-populate as you browse.
> </Note>

## 4. Basic Setup Actions

No manual configuration is required to get started. However, here are important initial tips:

- **Keep the extension enabled:** To continuously monitor connections.
- **Allow permissions when prompted:** As described in the permissions section.
- **Refresh tabs after install:** If you already had tabs open during installation, refreshing them ensures uBO Scope begins tracking network activity immediately.

## 5. Preparing for Your First Exploration

Once you have installed and granted the required permissions, follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel">
Click the uBO Scope icon next to your address bar to reveal connection data for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Browse a Website">
Visit any website and watch the badge update with the number of connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect the Popup">
Open the popup again to see connections categorized by status and domain.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 6. Troubleshooting Common First-Run Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Extension Badge Does Not Appear">
Ensure that you have granted all requested permissions, and the browser is version-compatible with uBO Scope. Try restarting your browser and confirming the extension is enabled.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty">
This may happen if no network activity was detected yet or if you are on a new tab page. Try navigating to a loaded website and then reopening the popup.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Prompt Does Not Appear or Denied">
Check your browser’s extension permission settings and verify that uBO Scope is allowed to access storage, active tab, and webRequest data.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Additional Tips

- **Refresh the tab** after installation for immediate data tracking.
- **Understand the badge count:** It represents distinct third-party domains, not the total number of requests.
- **Combine with content blockers:** uBO Scope works alongside any content blocker without interference, showing actual connection outcomes.
