# Initial Configuration Guide for uBO Scope

This guide helps you complete any post-installation setup tasks required to start using uBO Scope right away. You'll learn how to grant necessary permissions, understand how the extension icon’s badge reflects network activity, and verify your extension is ready to monitor third-party connections seamlessly—without extra effort.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation Completion

After installing uBO Scope from your browser’s official extension marketplace, the extension should be active immediately. Some browsers may require you to grant additional permissions or enable the extension manually.

### Action Steps:

- Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. It uses the uBO Scope logo (a shield icon).
- If your browser requires it, enable the extension explicitly in the extensions/settings menu.
- For first-time use, some browsers may prompt you to confirm permissions—approve all requested permissions to ensure full functionality.

<Tip>
Without granting necessary permissions (e.g., webRequest, activeTab), uBO Scope cannot monitor network connections accurately.
</Tip>

## 2. Grant Necessary Permissions

uBO Scope relies on certain browser permissions to monitor and capture network requests made by webpages. These permissions allow it to observe connections, even those affected by content blockers.

### Essential Permissions:

- **Web Request**: Allows tracking and categorizing requests to third-party servers.
- **Active Tab Access**: Enables data display relevant to the currently active tab.
- **Storage Access**: Stores session and preference data.

Your browser should request these permissions automatically during installation. If you declined any, revisit your browser’s extension permissions settings and enable them.

<Warning>
Inadequate permissions will limit uBO Scope’s capabilities, leading to incomplete or missing data in the popup display and inaccurate badge counts.
</Warning>

## 3. Understanding the Extension Icon Badge

One of uBO Scope’s key user interface features is the badge number displayed on its toolbar icon. This number reflects the **count of distinct third-party remote domains** from which your browser fetched resources on the active tab.

### What the Badge Means:

- **Number displayed:** Represents unique third-party domains successfully contacted.
- **No number (blank badge):** Either no third-party connections or the extension hasn’t captured data yet.

This instantly helps you gauge the level of third-party tracking or resource fetching on any webpage.

<Info>
A lower badge count is more desirable because it means fewer distinct third parties are involved in loading the webpage.
</Info>

## 4. Post-Installation Behavior

Once permissions are granted and uBO Scope is enabled:

- The extension will **automatically start capturing network request data** for each active tab.
- Network requests are categorized as **allowed (not blocked)**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked**.
- Your toolbar badge updates dynamically to reflect the current count of allowed third-party domains.
- Opening the popup interface via the extension icon displays detailed connection outcomes and domain counts.

## 5. Accessing the Popup Interface

To view detailed connection data anytime:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
2. The popup will display:
   - The active tab's hostname.
   - The total number of connected third-party domains.
   - Separate lists of domains categorized by connection outcomes: “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked.”

<Tip>
You can use this interface to quickly audit which third-party servers your browser communicates with while visiting any webpage.
</Tip>

## 6. Verifying uBO Scope Is Monitoring Correctly

Ensure the extension is working as expected:

- Confirm that the badge shows a number after you load a webpage that uses third-party resources.
- Open the extension popup and check that domain lists populate according to connection outcomes.
- If the badge never updates and popup lists remain empty, recheck permissions and extension enablement.

<Steps>
<Step title="Reload Your Webpage">
Open or reload a website that you know includes third-party content (e.g., sites with ads, embedded videos, or social widgets).
</Step>
<Step title="Observe Icon Badge">
Watch the uBO Scope toolbar icon for the badge number updating with connected third-party domain counts.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup">
Click the extension icon to review detailed domain connection results.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Domain Counts">
Verify that the allowed, stealth, and blocked domains are listed with count badges.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 7. Common Pitfalls and Tips

- **Badge Not Updating:** This usually results from missing permissions or browser restrictions on `webRequest` APIs; check browser extension settings.
- **No Popup Data:** If you see ‘NO DATA,’ ensure you are viewing an active tab with loaded content and that the extension is enabled.
- **Permission Prompts Hidden:** Some browsers suppress repeated permission requests; you may need to reinstall the extension or reset permissions.

## 8. Troubleshooting Resources

If you encounter issues during initial configuration or post-installation:

- Review the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../first-steps-usage-validation/troubleshooting-common-setup-issues) page to resolve typical setup problems.
- Verify system and browser environment with [Prerequisites & Supported Browsers](../installation-setup/prerequisites-system-requirements).
- Confirm installation integrity with [Accessing the Popup & Verifying Installation](../first-steps-usage-validation/accessing-popup-verifying-install).
