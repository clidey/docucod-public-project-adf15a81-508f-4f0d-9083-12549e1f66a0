## 2. Review and Confirm Extension Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network connections effectively. These permissions are requested during installation, but verifying them post-installation guarantees that the extension operates smoothly:

- **Required Permissions:**
  - `webRequest`: Allows intercepting and examining network requests.
  - `activeTab`: To identify the current tab when showing details.
  - `storage`: To save session and configuration data.

### How to Verify Permissions

1. Go to your browser’s extensions page.
2. Select uBO Scope.
3. Confirm the listed permissions include `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`.

If any permissions are missing or disabled:
- Reinstall the extension.
- Check browser settings to ensure extensions are allowed the necessary permissions.

<Warning>
If `webRequest` permission is not active, uBO Scope cannot monitor network connections accurately.
</Warning>

## 3. Understand the Basic Popup Interface

The popup interface provides a detailed summary of third-party network connections seen by uBO Scope for the active tab. Here's what to expect when you click the uBO Scope icon:

### Key Sections of the Popup

- **Tab Hostname Display:** Shows the current webpage's hostname prominently at the top.
- **Summary Count:** Indicates the number of distinct third-party domains with connections detected.
- **Connection Outcomes:** Listed in three categorized sections:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which connections were allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with connections that were stealth-blocked (redirected without visible blocking).
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed or were explicitly blocked.

### Example Layout

```text
[Hostname Info]
Domains connected: [Count]

NOT BLOCKED
 - example.com (12)
 - cdn.site.net (5)

STEALTH-BLOCKED
 - tracker.hidden.org (3)

BLOCKED
 - ads.badsite.io (7)
```

### Navigating the Popup

- Domains are displayed with their network request count.
- Use this interface primarily to quickly identify which third-party servers the current tab is communicating with and their status.

<Info>
The popup does not require any user configuration for first use. Simply opening it after pinning provides immediate insights.
</Info>

## 4. Prepare for Your First Use

After pinning and verifying permissions, you’re ready to start monitoring network connections.

**Best Practices:**

- Open a website (for example, your favorite news site).
- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
- Observe the domains listed under each outcome to understand the network connections made by that site.

<Tip>
You can cross-reference connection data with other content blockers to get a fuller picture of which third parties are active or being blocked.
