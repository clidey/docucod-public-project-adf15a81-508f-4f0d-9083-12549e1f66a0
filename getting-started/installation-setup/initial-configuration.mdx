# Initial Configuration & First Launch

Welcome to the first step after successfully installing uBO Scope. This guide will help you quickly access the extension, verify that it is working, and adjust optional settings if applicable. By the end, you'll be ready to use uBO Scope to monitor the third-party remote servers your browser connects to.

---

## 1. Accessing uBO Scope

Once installed, uBO Scope integrates with your browser toolbar as an extension icon featuring the uBO Scope logo.

### How to Open the uBO Scope Interface:

1. Locate the **uBO Scope icon** in your browser's toolbar.
2. Click the icon to open the popup interface.

The popup provides a tab-focused summary of domains your browser has connected to, categorized by their network outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).

<Tip>
If you do not see the icon, check your browserâ€™s extension management page to verify the extension is enabled.
</Tip>

## 2. Verifying Extension Activation and Basics

After installation, uBO Scope runs automatically without configuration. Confirm that it is active and tracking by following these steps:

### Step-by-Step Verification:

1. **Open a new browser tab** and navigate to a website of your choice.
2. Click the **uBO Scope toolbar icon** to open the popup.
3. Look for:
   - The **toolbar badge** number on the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. This displays the count of distinct third-party domains your browser has made successful network connections to.
   - The **popup summary** showing the number of domains connected.
   - Sections labeled **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** indicating network request outcomes categorized by domain.

If the toolbar badge is showing a number (or blank if zero) and the popup displays domain data corresponding to your browsing, uBO Scope is functioning correctly.

## 3. Understanding Baseline Default Behavior

By default, uBO Scope:

- Monitors network requests initiated by your browser to remote servers on HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and secure WebSocket protocols.
- Aggregates these by domain using the Public Suffix List to provide meaningful summaries.
- Displays counts for:
  - **Allowed domains** (successful connections).
  - **Stealth-blocked domains** (redirects or stealth blocking detections).
  - **Blocked domains** (network errors or blocked requests).

This baseline requires no additional configuration and applies immediately to your browsing experience.

<Info>
The toolbar badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers for which connections were successful. A lower count often indicates fewer third-party connections and potentially better privacy.
</Info>

## 4. Optional Settings and Configuration

Currently, uBO Scope requires minimal setup. Optional configurations may become available in future versions. For now, there are no mandatory or advanced settings to tweak before first use.

You can check for updates or features by visiting the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).

## 5. Preparing for Your First Use

To make the most of uBO Scope:

1. **Navigate to websites you frequently visit.** Observe how the toolbar badge count changes to reveal the diversity of third-party connections.
2. **Open the uBO Scope popup frequently** to see which domains are listed as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked in real time.
3. Use this information as a foundation to understand your browsing security and the effectiveness of your current content blockers.

<Note>
Not all third-party connections are malicious or unwanted; many content delivery networks (CDNs) are legitimate and essential. Use uBO Scope to get transparency, not to automatically judge domains.
</Note>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

If you experience issues during your initial configuration or first launch:

- Make sure your browser version meets the minimum requirements:
  - **Chromium browsers:** Version 122.0 or higher
  - **Firefox:** Version 128.0 or higher
  - **Safari:** Version 18.5 or higher
- Confirm the extension is enabled in your browser's extension or add-on manager.
- Reload your browser or restart it if the extension does not appear active.
- Visit [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../first-run-validation/common-issues-solutions) for a more detailed diagnosis.

## 7. Next Steps

Once you have confirmed that uBO Scope is installed, active, and displaying connection data:

- Explore the [Quick Validation Steps](../first-run-validation/quick-validation) guide to confirm your setup is capturing network data correctly.
- Learn to interpret the data by reviewing [Reading Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Domains](../../guides/interpreting-data/reading-status).
- Discover the deeper meaning behind the toolbar badge in [Making Sense of Toolbar Badge Counts](../../guides/interpreting-data/badge-counts-meaning).

By following these guides, you'll rapidly progress from initial setup to expert use.
