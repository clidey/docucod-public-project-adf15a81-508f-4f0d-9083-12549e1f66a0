# Configuration After Installation

After you have successfully installed uBO Scope in your browser, a few essential post-installation steps will ensure the extension is fully enabled and ready for use. This guide walks you through enabling uBO Scope, configuring optional preferences such as pinning it to the toolbar, and granting the necessary permissions when prompted.

1. Open your browser's extension or add-on management page:
   - **Chrome/Chromium:** Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - **Firefox:** Navigate to `about:addons`
   - **Safari:** Go to Preferences > Extensions

2. Locate **uBO Scope** (sometimes listed as **uBlock Origin Scope**).
3. Confirm that the extension is enabled (the toggle should be active).

## 2. Pin uBO Scope to the Toolbar (Optional but Recommended)

Pinning uBO Scope ensures quick access and constant visibility of its badge count monitoring third-party connections.

### For Chromium-based browsers:

1. Locate the puzzle-piece icon (Extensions) near the browser's address bar.
2. Click it to open the extensions menu.
3. Find **uBO Scope** and click the pushpin icon to pin it to the toolbar.

### For Firefox:

1. Click the overflow menu icon (three horizontal bars) in the toolbar.
2. Click on "Customize Toolbar".
3. Drag the uBO Scope icon to the visible toolbar area.
4. Click "Done" to save your changes.

### For Safari:

1. Open Safari's Preferences.
2. Select the Extensions tab.
3. Verify that uBO Scope shows an icon.
4. While Safari automatically shows extension icons for enabled extensions, you can customize the Safari toolbar by right-clicking the toolbar and choosing "Customize Toolbar" to add or rearrange icons.

## 3. Grant Requested Permissions

uBO Scope requires certain permissions to monitor your browser’s network connections properly. When you first install or enable the extension, the browser may prompt you to grant these permissions.

### Typical Permission Prompts Include:

- **Access to websites:** Needed for monitoring HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket connections (e.g., `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
- **WebRequest API Access:** To observe network requests passing through the browser.
- **Storage Access:** To save session and configuration data.

### Action Steps:

1. When the browser displays a permission prompt, read it carefully.
2. Accept or allow the requested permissions for uBO Scope.

> <Warning>
> Denying permissions will prevent uBO Scope from functioning as intended, resulting in incomplete or missing connection data.
> </Warning>

## 4. Confirm Extension Initialization

Once permissions are granted and the extension is enabled:

1. Open any website in a new tab.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon on your toolbar.
3. The extension's popup should display data about the current page's network connections, including counts of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

If no data appears, wait a few seconds, refresh the page, or consult troubleshooting resources (see Troubleshooting section).

## 5. Optional Configuration Settings

Currently, uBO Scope has no configurable settings immediately after installation besides pinning and permissions, but future updates may expose additional options.

Keep an eye on release notes for updates to configuration capabilities.
