# Initial Configuration

Welcome to the initial configuration guide for **uBO Scope**. This page will help you verify that the extension is installed correctly, running smoothly, and show you how to access and interpret the extension's user interface on first use.

---

## 1. Verify Extension Installation

Before proceeding with any configuration, ensure uBO Scope is properly installed in your browser.

### Steps to Verify Installation

1. **Locate the Toolbar Icon:**
   - Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's extension toolbar. It uses the uBO Scope logo.
2. **Check Extension Permissions:**
   - Confirm the extension has requested permissions for `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
   - These permissions ensure accurate monitoring and data tracking.
3. **Version Check:**
   - Right-click the extension icon and open "Manage extensions" or "Extensions" page.
   - Confirm that version `1.0.1` (or later) is installed.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the icon, check if uBO Scope is enabled in your extensions manager.
</Tip>

## 2. Accessing the Extension Popup

The primary interface of uBO Scope is its popup, which displays network activity summary per browser tab.

### How to Open the Popup

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- This opens the popup window where you can review connection summaries.

### Popup Interface Overview

- **Hostname Display:** Shows the domain and subdomains of the current active tab.
- **Summary:** Number of distinct remote domains connected (displayed next to "domains connected:").
- **Domains Lists:** Divided into three outcomes:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains subject to stealth blocking or redirects.
  - **Blocked:** Domains blocked due to errors or filters.

> Initially, if no data is available for the tab, the hostname shows 'NO DATA' and the domains count is '?'.

## 3. Initial User Experience and What to Expect

Upon first running uBO Scope, the extension immediately starts monitoring network connections for active tabs.

### Your First Observations:

- The badge on the toolbar icon will show a number indicating how many unique third-party domains the current tab connected to.
- Opening the popup will populate the three domain lists with live observed data as you browse.
- The interface updates dynamically as network requests succeed, redirect, or get blocked.

<Note>
The extension depends on browser `webRequest` API visibility; network requests outside this API’s scope will not be tracked.
</Note>

## 4. Configuration Settings

uBO Scope does not require or offer manual configuration adjustments on first run. It auto-loads and continuously updates network connection data.

### Backend Handling

- The extension maintains session data stored in browser storage for the current window and tab.
- No user configuration steps are needed to enable features.

## 5. Verify uBO Scope is Running Correctly

After installation, perform this quick test to confirm proper operation.

### Step-by-step Verification

1. Open a new tab and navigate to a commonly visited website (e.g., a news page or search engine).
2. Observe the uBO Scope toolbar badge number change to reflect the count of third-party domains connected.
3. Click the extension icon to open the popup:
   - Verify that the hostname matches the current tab domain.
   - Check the summarized domains under "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked" sections.
4. Refresh the webpage and watch the popup update dynamically.

<Tip>
If the badge remains empty or the popup shows 'NO DATA' after browsing a page, try closing and reopening the tab, or restarting the browser.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Popup Shows 'NO DATA':**
  - Ensure you are on an active, fully loaded webpage (network monitoring begins after main frame loads).
  - Check that uBO Scope has necessary permissions enabled.
  - Verify the browser version meets minimum requirements (Chrome >= 122, Firefox >= 128, Safari >= 18.5).

- **Badge Count Not Updating:**
  - The extension listens for network events and updates badges asynchronously.
  - Wait a few seconds after loading a page for the badge to refresh.
  - Restart the browser if updates do not appear.

- **Extension Icon Missing:**
  - Check browser extension management page to confirm installation and enabled status.
  - Pin the extension to the toolbar using the browser's UI customization.

<Warning>
uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API, which some browsers or versions might limit or disable for security reasons. Without this API, data will not be captured.
</Warning>
