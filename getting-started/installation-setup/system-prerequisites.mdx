# Prerequisites & Supported Browsers

Welcome to uBO Scope! Before installing this extension, it is essential to confirm that your browser and environment meet the system requirements for a seamless experience. This guide helps you understand which browsers uBO Scope supports and what prerequisites are necessary to get started.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to integrate deeply with modern browsers using their web extension APIs. It currently supports the following browsers:

- **Google Chrome** (Chromium-based browsers included)
  - Minimum version: 122.0 or later
  - Available via Chrome Web Store

- **Safari**
  - Minimum version: 18.5 or later
  - Available via Safari Extensions

</Note>

## 2. System Requirements

Since uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension, system requirements are minimal but important to confirm:

- **Operating Systems Supported**:
  - Windows, macOS, Linux for Chromium and Firefox
  - macOS for Safari, version 18.5 or newer

- **Browser Requirements**:
  - Must support Manifest Version 3 and the `webRequest` API
  - Ability to install extensions from respective official stores or via sideloading where applicable

- **Permissions Needed**:
  - Storage access to save extension data
  - ActiveTab permission to monitor requests on the active tab
  - WebRequest permission to observe network requests

## 3. Key Technical Prerequisites

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure these browser capabilities and environment settings are enabled:

- **WebRequest API Access**:
  uBO Scope relies on the `webRequest` API, which is critical for monitoring all attempted and successful remote server connections. Ensure this API is available and not restricted by your browser or organizational policies.

- **Host Permissions**:
  uBO Scope requires broad host permissions for HTTP, HTTPS, as well as WebSocket protocols to fully monitor network requests:

  ```json
  [
    "https://*/*",
    "http://*/*",
    "wss://*/*",
    "ws://*/*"
  ]
  ```

  For Safari, only HTTP and HTTPS host permissions are supported.

- **ActiveTab and Storage Permissions**:
  These are necessary for managing session data and accessing the active tab's network details.

## 4. Network Requirements

To accurately report network connections, uBO Scope needs:

- Unrestricted internet connectivity to fetch all remote server connections from active tabs
- No firewall or proxy blocking the browser's requests or extension communication

<Warning>
Restrictive firewall or security software blocking extension APIs might impair uBO Scopeâ€™s effectiveness.
</Warning>

## 5. Verifying Browser Compatibility

To confirm your browser version and compatibility:

### For Chromium Browsers:

1. Open the browser.
2. Go to `chrome://settings/help`.
3. Confirm the version is 122.0 or higher.

### For Firefox:

1. Open the browser.
2. Go to `about:support` or `about:preferences`.
3. Locate the version number; it must be 128.0 or higher.

### For Safari:

1. Open Safari.
2. Click `Safari` > `About Safari` from the menu bar.
3. Confirm the version is 18.5 or higher.

## 6. Summary of Browser Manifest Details

The built-in manifest files for each supported platform declare the exact permissions and minimum versions:

}
```

  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*", "wss://*/*", "ws://*/*"]
}
```
</Accordion>

  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*"]
}
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Best Practices Before Installing

- **Ensure the browser is fully updated** to minimize issues from deprecated APIs or missing features.
- **Avoid security policies or browser configurations** that disable extension network APIs.
- If using Firefox or Chromium in specialized environments (e.g., corporate managed setups), verify that the `webRequest` API is fully accessible.

## 8. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting Tips

- <Warning>
  Using outdated browser versions below the minimum required will cause installation failure or malfunction.
  </Warning>

- <Tip>
  If the extension's badge or popup fails to reflect accurate data, check if the browser's `webRequest` API is blocked by other extensions or security settings.
  </Tip>

- <Tip>
  On Safari, note that WebSocket monitoring is limited; expect a narrower scope compared to Chromium or Firefox.
  </Tip>

- <Note>
  Ensure you have permissions to install extensions in your browser or device, as corporate policies may restrict installation.
  </Note>
