# System Requirements & Supported Browsers

Ensure your system and browser meet the necessary criteria before installing and using uBO Scope. This page outlines the minimum requirements, supported browsers, and important compatibility notes to help you choose the correct extension version and avoid potential issues.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

uBO Scope operates as a browser extension and thus requires a compatible browser on any standard desktop operating system. Supported OS platforms for the browsers listed below include:

- **Windows** (Windows 10 and later recommended)
- **macOS** (macOS 11 Big Sur and later recommended)
- **Linux** (various modern distributions)

> Since uBO Scope is a browser extension, it inherits compatibility from the underlying browser and should run wherever the supported browser versions run.


## 2. Supported Browsers

To leverage the full capabilities of uBO Scope, ensure you use one of the supported browsers with compatible versions. The extension uses modern WebExtension APIs (`webRequest` and Manifest V3 features), so compatibility depends on browser support for these technologies.

| Browser           | Minimum Version | Installation Source                                         |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Google Chrome     | 122.0+          | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Mozilla Firefox   | 128.0+          | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |
| Safari            | 18.5+           | [Safari Extensions Gallery / App Store]                     |


### Notes on Browser Support

- **Manifest Version 3**: uBO Scope uses Manifest Version 3, ensuring the extension conforms to the latest browser extension security and performance standards.

- **Minimum Chrome Version**: The Chromium-based extension requires Chrome 122 or later to ensure full support for service workers as background scripts.

- **Firefox Requirements**: Firefox requires version 128 or later, including Firefox on Android, for full compatibility.

- **Safari Compatibility**: The Safari extension requires Safari 18.5 or later, as specified in its manifest. Older versions are not supported.


## 3. Browser Permissions Required

uBO Scope requests specific permissions that must be granted for it to work correctly:

- **activeTab**: To access data for the tab you are currently viewing.
- **storage**: To save session data and settings.
- **webRequest**: To monitor network requests made by web pages.

These permissions are standard for extensions that monitor network activity and will be requested upon installation.


## 4. Network Requirements

uBO Scope listens to browser network events using the `webRequest` API:

- Must allow the extension to monitor HTTP and HTTPS traffic (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`).
- WebSocket protocols (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) are monitored in browsers supporting them (e.g., Firefox, Chromium).

No additional firewall configuration is typically required, but ensure that browser network filtering or proxy settings do not interfere with extension permissions.


## 5. Choosing the Correct Extension Version

uBO Scope provides separate extension packages for each supported browser platform. Ensure you download and install the version matching your browser:

- **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)**: Use the Chromium version from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).

- **Mozilla Firefox**: Use the Firefox version from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).

- **Safari**: Use the Safari version available via the Mac App Store or Safari Extensions Gallery (requires Safari 18.5+).

Installing an incompatible version or in an unsupported browser may result in functionality breakage or installation failure.


## 6. Compatibility Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep Browsers Updated**: Use the latest browser version to receive security patches and ensure compatibility with Manifest v3 policies.

- **Verify Extension Permissions**: Confirm during installation that all requested permissions are granted to uBO Scope.

- **Avoid Conflicting Extensions**: Some privacy or security extensions may interfere with uBO Scopeâ€™s ability to monitor network requests; consider disabling conflicting tools if you experience issues.

- **Use Supported Browsers for Full Feature Set**: While other browsers might support WebExtensions, uBO Scope is tested and supported explicitly on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.


## 7. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

- Confirm the extension is enabled in your browser's extensions page.
- Ensure the browser version meets the minimum requirements.
- Verify that the extension permissions include 'webRequest' and 'activeTab'.
- Check for conflicts with other content blockers or privacy extensions that might block webRequest API access.
