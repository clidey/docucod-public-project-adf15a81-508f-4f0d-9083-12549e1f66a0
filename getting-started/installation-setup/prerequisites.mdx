# System Requirements & Compatibility

Ensure your device and browser meet the necessary prerequisites and compatibility standards to run uBO Scope effectively. This page details supported browsers, minimum versions, and specific technical considerations tied to the browser APIs that uBO Scope depends on for accurate network connection reporting.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension and officially supports the following browsers with these minimum versions:

| Browser  | Minimum Version |
|----------|----------------|
| **Firefox** | 128.0          |
| **Chromium-based browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.) | 122.0          |
| **Safari** | 18.5           |


> These version requirements ensure uBO Scope can access the necessary browser APIs, especially the `webRequest` API, which is crucial for monitoring network requests.


### Why These Versions?

- **Firefox**: Starting with version 128.0, the extension can leverage the `webRequest` API and background modules following latest manifest conventions.
- **Chromium**: Version 122.0 or newer supports Manifest V3 extensions employing service workers for background scripts, which uBO Scope requires.
- **Safari**: Version 18.5 or higher is needed for sufficient extension support and API compatibility.


## 2. System Prerequisites

No special hardware or system software installation is required beyond having a compatible browser.

**System should have:**

- The supported browser installed and updated to the minimum required version.
- Network capabilities enabling HTTPS and WebSocket connections, as uBO Scope monitors these types of requests.


## 3. Browser API and Permissions Requirements

uBO Scope depends heavily on browser capabilities to monitor network requests. It requires certain permissions and API availability:

- **Permissions Required:**
  - `webRequest` — essential to observe network traffic.
  - `activeTab` — to associate network requests with the active browser tab.
  - `storage` — to persist user preferences and extension state.

- **Host Permissions:**
  - Access to all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) to track all types of remote connections.


## 4. Technical Limitations Due to Browser API Coverage

While uBO Scope strives to reveal *all* network connections your browser performs, the monitoring is constrained by the underlying browser APIs:

- **Network requests not exposed to the `webRequest` API will not appear in uBO Scope.**
- Examples of such requests include:
  - Requests made by browser components running outside the context of web requests (e.g., some internal browser services).
  - Network activity by extensions or apps that do not surface through the standard APIs.
  - DNS-only blocking performed by some security solutions, where the browser never attempts the network connection.


This limitation means uBO Scope cannot guarantee visibility on outside-of-browser or stealthy system-level network activity.


## 5. Platform-Specific Notes

### Firefox
- Requires version 128.0 or higher due to API and extension manifest compatibility.
- Uses background scripts loaded as ES modules.

### Chromium-based Browsers
- Requires minimum Chrome/Chromium version 122.0, supporting Manifest V3 and service workers.
- Background script runs as a service worker.

### Safari
- Requires Safari 18.5 or later for Manifest V3 support and required APIs.


## 6. Best Practices for Ensuring Compatibility

- Keep your browser updated to the latest stable version.
- Ensure no restrictive enterprise policies or security software interfere with extension permissions.
- Verify that your browser's settings allow extensions to use `webRequest` API and network monitoring features.
- Avoid using third-party privacy or firewall extensions that block or obscure network requests invisibly, as this might reduce uBO Scope's accuracy.


## 7. Verification Steps After Installation

After installing uBO Scope (see [Installing the Extension](/getting-started/installation-setup/install-extension)), verify that it can monitor network requests:

1. Open uBO Scope's popup in your browser toolbar.
2. Visit various websites and observe the updated connection counts and domains.
3. Confirm that connections to standard web pages and known third-party servers are reported.


<Tip>
If you notice no connections or strange counts despite browsing, re-check your browser version and permissions. Also, ensure no conflicting extensions or network policies prevent monitoring.
</Tip>

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Compatibility Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Extension Not Loading or Crashing">
- Ensure your browser version meets the minimum required version.
- Check for conflicting extensions that might interfere with APIs.
- Restart the browser after installing uBO Scope.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Network Requests Visible">
- Verify that `webRequest` API is enabled and available.
- Check if third-party network monitoring tools or VPNs block or reroute connections invisibly.
- Make sure host permissions are granted during extension installation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Requests Denied">
- Grant all requested permissions to uBO Scope during installation.
- If permissions are denied, uninstall and reinstall the extension ensuring acceptance.
- Some enterprise environments may restrict permissions; consult your IT administrator.
