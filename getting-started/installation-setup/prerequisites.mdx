# Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

Before installing uBO Scope, it’s essential to verify that your browser and operating system are fully supported. This ensures you experience a smooth setup without surprises, and guarantees the extension can operate with full functionality.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with major browsers that support Manifest Version 3 (MV3) extensions and the `webRequest` API. Currently, the officially supported browsers are:

- **Google Chrome (Chromium-based browsers)**
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Apple Safari**

Each browser requires a specific build tailored to its extension environment and API requirements.

### Browser Version Requirements

| Browser        | Minimum Version | Notes                                   |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Chrome         | 122.0+          | Required for MV3 and minimum API support|
| Firefox        | 128.0+          | Supports MV3 and relevant APIs          |
| Safari         | 18.5+           | Requires Safari Web Extensions with MV3|


## 2. Supported Operating Systems

uBO Scope runs on any operating system that supports the above browsers at the required versions. This includes:

- **Windows**
- **macOS**
- **Linux**
- **iOS/iPadOS (Safari on iOS 18.5 or newer)**
- **Android (Firefox 128+, Chromium-based browsers if applicable)**


## 3. Where to Get uBO Scope

You must install the version of uBO Scope appropriate for your browser. Below are official download links for the supported platforms.

| Browser  | Official Store Link |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Chrome (Chromium)** | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| **Firefox** | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |


Apple Safari users will find uBO Scope available through the Safari Extensions Gallery or the Mac App Store according to Safari’s extension management policies.


## 4. Compatibility Verification Before Installation

Before installing uBO Scope, confirm the following for a seamless experience:

- Your browser is updated to the minimum supported version or later.
- Your operating system supports the browser version.
- You have the necessary permissions to install extensions (for example, administrator privileges in some corporate environments).


## 5. Installation-Specific Notes by Platform

### Chromium-Based Browsers

- Requires Chrome 122 or higher.
- The extension uses a service worker as the background script.
- The extension’s manifest includes permissions for `webRequest` and access to HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs.

### Mozilla Firefox

- Requires Firefox version 128 or higher.
- Permissions are similar to Chromium, but the manifest uses a background script as a module.
- The extension supports strict minimum Firefox version enforcement.

### Apple Safari

- Requires Safari 18.5 or higher.
- Background script runs as a module.
- Host permissions cover HTTP and HTTPS only (no WebSocket support as of current manifest).


## 6. Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

- **Do not install versions for other browsers:** Each build is tailored for its environment; using a version designed for another browser will not function correctly.
- **Keep your browser updated:** Browser API changes may affect uBO Scope’s ability to monitor network requests accurately.
- **Avoid restrictive security policies:** If your network or system blocks `webRequest` API usage or extension installations, uBO Scope may not work correctly.


## 7. Next Steps After Verifying Compatibility

Once you have confirmed support and obtained the correct version:

- Proceed to the [Installation Instructions](/getting-started/installation-setup/installing-ubo-scope) to install uBO Scope.
- After installation, refer to [Validating Your Installation](/getting-started/installation-setup/first-run-validation) to ensure uBO Scope operates correctly in your environment.

<Tip>
Always verify you are installing uBO Scope from official browser extension stores listed above to avoid unofficial or compromised versions.
</Tip>

<Tip>
On slower or heavily secured systems, some extension permissions might require explicit user approval during installation—review dialogs carefully.
</Tip>
