### 2.2 Manual Installation

If you need to install uBO Scope manually (e.g., development, testing, or browser unsupported by official stores), follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the source code from the [uBO Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
2. Choose the platform folder for your browser (`platform/chromium`, `platform/firefox`, or `platform/safari`).
3. Load the extension as an **unpacked extension** in your browser:

   - **Chrome:** Go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable **Developer mode**, click **Load unpacked**, and select the appropriate platform folder.
   - **Firefox:** Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click **Load Temporary Add-on**, and select the `manifest.json` inside the platform folder.
   - **Safari:** Follow [Apple’s Extension Builder instructions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions) to load the extension from the source.

<Tip>
Manual installation is primarily for development purposes. Regular users should prefer official extension stores for smoother updates and security.

## 3. Verifying the Installation

Once uBO Scope is installed:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar (a small shield icon labeled ‘uBO Scope’).
2. Click the icon to open the popup interface.
3. The extension should display a placeholder message like "NO DATA" initially.
4. Navigate to a website; you should see the counts of distinct connected third-party domains updating in near real-time on the popup and on the icon badge.

<Check>
If you see no errors and see the badge count update as you browse, the installation was successful.
</Check>

## 4. Tips and Best Practices

- **Permissions Prompt:** During installation, your browser will ask to grant specific permissions. Make sure to allow all requested permissions for proper operation.
- **Keep Browser Updated:** The extension depends on modern browser APIs only fully available in latest versions.
- **Consider Browser Settings:** Some privacy or security settings may affect the extension’s ability to monitor network requests.
- **Use Official Stores:** Installing from official stores ensures you receive trusted updates and support.

## 5. Troubleshooting Installation Issues

If installation fails or uBO Scope does not behave as expected:

- **Extension Icon Missing:** Check if the extension is enabled in your browser's extensions page.
- **Permissions Denied:** Reinstall the extension and accept all permission prompts.
- **Browser Version Too Old:** Update your browser to meet the minimum version requirement.
- **Manual Installation Issues:** Ensure you select the correct platform folder and have enabled developer mode.
