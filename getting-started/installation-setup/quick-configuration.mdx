# Quick Configuration & Permissions

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide ensures you complete all necessary post-installation steps, granting permissions and understanding key interface elements, so you’re ready to start monitoring your first network connection with confidence.

---

## 1. Granting Required Permissions

uBO Scope relies on specific browser permissions to function correctly. Right after installation, you may encounter prompts requesting permission approval.

### What to Expect
- **Host permissions** for accessing network requests on all HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket URLs (e.g., `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
- **Extension permissions** including `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`. These allow tracking network requests, storing session data, and interacting with the active browser tab.

### Steps to Grant Permissions
<Steps>
<Step title="Review Permission Prompt">
Upon installing uBO Scope, your browser will prompt you to allow access to requested sites and network activity.
- Read carefully what is requested.
- The extension requires these permissions to monitor external connections across websites you visit.
</Step>
<Step title="Accept Permissions">
Click ‘Allow’ or ‘Accept’ to grant the extension required host and webRequest permissions.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Extension Icon Activation">
Once permissions are granted, confirm the extension’s toolbar icon becomes active (colored and clickable).
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you decline necessary permissions, uBO Scope will not be able to monitor connections properly. You can update permissions later in the browser’s extensions settings.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Icon Behavior

The uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar is your primary indicator and launcher.

### Icon States & Their Meaning
- **Default state**: Indicates uBO Scope is installed and active but no data has been collected yet.
- **Badge count**: Shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers allowed (not blocked) on the active tab. Lower numbers usually mean fewer third-party connections.
- **Click behavior**: Clicking the icon opens the popup panel summarizing network connections.

### What You Should Know
- The badge updates dynamically as you browse.
- A blank badge means no third-party connections detected on the current tab.

<Note>
The badge count represents _allowed_ third-party server connections, which is the primary privacy indicator. Blocked connections are detailed in the popup panel but do not increase the badge count.
</Note>

## 3. Handling Initial Prompts and Setup

Some browsers may show extra prompts during your first interaction with uBO Scope.

### Common Prompts
- **Extension activation confirmation**
- **Access to active tab data** (needed for detailed domain analysis)

### Action Steps
<Steps>
<Step title="Respond to Activation Prompts">
Allow any browser dialogs requesting to activate or permit the extension for current or future browsing sessions.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload or Open a Tab">
Open a new browser tab or reload existing tabs to begin capturing network requests immediately.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you do not see activity after granting permission, reload the current tab to trigger network request monitoring.
</Tip>

## 4. Launching uBO Scope for Your First Analysis Session

Now that permissions are set and the icon is active, you're ready to monitor network connections on live webpages.

### Step-by-Step First Launch
<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Website">
Navigate to any website you want to analyze in your browser.
</Step>
<Step title="Click on the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon">
Click the icon to open the popup panel showing details of network connections for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Popup Panel">
The popup includes:
- A count of connected domains.
- Categorized sections for allowed (not blocked), stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Badge Count for Active Tab">
Observe the badge on the icon to understand the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you see "NO DATA" or zero domains listed, try navigating to a different site or reload the current tab to generate network data.
</Tip>
