## 2. Required Permissions

During installation, uBO Scope requests specific permissions essential for its operation. Understanding these permissions helps you trust the extension and anticipate its behavior.

| Permission   | Purpose                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `activeTab`  | Access data about the currently active tab to report network connections from that tab.
| `storage`    | Store session data and user settings securely within the browser.
| `webRequest` | Listen to network requests initiated by web pages to identify distinct third-party connections.


### Host Permissions

Additionally, uBO Scope requests access to the following URL patterns to monitor network activity:

- `https://*/*`
- `http://*/*`
- `wss://*/*` *(Chromium and Firefox only)*
- `ws://*/*` *(Chromium and Firefox only)*

<Tip>
These host permissions enable uBO Scope to capture network requests across all regular and websocket protocols initiated by webpages.

## 3. System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Compatible with any OS supporting the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, or Safari (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android).
- **Memory & Storage:** Minimal memory and disk space needed due to efficient data handling within the browser environment.

## 4. Preparing for Installation

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure the following:

- Your browser version meets or exceeds the minimum listed above.

<Tip>
Disable conflicting extensions or browser policies that might restrict the `webRequest` API usage to guarantee accurate network monitoring.
</Tip>

## 5. Understanding Impact & Privacy

uBO Scope operates as a transparent observer:

- It **does not block** or modify any network requests.
- All data collection remains local to your browser session.
- The data observed pertains solely to your browsing activity and network connections initiated by webpages.

<Info>
The extension's manifest declares all permissions upfront, and the source code is openly available for review at the official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
