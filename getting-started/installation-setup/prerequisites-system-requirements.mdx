# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing and using uBO Scope, ensure that your system and browser environment meet the necessary requirements. This page details supported browsers and operating systems, required permissions, and configuration tips to prepare for a smooth setup and optimal extension performance.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers & Minimum Versions

uBO Scope supports the following browsers and versions, reflecting the extension's compatibility and required browser APIs:

- **Chromium-based Browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge)
  - Minimum version: **122.0**
  - Reason: Requires Manifest V3 support and stable `webRequest` permissions
- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum version: **128.0**
  - Includes Firefox for Android (version 128.0 or later)
- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum version: **18.5**

> These minimum versions are required to ensure compatibility with modern browser API features uBO Scope relies on.

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

- **Windows** (latest versions supporting above browsers)
- **macOS** (including Safari 18.5+)
- **Linux** (with Chromium or Firefox meeting version requirements)
- **Android** (Firefox 128+ only)

> Note: Because uBO Scope operates as a browser extension, it inherits the operating system support of each browser.

## 3. Required Browser Permissions

uBO Scope requires the following permissions to function correctly:

- **`webRequest`**: To monitor and capture all network requests made by webpages.
- **`activeTab`**: To access data related to the active browser tab.
- **`storage`**: To store session data and user configuration locally.
- **Host Permissions**: 
  - Access to all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and Secure WebSocket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).

### Why These Permissions Matter
The `webRequest` permission is critical because uBO Scope tracks and reports every HTTP(s) request the browser initiates to third-party servers. Host permissions enable uBO Scope to listen to and analyze requests across all domains you visit. Without these permissions, the extension cannot deliver its core visibility features.

## 4. Browser Settings & Configuration Tips

### Enable Extension Installation from Trusted Sources

- **Chrome & Edge**: Use official Web Stores for installation to avoid security issues.
- **Firefox**: Use Firefox Add-ons (AMO) or manually sideload with caution.
- **Safari**: Download via the Safari Extensions Gallery or the Mac App Store.

### Confirm Permissions on Install
After installing uBO Scope, the browser typically prompts you to grant requested permissions. Accepting these is mandatory for the extension to work properly.

### Required Features Enabled by Browser
- **Manifest V3 Support**: uBO Scope is a Manifest V3 extension; ensure your browser supports it.
- **WebRequest API Availability**: The extension monitors network activity through the `webRequest` API. In some browsers or modes (e.g., incognito/private mode), this API might be restricted.

### Network Considerations

- Firewalls or antivirus programs that intercept or modify HTTPS traffic may affect data accuracy.
- VPN or proxy settings might alter network requests visibility.

## 5. System Resource Recommendations

While uBO Scope is lightweight, monitoring network traffic and updating UI badges in real-time requires some system resources.

- **Memory**: At least 100 MB of free RAM during browsing sessions.
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor recommended for smooth background processing.

> These recommendations prevent any perceptible impact on browsing performance.

## 6. What to Check Before Proceeding with Installation

Follow this quick checklist to confirm you're ready:

- [ ] Your browser version meets or exceeds the minimum required.
- [ ] You have administrative rights to install browser extensions.
- [ ] You understand and are willing to grant the permissions the extension requests.
- [ ] No existing browser settings or policies block extension installation or `webRequest` usage.

<Tip>
If you plan to use uBO Scope alongside other blockers like uBlock Origin, verify that these extensions do not conflict. uBO Scope is designed to work transparently regardless of other blockers.
</Tip>

<Tip>
For privacy and security, only install uBO Scope from official browser extension stores or the verified GitHub repository: [https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).

## 8. Troubleshooting Primer

If you encounter issues during installation or first use:

- Confirm your browser is up-to-date with the required version.
- Verify that no browser policies or antivirus software block extension installation.
- Check that permissions have been properly granted after installation.
- Confirm that your browser is not running in a private mode that restricts the `webRequest` API.
