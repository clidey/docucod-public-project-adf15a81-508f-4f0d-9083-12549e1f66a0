# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing and running the uBO Scope extension, it's essential to ensure your environment meets the minimum supported browsers, operating systems, and required permissions. This chapter helps you verify your setup to avoid common installation issues and get started smoothly.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to work across major browsers with modern extension APIs and permissions. Below are the specific minimum supported versions:

- **Google Chrome / Chromium-based browsers**  
  - Minimum version: **122.0**  
  - Requires support for Manifest V3 and service workers.

- **Mozilla Firefox**  
  - Minimum version: **128.0** (including Firefox for Android)

- **Safari**  
  - Minimum version: **18.5**  
  - Runs as a Safari Web Extension using the `safari-web-extension` scheme.

> These version requirements ensure the extension can use the necessary APIs for request monitoring and UI features.

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

Because uBO Scope operates as a browser extension, compatibility primarily depends on the underlying browser and its platform support:

- Windows 10 and later (for Chromium and Firefox browsers)
- macOS 11.0 or later (for Safari, Chromium, and Firefox browsers)
- Linux distributions compatible with Chromium or Firefox latest releases
- iOS/iPadOS are not supported due to browser extension API limitations

> Ensure your system is running an OS version that supports your targeted browser minimum requirements.

---

## 3. Required Permissions

uBO Scope relies on browser permissions to gather and display network connection data correctly. Upon installation, it requests the following permissions:

- **`webRequest`**: To monitor all HTTP and WebSocket network requests made by webpages in real time.
- **`activeTab`**: To access data related to the currently active browser tab for accurate reporting.
- **`storage`**: To persist session data safely across browser sessions.

Additionally, the extension requests **host permissions** covering all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS domains (`*://*/*`) to track requests to all remote servers.

> Without these permissions, uBO Scope cannot report or count remote server connections reliably.

---

## 4. Browser Configuration Requirements

### Network and Policy Settings

- Ensure that your browser allows extensions to use the `webRequest` API. Some browsers or browser policies may restrict `webRequest` usage or require explicit enabling.

### Network Connectivity

- uBO Scope requires internet access to fetch the public suffix list from `publicsuffix.org`, which helps it correctly categorize domains.

- Firewall or security software should permit the browser and its extensions to access external resources freely.

> Failure to meet these networking requirements may cause incomplete or inaccurate reporting.

---

## 5. User Account and Privileges

- Installation requires user rights to add browser extensions.
- Running the extension does not require elevated privileges.

> Most users installing extensions locally have necessary rights; enterprise environments with locked-down policies should validate extension permissions.

---

## 6. Additional Notes

- uBO Scope does not require any external dependencies such as standalone applications or services.
- It assumes a Linux-like environment for development tooling (e.g., packaging scripts), but end-users interact with it purely via browser extensions.
- The extension's packaging scripts (`tools/make-package.sh`, `tools/make-firefox.sh`) are intended for developers building or customizing distributions.

## Summary Checklist

Before proceeding with installation, verify the following:

- [ ] You are using a supported browser version (Chrome ≥122, Firefox ≥128, Safari ≥18.5).
- [ ] Your operating system supports the targeted browser.
- [ ] The browser grants the extension the `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` permissions.
- [ ] Host permissions include all HTTP/S and WS/S URLs.
- [ ] Browser settings or policies allow extension network monitoring.
- [ ] Network connectivity is stable to fetch necessary resources (like the public suffix list).
