# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Understand what environments, browsers, and permissions are required to use uBO Scope effectively. This guide ensures you're prepared to install and operate uBO Scope without surprises.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is a browser extension available for major modern browsers with the following minimum supported versions:

| Browser    | Minimum Version | Notes                                             |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Chrome     | 122.0           | Requires Manifest V3 support and webRequest API  |
| Firefox    | 128.0           | Includes Firefox Desktop and Android             |
| Safari     | 18.5            | macOS Safari with support for Safari Web Extensions |

> These versions are mandated because uBO Scope relies on Manifest V3 extension APIs, including service workers and the webRequest API with blocking capabilities.

## 2. Permissions Required

uBO Scope requires explicit permissions to function correctly. During installation or first use, your browser will prompt for the following:

- **Active Tab Access:** To monitor network requests on the current tab.
- **Storage:** To persist connection data between sessions.
- **WebRequest:** To observe, record, and analyze network requests in real time.

<Check>
Ensure you grant these permissions when installing or prompted during setup to enable full functionality.
</Check>

## 3. Host Permissions

uBO Scope needs access to all HTTP(S) and WebSocket URLs to track third-party connections. Specifically, it requests permission to monitor requests on:

- `https://*/*`
- `http://*/*`
- `wss://*/*` (where supported, e.g., Firefox and Chromium)
- `ws://*/*` (where supported)

This broad host access is essential for comprehensive connection auditing.

<Note>
Safari currently does not require WebSocket URL permissions explicitly. The extension's effectiveness may vary slightly between browsers due to platform-specific API support.
</Note>

## 4. System Requirements

Since uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension, it has minimal resource requirements:

- **Operating System:** Compatible with any OS supported by the browser versions listed above (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android).
- **Memory and Storage:** Negligible â€“ uses browser extension storage APIs for data caching.

The extension is optimized not to impact browser performance noticeably.

## 5. Network & Connectivity Requirements

To provide accurate connection auditing:

- **Internet Access:** Required to track actual network requests made by webpages.
- **Browser Network APIs:** Depends on the browser exposing comprehensive network event APIs (`webRequest` API).

If the browser restricts or disables `webRequest` APIs or if network requests occur outside browser control, uBO Scope cannot report them.

## 6. Browser Settings and Considerations

Some users might have additional privacy extensions or strict browser privacy settings that interfere with network request reporting:

- Ensure content blockers or privacy settings do not completely disable or hide network requests from extensions.
- uBO Scope works in conjunction with content blockers; it can report blocked, stealth-blocked, and allowed connections regardless of which content blocker is active.

<Tip>
For the best results, use uBO Scope alongside standard privacy tools without overly restrictive browser configurations that limit extension permissions.
</Tip>

## 7. Summary

Before installing uBO Scope, confirm:

- Your browser version meets minimum requirements (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- You accept required permissions for active tab access, storage, and webRequest capabilities.
- Host permissions for HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket URLs are allowed.
- Your browser or other extensions do not block uBO Scope's network event access.

This preparation guarantees you unlock the full power of uBO Scope's network transparency right from the start.
