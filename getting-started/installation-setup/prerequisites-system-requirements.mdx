# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a lightweight browser extension that integrates seamlessly with modern browsers supporting the **WebExtension Manifest V3** standard. Currently, the following browsers and versions are officially supported:

- **Google Chrome (Chromium-based browsers)**
  - Minimum version: 122.0 or later
  - Uses a service worker background script for extension logic.
- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum version: 128.0 or later
  - Uses a module-type background script.
- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum version: 18.5 or later
  - Uses a module-type background script.

uBO Scope leverages browser-specific APIs and permissions described in their respective manifests to ensure compatibility and performance.

> <Info>Browser updates below the minimum versions may lead to partial or no functionality. Make sure your browser is up to date before installing uBO Scope.</Info>


## 2. Operating System Requirements

uBO Scope runs as a WebExtension, thus it supports any operating system where supported browsers operate. This includes:

- Windows 10 and later
- macOS 11 (Big Sur) and later
- Linux distributions compatible with Chrome or Firefox
- iOS and iPadOS (via Safari Web Extensions, minimum Safari 18.5)

There are no additional OS-level dependencies; the extension functions entirely within the browser environment.


## 3. Permissions Required

To provide its core functionality—monitoring and reporting remote server connections—uBO Scope requires several **explicit permissions** that users must consent to during installation or first use:

- **`webRequest`**: To observe network requests made by webpages in real-time.
- **Host permissions**: Access to all HTTP and HTTPS URLs (`http://*/*` and `https://*/*`), enabling monitoring of connections across all websites visited.
- **`storage`**: To save session data and configuration locally within browser storage.
- **`activeTab`**: To interact with the currently active browser tab for updating badge counts and popup data.

These permissions ensure accurate network request capture regardless of any content blockers or DNS-level filtering.

> <Warning>Granting broad host permissions is essential for uBO Scope to monitor remote connections across all visited sites. This is a core design principle to maximize transparency and privacy insight.</Warning>


## 4. User Consent and Security Considerations

Upon installation, browsers will prompt users to authorize these permissions. Users should understand that uBO Scope does **not** modify web content or block requests; it only reports connection attempts and outcomes for transparency.

All data processing occurs locally within the browser. No data is sent externally by the extension, ensuring your network activity and privacy remain confidential.


## 5. Network and Connectivity Requirements

- **Internet access** is required for the extension to fetch the latest [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) during its initialization phase to accurately identify and categorize domains.
- The extension operates offline once the suffix list is cached in browser session storage.

> <Tip>If network conditions prevent the suffix list from downloading during startup, uBO Scope will fall back to cached data if available, or display limited domain categorization until the list is refreshed.</Tip>


## 6. Summary of System Requirements

| Requirement           | Details                                               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Supported browsers    | Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+             |
| Operating systems     | Windows 10+, macOS 11+, Linux, iOS/iPadOS via Safari  |
| Required permissions  | webRequest, storage, activeTab, host permissions (*)  |
| Network requirements  | Internet access for public suffix list on first run   |

(*) Host permissions include full access to HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket URLs (platform-dependent).


## 7. Common Compatibility Considerations

- **Browser-specific behavior:** While uBO Scope is tested on the listed browsers, small differences in background script handling (service worker vs. module script) and `webRequest` API can affect performance.
- **Content blockers installed alongside:** uBO Scope monitors network requests independently and reports what the browser sees, regardless of which content blockers or filter lists are active.


## 8. Next Steps

Once your browser and system meet the prerequisites above and permissions are granted:

- Proceed to the [Installing uBO Scope](../installation-setup/installing-ubo-scope) guide to install the extension.
- After installation, review [Quick Configuration & Permissions](../installation-setup/quick-configuration) to finalize setup.
- Finally, start with [Your First Run: Seeing uBO Scope in Action](../../first-use-validation/first-run-success) to explore the extension's interface and monitoring capabilities.

**Example: Checking your browser version**

- **Chrome**: Go to `chrome://settings/help` and verify version ≥ 122
- **Firefox**: Go to `about:support`, check Application Basics > Version ≥ 128
- **Safari**: From the Apple menu, choose About Safari, ensure 18.5 or later


**If you encounter permission issues:**

- Verify you accepted all permissions during extension installation
- Check for conflicting extensions that may restrict webRequest access
