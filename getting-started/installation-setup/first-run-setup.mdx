# First Run & Basic Configuration

Welcome to the first step of using **uBO Scope**. This guide walks you through launching the extension for the first time, understanding the permissions it requires, verifying its presence in your browser, and ensuring it is enabled and ready for use. By following these straightforward steps, you'll quickly confirm your setup works perfectly, allowing you to start monitoring network connections immediately.

---

## 1. Launching uBO Scope for the First Time

After installing uBO Scope from your browser's official extension store, you'll want to confirm it's properly activated and visible.

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Icon

- Look for the uBO Scope icon on your browser's toolbar. It features a shield-like logo with a badge count indicator.

- If you do not see the icon immediately:
  - On **Chrome/Chromium browsers**, click the puzzle piece "Extensions" icon and pin uBO Scope for quick access.
  - On **Firefox**, access the overflow menu (three dots) and choose to pin the extension.
  - On **Safari**, check the toolbar or the extension menu to ensure uBO Scope is enabled (Safari 18.5+ required).

### Step 2: Click the Icon to Open the Popup Panel

- Clicking the icon opens the uBO Scope popup panel.
- The panel will load with the current tab’s domain displayed, showing connection summaries.

If the popup fails to open or shows 'NO DATA', refresh the active tab or try restarting your browser.
</Check>

## 2. Reviewing Extension Permissions

uBO Scope requires certain browser permissions to fully monitor network connections. These permissions are requested during installation but verifying them helps ensure proper operation.

### Permissions uBO Scope Uses:

- **ActiveTab**: Access to the current tab to report connections.
- **Storage**: To save session data and configuration locally.
- **webRequest**: To observe network requests and their outcomes.
- **Host Permissions**: Access to all HTTP and HTTPS URLs (and WebSocket variants on some browsers).

### How to Check Permissions:

- Visit your browser's extension management page:
  - **Chrome/Chromium:** `chrome://extensions/` or via menu > Extensions > Manage Extensions.
  - **Firefox:** `about:addons` > Extensions > uBO Scope > Permissions.
  - **Safari:** Safari > Preferences > Extensions.

- Confirm all listed permissions are granted.

<Warning>
If permissions are missing, uBO Scope will not function correctly and might not monitor all network activity.
</Warning>

## 3. Enabling uBO Scope If Hidden or Disabled

Modern browsers sometimes disable or hide extensions by default. If you don’t see the uBO Scope icon or it appears dimmed:

### Step 1: Enable the Extension

- Go to your browser's extensions page.
- Find uBO Scope and toggle it on.

### Step 2: Show the Extension Icon

- In the browser toolbar, click the "Extensions" (puzzle) icon.
- Locate uBO Scope and select the option to pin or show the icon permanently.

<Info>
On Safari, ensure your browser version is 18.5 or higher as lower versions do not support the required APIs.
</Info>

## 4. Confirming uBO Scope is Ready for First Use

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

- Click the icon to open the popup panel.
- You should see the domain name of the active tab.
- Sections with domains marked as “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked” will report network connection statuses.
- The badge count on the icon will display the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.

### Step 2: Verify Data Updates

- Navigate to different websites/tabs while keeping uBO Scope open.
- Observe the badge count and the popup updating to reflect network connections.

<Check>
If the badge count remains empty across sites known to load third-party resources, refresh tabs or restart your browser.
</Check>

## Tips for a Smooth First Run

- **Refresh your active tab** after installation to trigger uBO Scope's monitoring.
- **Pin the icon** to the toolbar for easy access and reference.
- On browsers with strict extension policies, **confirm permissions carefully** to avoid silent failures.
- If using other privacy or content blockers, uBO Scope works **independently** and shows raw network connection data, unaffected by those blockers.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

- **Extension not showing icon:** Check if the extension is enabled and pinned.
- **Permissions incomplete:** Double-check permissions on your browser's extension management page.
- **Browser incompatibility:** Use supported browsers and minimum versions listed in the system requirements.
- **Popup showing no data:** Reload tab, try a different tab, or restart the browser.

<Warning>
Browsers can update and reset extension settings; re-check permissions and icon visibility after updates.
</Warning>
