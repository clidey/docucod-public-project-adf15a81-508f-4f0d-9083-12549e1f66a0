# Prerequisites & Supported Browsers

Before you install uBO Scope, it's essential to verify that your system and browser meet the necessary requirements to ensure a smooth installation and fully functional experience. This page guides you through supported browsers, basic system prerequisites, and platform-specific considerations.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to run in modern browsers that support Manifest Version 3 extensions and provide the required APIs (`webRequest`, `storage`, etc.). The extension is compatible with the following browsers:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave)
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Apple Safari**

### Browser Version Requirements

| Browser          | Minimum Version      | Notes                                  |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Chromium         | 122.0 or later       | Minimal Chrome version with service worker support (MV3) |
| Firefox          | 128.0 or later       | Firefox version 128+ supports extension APIs used by uBO Scope |
| Safari           | 18.5 or later        | Requires Safari Web Extensions support | 


### Where to Install

You can find the extension in the official extension stores for your browser:

- **Chrome Web Store:** [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- **Firefox Add-ons:** [https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- **Safari Extensions:** Available through Safari's extensions gallery or via manual sideloading (check your Safari version compatibility).

<Tip>
Installing from official stores guarantees authenticity and automatic updates.
</Tip>

## 2. System Requirements

While uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension, certain system-level prerequisites must be met:

- **Operating Systems:** Windows, macOS, Linux (desktop) supported via compatible browsers.
- **RAM:** Minimum 512 MB of RAM; more recommended for multitasking.
- **Disk Space:** Less than 10 MB needed for extension storage.
- **Network:** Active internet connection required for normal browsing and extension operation.

<Note>
No additional software dependencies or services are required. uBO Scope operates entirely within the browser environment.
</Note>

---

## 3. Permissions & Access Needed

To provide detailed insights about your browser’s network connections, uBO Scope requests the following permissions:

- **`webRequest`**: To monitor network request events that indicate which connections are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- **`storage`**: To save session data and the public suffix list for domain parsing.
- **`activeTab`**: To interact with the currently active tab for reporting.

These permissions are standard and necessary for uBO Scope's core functionality.

<Warning>
Do not grant permissions from unknown or untrusted sources. Always verify you are installing the official uBO Scope extension.
</Warning>

## 4. Platform-Specific Features & Limitations

| Platform   | Notes on Implementation & Limitations                                      |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium  | Uses a service worker for background tasks as required by Manifest V3. Utilizes `webRequest` listeners fully.
| Firefox   | Runs background processes as an ES module script. Requires Firefox 128+ for full API compatibility.
| Safari    | Limited host permission scope (HTTP and HTTPS only). Background scripts executed as modules. Requires Safari 18.5+.

<Tip>
Browser APIs and extension behavior vary slightly across platforms due to underlying browser architecture and permissions models.
</Tip>

## 5. Verify Your System Compatibility

Before proceeding to installation, follow these steps to confirm your readiness:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Version">
- Open your browser.
- Navigate to the browser's `About` page (e.g., `chrome://settings/help` for Chrome, `about:support` for Firefox).
- Confirm your browser version meets the minimum required version.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Manifest V3 Support">
- Ensure your browser supports Manifest Version 3 extensions (MV3).
- MV3 is standard in modern Chrome, Edge, and recent Firefox.
- Safari supports MV3 in versions 18.5 and later.
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Required Permissions">
- uBO Scope will request necessary permissions upon installation.
- Confirm you accept permissions for network and storage access.
</Step>

<Step title="Network Accessibility">
- Verify your network allows normal web traffic.
- uBO Scope relies on webRequest API to monitor network events; proxies or VPNs that deeply interfere may affect visibility.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- **Keep your browser updated**: This ensures security and compatibility with uBO Scope.
- **Avoid installing multiple similar extensions**: Running other extensions that extensively modify or block network requests might conflict with uBO Scope's reporting.
- **Use official extension stores**: This prevents installing malicious or outdated versions.

<Check>
Regularly check the badge count after installing to confirm uBO Scope is actively monitoring connections.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Compatibility Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Browser Not Supported or Outdated">
- Ensure you are using one of the supported browsers listed in section 1.
- Update your browser to the latest version.
- Restart the browser after updating.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extension Fails to Install or Run">
- Verify that Manifest V3 is supported in your browser.
- On Safari, confirm minimum version is 18.5 and that extensions are enabled in Safari settings.
- Check that you have accepted all extension permissions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Limited Host Permissions Affect Data Collection">
- On Safari, uBO Scope only declares HTTP and HTTPS host permissions (not WebSocket).
- This may limit visibility into certain network connections.
- Consider using Chromium or Firefox for full host permission support.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Storage API Not Accessible">
- In rare cases, browser storage APIs may be disabled via privacy settings or corporate policies.
- Confirm your browser allows extensions to use `storage` permissions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Appendix: Supported Permissions in Browser Manifest

For transparency, here are sample key permissions defined for each platform's manifest:

```json
// Chromium manifest.json key excerpt
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*", "wss://*/*", "ws://*/*"]
}
```

```json
// Firefox manifest.json key excerpt
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*", "wss://*/*", "ws://*/*"]
}
```

```json
// Safari manifest.json key excerpt
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*"]
}
```

<Note>
Notice Safari restricts host permissions to HTTP and HTTPS, excluding WebSocket schemes.
