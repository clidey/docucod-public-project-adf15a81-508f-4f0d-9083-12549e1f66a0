# First-Time Setup & Permissions

uBO Scope activates immediately after installation but requires specific permissions to operate fully. This guide walks you through the initial setup experience, explaining the permissions the extension requests and what to expect when you open the popup for the first time.

---

## 1. Extension Permissions Overview

Upon installing uBO Scope, the extension automatically requests several key permissions essential for its core functionality:

- **Access to Network Requests:** Permissions like `webRequest` and `host_permissions` (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) allow uBO Scope to monitor all network connections initiated by webpages. This is critical for the extension to reveal all third-party remote connections.
- **Active Tab Access:** Permission to access the current active tab (`activeTab`) enables the extension to retrieve and display relevant data about the webpage you are viewing.
- **Storage:** Permission to use storage (`storage`) lets uBO Scope save user session data and configuration details between browsing sessions.

<Note>
These permissions are requested upfront during installation by the browser. You might see a permission prompt explaining the network access and tab information the extension needs to function.
</Note>

## 2. What Happens on First Run?

The first time you click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar, the extension’s popup interface launches and performs several initial actions:

1. **Reads Current Tab Information:** It queries the browser for your active tab’s domain and hostname.
2. **Fetches Network Connection Data:** Using its background service worker or script, uBO Scope fetches any recorded network connection details relevant to the active tab.
3. **Populates the Popup Interface:** The popup displays counts and lists of third-party domains separated by connection outcomes — allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

Because the extension starts tracking network activity as soon as it is installed and enabled, the displayed data will reflect network connections from your current page and any new network activity happening in real-time.

At this point, you should see the total number of domains contacted by your current tab and categorized lists in the popup.
</Check>

## 3. Reviewing Requested Permissions

To ensure transparency and control, uBO Scope clearly defines its required permissions in the extension manifest files across supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Key permissions include:

- `host_permissions` covering all HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket URLs
- `webRequest` to listen for network request events
- `activeTab` for tab access
- `storage` for persistent data

<Info>
If you wish to review or manage permissions after installation:

- In **Chrome** or **Chromium-based browsers**, go to `chrome://extensions/`, find uBO Scope, and check the "Permissions" section.
- In **Firefox**, navigate to `about:addons`, select uBO Scope, and review permissions under "More options".
- In **Safari**, use the Extensions preferences pane to inspect allowed websites and permissions.

## 4. Typical User Flow on First Popup Launch

Follow these practical steps to engage with uBO Scope’s initial setup:

<Steps>
<Step title="Click the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon">
Click the extension icon next to your browser’s address bar to open the popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Hostname Display">
At the top, you will see the hostname (and subdomain if present) of the current active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Domains Connected Summary">
The popup shows the number of unique domains contacted by the current tab under “domains connected”.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked Sections">
Below the summary, domains are grouped into:

- **Not blocked (allowed):** Domains the browser successfully connected to
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where connections were redirected or blocked but stealthily
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests were explicitly blocked or failed
</Step>
<Step title="Interact with Domain Lists">
The domain lists provide counts of requests to each domain — useful for spotting frequent third-party connections.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. What to Expect in Real Scenarios

- **If your tab has not made any network requests since installing uBO Scope, the popup may show `NO DATA` or `?` counts.** Reload the webpage to populate data.
- **Counts in the badge icon reflect distinct third-party remote servers contacted, not total requests.** A lower count suggests fewer third-party connections.
- **The extension operates alongside any content blockers you use, showing results consistent with actual network activities the browser reports.**

<Tip>
If you notice unexpectedly high connection counts, consider auditing your content blocker settings or review domains listed to understand what is being contacted.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Permission and Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common First-Run Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Extension Popup Shows No Data or Stays Loading">
- Ensure you have granted permissions fully as prompted during installation.
- Reload the current tab to trigger fresh network activity.
- Verify the extension is enabled and running in your browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Issues with Network Connection Reporting">
- Confirm your browser version meets the minimum requirement (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+).
- Some network requests made outside the browser (e.g., OS-level DNS blocking) may not appear.
- Check if other extensions may interfere with uBO Scope’s ability to monitor web requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Cannot Be Changed or Are Disabled">
- Restart your browser to refresh extension permissions.
- Reinstall uBO Scope if permission prompts did not appear or were dismissed.
- Visit your browser’s extensions page to manually enable required permissions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Security and Privacy Notes

- uBO Scope's permissions are scoped to network monitoring and active tab access only — it does not collect or send data externally.
- Data shown is local to your browser session and stored using browser storage APIs.
- You retain full control to disable or uninstall the extension at any time.
