# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Welcome to the foundational step for using uBO Scope — this document ensures you have the right environment and permissions set before installing and running the extension. By preparing your system and browser according to these prerequisites, you unlock smooth installation and reliable operation of uBO Scope, enabling you to monitor all remote server connections transparently.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with the following browsers:

| Browser      | Minimum Version          | Notes                           |
|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Chromium     | Version 122.0 or later  | Supports service workers (MV3) |
| Firefox      | Version 128.0 or later  | Supports background scripts (MV3) |
| Safari       | Version 18.5 or later   | Background scripts (MV3), limited to HTTPS and HTTP hosts |


### How to Check Your Browser Version

- **Chromium/Chrome:** Go to `chrome://settings/help`
- **Firefox:** Go to `about:support`
- **Safari:** Use Safari menu > About Safari


<Guidance> Ensure your browser is updated to meet or exceed these versions for full compatibility with uBO Scope.</Guidance>

## 2. Permissions Required by uBO Scope

uBO Scope requests specific browser permissions to function correctly by monitoring network connections using browser APIs.

### Required Permissions:

- **`webRequest`**: To listen to all network request events, including successes, errors, and redirects.
- **`activeTab`**: To access information about the current active tab where monitoring will occur.
- **`storage`**: To persist data about network request outcomes per session.
- **Host Permissions:** 
  - For Chromium and Firefox: `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, and `wss://*/*` to monitor HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and Secure WebSocket requests.
  - For Safari: `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` only (no WebSocket support).

<Note>
These permissions enable uBO Scope to track remote server connections regardless of active content blockers by hooking into the browser's network events.
</Note>

## 3. System & Environment Considerations

### Operating System

- uBO Scope runs on all platforms supported by your chosen browser, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile platforms (where supported).

### Network Connectivity

- Ensure your device has internet access during installation to download and install the extension.
- Network requests made outside the scope of the browser's `webRequest` API (e.g., native apps, some restricted browser environments) will not be captured.

### Browser Features

- The browser must support Manifest Version 3 (MV3) extensions for uBO Scope to function.
- Some browsers or configurations that restrict standard extension APIs may limit uBO Scope's capabilities or prevent it from working.

---

## 4. Security & Privacy

- uBO Scope does NOT block any requests; it only observes the network activity reported by the browser.
- The extension respects browser sandboxing and security models; it only accesses permitted data sites and sessions.
- Permissions requested align strictly with the need to inspect network requests, without broader system access.

<Tip>
Review permissions carefully during installation to understand what uBO Scope will access.
</Tip>

## 5. Summary Checklist Before Installation

### ✅ Confirm Browser Compatibility

- Your browser is Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+.

### ✅ Verify Permissions Availability

- The browser supports `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` permissions.

### ✅ Network Access

- Internet connection is active.

### ✅ Browser Settings

- Extensions are enabled and allowed to use the required APIs.

<Tip>
If you plan to use uBO Scope on Safari, note the limitation that it cannot monitor WebSocket connections due to permission restrictions.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Prerequisites

### Issue: Extension Fails to Access Network Information

- **Cause:** Browser version too low or missing required permissions.
- **Solution:** Update your browser to the latest version and ensure permissions are granted during installation.

### Issue: No Data Captured or Badge Not Updating

- **Cause:** Browser or network environment restricts `webRequest` API.
- **Solution:** Check if other extensions or privacy settings interfere with network APIs. Refer to [Extension Not Showing Data?](../troubleshooting/extension-not-showing-data) for detailed guidance.

### Issue: Installation Blocked by Browser Policy

- **Cause:** Enterprise or security policies disabling extensions or particular APIs.
- **Solution:** Contact your system administrator or review browser policy settings.
