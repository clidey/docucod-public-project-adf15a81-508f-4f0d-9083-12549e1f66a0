# System Requirements & Prerequisites for uBO Scope

Ensure your system and browser setup meets the following requirements and prerequisites before installing and using uBO Scope. This guidance guarantees the extension functions optimally and delivers accurate network connection insights.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to operate as a browser extension on the following browsers:

- **Google Chrome / Chromium-based browsers**
  - Minimum Chrome version: **122.0**
  - Install from [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum Firefox version: **128.0**
  - Install from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

uBO Scope supports all operating systems that run the above browsers and meet their minimum version requirements, including:

- **Windows** (with compatible Chrome/Firefox versions)
- **macOS** (supports Safari, Chrome, Firefox)
- **Linux** (with Chrome/Firefox installed)

<Note>
Because uBO Scope depends on browser capabilities, platform support aligns directly with browser support. Ensure your OS supports your chosen browser version.
</Note>

## 3. Browser Permissions Required

For uBO Scope to function correctly, it requires explicit browser permissions. Upon installation, grant the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: Enables the extension to access details about the active tab for accurate network monitoring.
- **storage**: Allows persistent storage of domain data and session states.
- **webRequest**: Critical permission to monitor and intercept network requests initiated by webpages.

Additionally, the extension requires access to all HTTP and WebSocket URLs to observe network activity:

- `http://*/*`
- `https://*/*`
- `ws://*/*`
- `wss://*/*`


<Warning>
Without the **webRequest** permission and host permissions over network URLs, uBO Scope cannot capture remote connections, rendering its core functionality ineffective.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Network & Connectivity Considerations

Ensure your network environment allows the browser to monitor requests through the webRequest API:

- Firewall or security software should not block browser extension network monitoring.
- Proxy or VPN setups that interfere with the browser’s network stack might cause incomplete or inaccurate data.

---

## 5. Additional Software Dependencies

No external software dependencies or tools are required because uBO Scope operates entirely within the browser environment.

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Extension Not Capturing Network Requests">
- **Cause**: Missing webRequest or host permissions.
- **Solution**: Reinstall the extension and explicitly allow the requested permissions during installation or via browser extension settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- **Cause**: Browser may have restricted background processes or session data corruption.
- **Solution**: Restart browser, ensure extension’s background service worker is active, and clear browser cache.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension Not Available for Browser Version">

## Useful Tips

- Keep your browser updated to maintain compatibility and security.
- Review and adjust privacy or security settings that might block extension permissions.
- For enterprise or managed environments, check if IT policies allow browser extensions with network monitoring rights.
