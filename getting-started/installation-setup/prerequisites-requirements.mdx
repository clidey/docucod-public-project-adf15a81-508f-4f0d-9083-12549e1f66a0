# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

To ensure a smooth installation and optimal experience with uBO Scope, it is crucial to understand the supported browsers, system requirements, and necessary permissions before proceeding. This guide outlines everything you need to prepare before installing the extension across supported platforms.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to work seamlessly as a browser extension with the following browsers:

| Browser  | Minimum Versions             | Notes                           |
|----------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Chromium | Version 122.0 or higher      | Uses service worker background  |
| Firefox  | Version 128.0 or higher      | Supports desktop and Android    |
| Safari   | Version 18.5 or higher       | Uses background scripts as module |


<u>**Browser compatibility and behavior differences:**</u>

- **Chromium** requires minimum version 122.0 due to API support and service worker model.
- **Firefox** enforces minimum version 128.0 and supports extra WebSocket permissions.
- **Safari** expects a minimum version of 18.5 and uses a module-based background script.

Ensure your browser is updated to meet or exceed these versions before installing uBO Scope.

---

## 2. System Requirements

uBO Scope has minimal hardware and software demands but requires certain capabilities:

- **Operating System**: Compatible with any OS supported by the above browsers (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS/iPadOS for Safari and Firefox Android).
- **Memory & Performance**: Typical browsing conditions suffice; uBO Scope runs efficiently in the background consuming minimal resources.
- **Disk Space**: Less than 10 MB for extension files and cached data.


---

## 3. Permissions & Access Requirements

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to function correctly and to display network routing outcomes:

- **Host Permissions**:
  - Access to all HTTP(s) and WebSocket URLs: `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` (with some variations depending on browser)

- **Extension Permissions**:
  - `activeTab`: To interact with the active browser tab for data collection.
  - `storage`: To save session data and extension state.
  - `webRequest`: To monitor network requests, track outcomes such as allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.

<u>**Important:** You must allow these permissions during the installation prompt for uBO Scope to operate fully.</u>

---

## 4. Network & Connectivity Requirements

- The browser must support the `webRequest` API to capture and report network connections.
- Network connectivity is required for fetching remote resources and the public suffix list used internally.
- Firewall or security software should not block the extension's background activities or network monitoring.

---

## 5. Preparing Your Environment

Follow these preparatory steps before installing:

1. **Update Browser**
   - Ensure your browser version meets the minimum version specified above.

2. **Verify Permissions**
   - Understand and be ready to grant the required permissions during extension installation.

3. **Check Network Access**
   - Verify that your browser or system firewall permits network monitoring APIs and extension background activities.

4. **Review System Storage**
   - Confirm you have sufficient local storage for data saved during browsing sessions.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- Attempting installation on unsupported or outdated browsers will lead to failure or non-functionality.
- Denying required permissions (`webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab`) during installation will prevent accurate data collection and display.
- Using strict firewall or privacy tools that block extension APIs or network events may disrupt functionality.
