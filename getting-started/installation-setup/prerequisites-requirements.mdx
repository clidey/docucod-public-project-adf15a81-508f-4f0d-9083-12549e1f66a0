# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure your environment meets the necessary conditions to guarantee a smooth setup and reliable operation. This page guides you through the compatible browsers, minimum browser versions, and required permissions needed to get started with uBO Scope.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers & Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is a browser extension that leverages the `webRequest` API to monitor network connections transparently. To function correctly, it requires specific permissions and API support available only in modern browsers. Supported browsers and minimum version requirements are:

| Browser   | Minimum Version | Notes                                         |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------|
| **Chromium-based** (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.) | 122.0 and above | Requires Manifest V3 support and service workers. |
| **Firefox**                | 128.0 and above     | Must support the necessary `webRequest` APIs and session storage. |
| **Safari**                 | 18.5 and above      | Supports required web extension APIs; requires strict minimum version 18.5. |


<Note>
Ensure you update your browser to the specified minimum version or later before installing uBO Scope to avoid compatibility issues.
</Note>

## 2. Required Permissions

To provide comprehensive monitoring of browser network requests, uBO Scope requires these permissions granted by the browser during installation:

- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to access details about the currently active tab.
- **storage**: Enables storing session and extension-related data locally for performance and persistence.
- **webRequest**: Grants access to network request details necessary for tracking remote connections.

<Warning>
If you deny any of these permissions during installation, uBO Scope will not function properly.
</Warning>

## 3. Host Permissions

uBO Scope monitors network requests to URLs matching these patterns:

- `https://*/*`
- `http://*/*`
- `wss://*/*` and `ws://*/*` (WebSocket traffic, only on Chromium and Firefox)

This broad host permission is essential for capturing all remote server connections initiated by the browser.


## 4. System & Network Considerations

- **Internet Connectivity**: Active internet connection is required for uBO Scope to capture network requests actively made by pages you visit.

- **Firewall & Proxy Settings**: Ensure your firewall or proxy settings do not block the browser's `webRequest` API from reporting network requests. Some enterprise environments may restrict this capability.

- **Content Blockers Coexistence**: uBO Scope operates independently from content blockers and monitors requests irrespective of other blockers in place. However, it relies on the browser’s ability to report requests through the `webRequest` API.


## 5. Installation Environment

- **Browser Profile Permissions**: Installation and use require permissions to add extensions to your browser profile.

- **Stable Browser Channel**: Use the stable release channel of your browser to ensure maximum API stability and support.


## 6. Verifying Your Environment

Before proceeding to installation, perform these checks:

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm Browser Version">
- Open your browser's About page.
- Verify the version is equal to or higher than the minimum supported version listed above.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Permissions">
- For Chromium and Firefox, verify the browser allows extension installations with requested permissions.
- For Safari, ensure you have upgraded to version 18.5 or later.
</Step>
<Step title="Network Accessibility">
- Confirm your network settings allow the browser to access external servers and report requests.
- Disable restrictive proxies temporarily if necessary.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
If you meet all the above criteria, your environment is ready to install and use uBO Scope effectively.
