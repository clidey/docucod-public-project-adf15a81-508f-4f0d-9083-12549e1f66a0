# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This page provides a clear overview of the supported browsers, platform compatibility, and essential requirements to install and run **uBO Scope** smoothly. Ensuring your environment meets these criteria guarantees accurate network monitoring and uninterrupted extension functionality.

## Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

| Browser        | Minimum Version  | Notes                                |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| Google Chrome  | 122.0            | Desktop versions only               |
| Chromium-based | 122.0            | Including Edge, Brave, and others  |
| Mozilla Firefox| 128.0            | Desktop and Android versions        |
| Safari         | 18.5             | macOS and iOS/macOS Safari         |

<u>uBO Scope requires modern browser versions to leverage the latest `webRequest` API capabilities, essential for accurate monitoring of network connections.</u>

---

## Platform Support

- **Desktop**
  - Windows, macOS, Linux supported through Chromium and Firefox browsers
  - macOS Safari support with version 18.5 and later

- **Mobile**
  - Firefox Android supported starting from version 128.0
  - Safari Mobile support aligned with iOS version compatible with Safari 18.5 minimum

<u>Note:</u> Chrome on Android is not officially supported due to browser API limitations.

---

## System Requirements

While uBO Scope is lightweight, the following system conditions help ensure smooth operation:

- **Memory:** 256 MB RAM minimum (typical browser system requirement suffices)
- **Storage:** Minimal disk space for extension (~a few MBs for caching and session data)
- **Network:** Active internet connection to fetch the Public Suffix List (PSL) on first use

<u>Since uBO Scope is an extension, it will rely on the host browser’s resources and permissions.</u>

---

## Permissions & Access Requirements

The extension requires explicit permissions to function properly:

- `webRequest`: To observe all network requests initiated by the browser
- `activeTab`: To access details of the currently active tab for monitoring
- `storage`: To save session data and the Public Suffix List for domain classification

<u>These permissions are requested at installation and must be granted for full functionality.</u>

---

## Background Knowledge

Understanding a few concepts helps you appreciate uBO Scope's capabilities:

- **Network Monitoring:** uBO Scope listens to all browser network requests including HTTP(S) and WebSocket communications.
- **Third-Party Domains:** The tool reports and categorizes connections to third-party domains, helping you assess privacy risks.
- **Public Suffix List (PSL):** uBO Scope uses the PSL to identify registered domains and differentiate them from subdomains.

- [Core Concepts and Terminology](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/overview/architecture-concepts/core-terminology.mdx)

---

## Summary

Before installing uBO Scope:

- Confirm your browser is supported and up-to-date.
- Ensure the extension permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`) are permitted.
- Have a stable internet connection for initial setup.

Following these guidelines guarantees uBO Scope will provide accurate, real-time monitoring of your browser’s remote server connections.

## Practical Tips

- Keep your browser updated to support the latest WebExtension APIs.
- If you experience loading delays on first use, ensure your internet connection allows fetching of the Public Suffix List.
- Review browser-specific installation instructions as some steps or UI elements may vary.

<Tip>
The Public Suffix List is automatically cached after the first download to optimize performance.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Without the necessary permissions, uBO Scope cannot monitor network requests, severely limiting its usefulness.
</Warning>
