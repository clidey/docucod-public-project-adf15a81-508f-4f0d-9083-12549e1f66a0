# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Ensure you meet the following requirements before installing and using uBO Scope. This preparation guarantees a smooth setup and operation across supported browsers.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is a modern browser extension designed to work on the latest versions of popular browsers that support Manifest V3 extensions and the `webRequest` API.

| Browser   | Minimum Version | Notes                              |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| Chrome    | 122.0+          | Supports all uBO Scope features    |
| Firefox   | 128.0+          | Includes Firefox for Android       |
| Safari    | 18.5+           | Requires Safari strict minimum ver |


### Why these versions?
- The extension requires Manifest V3 support to function properly.
- `webRequest` permission availability is essential to monitor network connections.


## 2. System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Any OS supported by the browsers listed above (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android)
- **Disk Space:** Minimal, as uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension (typically under 5 MB).
- **RAM:** No explicit minimum, but running the latest browser versions presumes at least 1 GB RAM.


## 3. Required Extension Permissions

During installation, the extension requests these permissions to perform its core functions:

- **`activeTab`** — Access to the currently active browser tab to monitor network requests.
- **`storage`** — Stores session data and user settings.
- **`webRequest`** — Essential to observe and report all network traffic initiated by webpages.
- **Host Permissions:**
  - Access to all HTTP/HTTPS URLs (`http://*/*` and `https://*/*`).
  - Access to WebSocket URLs (`ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*`) on Chromium and Firefox (limited on Safari).


> <Warning>
> uBO Scope requires broad host permissions to monitor network requests across all sites you visit. This is necessary for full visibility of remote server connections.
> </Warning>


## 4. Network & Connectivity Considerations

- Your browser and network configuration must allow extensions to access all requested URLs.
- Firewalls or network proxies should not block extension requests to fetch resources or update its internal Public Suffix List.


## 5. Extension Limitations to Understand

- uBO Scope tracks network connections visible through the browser's `webRequest` API only.
- Network requests circumventing this API (e.g., certain sandboxed or external app calls) will not be reported.
- Badge counts represent distinct third-party domains connected by the active tab. Some legitimate third parties (e.g., CDNs) show in counts and are not inherently suspicious.

# Best Practices & Tips

- Keep your browser updated regularly to ensure compatibility and security.
- Review extension permissions carefully at installation; uBO Scope only requests needed permissions to function correctly.
- Understand that “lower badge counts” signify fewer distinct remote third-party connections, which is generally more desirable from a privacy standpoint.

# Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Browser version too low to support Manifest V3">
Make sure your browser version is up to date. If updating is not an option, uBO Scope will not function correctly. Upgrade to the minimum supported version.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions prompt not appearing during installation">
Ensure you are installing uBO Scope from an official source relevant to your browser. If updates or installation is blocked, check your browser’s extension management policies or enterprise restrictions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network restrictions affecting extension operation">
Verify that firewall or proxy settings do not block extension-host communication or resource fetching. Temporarily disabling such rules can help isolate the issue.
