# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Before installing and using uBO Scope, it's essential to ensure your system and browser environment are fully compatible and correctly configured for optimal operation. This guide walks you through the necessary system settings, supported browsers and versions, permissions, and extension environment prerequisites.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers & Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension and works across the major browser families that support modern WebExtension APIs, specifically the `webRequest` API used to track network requests. Compatibility varies slightly depending on the browser’s platform and version.

- **Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Edge, Brave):**
  - Minimum version: **Chrome 122.0+**
  - Manifest v3 support with service worker background running `js/background.js`

- **Mozilla Firefox:**
  - Minimum version: **Firefox 128.0+** (desktop and Android)
  - Supports `js/background.js` as a module service worker

- **Apple Safari:**
  - Minimum version: **Safari 18.5+**
  - Background script runs as a module script

<Note>
Always use the latest stable browser release to guarantee full compatibility with extension APIs and uBO Scope’s features.
</Note>

## 2. System Requirements

uBO Scope is lightweight but requires the following:

- **Operating System:**
  - Compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux distributions, and platforms supporting above browser versions.
- **Memory & CPU:**
  - No dedicated hardware resources required beyond what your browser demands.
  - Minimal impact expected as uBO Scope operates primarily as a background network listener.
- **Disk Space:**
  - Less than 5MB for installation files and temporary data storage.

<Info>
No special hardware or GPU acceleration is necessary to run uBO Scope.
</Info>

## 3. Necessary Permissions

To function properly, uBO Scope requires permissions granted during installation. These align with the browsers’ extension permission model.

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `activeTab` | Access to the current active tab to monitor network connections contextually. |
| `storage` | To persist session data such as tab connection details and cached suffix lists. |
| `webRequest` | Core permission to monitor all HTTP and WebSocket network requests made by web pages. |

<Warning>
Granting these permissions is essential; denial will limit or disable uBO Scope's core monitoring capabilities.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Extension Environment Requirements

- **WebExtension API Support:** uBO Scope leverages the standardized WebExtension API surface available in supported browsers.
- **Manifest Version 3 Support:**
  - Important as uBO Scope declares manifest v3 with service worker or background module scripts.
- **Host Permissions:**
  - Requires network access permissions for URLs matching `http://*/*` and `https://*/*`.
  - For Firefox and Chromium, additionally requires WebSocket schemes (`ws://` and `wss://`).
- **Browser Storage:**
  - Needs both `local` and `session` storage capabilities.

---

## 5. Network & Connectivity Requirements

- The extension depends on normal browser network access to track web requests.
- No special firewall or proxy configuration is generally required.

<Tip>
If you use restrictive firewall rules or privacy proxies that restrict web extension behavior, verify that these do not block the extension’s access to web requests or storage.
</Tip>

---

## 6. Summary Checklist

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure all the following are met:

- You have **one of the supported browsers** listed, with the minimum required version.
- Browser permissions for **active tab, storage, and webRequest** are enabled for the extension.
- Your system meets **basic OS and resource requirements** (typical for running browsers).
- You have **network access** compatible with browser extension network monitoring.

<Check>
Meeting these prerequisites ensures a smooth installation and accurate network monitoring with uBO Scope.
</Check>

## 7. Troubleshooting & Additional Notes

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with Environment Compatibility">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
If you experience installation errors or the extension fails to launch:
- Verify your browser version meets the minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Upgrade your browser to the latest stable release.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Permissions">
If uBO Scope reports limited or no data:
- Check extension permissions in browser settings.
- Ensure 'activeTab', 'storage', and 'webRequest' permissions are granted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Restrictive Network Policies">
If network request data is not appearing:
- Confirm no firewall or security tools block browser extension network listeners.
- Test disabling VPNs or proxies that may interfere.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Next Steps

With your environment verified and ready, the next logical task is to install uBO Scope via your browser’s extension store or side-load the extension.

See the [Extension Installation](getting-started/installation-setup/installation-instructions) page for detailed steps.
