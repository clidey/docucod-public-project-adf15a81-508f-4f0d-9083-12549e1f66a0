# Prerequisites & System Requirements

To ensure uBO Scope functions flawlessly from the moment you install it, this guide walks you through the essential prerequisites and system requirements. Meeting these foundational needs will guarantee smooth first runs and accurate network connection reporting.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with several major browsers. Confirm your environment supports the extension by verifying the following:

- **Chromium-based Browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge)**
  - Minimum Chrome version: **122.0**
  - Distribution: Available on the Chrome Web Store

- **Firefox**
  - Minimum Firefox version: **128.0**
  - Distribution: Available from Firefox Add-ons site

- **Safari**
  - Minimum Safari version: **18.5**


> These version requirements ensure access to Manifest V3 APIs and modern browser capabilities uBO Scope depends on.

## 2. Operating System Compatibility

uBO Scope is compatible with any operating system supported by the above browsers, including:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Android (Firefox for Android supports uBO Scope)

There are no special OS-level dependencies or drivers needed.

## 3. Browser Permissions & Access

To operate effectively, uBO Scope requires certain permissions granted during install:

- **Active Tab Access** (`activeTab`): To know what page you are on and read its network connections.

- **Storage Access** (`storage`): To save session data such as observed network requests and user settings.

- **Web Request Access** (`webRequest`): To listen to all network requests initiated by the browser.

- **Host Permissions**: 
  - For Chromium and Firefox, uBO Scope needs access to all HTTP, HTTPS, and websocket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
  - Safari requires permissions for HTTP and HTTPS only.

<Check>
Make sure when you install uBO Scope, these permissions are requested and accepted. Without them, the extension cannot monitor network connections properly.
</Check>

## 4. Network and Connectivity Requirements

- **Unrestricted Access to WebRequest API:**
  - Browsers must support and allow extensions to listen to network requests via the `webRequest` API.
  - uBO Scope relies on this API to detect connection attempts and outcomes.

- **Internet Connectivity:**
  - While the extension operates locally, initial installation and updates to external dependencies (such as the Public Suffix List) require active internet access.

- **Firewall and Proxy Considerations:**
  - Ensure your firewall or network proxy does not block the extension's messaging or network monitoring capabilities within the browser.

## 5. Hardware and Performance Considerations

- uBO Scope is lightweight and optimized to run efficiently without taxing system resources.
- No specific hardware requirements beyond what is needed to run the supported browsers smoothly.

## 6. Prerequisite Software and Tools

- **Browser Installation:** You must have one of the supported browsers installed and updated according to the minimum version stated above.
- **No Additional Software:** uBO Scope does not require any external software or dependencies.

## Tips for a Smooth First Run

- Always install uBO Scope from official store links to ensure authenticity and safety.
- Review permission prompts carefully and confirm all appear as listed to avoid tracking gaps.
- Restart your browser after installation to properly load the extension.
- Confirm your browser’s `webRequest` API or equivalents are not restricted by other extensions or policies.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Installing on unsupported browser versions will cause failure to activate or missing functionality.
- Declining permission requests for storage or webRequest will prevent usage.
- Using strict browser privacy modes or policies that restrict extension APIs can limit effectiveness.

<Warning>
If you encounter unexpected behavior, first check that your browser version and permissions match these requirements.
</Warning>

## Summary

Meeting these system requirements and granting necessary permissions sets the foundation for uBO Scope’s operational success. Once these are confirmed, proceed to installation and initial configuration for your first network connection analysis.

## Additional Information

uBO Scope accesses network requests using the browser's WebRequest API, supported only by the major browsers listed above. It uses storage APIs to save session data intelligently and visualizes network outcomes on a per-tab basis, helping you understand real-time remote server connections from your browser.
