# First Launch & Basic Setup

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through launching the extension for the first time, understanding the permissions it requires, and confirming it has installed and is functioning correctly. By following these steps, you'll be able to see the extension's real-time reports of remote server connections initiated by your browser tabs.

---

## 1. Locate and Launch the uBO Scope Extension

### Step 1: Find the Extension Icon

Once installed, look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. The icon appears as a distinct badge with a simplified network icon. 

- **Chrome, Firefox, Safari**: Usually, the icon is positioned next to the address bar or in the extensions menu (puzzle-piece icon in Chromium-based browsers).

### Step 2: Open the Extension Popup

Clicking the icon opens the uBO Scope popup panel. This interface presents connection counts and details for your active tab.

> <Check> If the popup does not appear or shows 'NO DATA', ensure the extension is enabled in your browser's extensions management page.

## 2. Understand Required Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to observe and report network connections effectively. Understanding these permissions helps you trust and configure the extension rightly.

- **Active Tab**: Grants access to analyze and report on the current tab's network activity.
- **WebRequest API**: Allows uBO Scope to monitor all HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket requests and their outcomes.
- **Storage**: Enables saving session data like observed connections across tabs.

> <Info> These permissions are standard for monitoring network requests and do not permit data modification or collection beyond your local browser.

## 3. Confirm Successful Installation and Activation

### Step 1: Verify the Toolbar Badge

The extension's badge on the toolbar icon displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected to by the active tab.

- A **number** indicates how many distinct domains uBO Scope has detected.
- An **empty badge** means no third-party connections have been observed yet.

### Step 2: Open the Popup and Review Domains

Click the icon to open the popup, which categorizes connected domains into:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Servers connections were successful.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections that were redirected or stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked**: Connections explicitly blocked.

Each category lists domains with connection counts allowing you to understand your tab's network footprint.

### Step 3: Validate Real-Time Updates

Navigate between different tabs or reload your current tab. Observe that the badge count and popup data update correspondingly, reflecting the network activity.

> <Tip> If the count remains stuck or the popup doesn't update, try disabling and re-enabling the extension or restarting your browser.

## 4. Enable Essential Permissions if Prompted

Some browsers may prompt you to allow uBO Scope access to monitor network requests fully.

### Steps to Grant Permissions

1. When prompted, click **Allow** or **Enable** to grant the necessary permissions.
2. Check browser extension settings to ensure `webRequest` and host access permissions are enabled.
3. For some browsers (e.g., Firefox), you may need to explicitly allow the extension to access websites on all domains.

> <Warning> Without these permissions, uBO Scope cannot monitor or display connection details accurately.

---

## 5. Initial Use Scenario

1. Open a new browser tab and visit your favorite website.
2. Look at the uBO Scope badge count increase as connections to third-party servers are observed.
3. Click the extension icon to open the popup, and explore the domains listed under each category.
4. Confirm that the domains correspond to resources loaded on the visited page.

This immediate feedback allows you to gain transparency of third-party network activity.
