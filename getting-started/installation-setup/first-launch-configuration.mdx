# First Launch & Configuration

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through opening the extension for the first time, verifying the initial setup, and confirming that it is correctly monitoring network connections right from the start.

## 1. Accessing the Extension Popup

uBO Scope integrates seamlessly with your browser’s toolbar for quick access to your current tab’s network connection details.

### Steps to Open the Popup

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It appears as a small icon with the uBO Scope logo (similar to a shield or logo image, consistent with the extension’s icon set).
2. Click the icon once to open the extension’s popup window.

> <Check> If you don’t see the icon immediately:
> - Make sure the extension is installed and enabled.
> - In Chrome, look within the extensions menu (puzzle-piece icon) and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.
> - In Firefox, confirm it appears in the toolbar; customize if needed.

## 2. What to Expect on First Run

When you open uBO Scope for the first time in the browser toolbar popup, you should see the following:

- **Hostname Display:** At the top, the popup shows the current active tab’s hostname (the website domain you are visiting).
- **Domain Connection Summary:** A count of distinct third-party domains connected to from the current tab.
- **Connection Outcomes Sections:** Three categorized sections showing domains under these statuses:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains successfully connected.
  - **Stealth Blocked:** Domains where stealth blocking was detected.
  - **Blocked:** Domains that were outright blocked.

> <Info> Initially, when you open uBO Scope on a fresh tab or a page with no network activity, the display may show "NO DATA" or a question mark for counts. This means no connections have yet been recorded.

## 3. Confirming Proper Monitoring

To verify the extension is correctly monitoring network connections from the start, follow this simple validation:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Extension Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Visit a Website">
Load a well-known website with third-party resources, for example, https://example.com or https://news.ycombinator.com.
</Step>
<Step title="Refresh the Page">
Refresh the active tab to trigger network requests that uBO Scope can monitor.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Domain Counts in Popup">
Reopen or refresh the popup window. You should now see:
- The hostname of the active site displayed correctly.
- A numeric count for 'domains connected' that reflects the distinct third-party domains.
- Lists populated under "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and/or "blocked" categories.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Success Criteria

- The hostname at the top matches the current webpage domain.
- The domain count number is a positive integer reflecting third-party connections.
- At least one domain appears in one of the outcome categories.
- The badge on the toolbar icon (if visible) shows a number representing allowed third-party domains.

> <Tip> If the count remains zero after browsing a typical site, try clearing your session or restarting the browser to ensure fresh data collection.

## 4. Practical Tips for First Launch

- **Use Popular Sites:** Sites like news outlets or portals tend to load various third-party resources, making connection activity clearer.
- **Avoid Private/Incognito Mode:** Some browsers limit extension capabilities in private mode; use a regular tab for first launch verification.
- **Refresh Popup:** The popup updates data asynchronously—close and reopen it if data does not appear immediately.
- **Check Browser Compatibility:** Supported browsers include Chrome (122+), Firefox (128+), and Safari (18.5+).

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Initial Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Initial Setup Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="The Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Blank">
- Confirm the extension is enabled and active.
- Refresh the active tab to generate network requests.
- Make sure you are not in private mode if your browser limits extension activity there.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Hostname Does Not Display or Is Incorrect">
- Ensure the active tab has fully loaded.
- Verify there is no browser content policy blocking the extension.
- If persistent, try restarting the browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Is Not Updating">
- Badge count updates asynchronously; wait a few seconds after page load.
- Refresh the page and popup.
- If it remains stuck, disable and re-enable the extension.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. What Happens Behind the Scenes?

Every network request your browser makes to remote servers is intercepted and classified by uBO Scope into allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked outcomes. This data is stored per tab and displayed in a user-friendly manner in the popup interface. The extension leverages the browser’s `webRequest` API and Public Suffix List to organize domains accurately.

## 7. Next Steps After First Launch

- Explore the popup interface deeper to review domain lists and connection outcomes.
- Learn how to interpret the toolbar badge count for privacy insights.
- Consult the [Popup Overview](overview/quickstart-feature-tour/popup-overview) for detailed usage of the extension UI.
- Review [Installation Instructions](getting-started/installation-setup/installation-instructions) if you encounter installation issues.
- Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](getting-started/usage-validation/common-issues-troubleshooting) for more problem-solving advice.
