# Troubleshooting Installation & Setup

This guide addresses the most common issues users encounter during installation and initial setup of uBO Scope. If you do not see the extension icon, the badge count does not update, or you receive browser compatibility warnings or permission errors, follow the steps below to resolve these problems.

---

## 1. Extension Icon Not Appearing

If after installing uBO Scope you do not see its icon in your browser's toolbar, perform these checks:

- **Verify Installation Completion:**  Confirm that the installation finished successfully through your browser's extensions or add-ons page.
- **Check Browser Version Compatibility:**
  - **Chrome/Chromium:** Minimum version 122.0
  - **Firefox:** Minimum version 128.0
  - **Safari:** Minimum version 18.5

  Older browser versions will not load uBO Scope. Upgrade to a supported version accordingly.
- **Ensure Extension Icon is Enabled:** Some browsers hide extension icons by default. In Chrome, click the puzzle-piece icon and pin uBO Scope.
- **Restart Your Browser:** Restarting can resolve extension loading glitches.

<Tip>
If the extension still doesn't appear, try reinstalling from the official store:

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

Avoid installing from unofficial sources to prevent conflicts or corrupted installs.
</Tip>

## 2. Toolbar Badge Count Not Updating

The toolbar badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains contacted by the current webpage. If the badge remains empty or does not update:

1. **Confirm Permissions Are Granted:**
   - uBO Scope requires permissions for `activeTab`, `webRequest`, and `storage`. Without these, it cannot monitor network requests.
   - Check your browser’s extension permissions page and ensure all required permissions are enabled.

2. **Check Site URLs Against Permissions:**
   - uBO Scope monitors URLs matching patterns like `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and WebSocket schemes.
   - Unusual or local URLs outside these patterns won’t update the badge.

3. **Allow Time for Data Collection:**
   - Network requests are processed in batches with a short delay (~1 second). Wait a moment after loading a page for updates.

4. **Reload the Webpage:**
   - Reloading ensures fresh activity is captured.

5. **Verify No Conflicting Extensions:**
   - Some security or privacy extensions may block uBO Scope from receiving webRequest data. Temporarily disable other extensions to test.

6. **Browser-Specific Issues:**
   - Safari and Firefox may have stricter extension lifecycle or message handling behaviors that can cause delays.

<Tip>
Use the extension popup's UI to verify if any data is displayed. No data usually indicates problems with network request monitoring permissions or extension activity.

## 3. Browser Compatibility Messages

When installing uBO Scope, you may encounter warnings or errors about browser version incompatibility.

- These messages indicate your current browser version is below the minimum supported release.
- To safely use uBO Scope, upgrade to the latest stable version.

If you believe your browser supports required APIs but the message persists, ensure you have the correct extension version for your browser platform.

---

## 4. Missing or Insufficient Permissions

uBO Scope requires explicit permissions to monitor network requests and manage storage.

- **Check Permissions:** Access your browser's extension management page and ensure these permissions are granted:
  - **Active Tab Access:** Needed to track the active tab's requests.
  - **Web Request Access:** Required to intercept and analyze network requests.
  - **Storage Access:** For session data persistence.

- **Grant Permissions Manually (If Available):** Some browsers prompt you to approve permissions post-installation.

- **Reinstall the Extension:** Corrupted installs can cause permission errors.

- **Clear Browser Cache or Profile Data:** Sometimes stale cache or corrupted profile data interferes with permissions.

---

## 5. Additional Troubleshooting Steps

- **Restart Browser and System:** System or browser glitches can block extension processes.
- **Review Browser Console for Errors:** Open the browser’s developer console and look for errors related to uBO Scope.
- **Check Network Request API Support:** If the browser disables or limits its `webRequest` API, uBO Scope will not function correctly.
- **Update to Latest Extension Version:** Use the most recent release to avoid fixed bugs.
