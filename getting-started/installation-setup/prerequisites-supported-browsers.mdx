# Prerequisites & Supported Browsers

Ensure your environment is prepared before installing uBO Scope for a seamless experience. This guide helps you verify system and browser readiness, focusing on supported platforms and essential requirements.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a cross-browser extension compatible with the latest versions of major browsers:

- **Chromium-based Browsers** (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.)
  - Minimum version: **122.0** or higher
  - Available from Chrome Web Store
- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum version: **128.0** (including Firefox for Android)
  - Available from Firefox Add-ons
- **Safari**
  - Minimum macOS Safari version: **18.5** or higher
  - Available from Safari Extensions


<Check>
Using an unsupported browser or outdated browser version can result in the extension failing to install or operate correctly.
</Check>

## 2. System Requirements

uBO Scope has minimal system demands but requires running supported browsers on compatible operating systems:

| Platform             | Notes                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Windows 10 or later  | Chromium or Firefox latest versions      |
| macOS 12+            | Safari 18.5+ or supported Chromium/Firefox |
| Linux                | Supported Chromium or Firefox versions   |
| Android              | Firefox 128.0+ on Android devices        |


No additional memory or disk space beyond what your browser requires is necessary.

## 3. Permissions & APIs Required

uBO Scope depends on specific browser features and permissions to function:

- **`webRequest` API**: To observe and report network requests and their outcomes.
- **`storage` Permission**: To save session data and settings.
- **`activeTab` Permission**: To interact with the active tab and gather browsing context.


<Info>
Browsers must support these extension APIs properly. This is standard for modern browsers but can be limited in some environments (e.g., very restrictive enterprise setups).
</Info>

---

## 4. Network and Environment Preparation

uBO Scope monitors HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket connections initiated by the browser:

- Ensure your network firewall or proxy does not block or alter browser network APIs.
- For best accuracy, avoid using browser features or VPNs that might obscure network activity from the extension.

<Warning>
Network requests that do not flow through the browser's `webRequest` API (e.g., some VPN tunnels, proxy modifications) will not be reported by uBO Scope.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Browser Extensions Compatibility

- uBO Scope is **independent** of content blockers like uBlock Origin or AdGuard but works alongside them.
- Compatible and tested with popular content blockers.

<Info>
Using content blockers can affect what network requests uBO Scope observes, but the extension reports all network activity the browser exposes through its APIs.
</Info>

---

## 6. Verification

Before installing uBO Scope, verify:

1. Your browser version meets the minimum requirements:

   - Chromium-based: Open `chrome://settings/help` to check the version
   - Firefox: Open `about:support` and look for the version
   - Safari: Use 'Safari > About Safari' from the menu

2. You have rights or permissions to install extensions

3. Your environment permits extensions access to network information via `webRequest`

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What happens if network requests are not showing up?">
Verify that the browser allows the extension to use the `webRequest` API and that you do not have network configurations hiding or filtering traffic at a level bypassing browser APIs.
