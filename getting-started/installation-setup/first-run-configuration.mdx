# First Run & Basic Configuration

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through your extension's first launch experience, helping you quickly access and understand the popup interface, interpret badge counters, and read your first domain connection results. You'll also learn how uBO Scope tracks third-party servers by browser tab and how to tweak simple preferences if you wish.

---

## 1. Accessing uBO Scope's Popup Panel

Upon successful installation of uBO Scope, a new toolbar icon appears in your browser’s extension area with the uBO Scope logo.

### Steps to Open the Popup:
1. Navigate to any webpage you'd like to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
3. The popup panel opens, displaying network connection summaries linked to the active tab.

<Tip>
If you don't see the icon immediately: Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser's extensions page, or check if it is hidden in an overflow menu.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge Counter

The toolbar badge shows a numeric count representing the number of distinct third-party domains that the current webpage successfully connected to and were **not blocked**. This is your direct insight into external connections.

- **What the badge number means:**
  - Counts unique remote domains contacted successfully.
  - Lower badge numbers mean fewer third-party contacts — generally an indicator of better privacy or less tracking.

- **What it doesn’t mean:**
  - The badge does *not* indicate total requests.
  - It does *not* reflect blocked or stealth-blocked domains.

<Tip>
Remember, a lower number on the badge is preferred. Some domains serve necessary content, such as CDNs or essential services, so not all third-party domains are inherently problematic.
</Tip>

## 3. Interpreting Your First Domain Connection Results

After opening the popup:

### Key UI Elements Explained

- **Tab Hostname Display:** At the popup’s top, you see the hostname and domain of the tab you're inspecting.

- **Domains Connected Summary:** Shows how many distinct domains the page connected to.

- **Connection Outcome Sections:** These three sections classify third-party domains by their network request outcome:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains contacted successfully without blockage.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or silently blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed due to explicit blocking by content blockers or errors.

- **Domain Rows:** Each domain entry shows the domain name and the count of connections from that domain within the tab.

### Understanding Domains and Counts

- The connection counts beside each domain represent how many times network requests to that domain occurred during the session on the active tab.
- Domains may list in multiple sections if different connection outcomes occurred for them.

<Tip>
Domain names can include international characters; uBO Scope automatically converts encoded domain names (Punycode) back to their Unicode form for easier reading.
</Tip>

## 4. How uBO Scope Tracks Remote Servers Per Tab

uBO Scope uniquely tracks network connections **per browser tab** to help you isolate third-party activities on each website you visit.

- When you open a new tab and load a web page, uBO Scope resets the count for that tab’s hostname and starts fresh.
- The extension listens to all network events (`success`, `redirect`, `error`) related to requests from that tab’s content.
- It categorizes and updates the popup UI and toolbar badge dynamically as data is collected.

<Tip>
Closing a tab automatically clears its connection data, keeping your session data organized.
</Tip>

## 5. Adjusting Basic Preferences

While uBO Scope operates mainly without user configuration, you can adjust some simple settings via your browser’s extension options page if available (depending on your browser).

### Recommendations:
- **Popup Appearance:** Resize or move your browser window if the popup content doesn’t fit well. The UI automatically adapts to viewport size.
- **Badge Display:** If you prefer not to see the badge number, you can disable the badge display via your browser’s extension icon controls (if supported).

<Tip>
Because uBO Scope requires minimal configuration, settings are intentionally limited to avoid complexity.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting First Run Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Results">
- Ensure you have opened the popup **while on an active webpage tab** where uBO Scope has recorded network requests.
- Refresh the webpage to trigger a new set of network requests.
- Verify the extension has the needed permissions (see installation guide).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Toolbar Badge Does Not Update">
- Sometimes the badge may not update instantly—try clicking the icon to open the popup, which forces a refresh.
- Restart your browser to reload the extension.
- Check extension permissions and ensure no conflicts with other extensions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Data Seems Inconsistent or Delayed">
- Network requests are batched and processed roughly every second.
- Brief delays in displaying the most recent connections are normal.
- Reopen the popup or refresh the page to view the latest data.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Summary

You now understand how to launch uBO Scope’s popup, read and interpret the badge counter, and analyze the first domain connection results. The extension tracks third-party network connections per tab, giving you detailed insight into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
