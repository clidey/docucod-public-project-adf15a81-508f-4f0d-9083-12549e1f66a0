## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before you begin, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Network Access:** Internet access to download the extension from the Chrome Web Store.

> <Check>Confirm your browser version by navigating to `chrome://settings/help` or your browser's equivalent to ensure compatibility.

</Tip>

## 3. Post-Installation Verification

After installation, verify the extension functions properly:

1. **Open any website** in a new browser tab.
2. **Click the uBO Scope icon** in the toolbar.
3. A popup should appear, displaying information about remote server connections made by the webpage.

You should see sections labeled **"not blocked,"** **"stealth-blocked,"** and **"blocked"** domains along with a summary count of connected domains.

<Check>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or remains blank, refresh the page or open a different site, as data collection starts with active browsing.
</Check>

## 4. Tips and Best Practices

- **Keep your browser updated:** Ensure your Chromium-based browser is always up to date to receive the latest security and compatibility improvements.

- **Check permissions:** If the extension does not show connection data, verify that it has the required permissions under `chrome://extensions` → Details → Permissions.

- **Reload pages:** Some network request data only populates after initial page loads or navigation events.

- **Use alongside content blockers:** uBO Scope works alongside other content blockers without interference, offering transparent insight into allowed and blocked connections.
