# First Launch & Initial Configuration

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide helps you get started with the extension right after installation. We walk you through opening the extension for the first time, understanding the necessary permissions, and familiarizing yourself with the default user interface and its core indicators.

---

## 1. Opening uBO Scope for the First Time

Once installed, you will see the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. Follow these steps to open and activate the extension:

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon">
Find the shield-shaped uBO Scope icon in your browser's extension toolbar area, usually near the address bar.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Icon to Open the Popup">
Click the icon to open the popup window, which provides real-time status and details about your current tab's network connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Grant Permissions (If Prompted)">
On first launch, your browser may ask you to confirm required permissions for the extension to function properly. These include access to active tabs, storage, and webRequest APIs.

Confirm these permissions to allow uBO Scope to monitor network requests seamlessly.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
uBO Scope relies on browser permissions to capture and display network activity. Without granting these permissions, the extension cannot provide accurate data.
</Info>

## 2. Understanding the Default UI and Extension State

Upon opening the popup, here is what you will encounter:

- **Header (Hostname Display)**: Shows the hostname and domain of the active browser tab you're monitoring.
- **Domains Connected (Summary)**: A badge-like counter indicating the number of distinct third-party domains connected to by the current tab.
- **Three Outcome Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains to which network requests have successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were stealth-blocked (redirected or hidden by content blockers).
  - **Blocked**: Domains whose network connections were explicitly blocked.

- **Domain Lists**: Each section lists domains observed for that connection outcome, alongside the number of connections per domain.

- **Loading State**: The interface displays a loading indicator while gathering data.

### What to Expect on First Launch
- If the active tab has network activity, uBO Scope will process and display these domains accordingly.
- If there is "NO DATA," it means the extension has not recorded any connection information for the active tab yet.

<Tip>
Open websites with active network requests to see uBO Scope populate its interface with connection data.
</Tip>

## 3. Recognizing Activation and Data Collection

uBO Scope automatically tracks network requests from the moment you browse. The badge count on the toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct remote servers connected.

- **When Active**: The count updates dynamically, and the popup fills with categorized domains.
- **Inactive or No Data**: The popup will show "NO DATA" until network activity is detected.

## 4. Overview of Key UI Elements

Here is a brief breakdown to help you navigate the main UI sections effectively:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Hostname Display">
Shows the current tab's hostname and root domain in Unicode format for easy identification.
</Card>
<Card title="Connection Outcome Sections">
Categorizes domains based on whether connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
</Card>
<Card title="Domains List">
Displays per-domain connection counts, letting you see the frequency and distribution of connections.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## 5. Practical Tips for First Use

- Visit websites that load diverse content from multiple sources (e.g., news sites, social media) to see uBO Scope in action.
- Pay attention to the badge count: a lower number means fewer distinct third-party connections, usually indicating fewer privacy exposures.
- Use the domain lists to identify which third-party servers are interacting with your visited page.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues on First Launch

<AccordionGroup title="Common First Launch Issues">
<Accordion title="The popup shows 'NO DATA' constantly">

This usually means there has been no network activity captured yet, or the extension permissions were not granted properly.

- Ensure you have granted all necessary permissions.
- Reload the active tab or navigate to a website with active third-party content.
- Restart the browser if the problem persists.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The toolbar badge does not update">

- Confirm the extension is enabled in your browser's extensions page.
- Check your browser version meets the minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Make sure the site you visit generates network requests that can be monitored.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unexpected errors or UI not loading">

- Disable other conflicting extensions that might interfere with network monitoring.
- Open the browser's developer console on the popup page to check for errors.
- Report persistent issues with context to the GitHub repository.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Summary

On your first launch, uBO Scope activates automatically once installed and permitted. Its popup UI provides an immediate snapshot of third-party network connections from your active tab, categorized by connection outcome. This instant visibility empowers you to start understanding your browserâ€™s network interactions without additional setup.
