# First Configuration: Getting Ready to Observe

After installing uBO Scope, this guide walks you through the essential initial setup steps to prepare the extension for effective network observation. It covers accepting necessary permissions, pinning the extension icon for quick access, and familiarizing yourself with the popup interface's core features. Completing these steps ensures you are fully ready to start monitoring your browser’s network connections transparently.

---

## 1. Accepting Permissions

Upon installation, uBO Scope requires several browser permissions to function correctly. These permissions enable it to monitor network requests across webpages and safely store session data.

### What Permissions Are Required?
- **Active Tab Access**: To interact with the current tab for querying network data.
- **Storage Permissions**: To store session information and settings.
- **Web Request Monitoring**: To observe all HTTP(s) and WebSocket network activity for accurate connection reporting.

### Steps to Confirm Permissions
1. After installing uBO Scope from your browser's extension store, a prompt might appear requesting permission authorization.
2. Read the permission request carefully — uBO Scope only asks for what it needs to observe network requests transparently.
3. Click **Allow** or **Add Extension** to grant the requested permissions.

<Tip>
Permissions are fundamental for uBO Scope to deliver accurate insights. Without these permissions, the extension cannot monitor network connections or update its badge count.
</Tip>

## 2. Pinning the uBO Scope Icon for Convenient Access

To access uBO Scope quickly and stay aware of your network activity, pin its icon to your browser’s toolbar.

### Why Pin the Extension Icon?
- Provides instant access to the popup interface.
- Displays the badge count indicating third-party connections on the active tab.

### How to Pin

#### Chrome and Chromium-based Browsers
1. Click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions) next to the address bar.
2. Find **uBO Scope** in the dropdown list.
3. Click the **Pin icon** next to uBO Scope. The extension icon will now appear permanently on the toolbar.

#### Firefox
1. Click the hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) on the right of the toolbar.
2. Choose **More Tools** > **Customize Toolbar**.
3. Drag and drop the uBO Scope icon onto the toolbar area.
4. Click **Done** to save.

#### Safari
1. Open Safari > Preferences > Extensions.
2. Ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
3. Use Safari’s toolbar customization to add the uBO Scope icon if not automatically shown.

<Warning>
Pinning the extension icon is critical for real-time access to your network connection details and to visually track your third-party connection count.
</Warning>

## 3. Brief Tour of the Popup Interface

Once the extension is installed and pinned, you can explore its popup interface to understand what information you will see during network observation.

### Opening the Popup
- Click the uBO Scope icon on your browser’s toolbar.

### Understanding the Popup Layout

The popup interface is designed to give you a clear snapshot of network connections for the active browser tab:

- **Hostname Display**: Shows the main hostname of the current tab along with any subdomain prefix.
- **Domains Connected Summary**: Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains connected during the session.
- **Connection Categories**:
  - **Not Blocked**: Servers contacted successfully.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Servers where requests were redirected or stealthily blocked to avoid detection.
  - **Blocked**: Servers actively blocked by content blockers or network restrictions.

### Interactive Details
- Each category shows a list of domains involved and the count of connections.
- Domains are shown with Unicode support for internationalized names.

<Info>
The popup dynamically updates as you browse, reflecting real-time network activity for the tab you are observing.

## 4. Preparing for Your First Network Observation Session

Having completed permissions and familiarized yourself with the interface, you are set to start observing network activity on any webpage.

### Best Practices Before Observing
- Ensure the extension icon is visible and pinned.
- Know that uBO Scope does not block any connections but reports their outcomes.
- Visit a website where multiple third-party resources load (e.g., a news site or popular web service) to see meaningful connection data.

### What to Expect
- The badge count on the extension icon increments based on unique third-party servers contacted.
- The popup shows categorized lists of these domains, helping you distinguish allowed from blocked or stealth-blocked connections.

<Tip>
Start with familiar, trusted websites to understand typical network behavior before exploring more complex or privacy-sensitive sites.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Initial Setup Issues

### Extension Icon Not Visible
- **Cause**: Extension not pinned or hidden in overflow menu.
- **Solution**: Follow the pinning instructions again for your browser.

### Permissions Prompt Did Not Appear
- **Cause**: Browser might defer permissions setup until first use.
- **Solution**: Remove and reinstall the extension, then accept permissions immediately.

### Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Empty
- **Cause**: No network activity recorded for the active tab yet.
- **Solution**: Reload the tab or navigate to a page with active network connections.

### Badge Count Not Updating
- **Cause**: Background service might not be fully ready or affected by storage/session issues.
- **Solution**: Restart your browser, confirm permissions, and try browsing again.
