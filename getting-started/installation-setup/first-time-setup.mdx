# Initial Configuration for uBO Scope

Get up and running quickly by understanding the essential configuration and interface behavior of uBO Scope after installation. This guide will help you configure your environment, interpret permissions, and get familiar with the extension's badge and popup interface behaviors.

---

## 1. Understanding Interface Permissions

uBO Scope requires a specific set of browser permissions to accurately monitor your browser's network requests. These permissions enable the extension to observe all connections initiated by web pages and display relevant details in the UI.

### Permissions Required

- **activeTab**: Allows uBO Scope to access the active tab to collect data about network connections relevant to the current page.
- **storage**: Enables the extension to save session data and settings locally within the browser.
- **webRequest**: Grants access to observe, analyze, and report all outgoing network requests triggered by web content.
- **Host Permissions**: 
  - Access to URLs of the form `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, and `wss://*/*` 
  - These allow monitoring connections across all websites and web protocols.

<Tip>
These permissions are essential for uBO Scope to function correctly, as they let it transparently track every attempted and successful remote connection your browser initiates.
</Tip>

## 2. Badge Behavior Explained

The toolbar icon badge is a quick-glance indicator showing the current number of distinct third-party remote domains connected by the active tab.

- **Badge Count Meaning**: The number displayed on the badge represents the count of distinct third-party domains for which at least one connection was allowed (not blocked).
- **Preferred State**: A lower badge count indicates fewer remote third-party connections, which is often desirable from a privacy perspective.
- **Behavior on New Tabs and Page Loads**:
  - On loading a new page, the count resets and updates as network requests occur.
  - If no connections to third-party domains have been made or detected, the badge will be empty (no number).

<Note>
The badge only counts **allowed** third-party domains, not blocked or stealth connections.
</Note>

## 3. Popup Interface Overview and Domain Statuses

Opening the uBO Scope popup (by clicking the toolbar icon) displays detailed connection outcomes categorized by domain groups:

| Section | Description |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Allowed** | Domains where network requests succeeded and were not blocked. |
| **Blocked** | Domains where network requests were blocked or failed. |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains involved in silent redirects or stealth blocking by content blockers. |

Each section lists domains with a badge count representing the number of connection attempts made to that domain.

### Navigating the Popup

1. **Tab Hostname Display**: At the top, you see the current tab's hostname and its base domain.
2. **Summary Section**: Shows total count of distinct connected domains.
3. **Detailed Sections**: Scroll each section to review the relevant domains and their request counts.

Example:

```
domains connected: 5

Allowed:
- cdn.example.com [10]
- api.example.org [2]

Blocked:
- ads.tracker.net [3]

Stealth-blocked:
- some.redirected.site [1]
```

<Info>
Use this interface to understand which third-party servers your browser communicates with when visiting a page, and how content blocking affects these connections.
</Info>

## 4. How uBO Scope Integrates with Your Browser

uBO Scope runs as a lightweight browser extension that works seamlessly in the background with minimal configuration.

- It listens to all relevant network requests at the browser level.
- Maintains per-tab session data on allowed, blocked, and stealth connections.
- Dynamically updates the toolbar badge to reflect current connection counts.
- Provides instant detailed feedback via the popup interface.

This integration guarantees accurate monitoring regardless of whether you use uBlock Origin or other content blockers, since it taps into the browser's native `webRequest` API.

<Tip>
The extension automatically handles session persistence and cleanup as you open and close tabs, needing no manual intervention.
</Tip>

## 5. Steps to Perform Your First Configuration Validation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Confirm Permissions">
    Ensure the extension is installed and granted the necessary permissions during installation. Check your browser’s extension page for permission details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open any Website">
    Navigate to a common website with typical third-party connections.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Observe the Toolbar Badge">
    Look at the uBO Scope icon badge; it should show a number representing the distinct third-party domains connected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Popup Interface">
    Click the toolbar icon to open the popup and review detailed connection statuses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Domain Statuses">
    See that domains are correctly categorized under Allowed, Blocked, or Stealth as per ongoing network activity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Successful review of badge counts and popup domain entries means uBO Scope is properly configured and actively monitoring.
</Check>

## 6. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Allow Time for Data Collection**: When you open a page, wait a moment for connections to be recorded and badge to update.
- **Beware of Incognito Mode Limitations**: Permissions and background activity may be limited if the extension isn't enabled for private browsing.
- **Understand Badge Resets**: Badge count resets when you switch tabs or reload pages, reflecting fresh data.
- **No Settings Panel**: uBO Scope requires minimal configuration; avoid looking for options dialogs.

<Tip>
If the badge never updates or the popup shows no data, verify that the extension is enabled and has permission to access webRequest APIs.
</Tip>

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope Initial Setup">
  <Accordion title="Badge Does Not Appear or Update">
    - Ensure you installed the latest version of uBO Scope from your browser’s official add-on store.
    - Confirm the extension permissions include access to all websites.
    - Restart the browser and reload tabs.
    - Check for conflicting extensions or policies blocking extension activities.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Empty Sections'>
    - The current tab may not have triggered any network requests yet. Reload the page.
    - The extension may have insufficient permissions; verify in browser extensions manager.
    - Try disabling private/incognito mode restrictions.
