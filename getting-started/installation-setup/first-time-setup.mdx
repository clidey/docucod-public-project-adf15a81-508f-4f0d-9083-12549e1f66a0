# First-Time Configuration

Welcome to the initial setup guide for **uBO Scope**. This page focuses on the minimal configuration steps after you have installed the extension. uBO Scope is designed to work out-of-the-box with almost no setup, providing immediate insight into your browsing session's remote server connections.

---

## 1. How uBO Scope Works Immediately After Installation

Once installed, uBO Scope begins monitoring network requests from your active browser tabs without any manual configuration. It leverages browser APIs to detect and report every connection attempt to third-party remote servers.

- The extension uses the browser's `webRequest` API to track network requests.
- It categorizes connections into:
  - **Allowed** (connections successfully made),
  - **Stealth-blocked** (redirected or indirectly blocked), and
  - **Blocked** (failed or denied connections).
- The badge on the extension icon reflects **the number of distinct third-party domains allowed**.

This immediate functionality means you do not need to adjust any settings to start benefiting from uBO Scope.


## 2. Recommended Browser Permission Checks

**uBO Scope requires certain permissions to function correctly.** These include:

- **`activeTab`**: To interact with and collect data for the current active tab.
- **`storage`**: To retain session data during and across browsing sessions.
- **`webRequest`**: To monitor and intercept network requests.

### Verifying Permissions

1. Navigate to your browser's extensions management page.
2. Locate uBO Scope.
3. Check that the above permissions are granted.

If permissions are missing or denied, the extension may not report network requests accurately.

<Tip>
Browsers such as Chrome (version 122+), Firefox (128+), and Safari (18.5+) support these permissions and APIs fully. Verify your browser version is up to date to ensure seamless operation.
</Tip>


## 3. Integration With Your Browsing Session

uBO Scope injects minimal background scripts and runs as a service worker or background module depending on your browser:

- It monitors every network request your browser initiates that passes through the allowed URL patterns (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
- The extension collects per-tab data reflecting network request outcomes dynamically.
- Data is stored throughout your session and saved for continuity.
- At any moment, clicking the uBO Scope icon opens a popup summarizing all third-party connections for the current tab.

This integration is designed so that users rarely need to intervene. The extension automatically resets data on tab close and updates the badge count live.


## 4. Minimal to No Configuration Required

### What You Should Expect

- **Out-of-the-box operation:** Install and simply start browsing.
- **Badge count updates** dynamically to reflect the number of connected third-party domains.
- **Popup interface** provides a categorized summary of network requests per tab.

### When Might You Need Configuration?

- Advanced users and filter list maintainers may wait for future features that offer more configuration options.
- Currently, no user settings are necessary or available for enabling core monitoring.


## 5. Practical First-Time User Flow

Navigate to a popular website or any page with multiple resources (e.g., news or media site).
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Badge">
Watch the uBO Scope icon; the badge should show a number indicating distinct third-party domains connected.

</Step>
</Steps>


## 6. Troubleshooting Recommendations

If uBO Scope doesn’t seem to be capturing network requests correctly or the badge count remains empty:

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Extension Icon Badge Shows No Data">
- Verify you are browsing a tab with active network connections.
- Reload the tab; uBO Scope updates badge counts only after detecting network activity.
- Check for permission revocations in your browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Does Not Display Domain Data">
- Ensure you have the latest version of uBO Scope installed.
- Refresh your active tab or open a new tab to trigger data collection.
- Confirm your browser supports the extension’s API requirements.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Connections Are Not Being Reported">
- Some requests bypass the `webRequest` API and hence cannot be monitored.
- Use supported browsers as per the [Supported Browsers & Requirements](/getting-started/introduction-quickstart/supported-browsers-prerequisites) documentation.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
