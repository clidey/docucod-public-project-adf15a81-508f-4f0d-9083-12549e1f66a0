# First-Time Setup & Permissions

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through the critical initial configuration immediately after installation. You'll learn about the permissions this extension requires, how to identify its icon in your browser, and how to confirm that the basic setup is complete for first use.

## 1. Understanding Required Permissions

uBO Scope uses browser permissions to monitor and report network requests effectively. These permissions enable it to observe all connections your browser attempts, helping expose third-party remote server interactions as intended.

### Essential Permissions Explained

- **Active Tab**: Grants uBO Scope access to the currently active browser tab for monitoring network requests originating there.
- **Storage**: Allows saving of connection data securely within your browser for persistence across sessions.
- **WebRequest**: Enables uBO Scope to listen to all network requests, track outcomes (allowed, blocked, redirected), and update its interface and badge accordingly.
- **Host Permissions**: uBO Scope must have access to all URLs starting with `http://`, `https://`, `ws://`, and `wss://` to comprehensively monitor connections.

### How Permissions Are Granted

When you install uBO Scope, your browser should prompt you to grant these permissions automatically. This process is standard for browser extensions and ensures the extension can function fully.

<Tip>
If you do not see a permission prompt upon installation, check your browser’s extension management page to verify permissions manually.

## 2. Recognizing the uBO Scope Extension Icon

Once installed and enabled, uBO Scope displays an icon in your browser’s toolbar.

### What the Icon Looks Like

- The icon resembles a small shield with a globe, consistent across supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Icon sizes include 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128 pixels to support various display densities.

### Toolbar Behavior

- If the icon is hidden, you may need to pin it to your toolbar from the browser’s extension management interface for easy access.
- The icon also displays a badge with a number, representing the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected during browsing. Lower badge counts are generally better, indicating fewer remote servers connected.

<Info>
The badge count updates dynamically as you browse, reflecting your current tab’s third-party remote connections.

## 3. Confirming Basic Setup Completion

After installation and granting permissions, verify that uBO Scope is correctly initialized and ready to use.

### Step 1: Check Extension Status

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
2. Click the icon to open its popup interface.
3. The popup will display in a few moments a summary of domains connected for the active tab.

### Step 2: Verify Data Collection

- Initially, the popup shows “NO DATA” while loading or if no network requests have been logged yet.
- Visit a few websites to generate network activity.
- Reload the popup by clicking the icon again. You should see a domains count and categorized domains under **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** sections.

### Step 3: Understand the Badge Count

- The badge number on the toolbar icon reflects the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected in the current tab.
- If the badge is empty or missing after browsing websites with external content, this could indicate a permissions or installation issue.

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

- **Pin uBO Scope Icon:** Pin the extension icon to your toolbar immediately after installation for easy access.
- **Allow Host Access:** Ensure the extension has proper host permissions to avoid missing data.
- **Use in Private Browsing:** Some browsers restrict extension functionality in private or incognito mode; check your browser’s extension settings.

<Warning>
Without the necessary permissions, uBO Scope cannot accurately report network requests, rendering its data incomplete or empty.
</Warning>
