# Verifying Your Installation

Welcome to the crucial step of confirming that uBO Scope is correctly installed and actively tracking your browser’s network connections. This page guides you through identifying the extension’s toolbar icon, understanding its initial badge display, and validating the extension’s core monitoring functionality using a sample webpage.

---

## 1. Confirm the Toolbar Icon is Visible and Active

The first sign of a successful installation is the presence of the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.

### Steps:

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s extension area. It should display uBO Scope’s distinctive logo.
- If you do not see the icon immediately:
  - Check your browser’s extension management menu to ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
  - On Chromium-based browsers, use the puzzle piece menu (`Extensions`) and pin the uBO Scope icon to the toolbar.
  - On Firefox or Safari, verify the extension is enabled in the add-ons/settings page.

### What to Expect:
- A visible icon with the uBO Scope logo.
- The icon acts as your gateway to quick status insights and access to the popup panel.

<Check>
Make sure the uBO Scope icon is both visible and enabled in your browser toolbar before proceeding.
</Check>

## 2. Understand the Initial Badge Display

The toolbar icon badge shows the count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by your browser on the active tab.

### Initial Badge Behavior:

- **Empty Badge or No Number**: When you first open a new tab or a page with no third-party connections, the badge may be empty, indicating zero detected domains.
- **Non-zero Badge**: Upon loading a page with remote server connections, expect to see a count reflecting the number of unique third-party domains your browser connected to.

### Key Points:
- The badge count represents only distinct third-party remote servers — not total requests.
- A lower badge count signals fewer third-party connections, which often correlates to better privacy.

<Info>
An empty badge is normal immediately after installation or on first load of a page with no remote connections.
</Info>

<Warning>
Do not confuse the badge count with a block count; uBO Scope reports allowed connections regardless of content blocking.
</Warning>

## 3. Verify uBO Scope is Tracking Network Connections

To ensure uBO Scope actively monitors your browsing activity, perform a simple validation by visiting a webpage known to initiate connections to external domains.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Sample Webpage">
- Visit a popular website or a page known for multiple third-party content, such as a news site or comprehensive web portal.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Badge Count">
- Watch the uBO Scope toolbar icon as the page loads.
- The badge should update to reflect the number of third-party domains detected.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Toolbar Icon to Open the Popup Panel">
- Click on the uBO Scope icon to open the popup panel.
- The panel displays detailed domains categorized as:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains that your browser connected to successfully.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains with stealth blocking applied.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Popup Data">
- Verify that the counts and domain names in the popup match expected third-party connections.
- The summary at the top reiterates the total distinct domains connected.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Expected Outcome:
- The badge number increases from empty to a number reflecting distinct third-party domains.
- Popup panel shows domain lists correspondingly.

## 5. Best Practices for Effective Verification

- Use sites with diverse content from multiple domains to see meaningful badge counts.
- Remember the badge counts unique domains, not requests or blocked counts.
