# Initial Configuration & Permissions

Ensure uBO Scope delivers accurate insights right from the first moment you start using it. This guide walks you through the default configuration, the permissions the extension requires to function effectively, and optional tweaks to maximize your visibility into remote server connections during your browsing sessions.

---

## 1. Default Setup Overview

uBO Scope is designed to function immediately after installation without requiring complex configuration. By default, it:

- Monitors all HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket (ws/wss) connections.
- Tracks network requests across all active browser tabs.
- Categorizes connection outcomes as **allowed** (successful), **stealth-blocked** (redirected but hidden), and **blocked** (failed requests).
- Displays a badge count on the toolbar icon reflecting the number of distinct third-party domains connections were allowed to.

This setup ensures you start receiving meaningful data on third-party connections immediately.

<Tip>
The badge count on the extension’s icon represents the number of unique third-party domains connected successfully, not merely the total number of requests. This offers a clearer, privacy-focused perspective on your browsing footprint.
</Tip>

## 2. Required Permissions Explained

To operate effectively, uBO Scope requests several key permissions defined in the browser manifest:

### Permissions Required

- **`activeTab`**: Access to data on the currently active browser tab.
- **`storage`**: To save session data related to network requests and configuration.
- **`webRequest`**: Allows interception and monitoring of outgoing and incoming network requests.

### Host Permissions

The extension needs broad permissions to monitor network traffic from all web pages you visit:

- `http://*/*` and `https://*/*`: Covers all web HTTP/HTTPS connections.
- `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*` (except on Safari, which omits websocket permissions): Cover all WebSocket connections.

<Note>
These permissions are necessary so uBO Scope can access the network events and report on third-party remote server connections comprehensively. They do not enable the extension to modify web content or block connections.
</Note>

## 3. How Permissions Impact Functionality

The combined permissions empower uBO Scope to listen to network requests across all tabs and windows, enabling continuous, real-time reporting:

- **`webRequest` API:** Captures details about network requests, including redirects and errors, essential for categorizing connection outcomes.
- **Session Storage:** Retains data across browsing sessions, so your connection history on each tab remains accessible until the tab closes.

These permissions work transparently after installation, eliminating the need for manual permission grants beyond the initial installation step from your browser's extension store.

## 4. Optional Configuration Tweaks

While no manual initial configuration is required, power users and filter list maintainers may consider these adjustments to optimize uBO Scope for their use cases:

### Customize Badge Visibility

The toolbar badge shows the number of unique allowed third-party domains per tab:

- If you prefer less clutter, disable the badge in your browser’s extension settings.
- Keep it enabled for immediate visual insights.

### Control Storage Persistence

By default, session data persists only while tabs remain open. This maintains privacy and reduces storage overhead.

- For extended analysis, exporting session data externally (not supported natively) can be explored by advanced users.

### Adjust Network Monitoring Scope

Currently, uBO Scope monitors all sites and connections enabled by host permissions. There is no UI to restrict monitoring to specific sites.

- Advanced users can explore modifying permissions by building custom extension packages if needed.

## 5. How uBO Scope Uses the Public Suffix List

uBO Scope employs the Public Suffix List (PSL) to accurately derive domains from hostnames, ensuring third-party domains are identified correctly:

- PSL avoids misclassification of subdomains as separate entities.
- The PSL data is loaded and cached internally when uBO Scope starts.

This enhances the precision of connection reporting.

## 6. Verifying Permissions and Configuration

Follow these steps to confirm that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions and is working correctly:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Extension Permissions">
Open your browser’s extensions page (e.g., chrome://extensions or about:addons).
Locate uBO Scope and click on “Details” or equivalent.
Verify that the listed permissions include “Access your data on all websites” and “Read and change all your data on the websites you visit.”
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Badge and Popup Behavior">
Visit a variety of websites.
Observe the toolbar icon – it should display a badge number indicating active third-party connections.
Click the icon to open the popup.
You should see categorized sections labeled “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked,” listing connected domains.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the badge remains blank across sites, check your browser’s privacy settings or other content blockers that might restrict the extension’s webRequest API access.
</Tip>

## 7. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with Initial Configuration & Permissions">
<Accordion title="Badge Does Not Update or Remains Blank">
- Ensure you have navigated to HTTPS or HTTP websites, as uBO Scope tracks real network requests.
- Verify that no conflicting extensions block webRequest API for uBO Scope.
- Restart the browser and confirm uBO Scope is enabled.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension Lacks Host Permissions">
- Double-check the installation source; installing from unofficial stores or sideloading might omit permissions.
- Reinstall from the official browser extension store to guarantee proper permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists">
- This can occur on new tabs or pages without network activity yet.
- Reload the web page and wait a few moments for the extension to capture network requests.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Summary

uBO Scope’s initial configuration is optimized for instant visibility of remote server connections with minimal user setup. The extension requires activeTab, storage, and webRequest permissions combined with broad host access to provide comprehensive monitoring. Optional tweaks allow users to tailor badge display and session persistence, though defaults suit most users. Verifying permissions and typical troubleshooting ensures smooth first run experiences.
