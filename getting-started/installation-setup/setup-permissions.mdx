# Verifying Extension Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to function fully and provide accurate insights into your browser's network connections. This guide walks you through reviewing and confirming these permissions to ensure the extension operates as intended.

---

## 1. Why Permissions Matter

uBO Scope leverages browser APIs that need explicit user authorization. Confirming these permissions:

- Ensures the extension can monitor network requests comprehensively.
- Builds your trust by transparently showing what data and capabilities the extension accesses.
- Avoids functionality limitations or inaccurate data caused by missing permissions.


## 2. Required Permissions Explained

Each permission serves an important role in delivering full extension functionality.

| Permission   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `webRequest` | Enables monitoring of network requests and responses, capturing connection outcomes such as allowed, blocked, or redirected requests.                    |
| `activeTab`  | Grants access to data from the active browser tab, allowing the extension to map connection details to the specific tab users are viewing.                |
| `storage`   | Facilitates saving session data, such as connection states and domain outcomes, to persist context across usage without loss.                           |
| Host Permissions (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, etc.) | Allows the extension to observe requests to all web domains, necessary for comprehensive network monitoring across all visited sites.                      |


## 3. Reviewing Permissions by Browser

Permissions are declared in the extension manifest and requested at installation. Here's how to verify them on popular browsers:

### Chrome (and Chromium-based browsers)

1. Click the extension icon in the toolbar.
2. Select **Manage extensions** or navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Find **uBO Scope** in the list and click **Details**.
4. Scroll to **Permissions**. Ensure the following are present:
   - `Read and change all your data on the websites you visit` (host permissions)
   - `Access your tabs` (activeTab)
   - `Read and change your browsing history` (webRequest, if listed)
5. If any are missing, reinstall the extension from the official store to ensure full permissions.

### Firefox

1. Click the menu button (three horizontal lines) and choose **Add-ons and themes**.
2. Select **Extensions** and find **uBO Scope**.
3. Click the extension and then **More options**.
4. Confirm the following permissions are granted:
   - `Access your data for all websites` (host permissions)
   - `Access browser tabs` (activeTab)
   - `Access browser requests` (webRequest)
5. If permissions are not granted or the extension is disabled, reinstall or update.

### Safari

1. Open Safari and go to **Preferences > Extensions**.
2. Select **uBO Scope**.
3. Confirm the extension has permissions to "Allow access to websites".
4. Check the minimum version requirement is met (Safari 18.5 or later).
5. If permissions are missing, re-enable or reinstall the extension.

## 4. How to Confirm Permissions Are Working

After verifying settings:

1. **Open uBO Scope's popup:** Click the extension icon to open its data panel.
2. **Visit a website:** Browse to a site known to connect to multiple domains (e.g., a news site).
3. **Observe the badge count:** The toolbar icon should display a number representing connected third-party domains.
4. **Check the popup:** Confirm domains are listed under "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" categories.

If these points work correctly, all permissions required by uBO Scope are active.

## 5. Common Permission Issues & How to Resolve

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Permissions">
<Accordion title="Permission Not Granted at Install">
Sometimes browsers block or limit permissions at extension install. To resolve:

- Remove uBO Scope.
- Reinstall it from the official store.
- When prompted, accept all permission requests.
- Restart the browser if necessary.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Host Permissions Limited">
If the extension cannot monitor all domains:

- Confirm the extension has broad host permissions (`http://*/*` and `https://*/*`).
- Some browsers allow restricting permissions to specific sites; ensure no restrictions are enabled.
- Adjust permissions in browser extension settings as needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Expired or Outdated Extension Version">
Permissions may not function properly if the extension is outdated.

- Check for updates in your browser's extension manager.
- Enable automatic updates.
- Manually reinstall the latest version if no update is available.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Browser Version Compatibility">
uBO Scope requires certain minimal browser versions:

- Chrome 122 or later
- Firefox 128 or later
- Safari 18.5 or later

Update your browser to meet these requirements for full extension capability.

## 6. Best Practices for Permission Transparency

- Always review permissions at installation.
- Understand that permissions requested serve to deliver accurate and trustworthy connection monitoring.
- Avoid installing extensions that request unnecessary or irrelevant permissions.
