### 2. Manual Installation (Developer or Advanced Users)

If you prefer to manually install or test the extension, use these steps for Chrome or Firefox. Safari manual installation typically requires packaging via Xcode and is not covered here.

#### Chrome (Using Developer Mode)

1. Clone or download the uBO Scope repository from GitHub: [https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle on the top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked**.
5. Navigate to the `build/uBO-Scope.chromium` directory if pre-built, or the root directory with the source code.
6. Select the folder containing the `manifest.json`.
7. The extension loads immediately. You should see the uBO Scope icon in your toolbar.

#### Firefox (Using about:debugging)

1. Clone or download the uBO Scope repository.
2. Open Firefox and visit `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
3. Click **Load Temporary Add-on...**
4. Select the `manifest.json` file inside the `platform/firefox/` folder or root directory.
5. The extension loads temporarily until Firefox is restarted.

<Tip>
Manual loading is useful for developers or when testing the latest unreleased versions. Keep in mind manual installs may require you to reload after each browser restart.
</Tip>

## Verifying Installation

After installation, confirm uBO Scope is active and ready:

1. Look for the uBO Scope toolbar icon (a shield emblem) in your browser’s extension area.
2. Click the icon to open the popup interface.
3. The popup should display connection data when you navigate to a webpage.

<Tip>
If the popup reports 'NO DATA,' try refreshing the current tab and ensure the extension permissions are granted.
</Tip>

### Checking Badge Count

- The badge on the icon indicates the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the active tab.
- A numeric badge should appear when browsing to a website that makes external connections.
