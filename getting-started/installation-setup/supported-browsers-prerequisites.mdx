# Supported Browsers & Prerequisites

Ensure your environment is fully prepared before installing and using uBO Scope by understanding exactly which browsers and versions are supported, along with any required permissions or browser settings. This page empowers you with the knowledge to verify compatibility and avoid common pitfalls, delivering confidence from the start.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to support major modern browsers with specific minimum version requirements to guarantee full functionality. Below is the list of supported browsers and their minimum versions:

| Browser      | Minimum Version | Notes                     |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Google Chrome (Chromium-based)** | 122.0          | Supports Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium browsers. Minimum Chrome version 122 due to Manifest V3 requirements.
| **Mozilla Firefox** | 128.0          | Includes Firefox for desktop and Android.
| **Safari**   | 18.5            | Requires Safari 18.5 or newer on macOS.


### Why Version Matters

- The extension uses Manifest Version 3 (MV3), which requires recent browser versions that support MV3 APIs such as `webRequest` in service workers.
- Older browsers lack necessary APIs or have partial support, which leads to incomplete or non-functional operation.


## 2. Browser Permissions Required

For uBO Scope to monitor network activity effectively, it requires the following permissions from the browser:

- **ActiveTab**: Allows the extension to interact with the currently active tab to gather and display connection data.
- **Storage**: Enables persistent storage of session data and user preferences.
- **WebRequest**: Critical for observing and categorizing network requests initiated by web pages.
- **Host Permissions**: Access to URLs matching `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and also `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` for WebSocket monitoring (depending on browser).


These permissions are declared explicitly in the extension manifest and prompt a permission grant during installation.


## 3. Browser Settings & Environment

Before installing uBO Scope, review the following environment considerations:

### 3.1 Extension Support

- Ensure that your browser supports third-party extensions and permissions specified above.
- Browsers or versions with strict extension policies or security sandboxing (especially in corporate or managed environments) may interfere with the extension’s operation.

### 3.2 WebRequest API Availability

uBO Scope relies on the browser exposing network requests through the `webRequest` API. Be aware of the following:

- Some browsers or browser modes (e.g., private/incognito with restricted extension permissions) may limit or disable this API.
- Network requests made by DNS-level or system-wide content blockers outside browser context are invisible to uBO Scope.


### 3.3 Permissions Prompts

Upon installing uBO Scope, the browser will prompt to grant permissions to access network data and browsing activity. Acceptance is required for full functionality.


## 4. Summary Table of Permissions per Browser

| Permission      | Chromium (v122+) | Firefox (v128+) | Safari (v18.5+) |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| activeTab       | Required         | Required        | Required        |
| storage         | Required         | Required        | Required        |
| webRequest      | Required         | Required        | Required        |
| host permissions| `http/https/ws`  | `http/https/ws` | `http/https`    |


> **Note:** Safari currently does not declare websocket (`ws`/`wss`) permissions explicitly in the manifest.


## 5. Checking Your Browser Environment

Follow these steps to confirm readiness:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Browser Version">
- Open your browser.
- Navigate to the About page (e.g., `chrome://settings/help` in Chrome, `about:support` in Firefox).
- Confirm version meets or exceeds version listed in section 1.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Extension Permissions">
- Look for any prior prompts or settings restricting webRequest or tab permissions.
- Ensure extensions can request host permissions.
- In enterprise contexts, check if policies block extension permissions.
</Step>
<Step title="Check API Availability">
- Extensions site or developer tools can show if `webRequest` API is available.
- Test installing a simple extension requiring network monitoring to verify.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 6. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with Browser Compatibility">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Old">
Your browser version does not support the features needed by uBO Scope.

**Resolution:** Upgrade to the minimum or latest version of your browser as noted above.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension Permissions Denied">
Without granting activeTab, storage, and webRequest permissions, uBO Scope cannot monitor connections.

**Resolution:** Reinstall the extension or adjust permissions via the browser's extension management UI.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="WebRequest API Restricted">
Some browsers limit webRequest on private or incognito windows or only provide limited APIs.

**Resolution:** Use uBO Scope in regular browsing mode and verify extension permissions for incognito mode if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Browser Policies or Security Software Blocking Extension">
Enterprise or security software may prevent installation or restrict extension capabilities.

**Resolution:** Contact your administrator or whitelist uBO Scope where possible.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Summary

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure you are running a supported browser version (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+), with permissions to access tabs, storage, and the webRequest API. This guarantees the extension can perform its core function of monitoring and reporting network connections without interruption.
