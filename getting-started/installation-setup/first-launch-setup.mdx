# First Launch & Extension Activation

Welcome to your first step with **uBO Scope**—a powerful browser extension designed to transparently monitor connections to remote servers. This guide walks you through enabling the extension in your browser, understanding its toolbar icon behavior, and verifying that uBO Scope is actively tracking connections on your tabs.

---

## 1. Enabling the uBO Scope Extension

Before uBO Scope can monitor your browser’s network requests, it must be installed and enabled in your browser. Follow the steps below based on your browser of choice.

### Step 1: Locate uBO Scope in Your Browser Extensions

- **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.)**
  1. Click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions) in the toolbar.
  2. Find **uBO Scope** in the list.
  3. Pin the extension icon to your toolbar by clicking the pin icon for quick access.

- **Firefox**
  1. Click the menu (three horizontal lines) and select **Add-ons and Themes**.
  2. Go to Extensions and locate **uBO Scope**.
  3. Make sure it is enabled (toggle switch is blue). Pin to toolbar if desired.

- **Safari** (if applicable)
  1. Open Safari Preferences > Extensions.
  2. Check the box to enable **uBO Scope**.

<Tip>

</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Icon

Once enabled, uBO Scope displays an icon in your browser toolbar featuring a badge count. This icon serves as your primary indicator that monitoring is active.

### Icon Behavior and Badge Count

- The badge number shows the **distinct count of third-party remote domains** contacted by the active browser tab.
- A **lower badge count is better**, indicating fewer third-party connections.
- If the badge is empty, it means no remote connections have been recorded yet or the page is still loading.
- Clicking the icon opens the popup UI, displaying detailed connection statistics per tab.

### Icon Visual States

uBO Scope uses a consistent icon across browser platforms with sizes ranging from 16x16 to 128x128 pixels. The toolbar icon also features a tooltip titled 'uBO Scope' that appears on hover.

<Note>
The badge count reflects **successful or attempted** connections, including allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked outcomes. It updates dynamically as network requests complete.
</Note>

## 3. Confirming Active Monitoring

After enabling uBO Scope and opening a webpage, follow these steps to confirm the extension is actively monitoring network connections.

### Step 1: Open a Tab With a Website

Navigate to any website you browse normally, such as your favorite news site or social media platform.

### Step 2: Observe the Toolbar Badge

- Wait a few seconds for the network activity to register.
- Check the badge count on the uBO Scope extension icon.
- The number represents how many distinct third-party domains the current tab contacted.

### Step 3: Inspect Popup Details

1. Click the uBO Scope icon.
2. The popup displays:
   - The tab’s main hostname.
   - Counts of connected domains categorized by outcome:
     - **Not blocked** (allowed connections)
     - **Stealth-blocked** (connections prevented silently)
     - **Blocked** (explicitly blocked connections)
   - A detailed list of domains with connection counts.

### Verification Success Criteria

You have successfully confirmed monitoring if:
- The badge count updates from zero on page load.
- The popup displays domain connection data under the correct outcome categories.
- Connection statistics correspond to your network activity.

<Check>
If these conditions are met, uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browser’s connections.
</Check>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

Should you experience difficulties during your first activation, consider the following common issues and fixes.

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope Activation">
<Accordion title="The Toolbar Icon Does Not Appear">
- Verify the extension is installed and enabled in your browser extensions manager.
- In Chrome/Chromium, click the puzzle icon and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.
- Restart your browser after installation for the icon to appear.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update After Navigating to Websites">
- Ensure you have granted all required permissions during extension installation.
- Some browsers may restrict network access; check browser settings to allow uBO Scope to monitor traffic.
- Confirm the page has fully loaded; network requests are processed asynchronously.
- Try navigating to different websites to trigger observable traffic.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Stats">
- Reload the current tab to generate fresh network events.
- Check if another extension or privacy setting may block webRequest API interception.
- Try temporarily disabling other content blockers to isolate conflicts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The Badge Shows Unexpectedly High Counts">
- Remember the badge counts distinct third-party domains contacted; some sites legitimately connect to multiple content delivery networks (CDNs).
- This does not necessarily indicate a problem but reflects normal web ecosystem complexity.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
