# First Launch & Basic Configuration

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through what to expect immediately after installing the extension, how the browser toolbar badge operates, initial permissions you need to be aware of, and how to open and navigate the popup panel. By the end, you will know how to verify that uBO Scope is working seamlessly and what success looks like on your first use.

---

## 1. Initial Permissions & Browser Integration

uBO Scope requires certain permissions to function optimally. Upon installation, your browser will prompt you to grant these permissions:

- **Active Tab Access:** Allows uBO Scope to detect network requests on the currently active browser tab.
- **Storage:** Enables saving session and configuration data within your browser.
- **webRequest:** Grants access to observe all network requests made by webpages.

The extension also requires host permissions for all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) to monitor web traffic fully.

<Tip>
If you notice uBO Scope is not reporting data after installation, verify that you have accepted these permissions — the extension cannot operate without them.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Browser Toolbar Badge

Once installed and active, uBO Scope adds its icon to your browser’s toolbar. The badge overlay on this icon serves a critical function:

- **Badge Number:** Shows the count of **distinct third-party remote servers** your browser connected to on the active tab.
- **No Number:** If no third-party connections have been observed, the badge will be empty.

Remember, a **lower badge number is desirable** — it indicates fewer third-party connections, reducing your privacy exposure.

<Note>
The badge updates in near real-time as you browse, reflecting new third-party connections made or blocked on the current page.
</Note>

## 3. Opening and Navigating the Popup Panel

The popup panel is your gateway to understanding detailed connection outcomes for the active tab.

### To open the popup panel:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup displays immediate data about the current tab's network connections.

### Popup Section Overview:

- **Tab Hostname:** Displays the hostname of the web page you are currently on.
- **Summary:** Shows the total number of distinct connected domains.
- **Outcome Sections:** Three categories of connections:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains where network connections succeeded and were allowed.
  - **Stealth Blocked:** Domains where requests were mitigated or redirected stealthily.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where network requests were explicitly blocked.

### Domain Lists:
Each outcome section lists the associated domains with a count badge showing how many connections to that domain occurred.

<Tip>
Use the popup during active browsing sessions to observe which third-party domains the page connects to and how connections are treated.
</Tip>

## 4. What to Expect After Installation

After installing uBO Scope and granting permissions:

- Navigate to any website.
- uBO Scope will start reporting network requests made by that page.
- The badge number on the toolbar icon updates to show distinct third-party domains contacted.
- Clicking the icon opens the popup where you see detailed connection outcomes.

<Check>
Make sure the badge updates as you browse different sites — this confirms uBO Scope is actively monitoring and categorizing connections.
</Check>

## 5. Signs of Successful Setup

You have successfully configured uBO Scope if:

- The extension icon is visible in the toolbar.
- The browser has granted all requested permissions.
- The badge count changes corresponding to browsing activity.
- The popup displays domain lists under the allowed, stealth, and blocked categories relevant to the current tab.

If these conditions are met, you are ready to explore deeper usage and interpretation in later guides.

## 6. Tips for First Use

- **Browse typical sites:** Load websites you frequent to observe real-world connection patterns.
- **Check badge changes:** Notice how the badge count increases or decreases based on connections detected.
- **Open the popup regularly:** Use it to correlate badge counts with specific domain connections.

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

If data does not appear or the badge remains blank:

- Confirm you have granted all permissions during installation.
- Ensure your browser version meets minimum requirements (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Avoid private/incognito windows if the extension is not enabled there.
- Refresh the tab or restart your browser if network requests are not captured.
