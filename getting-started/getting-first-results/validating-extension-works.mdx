# Validating Functionality of uBO Scope

Ensure that uBO Scope is actively capturing and reporting network connections correctly by verifying the toolbar icon badge and exploring the extension's popup UI. This guide walks you through practical checks and example scenarios that confirm your setup is correctly monitoring third-party server connections.

---

## 1. Understanding the Toolbar Icon Badge

The toolbar icon badge displays a count representing **the number of distinct third-party domains contacted by the active tab**.

- A **lower count** generally indicates fewer third-party connections.
- The count reflects **allowed connections**; connections that are blocked or stealth-blocked are listed separately in the popup UI.

### How to Use the Badge for Validation

1. **After installation and initial browser launch**, visit a simple website.
2. Observe the badge count on the uBO Scope icon:
   - A non-zero badge indicates active detection of network connections.
   - If the badge is empty (no number), it suggests no allowed third-party connections detected yet.

<Tip>
If the badge always shows zero or does not update, confirm that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`) and the browser supports these APIs properly.
</Tip>

## 2. Exploring the Popup UI

The popup UI provides detailed information about the current active tab’s network activity:

- **Hostname Header:** Shows the active tab’s full hostname and its base domain.
- **Summary Section:** Displays the total count of distinct domains connected.
- **Outcome Sections:** Categorize domains into three groups:
  - `Not blocked` (allowed connections)
  - `Stealth-blocked`
  - `Blocked`
- Each section lists third-party domains involved, along with counts indicating how many connections were made.

### Steps to Verify the Popup UI

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar.
2. Review the **hostname** displayed at the top to ensure it matches your active tab.
3. Check the **domains connected** summary count.
4. Expand each **outcome section** to review the detailed list of domains:
   - Confirm domains you expect to be allowed appear in the "Not blocked" section.
   - Domains that are stealth-blocked or blocked should appear in their respective sections.

### Interpreting the Data

- Domains are grouped and counted to provide a clear overview of network interactions.
- Counts show how many times connections occurred per domain.
- If the popup shows "NO DATA" or empty lists across sections immediately after visiting websites, it may indicate:
  - The extension is not active or lacks required permissions.
  - The current tab’s network requests are not being observed (e.g., due to browser limitations).

<Note>
The popup asynchronously fetches data for the active tab; allow a moment for updates after loading or switching tabs.
</Note>

## 3. Example Scenarios to Confirm Functionality

### Scenario A: Visit a Known Website

1. Open your browser with uBO Scope enabled.
2. Navigate to a popular news or tech website known for third-party content.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon.
4. Confirm:
   - The badge shows a non-zero number reflecting distinct allowed third-party domains.
   - The popup lists domains in the `Not blocked`, `Stealth-blocked`, and `Blocked` sections appropriately.

### Scenario B: Test with Content Blockers Enabled

If you have content blockers like uBlock Origin running:

1. Visit a site with aggressive third-party tracking.
2. Observe the badge and popup.
3. Confirm that blocked domains appear under `Blocked` or `Stealth-blocked` as expected.

This demonstrates how uBO Scope detects the actual network outcomes independently of your content blocking setup.

### Scenario C: Open a New Tab without Navigating

1. Open a new blank tab.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon.
3. The popup should show `NO DATA` or zero connected domains, confirming that it detects absence of network activity.

## 4. Common Validation Checks

| Check                             | What to Expect                                       | Troubleshooting Tip                             |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Badge updates on navigation       | Badge updates with number reflecting connections    | Reload tab or restart browser if static        |
| Popup hostname is current tab     | Hostname header matches active tab’s domain         | Switch tabs or refresh popup if mismatched    |
| Domains listed properly           | Domains appear in their expected sections            | Verify extension permissions and browser APIs |
| No data shown on active tabs      | Possible browser or extension disablement            | Confirm extension enabled and page permissions |

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Validation Issues

### The badge never updates or shows zero

- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled in your browser’s extension settings.
- Verify that permissions (activeTab, webRequest, storage) are granted.
- Confirm browser version meets minimum requirements.
- Try disabling other extensions that might interfere with webRequest listeners.

### Popup shows "NO DATA" for valid tabs

- Wait a few seconds after loading the tab to allow data collection.
- Reload the tab or the popup.
- Clear browser cache and restart the browser.

### Domains not categorizing correctly

- Confirm you are on a web page with network activity.
- Check if content blockers or privacy settings restrict data reporting.

## 6. Summary and Next Steps

Once validated, you can confidently use uBO Scope to examine network connections per tab:

- Use the badge as a quick privacy indicator.
- Use the popup UI to explore connections and outcomes in detail.
