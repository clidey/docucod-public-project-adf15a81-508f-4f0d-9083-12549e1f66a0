## 1. Common Symptoms and What They Mean

| Symptom                                | Likely Cause                                                  | Outcome                                   |

## 2. Verify Your Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope supports the latest versions of major browsers. Check that:

- **Chrome:** Version 122 or later
- **Firefox:** Version 128 or later
- **Safari:** Version 18.5 or later

Older versions lack critical APIs like `webRequest` in the required permission scopes.

<Check>
Use your browser’s About page or version info to confirm compatibility.
</Check>

---

## 3. Check and Confirm Required Extension Permissions

uBO Scope requires these permissions to function properly:

- **`webRequest`** — to monitor network requests
- **`storage`** — for saving session data
- **`activeTab`** — to access information about the active tab

### How to Verify Permissions

1. Open your browser’s extensions page (`chrome://extensions`, `about:addons`, or Safari Extensions preferences).
2. Locate uBO Scope and check the listed permissions.
3. Verify that the extension has access to `webRequest` and host permissions on sites you visit.

### Common Issues & Solutions

- If permissions are denied during installation, **remove and reinstall** the extension allowing it the requested permissions.
- If the browser updated recently, **restart the browser** to refresh permissions.

<Tip>
Permissions issues are the primary cause of uBO Scope failing to track network connections.
Verify them as an initial troubleshooting step.
</Tip>

## 4. Clear Cached Data and Restart the Extension

Sometimes stale or corrupted session data can cause UI issues.

### Steps:

1. Disable and then re-enable the extension via the extensions management page.
2. Clear the extension’s stored data:

   - For Chrome and Firefox:
     - Go to `chrome://extensions/` or `about:addons`.
     - Find uBO Scope and select “Storage” or “Clear Data” if available.
     - Alternatively, clear the browser's local storage for the extension via developer tools.

3. Restart your browser to reload the extension’s background scripts.

<Warning>
Be aware this will reset your session data but not the extension settings.
</Warning>

## 5. Resolve Missing or Incomplete Network Data

uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor connections accurately.

### Confirm Proper Data Collection

- Open uBO Scope popup on an active tab and see if network domains populate.
- Visit a site with known third-party connections (e.g., news or CDN-heavy sites).

### Troubleshooting Steps

- **Make sure other content blockers or privacy extensions are not interfering.** Disable them temporarily to test.
- **Check browser's `webRequest` API support:** Some browsers restrict this API on certain platforms or sites.
- **Avoid private browsing/incognito mode or ensure the extension is allowed to run in that mode.**

<Tip>
Use developer console in the popup (`Ctrl+Shift+J` or `Cmd+Option+J`) to check for errors or warnings.
</Tip>

## 6. Address Unsupported Browser Errors

If you see explicit messages indicating unsupported browsers:

- **Upgrade to a supported browser version** matching minimum version requirements.
- **Verify installation source:** Use official stores or verified builds.
- **Check for platform-specific restrictions**, especially on corporate or managed devices.

<Note>
Unsupported browsers or outdated versions limit uBO Scope's ability to monitor requests due to missing APIs.
</Note>

## 7. Permissions Troubleshooting

Below are specific scenarios with actionable fixes.

<AccordionGroup title="Permissions Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Extension Lacks webRequest Permission">
Verify the extension’s manifest and host permissions:

- Check that `webRequest` is listed in permissions.
- Confirm host permissions cover typical HTTP and HTTPS URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`).

If any permission is missing:

- Reinstall from the official extension store.
- Accept the permission prompts during installation.
- For manual installations (developer mode), ensure permissions are declared correctly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Active Tab Permission Not Granted">
Without `activeTab`, the extension cannot query the current tab, resulting in missing data.

Steps:
- Remove and reinstall the extension to trigger permission prompts.
- Ensure the extension is enabled and allowed to access the active tab.
- In Firefox and Chrome, verify in extensions settings that access on all sites is granted or at least on tabs you use.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Storage Permissions Restricted">
If the extension cannot save session data:

- Check browser storage quota and usage.
- Clear data for the extension manually.
- Disable any privacy features or extensions that restrict local storage.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Browser-Specific Troubleshooting Tips

### Chrome

- Ensure minimum version 122 or later.
- When installing manually (developer mode), load the unpacked extension with all permissions.
- In some cases, disable hardware acceleration if network data does not refresh.

### Firefox

- Minimum version 128 or later is required.
- If installed from AMO, verify the extension is enabled and granted all requested permissions.
- Restart Firefox after installation.

### Safari

- Requires Safari 18.5 or later.
- Install via the Safari Extensions preferences.
- Safari’s `webRequest` capabilities might be more limited; verify that other network monitoring extensions are disabled.
