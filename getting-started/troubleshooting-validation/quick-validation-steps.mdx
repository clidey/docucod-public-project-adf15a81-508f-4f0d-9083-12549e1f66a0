# Validating uBO Scope Functionality

Ensure your installation of uBO Scope is working as intended by following these simple verification steps. This guide helps you confirm that the extension accurately reports network connections, correctly updates the badge count, and displays detailed connection information in the popup interface.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation and Activation

Before performing any validation, verify that uBO Scope is installed and active in your browser.

### Steps:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
2. Confirm the icon appears without any warning or error overlays.
3. If you do not see the icon:
   - Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions/add-ons manager.
   - Restart your browser if necessary.

<Tip>
In browsers like Chrome and Firefox, you may need to pin the extension icon to keep it visible permanently.
</Tip>

## 2. Visit a Known Website to Generate Network Activity

To validate data collection and reporting accurately, open a web page that typically loads multiple resources from third-party servers.

### Recommended sites:

- news sites (e.g., https://www.bbc.com)
- e-commerce sites (e.g., https://www.amazon.com)
- content-rich blogs or multimedia platforms

### Steps:

1. Navigate to the site of choice.
2. Allow the page to fully load.
3. Watch the uBO Scope icon badge for a numeric indicator.

<Check>
A badge number should appear representing the count of distinct third-party domains connected.
</Check>

<Warning>
If the badge remains empty or zero for these sites, recheck permissions and browser support for the webRequest API.
</Warning>

## 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup to Inspect Connection Details

The popup interface displays detailed reports of network requests categorized under:

- **Not blocked:** Successful allowed connections
- **Stealth-blocked:** Redirected or silently blocked connections
- **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked connections

### Steps:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
2. Observe the displayed hostname and domain summary at the top.
3. Review each of the three outcome sections:
   - Domains and the count of connections made to them
4. Compare the number of distinct connected domains shown in the popup summary with the badge number.

<Tip>
If domain lists are empty or labels read "NO DATA", wait a moment and reload the page. The extension processes network events asynchronously.
</Tip>

## 4. Interpreting Network Connection Indicators

Understanding what each category represents is key to interpreting uBO Scope’s data:

| Category        | Meaning                                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Not blocked     | Domains successfully connected (resources loaded)      |
| Stealth-blocked | Connections redirected or stealthily prevented         |
| Blocked         | Connections intentionally blocked by browser or filters |

<Note>
Badge count reflects the distinct *not blocked* connected domains only.
</Note>

---

## 5. Verify Badge Count Accuracy

The badge on the extension icon should dynamically reflect the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected by the active tab.

### Steps:

1. Open multiple tabs with resource-heavy websites.
2. Switch between tabs and observe the extension badge value updates.
3. The badge number should differ depending on third-party connections per tab.

<Warning>
A persistent zero badge while visiting sites known to load external resources indicates a problem with monitoring permissions or webRequest API support in the browser.
</Warning>

## 6. Common Troubleshooting Tips

If validation indicates the extension is not functioning correctly, consider the following:

- Confirm browser version meets minimum requirements:
  - Chrome 122+
  - Firefox 128+
  - Safari 18.5+
- Ensure the extension has the necessary permissions (activeTab, webRequest, storage).
- Refresh the page after clearing session data.
- Disable other conflicting extensions that interfere with webRequest API.
- Review browser-specific known limitations regarding request monitoring.

## 7. Next Steps After Verification

Once you have confirmed uBO Scope is functioning:

- Explore your actual browsing activity to analyze third-party connections.
- Learn to interpret domain outcomes in the popup: see [Understanding the Popup Interface](/guides/getting-started/understanding-the-popup).
- Use uBO Scope to assess and improve filter lists or content blocker effectiveness.
