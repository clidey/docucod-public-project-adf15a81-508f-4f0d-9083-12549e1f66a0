# What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to **transparently reveal all remote server connections initiated by webpages** you visit. Unlike many tools that rely on content blockers or DNS filtering, uBO Scope reports network connections regardless of which blockers or filters you use. This empowers you to **understand, audit, and evaluate your online privacy exposure with complete visibility**.

---

## Why uBO Scope?

Modern browsers and privacy extensions often mask or modify network activity for security or performance reasons. Content blockers may hide or block network requests, but they don’t provide a full picture of attempted connections—especially those silently allowed or stealth-blocked.

uBO Scope’s core mission is to give you raw, accurate insight into **every distinct third-party remote server your browser tries to contact**. It counts and categorizes connections independently of blocking mechanisms, exposing connections typically hidden from users and traditional analytics.

---

## What Does uBO Scope Reveal?

- **All remote server connections attempted or established by webpages in your browser tabs.**
- The number of **distinct third-party domains** connected for each browser tab.
- Categorization of connections by outcome:
  - **Allowed**: Requests that successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-blocked**: Redirected requests that the extension detects as stealth-blocked.
  - **Blocked**: Requests failed or blocked by content blockers or network errors.

This inclusive view provides a realistic measure of background third-party tracking, CDN usage, and content delivery, helping you see beyond simplistic block count metrics.

## How uBO Scope Works

uBO Scope uses your browser's `webRequest` API to monitor all network requests made by webpages in real-time. Key points include:

- Listening to network events like redirects, success, or errors.
- Tracking connections per browser tab, updating a **badge counter** that shows the distinct third-party domains connected.
- Storing session data to maintain connection history during your browsing session.

This approach ensures accurate reporting, whether or not you use content blocking extensions or DNS filters.

<Info>
This extension supports Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers. It requires permissions for active tab access, webRequest monitoring, and local storage.

## What uBO Scope Is Not

- It is **not a content blocker**. It will not block or filter any network connections.
- It is **not an ad blocker test tool**. Common advertisement blocking test pages are ineffective benchmarks and will not reflect uBO Scope’s real-world measurements.

<uBO-Scope>helps debunk myths around blocker effectiveness by showing actual remote server count rather than superficial block counts.</uBO-Scope> Can also assist filter list maintainers in analyzing real browser traffic on constrained devices where developer tools may be unavailable.

## Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The extension’s toolbar icon displays a numeric badge representing:

- The **number of distinct third-party remote servers connected to by the active tab**.
- A **lower number means fewer distinct third-party connections**, which is generally more desirable for privacy.

<Warning>
A high block count on other content blockers may correspond to allowing **more** unique external connections—not fewer. uBO Scope highlights this important nuance.
</Warning>

---

## Quick User Scenario

Imagine visiting a news website using uBO Scope:

1. The toolbar badge immediately shows a number, e.g., `5`, indicating 5 distinct third-party domains contacted.
2. Clicking the badge opens the popup interface detailing each domain:
   - Which were allowed,
   - Which were stealth-blocked (redirected),
   - Which were blocked or failed.
3. Armed with this data, you understand exactly how many third parties are active and their connection status, regardless of any other blockers you use.

This empowers you to make informed choices about your privacy tools and browsing habits.
