# Requirements & Supported Browsers

This page ensures you have the correct environment set up to use **uBO Scope** effectively. It details the supported browsers, minimum versions, and system prerequisites necessary for reliable operation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed to integrate deeply with modern browsers through their native webRequest APIs. Compatibility is carefully maintained with the major browser engines, but specific minimum versions are required to leverage the needed browser capabilities.

| Browser   | Minimum Version | Notes                                           |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Chrome (Chromium-based) | 122.0          | Requires Manifest Version 3 support for extension service workers.
| Firefox   | 128.0           | Uses Manifest Version 3; supports webRequest API fully.
| Safari    | 18.5            | Requires Safari 18.5 or later due to strict_min_version and API availability.


### Details per Browser

- **Chrome / Chromium**
  - Minimum supported version is 122.0, due to Manifest V3 requirements.
  - The extension runs as a service worker background script.
  - Permissions include `webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab`.
  - Host permissions apply to HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS schemes.

- **Firefox**
  - Firefox 128.0 and above required for proper Manifest V3 support.
  - Background scripts run as module scripts.
  - Supports the same host and permissions scope as Chromium.

- **Safari**
  - Requires version 18.5 or later due to strict_min_version in manifest.
  - Background scripts load as classic scripts but declared as modules.
  - Host permissions limited to HTTP and HTTPS (WebSocket permissions unavailable).

<Note>
Your browser version and platform must meet these minimums; otherwise, uBO Scope will not function as expected or may fail to install.
</Note>

## 2. System and Browser Prerequisites

### General System Requirements

- A supported operating system for the chosen browser (Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile variants where supported).
- Internet connectivity to install the extension from the respective browser stores.

### Extension-Specific Requirements

- **Permissions**: The extension requires the `webRequest` permission to monitor network requests.
- **Storage**: Utilizes browser `storage.local` and `storage.session` for session data and persistent state.
- **Host Permissions**: Granted for all HTTP(S) and WebSocket URLs to capture network request details.

### Network

- No special firewall or proxy settings are typically required.
- However, network scans or proxies that block or modify `webRequest` API calls may impact visibility.

<Warning>
Browsers with tight security settings or enterprise policies may block some permissions or script executions used by uBO Scope. If you encounter issues, verify that the extension is allowed to access requested permissions.
</Warning>

## 3. Validating Your Environment

Follow these steps to confirm your environment can run uBO Scope:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Version">
- Open your browser.
- Navigate to its "About" page (e.g., `chrome://settings/help` or `about:support` in Firefox).
- Confirm the version number is equal to or greater than the minimum required (see Table above).
</Step>
<Step title="Install uBO Scope Extension">
- Install uBO Scope from your browser's official extension store.
- Confirm installation success; the uBO Scope icon should appear in your toolbar.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Permissions">
- Navigate to your browser's extension settings.
- Verify uBO Scope has permissions including `webRequest`, `storage`, and access to all sites.
- If not, adjust permissions and reload the extension.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Badge and Popup Functionality">
- Visit any website.
- Observe the uBO Scope badge icon; a count should appear indicating active monitoring.
- Click the icon and ensure the popup interface loads without errors.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you do not see the badge or the extension icon, it may be disabled or incompatible with your browser version.
</Tip>

## 4. Browser-Specific Notes

### Chrome

- Manifest Version 3 (MV3) requires service worker usage.
- Minimum Chrome version 122 ensures API compliance.

### Firefox

- Firefox supports MV3 starting version 128.
- Any older versions will not work correctly or will lack API support.

### Safari

- Uses `strict_min_version` to enforce version 18.5 or newer.
- WebSocket monitoring (`wss://` and `ws://`) is not supported due to host permission limitations in Safari's manifest.

<Info>
Safari users should be aware that WebSocket connections monitoring is limited. HTTP and HTTPS are fully supported.
</Info>

## Manifest Version & Permissions Reference

Below is a concise overview of the extensions' manifest versions and key permissions per platform:

| Browser   | Manifest Version | Background Script Type | Key Permissions                 | Host Permissions                 |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Chrome    | 3                | Service Worker Module | `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest` | `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` |
| Firefox   | 3                | Module Script          | Same as Chrome                 | Same as Chrome                 |
| Safari    | 3                | Module Script (with scripts array) | Same as Chrome (minus WS hosts) | `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`      |

<Check>
Make sure your installed extension version aligns with your operating platformâ€™s manifest requirements to avoid runtime issues.
