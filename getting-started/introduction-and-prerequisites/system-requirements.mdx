# System Requirements

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure that your system and browser meet the necessary requirements to guarantee a smooth installation and optimal operation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Platforms

uBO Scope operates as a browser extension leveraging each browser's webRequest APIs. It currently supports the following major desktop browsers:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge)
  - Minimum Chrome version: **122.0**
- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum Firefox version: **128.0**
- **Safari**
  - Minimum Safari version: **18.5**

These supported browsers cover Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop platforms where the respective browser versions are available.

<Check>
Ensure your browser is updated to at least the minimum specified version for compatibility.
</Check>

## 2. Operating System Requirements

The extension runs on desktops where the supported browsers operate. This includes:

- Windows 10 and later
- macOS 11 (Big Sur) and later
- Major Linux distributions with Chromium or Firefox browsers meeting version requirements

As an extension, uBO Scope does not install at the OS level, but relies on the browser environment.

## 3. Browser Permissions and APIs

To function correctly, uBO Scope requires the following browser permissions:

- **`webRequest` permission:** To monitor all outgoing network requests from browser tabs.
- **`activeTab` permission:** To interact with the currently active tab for precise data reporting.
- **`storage` permission:** To store session information and persistent settings.

Additionally, uBO Scope asks for broad host permissions on all HTTP and HTTPS sites:

- `http://*/*`
- `https://*/*`
- `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*` (except on Safari, where web sockets may be limited in permissions)

These permissions are essential because uBO Scope analyzes all network connections made by webpages without interfering.

<Info>
These permissions do not block or modify network traffic; they simply observe request outcomes.
</Info>

## 4. Network and Extension Environment Requirements

- **Network Connectivity:** uBO Scope requires network access to load resources such as the public suffix list necessary for domain parsing. Ensure your firewall or proxy allows your browser to fetch from external servers.
- **Extension APIs Exposure:** The browser must expose the `webRequest` API events (`onBeforeRedirect`, `onErrorOccurred`, `onResponseStarted`) to extensions for monitoring network connection details.

<Warning>
On some constrained platforms or browser modes limiting extension capabilities (e.g., private browsing with strict restrictions), uBO Scope may not be able to access all network requests or data reliably.
</Warning>

## 5. Summary of Key Requirements

| Requirement                          | Details                               |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Supported Browsers                 | Chromium ≥ 122.0, Firefox ≥ 128.0, Safari ≥ 18.5 |
| Operating Systems                  | Windows 10+, macOS 11+, Linux distros |
| Permissions                       | `webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage` |
| Host Permissions                  | `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` |
| Network Accessibility             | Able to fetch external resources and process webRequest events |

## 6. How to Verify Compatibility

To check whether your browser supports uBO Scope:

1. Confirm your browser’s version matches or exceeds the minimum requirement.
2. Review installed extensions permissions and ensure uBO Scope can request the needed access.
3. After installation, ensure the toolbar icon appears and reacts to network activity.

If any of these checks fail, update your browser or adjust permissions before proceeding with installation.

## 7. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

<Accordion title="Common system compatibility issues and solutions">

### Extension Not Installing or Loading
- **Cause:** Browser version too old or restrictive settings.
- **Solution:** Update your browser to the latest stable release.

### Extension Installed but Doesn't Show Data
- **Cause:** Permissions may be blocked or `webRequest` API events not available.
- **Solution:** Verify extension permissions, ensure network allows fetching, or check if privacy settings restrict extension activity.

### Safari Specific Limitations
- **Cause:** Some limitations in Safari’s extension APIs or version below 18.5.
- **Solution:** Upgrade Safari or consider using Chromium or Firefox for full functionality.

## 8. Next Steps

Once you have confirmed that your system and browser meet these requirements, proceed to the [Installing the Extension](../installation-and-setup/installing-extension) guide to set up uBO Scope.
