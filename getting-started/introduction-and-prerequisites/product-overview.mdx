# What is uBO Scope?

## Introduction

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to give you full transparency into **all attempted or successful network connections** your browser makes to remote servers during web browsing. It works alongside content blockers and can expose third-party connection attempts regardless of whether these requests are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked (hidden blocking). 

This makes uBO Scope invaluable for privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers who want to audit and understand the true network activity happening behind the scenes.

---

## How uBO Scope Works

uBO Scope integrates directly with your browser’s **webRequest API** to monitor network requests triggered by webpages you visit. It listens for connection outcomes in real time, classifying them into three categories:

- **Allowed:** Connections that successfully reach remote servers.
- **Blocked:** Connections prevented by your content blocker or other browser mechanisms.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were redirected or blocked quietly, without explicit notification to the page.

These outcomes are recorded per browser tab, allowing you to audit network activity on a per-site basis.

### Key Features:

- Works alongside any content blocker and respects its effects, yet provides an independent view of network activity.
- Provides a badge icon count showing the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** connected to by each tab.
- Breaks down network outcomes so you can see exactly which domains are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

## Why Use uBO Scope?

Imagine browsing your favorite website and wondering how many third-party services it contacts—CDNs, analytics, ads, trackers, etc. While content blockers might hide or block some of these, uBO Scope reveals every network connection attempt, helping you:

- **Debunk misconceptions** such as believing a blocker with higher block count is necessarily more effective.
- Verify **the actual number of unique third-party servers** your browser contacts, a crucial privacy metric.
- Audit stealth blocking, a subtle blocking technique content blockers use to avoid detection.
- Help filter list maintainers get accurate insight into real-world network requests.

## User Experience

When installed, uBO Scope visibly empowers you in two main ways:

1. **Toolbar Badge Count:** The extension’s icon displays a badge with a number representing how many distinct third-party remote servers were contacted in the current active tab. A lower number means fewer third parties accessed, which often corresponds to better privacy.

2. **Popup Interface:** Clicking the icon opens a detailed popup that categorizes and lists domains under “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked.” You see per-domain counts of connection attempts, enabling thorough auditing.

## Details from the Background Script

The background logic constantly monitors network requests using browser listeners:

- Captures events like redirects, errors, and successful responses on all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket URLs based on browser compatibility.
- Groups data by tab, tracking hostname and domain for the main frame.
- Updates the badge count dynamically as network activity occurs.

This ensures that the data you see in the popup accurately reflects the real-time connection status for each tab.

---

## Practical Scenario

_Scenario:_ You open a news website, and the uBO Scope badge shows “5.”

- Clicking the extension icon, you see the popup reveals 5 unique third-party domains listed under “not blocked.” These might be needed CDN or analytics domains.
- If you use a privacy content blocker that stealth-blocks some connections, those domains will appear under “stealth-blocked.”
- If some trackers were blocked outright, they appear under “blocked.”

This gives you actionable insight into what’s happening with your network requests, beyond what your blocker notifies you.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Understand Badge Counts:** The badge count reflects **unique third-party domains connected to**, not the total number of requests.
- **Use in Conjunction with Content Blockers:** uBO Scope does not block connections itself but shows outcomes influenced by your blockers.
- **Analyze Domains Carefully:** Not all third parties are harmful; some are essential services like CDNs.
- **Refresh Tabs After Installation:** To see accurate data, ensure your tabs reload after installing uBO Scope.

## Limitations and Browser Compatibility

- uBO Scope depends on browsers reporting network events via the `webRequest` API. Some browser restrictions or future changes might affect coverage.
- Some network requests made outside the browser's API (e.g., via native apps or certain extensions) are not captured.
- Support is included for major browsers like Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge), Firefox (desktop and Android), and Safari with appropriate permission scopes defined.

See the [Browser Integration & Compatibility](https://docs.example.com/overview/core-concepts-architecture/browser-integration) page for specifics on supported browsers and version requirements.

---

## Summary

uBO Scope is an essential companion tool for anyone wanting powerful visibility into their browser’s network connections. Through transparent, real-time reporting of all third-party remote servers contacted, it helps you monitor, audit, and ultimately improve your online privacy.

Start your journey by installing uBO Scope, then explore your network exposure tab-by-tab with confidence.
