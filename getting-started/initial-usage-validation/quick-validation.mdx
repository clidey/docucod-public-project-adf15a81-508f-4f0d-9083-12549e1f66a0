# Quick Validation Steps

This guide provides simple, practical checks and tests to confirm that uBO Scope is actively monitoring network connections and reporting accurate domain counts for the current browser tab.

---

## 1. Verify uBO Scope Badge Visibility

After installing uBO Scope in your browser, you should see the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar, typically near the address bar.

### Steps

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. Observe the badge number displayed on the icon.

### Expected Outcome

- The badge shows a number representing the count of distinct third-party domains contacted by the active tab.
- If there is no network activity yet, the badge may be blank.

<Tip>
If the icon or badge is missing, ensure the extension is enabled and visible in the browser's extensions menu. Refer to the installation guide if needed.
</Tip>

## 2. Confirm Domain Reporting for the Current Tab

uBO Scope tracks and reports the third-party domains connecting to the site open in your active tab. You can confirm this by opening the extension's popup panel.

### Steps

1. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup panel.
2. At the top of the popup, note the displayed tab domain and hostname.
3. Review the "domains connected" count near the top.
4. Inspect the lists under the three key categories:
   - Not blocked (allowed connections)
   - Stealth-blocked
   - Blocked

### Expected Outcome

- The popup shows the tab's current domain clearly.
- The "domains connected" count matches the badge number on the toolbar icon.
- Domains are listed under each category with the number of requests made.

<Note>
Domain names are shown in Unicode form for readability, using punycode conversion where necessary.
</Note>

## 3. Generate Network Activity to Test Real-Time Updates

To ensure uBO Scope is actively monitoring, navigate to a website known to connect to multiple third-party domains, such as a news site or a social media page.

### Steps

1. Open a new tab and go to a content-rich website.
2. Allow the page to load completely.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon again and observe the badge count and popup details.

### Expected Outcome

- The badge number increases reflecting distinct third-party domains contacted.
- The popup lists changes in allowed, stealth, and blocked domains accurately.

<Tip>
Refresh the page to see updated information. uBO Scope counts network activity related only to the active tab.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Tips">
<Accordion title="No Badge or Updates Show">
- Verify the extension is installed and enabled.
- Confirm browser version meets minimum requirements (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Ensure that no conflicting extensions block the webRequest API unobtrusively.
- Try restarting the browser.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Number Does Not Change">
- Confirm you are viewing the active tab and the extension popup.
- Check network activity on the page by opening the browser's developer tools Network tab.
- If the page has minimal third-party connections, the count may remain low.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty">
- Reload the tab.
- Ensure the extension has permissions as per installation requirements.
- Some tabs (like the browser's new tab page) may not generate connections.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding What the Badge Count Means

- The badge number represents the count of distinct third-party domains **allowed** or successfully connected by the tab.
- A higher number means more third-party servers were contacted; a lower number indicates fewer external connections.
- This count does **not** measure block counts or stealth blocking effectivenessâ€”it's focused on visibility of actual network connections.

## Summary

- Verify the uBO Scope icon and badge are visible and update correctly.
- Open the popup panel to confirm domain and connection counts.
- Perform actions on content-rich websites to trigger network activity.
- Use troubleshooting section to resolve common validation issues.

Ensuring these quick validation steps succeed confirms that uBO Scope is monitoring the network as intended for your browsing sessions.
