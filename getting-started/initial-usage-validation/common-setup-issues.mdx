# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

Encountering issues during installation or first use of uBO Scope can be frustrating. This guide addresses frequently reported problems such as missing toolbar badges, browser API limitations, and platform-specific quirks. Follow these practical troubleshooting steps to identify and resolve common roadblocks, ensuring uBO Scope operates smoothly in your browser environment.

---

## 1. Toolbar Badge Not Showing or Zero Count

The toolbar badge is your quick indicator of uBO Scope’s activity, reflecting the number of distinct third-party servers connected to a page. If the badge does not show or always reads zero, try the following steps:

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Verify Extension Installation**
   - Confirm that uBO Scope is properly installed from your browser's official store.
   - See the [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) page for installation methods.

2. **Check Browser Compatibility and Version**
   - Supported browsers and minimum versions are:
     - Chrome 122 or higher
     - Firefox 128 or higher
     - Safari 18.5 or higher
   - Running unsupported versions can prevent the extension from functioning properly.

3. **Ensure Appropriate Permissions Are Granted**
   - The extension requires permissions for `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`.
   - If these were not accepted during installation, remove and reinstall the extension.

4. **Refresh the Active Tab or Reopen the Browser**
   - Reload the current tab to generate fresh network requests.
   - A browser restart can clear transient issues.

5. **Validate Network Activity in the Tab**
   - Visit a website known to load third-party resources, such as a mainstream news site.
   - Use uBO Scope’s popup panel to check if domains are listed.

6. **Check for Conflicting Extensions**
   - Some privacy or ad-blocking extensions may interfere with network monitoring.
   - Temporarily disable other extensions to isolate conflicts.

### Troubleshooting Tips

If the badge still disappears after following the above steps, it might be due to browser API limitations or background service worker inactivity. Check your browser’s extension management interface to ensure uBO Scope is active and not disabled.

## 2. Popup Panel Shows "NO DATA" or Incomplete Information

The popup panel provides detailed domain connection information. Seeing "NO DATA" indicates failure to fetch tab-specific connection data.

### How to Fix

1. **Confirm the Current Tab Is Fully Loaded**
   - The extension collects data only when a tab is active and network requests are captured.
   - Wait for the page load to complete fully before opening the popup.

2. **Verify Browser API Support**
   - uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API to capture network events.
   - Some browsers or versions may report network requests differently, limiting data collection.

3. **Reload or Switch Tabs**
   - Data may be stale or orphaned if the tab was inactive or recently opened.
   - Switch to another tab and back, or reload the tab to trigger data collection.

4. **Check Background Script Status**
   - Service workers (background scripts) are responsible for processing network requests.
   - In Chromium-based browsers, verify the extension’s service worker is running.

5. **Review Console Logs for Errors**
   - Use the browser’s developer tools to inspect the console of the popup or background context.
   - Look for errors related to message passing or data deserialization.

### Common Pitfalls

- Opening the popup too quickly after a tab loads may not allow enough time to collect network data.
- Some network requests may be invisible to the extension if the browser’s `webRequest` API does not report them.

## 3. Browser API Limitations and Platform Specifics

uBO Scope is designed to operate with browsers supporting the modern `webRequest` API. Below are known platform-specific considerations:

### Chromium

- Requires Chrome 122 or newer due to Manifest V3 requirements.
- Uses a service worker as background script; this may unload when idle, causing brief lapses in monitoring.
- Badge and popup depend on active service worker and granted permissions.

### Firefox

- Requires Firefox 128 or newer.
- Uses a module-based background script.
- Most `webRequest` API features are fully supported.

### Safari

- Requires Safari 18.5 or newer.
- Uses Safari Web Extension model with strict minimum version enforcement.
- May exhibit subtle differences in event reporting latency.

### Recommendations

- Keep your browser updated to the latest stable version.
- Reinstall the extension if switching browsers or after upgrading the browser.
- On some platforms, experimental or developer builds may introduce instability.

## 4. Network Requests Not Reported or Underreported

Certain network activities may not be captured:

- Requests made outside the browser's `webRequest` API scope (e.g., native DNS requests, some WebSocket handshakes).
- Connections that bypass normal request routing such as pre-fetching or service workers.

### How to Verify

- Use the browser’s native developer tools network tab alongside uBO Scope to compare observed requests.
- Test network exposure on standard websites known for third-party content.

## 5. What to Do When Problems Persist

If you've exhausted these troubleshooting steps:

- Remove and reinstall uBO Scope to reset all stored data and permissions.
- Consult the browser's extension management UI for detailed error messages.
- Visit the [uBO Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) to check for open issues or submit a bug report.
- Refer to the following documentation for deeper insights:
  - [Prerequisites & System Requirements](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope#getting-started-installation-overview-prerequisites-system-requirements)
  - [First Run & Extension Activation](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope#getting-started-installation-overview-first-run-extension-activation)

---

## 6. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Always start your browser fresh when testing installation issues.
- Use websites with rich network requests (mixed first- and third-party) to validate uBO Scope functionality.
- Remember the badge counts **distinct third-party domains** - not total requests.
- Be aware that other content blockers may affect what uBO Scope can detect.

## Appendix: Quick Validation Steps

Using this checklist can help quickly verify if uBO Scope is working:

- Is the uBO Scope icon visible in your browser toolbar?
- Does the badge show a non-zero number when you visit complex sites?
- Does clicking the icon open the popup with domain lists?
- Do the domains correspond to expected connections from your current tab?

<Tip>
If you experience persistent issues, try reinstalling uBO Scope after restarting your browser. This often resolves permission and initialization glitches.
</Tip>

<Note>
Browsers implement the webRequest API differently, which can affect how uBO Scope reports data. Using supported versions of Chromium, Firefox, or Safari as specified ensures the best experience.
