# First Run & Interpreting the Interface

Welcome to your first session of uBO Scope. This guide walks you through what to expect when you load a website and open the uBO Scope extension popup for the first time. You will learn how to interpret the badge count, understand the categorized connection details, and grasp the difference between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections as reported by uBO Scope.

---

## 1. Opening uBO Scope on a Website

After installing uBO Scope, follow these simple steps to start monitoring your network connections:

<Steps>
<Step title="Load a Website">
Navigate to any website in your browser where you want to monitor network connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon">
Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser’s toolbar. This action opens the popup interface, revealing real-time data about the remote servers your current tab is connected to.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the badge on the toolbar icon shows no number (or is empty), it means no distinct third-party servers have been detected for the current tab yet.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count

The badge number you see on the uBO Scope icon represents the **number of distinct third-party remote servers your current tab has successfully connected to**. This count reflects connections allowed by any content blocker in place — a **lower number indicates a stronger privacy posture.**

- The badge updates live as network requests complete.
- It only counts unique, distinct hostnames (third-party domains).
- It excludes connections blocked at the network level or by content blockers.

<Note>
A common misunderstanding is to equate a higher block count with better blocking. uBO Scope clarifies this by focusing on allowed third-party connections — the real measure of exposure.
</Note>

## 3. Exploring the Popup Interface Elements

The uBO Scope popup presents connection data grouped by outcome status:

### 3.1 Tab Hostname and Domain
- At the top, the popup displays the loaded webpage's hostname (with any subdomain) and its root domain.
- This helps you recognize the origin of the current tab.

### 3.2 Summary Section
- Immediately below the tab title, you see a **count of distinct domains connected** to by the current tab across all categories.

### 3.3 Outcome Sections
There are three categorized panels showing domain lists:

| Category      | Description                                                       |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked** (Allowed)  | Third-party domains with successful connections.           |
| **Stealth-Blocked**         | Domains for which connections were redirected stealthily.  |
| **Blocked**                 | Domains for which connections were explicitly blocked.     |

Each section lists the domains detected and a badge indicating the number of connections made to each domain.

## 4. Detailed Connection Types Explained

<u>How uBO Scope classifies network requests per tab:</u>

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):**
  These are the third-party remote servers that your browser successfully connected to. A connection here indicates that the resource was fetched or allowed through content blocking filters.

- **Stealth-Blocked:**
  These connections were redirected or blocked stealthily by content blockers without outright erroring out or throwing visible signs. It means the server connection was altered or prevented in a way difficult to detect by the webpage.

- **Blocked:**
  These are outright blocked connections where the browser prevented network requests from completing due to content blocking or network errors.

<Tip>
Monitoring stealth-blocked domains helps gauge the subtle blocking strategies your content blocker uses beyond visible connection failures.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Interpreting the Connection Counts

Each domain listed in the allowed, stealth, or blocked section shows a count badge. This count represents the number of distinct network requests your browser made or attempted to that domain from the current tab.

- Higher counts next to domains often indicate heavier resource loading or repeated requests.
- Comparing counts across categories shows which third parties your content blocker affects most.

## 6. Example Walkthrough

Suppose you open the extension popup on a news site:

1. The badge shows "5", meaning five distinct third-party domains were contacted.
2. In the **Not Blocked** section, you see domains like `cdn.jquery.com` and `fonts.googleapis.com` with their respective counts.
3. The **Stealth-Blocked** section might list domains like `ads.example.net` indicating those connections were silently redirected or sabotaged.
4. The **Blocked** section shows domains such as `tracking.analytics.com` where requests failed due to active blocking.

This clear breakdown empowers you to understand what content your currently loaded page is connecting to and which connections your browser or extensions affect.

---

## 7. Tips for Effective Use

- Always check the badge count after loading or refreshing a page to see current distinct connection count.
- Use the popup’s categorized domain lists to identify unexpected or suspicious third-party connections.
- Combine your uBO Scope insights with your content blocker’s dashboard for comprehensive network control.
- Regularly revisit the popup on different tabs to build awareness of cross-site connection patterns.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting & FAQs">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge sometimes show no number?"><p>If the toolbar badge is empty, no third-party connections have been detected yet for the active tab. This can happen on pages that have minimal or no remote requests or if uBO Scope has not finished processing network data.</p></Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some domains appear in stealth-blocked rather than blocked?">
<p>Stealth blocking is a method some content blockers use to silently redirect or sabotage network requests without triggering explicit blocking errors. This avoids detection by websites but is reflected separately in uBO Scope's reporting.</p>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What should I do if the popup shows 'NO DATA'?">
<p>It may indicate that there is no recorded data yet for the current tab. Refresh the tab, ensure uBO Scope’s permissions are properly set, and try again.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="/getting-started/first-steps-and-usage/quick-validation-and-troubleshooting">Quick Validation & Troubleshooting</a> guide for detailed steps.</p>
