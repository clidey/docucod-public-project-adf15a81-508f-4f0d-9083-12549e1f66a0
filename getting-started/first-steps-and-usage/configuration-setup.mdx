# Basic Configuration Setup

Configuring uBO Scope immediately after installation ensures accurate, real-time visibility into your browser's third-party network connections. This guide walks you through essential permissions granting, toolbar pinning, and verification steps so you can start monitoring with confidence.

---

## 1. Verify Extension Permissions

uBO Scope relies on specific browser permissions to access network request data. After installation, the browser may prompt you to grant or confirm these permissions.

### Required Permissions:
- **`webRequest`**: To observe all network requests your browser initiates.
- **`activeTab`**: To focus monitoring on the current browser tab.
- **`storage`**: To save session data locally for improved performance.

### Action Steps:
1. When prompted by your browser, click 'Allow' or 'Grant' to enable these permissions.
2. If you do not receive a prompt, verify manually:
   - In Chrome/Edge, navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - In Firefox, go to `about:addons`
3. Locate uBO Scope in the list and click 'Details' or 'Permissions' to review or enable the required permissions.

<Note>
Without these permissions, uBO Scope cannot capture or report accurate connection data. Ensure permissions are fully granted.
</Note>

## 3. Confirm Access to the `webRequest` API

The key functionality of uBO Scope depends on its ability to listen to your browser’s network traffic through the `webRequest` API.

### Confirmation Steps:
1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup interface should show a loading state briefly, then display the hostname and connection summary.
3. Navigate to a website with various content (e.g., a news site).
4. Click the uBO Scope icon again; you should see details populated under these categories:
   - **not blocked**: Successful third-party connections
   - **stealth-blocked**: Requests intercepted without full blocking
   - **blocked**: Requests actively blocked

<Warning>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or fails to update:
- Ensure the extension has proper permissions as above.
- Reload the browser tab or restart the browser.
- Check for browser updates to meet version requirements.
</Warning>

## 4. Adjust Optional Settings (If Applicable)

Currently, uBO Scope has no complex user settings but future versions may add configuration options.

### Best Practices

- Periodically verify your browser’s extension permissions, especially after browser updates.
- Use regular browsing sessions to allow uBO Scope to build data for accurate reporting.
