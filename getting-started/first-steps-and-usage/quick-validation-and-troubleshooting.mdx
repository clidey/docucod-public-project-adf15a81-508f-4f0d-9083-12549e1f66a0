# Quick Validation & Troubleshooting

This page helps you rapidly confirm that uBO Scope is installed and operating correctly. You'll learn how to verify that the extension's badge updates as you browse, check the popup interface for live connection data, and troubleshoot common issues such as missing extension icon, permission problems, or unexpected zero counts.

---

## 1. Confirming uBO Scope Is Active

Before diving into detailed troubleshooting, ensure uBO Scope is installed, enabled, and visible in your browser toolbar.

### Step 1: Verify Installation

- After installation, locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar. It uses the uBO color scheme with the tooltip 'uBO Scope'.
- If you don't see it, ensure the extension is enabled:
  - In Chrome/Chromium: `chrome://extensions` or via Extensions menu
  - In Firefox: `about:addons`
  - In Safari: Extensions preferences

### Step 2: Pin the Extension

- Pin or enable the uBO Scope icon to keep it visible during browsing.
- In Chromium browsers, click the puzzle icon and pin uBO Scope.

### Step 3: Open the Popup Interface

- Click the uBO Scope icon. You should see a popup window showing the currently active tab's connection summary. This popup includes:
  - The domain name of the active tab
  - Counts of connected domains (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked)
  - Lists of domains categorized by their outcome

## 2. Validating Badge and Popup Data

The core value of uBO Scope is real-time reporting of third-party connections per tab.

### Step 1: Observe Badge Updates

- Visit websites with varied content (e.g., news sites, shopping sites).
- The badge on uBO Scope's toolbar icon will update to show the number of distinct third-party domains contacted and allowed.
- A lower badge number generally indicates fewer third-party connections.

<Check>
If the badge does not update or remains empty, proceed to the troubleshooting section below.
</Check>

### Step 2: Use the Popup Interface

- Reload a web page and click the extension icon.
- Verify that the popup:
  - Displays the correct domain in the header.
  - Shows three sections: ‘not blocked’, ‘stealth-blocked’, and ‘blocked’ connection domains.
  - Updates dynamically as network requests complete.

<Note>
Blocked domains indicate network requests the browser attempted but were prevented.
Stealth blocking shows redirects or subtle filtering by content blockers that are not visible as traditional blocking.
</Note>

## 3. Basic Troubleshooting

This section covers the fastest solutions to the most common startup problems.

### Issue: Extension Icon Does Not Appear

- **Cause:** Extension might not be enabled, or browser version is unsupported.
- **Solution:**
  1. Check your browser version against supported versions:
     - Chromium 122.0 or higher
     - Firefox 128.0 or higher
     - Safari 18.5 or higher
  2. Ensure the extension is enabled and not hidden.
  3. Pin the extension icon to the toolbar.

### Issue: Badge Never Updates or Shows Zero

- **Cause:** Permissions for webRequest API missing or blocked.
- **Solution:**
  1. Confirm uBO Scope has these permissions:
     - Access to all URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and WebSocket URLs)
     - `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`
  2. In your browser’s extension management page:
     - Confirm that you granted all requested permissions during installation.
  3. Restart your browser to refresh extension permissions.
  4. Visit multiple different websites after restart.

<Warning>
Some browser setups or privacy extensions/plugins may interfere with webRequest event reporting. Disable conflicting tools temporarily to test.
</Warning>

### Issue: Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Sections

- **Cause:** The active tab may not have produced network requests yet, or the extension is not capturing them.
- **Solution:**
  1. Refresh the current tab.
  2. Wait a few seconds after loading since network requests take time to register.
  3. Verify another tab with active third-party connections.

### Issue: Unexpected Lack of Data Despite Browsing

- **Cause:** Browser or extension caching issues or service worker termination.
- **Solution:**
  1. Reload the page and reopen the popup.
  2. Close and reopen the browser.
  3. Check for extension updates and install if available.

## 4. Quick Verification Steps

Use this checklist to confirm correct extension operation:

- [ ] uBO Scope icon is visible and pinned in the browser toolbar.
- [ ] Badge shows a numeric count while browsing.
- [ ] Popup lists domains under at least one of the three categories.
- [ ] Reloading a page updates the badge and popup data.

If any item is false, revisit the troubleshooting steps above.

## 5. Tips and Best Practices

- **Try Varied Websites:** Sites with a range of third-party content (news, e-commerce, social media) help confirm extension responsiveness.
- **Check Permissions Early:** Many function issues stem from insufficient permissions—ensure these are granted.
- **Reload Tabs for Fresh Data:** After installation or changes, refresh tabs to populate data.
