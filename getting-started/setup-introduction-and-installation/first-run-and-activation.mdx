# First Run & Activation

Get up and running with uBO Scope immediately after installation. This guide walks you through the essential first steps: enabling the extension, locating its toolbar icon, and understanding its status within your browser environment.

---

## 1. Enabling uBO Scope After Installation

Once installed from your browser's extension store, uBO Scope is typically enabled by default. However, to ensure that the extension is active and ready to work, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser's extensions or add-ons page:
   - **Chrome/Chromium:** Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - **Firefox:** Navigate to `about:addons`
   - **Safari:** Open `Preferences > Extensions`

2. Locate **uBO Scope** in the list.

3. Confirm the extension is toggled **On** or **Enabled**.

## 2. Finding and Using the Toolbar Icon

The key to immediate visibility is the toolbar icon — your access point to uBO Scope's data and controls.

### Locating the Icon

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar area near the address bar. It resembles the extension’s logo.
- If you do not see it:
  - Check your browser’s extension management options to pin or show icons by default.
  - In Firefox, use the toolbar customization via "Manage Extensions".
  - In Chrome, click the puzzle piece icon and pin uBO Scope for quick access.

### Icon Behavior

- The icon badge shows the **number of distinct third-party remote servers connected** by the active tab.
- A lower badge count indicates fewer connections to third parties.


## 3. Initial Activation Workflow

Getting started with uBO Scope is seamless:

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable the Extension">
Make sure uBO Scope is enabled as described in Section 1.
</Step>
<Step title="Open a Website">
Navigate to any webpage — uBO Scope immediately begins tracking network connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Toolbar Icon">
Open the popup panel by clicking the uBO Scope icon to view domain connection summaries for the current tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domain Summary">
Understand connected domains categorized by:
- **Not blocked (allowed) domains**
- **Stealth-blocked domains**
- **Blocked domains**
</Step>
</Steps>


## 4. Understanding Extension Presence in Your Browser

uBO Scope integrates smoothly without interfering with your browsing experience:

- It runs silently in the background, collecting network request data.
- The popup UI invoked from the toolbar icon provides clear reports per tab.
- Badge counts update dynamically to reflect real-time connection states.


## 5. Best Practices for First Use

- Test the extension on different websites to observe how third-party domains vary.
- Keep the toolbar icon visible for instant insights.
- Remember that the badge focuses on distinct third-party domains — it's a privacy transparency tool, not a blocker.


## 6. Troubleshooting Initial Activation Issues

### Extension Icon Not Showing

- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled in your extension settings.
- Pin the icon in your toolbar using browser controls.
- Restart your browser if the icon still does not appear.

### No Badge Count or Data Shown

- Confirm that you have visited at least one webpage since enabling the extension.
- Check browser permissions; uBO Scope requires `webRequest` and `storage` permissions.
- Reload the page and click the icon again.
