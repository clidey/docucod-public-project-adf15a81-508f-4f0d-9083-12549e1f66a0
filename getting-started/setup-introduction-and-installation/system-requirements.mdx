# System Requirements for uBO Scope

Understanding the system requirements and supported environments of uBO Scope ensures a smooth installation and optimal functionality. This page outlines the compatible browsers, minimum OS versions, and critical API dependencies that uBO Scope relies on.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Operating Systems

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with major modern browsers. Compatibility depends on the browser's support for the necessary webRequest APIs.

### Supported Browsers:

- **Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.)**
  - Minimum Chromium Version: **122.0**
  - Supported on Windows, macOS, Linux

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum Firefox Version: **128.0**
  - Supported on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- **Safari**
  - Minimum Safari Version: **18.5**
  - Supported on macOS and iOS


### Important Notes:
- The version constraints reflect the minimum browser versions that fully support Manifest V3 extensions and the required `webRequest` APIs.
- Browsers that do not meet these minimum versions will not be able to run uBO Scope correctly and may fail to load or present inaccurate network request reporting.

---

## 2. Core API Dependencies

uBO Scope relies heavily on the browser's **webRequest API**, which is essential for monitoring all network requests initiated by web pages. This API allows uBO Scope to capture and classify network activity such as allowed connections, redirect events, and blocked connections.

### Permissions Required:

- `webRequest` – intercept and observe network requests
- `activeTab` – interaction with the currently active browser tab
- `storage` – to maintain session and configuration data

These permissions underpin the extension's real-time connection monitoring and domain outcome classification.

**Note:** If a browser disables or limits the `webRequest` API (as seen in some emerging Manifest V3 restrictions), uBO Scope's effectiveness will degrade accordingly.

---

## 3. Platform-Specific Considerations

While uBO Scope is functionally consistent across platforms, each browser has particular caveats:

### Chromium-Based Browsers
- Requires Chromium 122+ to ensure compatibility with Manifest V3 service workers and host permissions.
- Supports monitoring of HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket (ws/wss) connections.

### Firefox
- Strict minimum version 128.0 for Manifest V3 support.
- Supports all requested URL schemes including ws/wss.

### Safari
- Requires Safari 18.5 or newer; older versions lack necessary manifest support.
- Uses a background script instead of service worker due to Safari limitations.

---

## 4. Host Permissions and URL Schemes

uBO Scope monitors requests matching these URL patterns:

- `http://*/*`
- `https://*/*`
- `ws://*/*` (in Chromium and Firefox)
- `wss://*/*` (in Chromium and Firefox)

**Note:** Safari's manifest does not include WebSocket host permissions explicitly and may have limited support for WebSocket monitoring.

## 5. Summary of Requirements

| Platform           | Browser Minimum Version | OS Supported           | Core Dependency       |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Chromium Browsers   | 122.0                   | Windows/macOS/Linux   | `webRequest` API, Service Worker |
| Firefox            | 128.0                   | Windows/macOS/Linux/Android | `webRequest` API, Background Script |
| Safari             | 18.5                    | macOS/iOS             | `webRequest` API, Background Script |

---

## 6. Why System Requirements Matter

Ensuring your browser and OS meet these requirements guarantees:

- Accurate and complete visibility into network requests
- Full feature set availability, including real-time badge counts
- Stable extension performance without unexpected runtime failures

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

If you encounter issues such as:
- uBO Scope failing to install
- Missing or inaccurate network connection data
- Errors relating to permissions or API availability

### Steps to Resolve:

1. Verify you're using the recommended minimum browser version or higher.
2. Confirm that the browser is updated to the latest stable release for your OS.
3. Check that uBO Scope extension permissions (especially `webRequest`) are granted.
4. Review browser release notes for changes to `webRequest` API usage or restrictions.
5. Consult the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/quick-start-usage-validation/basic-troubleshooting) guide for additional support.
