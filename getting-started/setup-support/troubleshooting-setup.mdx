# Troubleshooting Setup Issues

Ensuring uBO Scope is correctly installed and running is crucial to gaining accurate insights into your browser's third-party network connections. This guide helps you identify and resolve common setup problems such as missing extension icons, unexpected permission prompts, or absence of connection data. Follow these practical steps to reset the extension, verify browser compatibility, and get back on track.

---

## 1. Verify Extension Icon Presence

The uBO Scope icon must appear in your browser's toolbar to access the popup interface, which displays connection summaries.

### Steps to Check:

- **Locate the Extension Icon:** Look for the uBO Scope icon, often resembling the logo, near the browser address bar.
- **If Missing:**
  - In **Chrome/Chromium**, click on the puzzle-piece icon (Extensions menu) and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.
  - In **Firefox**, open the "Add-ons and Themes" panel (`about:addons`), find uBO Scope under Extensions, and enable the toolbar icon if hidden.
  - In **Safari**, ensure the extension is enabled via Safari > Settings > Extensions.

<Warning>
If the icon is missing after installation, the extension may be disabled or blocked. Reinstall or enable it following your browser’s extension management guidelines.
</Warning>

## 2. Address Unexpected Permission Prompts

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network requests. Unexpected or repeated permission prompts indicate a setup or compatibility issue.

### What Permissions Are Needed?

- Access to active tabs
- Ability to monitor web requests (`webRequest` permission)
- Local storage access for saving session data

### How to Verify and Resolve:

- Check the extension’s permissions in your browser's extension manager.
- Do not deny or revoke critical permissions; doing so disables network tracking.
- If prompted repeatedly, consider these actions:
  - Restart the browser.
  - Remove and reinstall the extension from the official store.
  - Ensure your browser version supports the permissions listed (see Section 4).

## 3. Confirm Connection Data Is Displayed

After installation and browsing some websites, the popup panel should show third-party connection counts and detailed domain listings.

### If You See "NO DATA" or Empty Panels:

- **Check Network Activity:** Open a website with typical third-party content (e.g., news or shopping site).
- **Open the Popup:** Click the extension icon to view the popup panel.
- **Verify the Summary Sections:** The panel divides connection results into 'not blocked,' 'stealth-blocked,' and 'blocked' domains.

### Troubleshooting Steps:

- Refresh the active tab or open a new tab to trigger network requests.
- Check if the toolbar badge updates; if blank, monitoring might not be active.
- Disable conflicting extensions that may block or interfere with web requests.
- Restart your browser to ensure the background script initializes properly.

<Tip>
Regular page navigation triggers network events uBO Scope monitors. Running tests on specialized or empty pages may result in no connections.

## 4. Verify Browser Compatibility and Version

uBO Scope supports major browsers but requires recent versions to ensure permissions and APIs function.

| Browser      | Minimum Version | Notes                                          |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Chrome**   | 122.0+          | Ensure Manifest V3 support and `webRequest` API availability.
| **Firefox**  | 128.0+          | Requires the strict minimum version for extension APIs.
| **Safari**   | 18.5+           | Enabled via Safari extensions with required permissions.

<Tip>
Confirm your browser matches or exceeds these versions by checking the 'About [Browser]' menu.
</Tip>
