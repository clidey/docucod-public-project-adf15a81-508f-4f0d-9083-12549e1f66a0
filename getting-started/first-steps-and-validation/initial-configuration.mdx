# First-Time Configuration and Permissions

Welcome to your first experience with **uBO Scope**, the lightweight browser extension that reveals all remote server connections your browser attempts or establishes. This guide walks you through the immediate steps after installation, clarifies any permissions uBO Scope requests, and explains what you will see on opening the extension popup for the first time.

---

## 1. Initial Permissions and What They Mean

Upon installing uBO Scope, your browser will request certain permissions required for the extension to function properly:

- **Access to activeTab:** To interact with the currently active browser tab and analyze its network requests.
- **Storage permission:** For storing session data and caching Public Suffix List information.
- **webRequest permission:** To listen for and monitor network requests made by web pages.
- **Host permissions:** Allow the extension to observe network requests for all HTTP, HTTPS, and (browser-dependent) WebSocket URLs.

> These permissions are necessary so uBO Scope can transparently report network activity in real time without interfering with page behavior.

### Browser-Specific Notes
- **Chrome & Chromium-based browsers:** Minimum Chrome version 122.0 is required. Permissions include HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket URLs.
- **Firefox:** Also tracks WebSocket connections; requires Firefox version 128.0 or higher.
- **Safari:** WebSocket tracking is not supported due to platform constraints. Requires macOS Safari version 18.5 or newer.

<Tip>
Granting these permissions enables complete network monitoring by uBO Scope. If you deny any, the extension will not be able to function correctly.
</Tip>

## 2. What Happens When You Open uBO Scope for the First Time

### Accessing the Extension Popup
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup interface. You will see:

- The hostname of the currently active tab, or 'NO DATA' if no network information is available.
- A summary section displaying the total number of distinct third-party domains connected to.
- Three outcome categories each showing domains:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains with successful network requests.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were redirected or blocked stealthily.
  - **Blocked:** Domains for which requests were explicitly blocked and failed.

### Badge Count on the Toolbar Icon
The badge number reflects the count of distinct third-party third-party remote servers connected for the active tab. A lower count usually means fewer external connections, often a desired privacy characteristic.

<Note>
This count only updates when there is network activity detected on the active tab.

## 3. No Configuration Needed to Start Using uBO Scope

**uBO Scope is designed for zero-friction first use.** There are no initial settings or preferences you need to configure before starting to see network connection data.

The extension automatically collects data on all relevant network requests the moment you open the popup, as long as permissions are granted.

<Tip>
For the most accurate results, avoid disabling any required permissions or restricting network access in your browser settings.
</Tip>

## 4. Understanding the Permissions You Granted

- **ActiveTab**: Lets uBO Scope interact with only the currently active tab to reduce footprint.
- **Storage**: Used to save session information and optimize repeated lookups, including a cached Public Suffix List.
- **WebRequest & Host Permissions**: Enables uBO Scope to listen to network requests made by the active tab’s webpage.

Should the extension be unable to listen to network events (due to denied permissions or browser restrictions), it will show minimal or no connection data.

## 5. Tips for Your First Scan

- Navigate to any website of interest.
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- Wait a moment for the popup to refresh and list connected domains.
- Review the categorized domains to understand what third-party servers the page connects to.

<Warning>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or question marks for domain counts:
- Confirm that the extension has all necessary permissions.
- Make sure the page is actively loading or recently loaded.
- Refresh the tab and reopen the popup.
</Warning>

## 6. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Not granting full permissions:** Without `webRequest` or host permissions, uBO Scope cannot monitor network activity.
- **Opening the popup on a blank or browser internal page:** No network requests will usually be detected.
- **Switching rapidly between tabs:** The popup updates based on currently active tab only; ensure the intended tab is active.

<Note>
Browser-specific restrictions may occasionally limit network request visibility, affecting the data shown.
</Note>

## 7. What to Expect Next

Once you’ve confirmed uBO Scope is functioning with your first interactions, you can:

- Dive into **Interpreting the Popup: Your First Scan** to learn detailed insights from the data.
- Explore **Troubleshooting Installation & Setup Issues** if you encounter any problems.
- Understand the **Badge Count** in detail to relate numbers to privacy impact.

These next steps will enhance your ability to use uBO Scope effectively for privacy awareness and filter list maintenance.

## Appendix: Where Permissions Are Declared (Advanced Users)

For those interested, here are where uBO Scope declares permissions in the browser manifest files:

- `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` are specified in manifest.json files per platform.
- Host permissions (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) enable monitoring all network traffic.

You can review platform-specific manifests in the `platform/chromium/manifest.json`, `platform/firefox/manifest.json`, and `platform/safari/manifest.json` files in the source repository.

# Summary
This guide sets up clear expectations about any permissions uBO Scope needs, confirms that no initial user configuration is necessary, and explains what users see upon first opening the extension popup. It emphasizes granting required permissions upfront for transparent network visibility and guides users on verifying they are ready to analyze connections.
