# First Run: Using uBO Scope

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with uBO Scope — the lightweight browser extension designed to give you transparent insights into all third-party connections your browser attempts or establishes during web browsing. This guide walks you through opening a website, launching the uBO Scope popup interface, and interpreting the connection statistics displayed, helping you grasp how network traffic is measured in real time.

---

## 1. Open Your Browser & Launch uBO Scope

Before starting, ensure you have installed uBO Scope according to the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/install-on-your-browser).

### Steps:

1. Open your preferred supported browser (Chromium v122+, Firefox v128+, or Safari v18.5+).
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser's toolbar. It usually appears as a small badge showing a number or an icon.

<Check>
If you don't see the icon:
- Confirm extension installation was successful.
- Check if the extension is enabled in your browser's toolbar or extensions menu.
- Refer to the [Troubleshooting Installation Issues](/getting-started/first-steps-and-validation/troubleshooting-setup) page.
</Check>

## 2. Browse to a Website

To observe uBO Scope in action, visit any website that makes remote connections. Commonly visited sites with third-party content (like news sites, social media, or streaming platforms) work well.

### Steps:

1. In a new browser tab, navigate to any website of your choice (e.g., https://example.com).
2. Wait for the page to fully load, allowing all associated network requests to complete.

<Tip>
Start with well-known websites to clearly observe diverse third-party connections.
</Tip>

## 3. Access the uBO Scope Popup UI

Once the site has loaded, interact with the uBO Scope popup UI to examine connection statistics collected during your browsing session.

### Steps:

1. Click the uBO Scope extension icon again to open the popup panel.
2. The popup will load and display several sections showing connection data.

<Note>
The popup UI may take a moment to fully render as it fetches data from the extension's background process.
</Note>

## 4. Understand the Connection Statistics Displayed

The popup interface organizes information into distinct categories reflecting the fate of the network requests made by the webpage:

- **Domains connected:** Displays the count of unique third-party domains with successful connections.
- **Not blocked:** Third-party domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or otherwise blocked without explicit errors.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts resulted in errors or were fully blocked.

Each category lists connected domains along with a badge showing the number of connection attempts.

### What to Look For:

- The number next to **domains connected** on the top summary shows how many unique third-party servers the site reached.
- A lower count here indicates fewer third-party connections, which typically implies increased privacy.
- Domain entries help you identify specific third parties involved.

<Callout title="Why is this important?">
The toolbar icon badge count matches the 'domains connected' figure, representing the distinct third-party servers your browser communicated with during the current tab session.
</Callout>

## 5. Example Walkthrough

Imagine you open `https://example.com` and then open the uBO Scope popup:

- The heading section will show the domain name.
- The summary reads "domains connected: 5", meaning five unique third-party domains were contacted.
- The **not blocked** section might list content delivery networks or analytics providers successfully loaded.
- The **blocked** section may list trackers or ad servers that were prevented from loading.

Understanding this split gives immediate insight into your browsing privacy profile and effectiveness of any content blocking in place.

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- **Refresh the webpage** if the popup shows no data or outdated info; uBO Scope tracks data live per tab session.
- Keep the popup open while browsing to see statistics update on page navigation or reload.
- Use the extension alongside your preferred content blockers for enhanced privacy insights.

<Warning>
Remember, uBO Scope reports connection attempts visible through the browser's webRequest API. Some network activity initiated outside this scope (e.g., WebSockets in some browsers, private DNS) might not be captured.
</Warning>

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues When First Using uBO Scope">
<Accordion title="The popup shows ‘NO DATA’ or is empty">
- Make sure you have navigated to a page with active network requests.
- Reload the webpage to trigger data collection.
- Check that the extension has the necessary permissions (see [Initial Configuration](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/first-setup)).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The badge count does not update as expected">
- Badge counts update per tab based on distinct third-party domains with allowed connections.
- If the count remains empty or zero, you might be on a page with no third-party connections or network requests blocked before the webRequest API can observe them.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I see domain names I don’t recognize">
- Many sites load resources from CDNs or third-party service providers.
- Use domain lookup tools or verify with known content to assess legitimacy.
- If concerned, use content blockers to control unwanted connections.
