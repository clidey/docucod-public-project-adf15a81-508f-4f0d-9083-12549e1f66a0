# Troubleshooting Initial Setup

If you are encountering issues right after installing uBO Scope, this guide will help you resolve the most common early problems. Each section provides precise steps to identify and fix issues related to missing badge counts, blank popup interface, permission errors, and installation failures.

---

## 1. Missing or No Badge on Toolbar Icon

The badge on the uBO Scope toolbar icon indicates the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected by the active tab. If you see no badge, it usually points to one or more setup issues.

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Verify Extension Installation and Activation**
   - Ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your browser's extensions/add-ons page.
   - Restart your browser to activate the extension fully.

2. **Confirm Required Permissions
**
   - uBO Scope requires `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` permissions.
   - Check permissions granted to the extension (see Basic Configuration guide).
   - For browsers that request permissions on demand, approve all required permissions.

3. **Check Host Permissions**
   - uBO Scope needs access to URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
   - If your browser prompts for these during installation or runtime, accept them.

4. **Test on Different Website**
   - Some pages might block or restrict tracking.
   - Visit a different, popular website to see if the badge updates.

5. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Make sure you are running a supported browser version:
     - Chromium 122.0 or later
     - Firefox 128.0 or later
     - Safari 18.5 or later

<Tip>
If the badge is still missing after following these steps, try disabling other extensions that may conflict with network tracking, such as other content blockers.
</Tip>

## 2. Blank or Empty Popup Interface

When clicking the uBO Scope icon, the popup interface should show details on remote connections of the current tab. A blank popup usually indicates data retrieval or extension communication problems.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Reload the Extension Popup**
   - Close the popup and reopen it.
   - Wait a few seconds for data to load.

2. **Check Active Tab Status**
   - Ensure the tab you are viewing is fully loaded and is a normal webpage, not a browser internal or special page.

3. **Verify Background Script is Running**
   - The background script collects and processes network request data.
   - Navigate to your browser’s extension debug page and confirm the background service worker (Chromium) or background script (Firefox, Safari) is running without errors.

4. **Confirm Data Availability**
   - uBO Scope relies on network requests captured by the background.
   - Open a new website tab, reload it, then check the popup again.

5. **Clear Extension Storage**
   - Rarely, corrupted data in extension storage causes issues.
   - Go to your browser's extension storage management and clear the data for uBO Scope, then reload the extension.

<Warning>
Do not close or suspend the background process manually as it is necessary for capturing network requests.
</Warning>

## 3. Permission Errors or Warnings

uBO Scope needs specific permissions to operate correctly. Permission issues typically prevent network request monitoring.

### What to Check

- **Permissions Request on Installation**
  - Make sure you approve the required permissions during extension installation.

- **Manual Permission Grant**
  - Some browsers allow you to grant or restrict permissions after installation. Verify permissions are not revoked.

- **Host Permissions**
  - Confirm that uBO Scope has the host permissions listed in the manifest:
    - `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, and `wss://*/*`

### How to Fix

- Reinstall the extension and accept all permission prompts.
- Check browser settings under Extensions > uBO Scope > Permissions and enable any disabled permissions.

<Info>
You can find detailed guidance on permissions and their importance in the Basic Configuration and Permissions document.

## 4. Installation Failures or Errors

Installation failures may arise due to browser version incompatibilities or incorrect installation sources.

### Remedies

1. **Confirm Browser Version**
   - Install only on supported versions:
     - Chromium 122.0+
     - Firefox 128.0+
     - Safari 18.5+

2. **Use Official Stores**
   - Chrome: [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
   - Firefox: [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
   - Safari: Install via official Safari Extensions mechanism

3. **Check Network Connectivity**
   - Ensure your browser can access extension stores and no firewall is blocking downloads.

4. **Review Installation Method**
   - Follow instructions precisely; manual sideloading requires extra steps and attention.

5. **Debug Installation Logs**
   - Use browser developer tools or extension debug pages to view error messages.

<Tip>
If installation problems persist, consider reinstalling your browser or updating to the latest stable version.
</Tip>

## 5. Common Additional Checks

- **Browser Updates:** Always keep your browser updated to avoid incompatibilities.
- **Extension Conflicts:** Disable other extensions temporarily to isolate issues.
- **Reload or Restart:** After updates or configuration changes, restart the browser.

## 6. Where to Get Help

- Visit the [uBO Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) for issues and discussions.
- Consult the Getting Started guides for installation, configuration, and first use.
- Explore feature overviews and core concepts pages for deep understanding.

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Quick Tips">
<Accordion title="Why is my badge count always zero?">
Check that the extension has all required permissions and that you visit normal websites with active network requests. The count reflects distinct third-party connections — legitimate sites or blocked pages with no network traffic produce zero.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup interface remains blank after clicking icon">
Reload the page you want to analyze, and ensure the extension background is running without errors. Clearing extension data may be necessary if a corrupted cache causes the problem.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission requests disappeared or were denied">
Reinstall the extension and explicitly approve all permissions. For browsers with post-install permission management, re-enable them manually.

<Accordion title="Extension fails to install or load">
Verify browser version compatibility and use official extension stores. Disable security or firewall software that could block installation.
