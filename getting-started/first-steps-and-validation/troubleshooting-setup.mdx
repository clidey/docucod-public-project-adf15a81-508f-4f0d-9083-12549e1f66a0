It also provides clear steps to reset or reinstall the extension to restore normal operation.

## 1. Extension Icon Not Appearing in Toolbar

If you cannot see the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar, follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm Successful Installation">
1. Open your browser's extensions or add-ons page:
   - **Chromium-based browsers:** Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - **Firefox:** Navigate to `about:addons`
   - **Safari:** Use Safari’s Extension preferences under `Safari > Preferences > Extensions`
2. Verify that uBO Scope is listed and enabled.
3. If it’s disabled, enable it and check the toolbar again.
</Step>
<Step title="Pin the Extension Icon to Toolbar">
1. Click the browser’s extension menu (puzzle piece icon in Chromium browsers).
2. Locate uBO Scope and click the pin icon to make it visible on the toolbar.
3. Refresh or restart your browser if needed.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Browser Compatibility and Version">
1. Ensure your browser version meets uBO Scope’s minimum requirements:
   - Chromium 122 or later
   - Firefox 128 or later
   - Safari 18.5 or later
2. Update your browser if outdated.
</Step>
<Step title="Restart Browser">
1. Sometimes, a quick restart resolves icon display issues.
2. Close all browser windows completely, then reopen.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the icon still does not appear, your browser might be blocking extensions from running. Check browser settings related to extensions or reach out to support forums for your browser.
</Tip>

## 2. No Data or "NO DATA" Message in Popup

When you click the uBO Scope icon and see 'NO DATA' or no domain listings, try these troubleshooting steps.

<Steps>
<Step title="Reload the Active Tab">
1. Refresh the webpage you intend to monitor.
2. uBO Scope captures network requests from page loads; reloading ensures data collection.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Permissions Granted">
1. uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor web requests.
2. Confirm the permissions accepted during installation:
   - Access to active tabs
   - Permission to use the `webRequest` API
3. In your browser’s extension settings, look for any prompts to grant permissions.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup After Browsing a Site">
1. Open a new tab and visit any website.
2. Switch to the uBO Scope popup quickly to observe recorded third-party connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Restart the Browser Session">
1. Close all browser windows.
2. Relaunch the browser and open a website to generate new network requests.
3. Open uBO Scope’s popup immediately after.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Ensure you visit websites with active network requests to third-party servers (e.g., sites with ads, CDNs). On minimal sites, no third-party connections may be present and thus no data shown.
</Tip>

## 3. Permission Errors or Restriction Warnings

If you encounter messages about missing permissions or that uBO Scope cannot track data, proceed as follows:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Extension Permissions">
1. Go to the browser’s extension permissions page.
2. Confirm that uBO Scope has permissions for:
   - `activeTab`,
   - `storage`,
   - `webRequest`, and
   - Host permissions for all `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` URLs.
3. If permissions are missing, remove and reinstall the extension (see section 4).
</Step>
<Step title="Allow uBO Scope to Run in Incognito/Private Mode (if needed)">
1. Some browsers require manual allowance for extensions to work in private browsing.
2. Enable uBO Scope to run in incognito/private mode via your browser’s extensions settings.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Running extensions in private mode may expose browsing activity; enable this only if you understand the privacy implications.
</Warning>
