# Making Your First Run with uBO Scope

This guide takes you through your very first experience with **uBO Scope** after installation. You will open a new tab, explore a sample website, and learn how to interpret the initial badge on the toolbar and the detailed popup panel that reveals your browser's connections. By the end, you'll clearly understand how to identify first-party versus third-party connections using uBO Scope, setting a solid foundation for monitoring your browsing privacy.

---

## 1. What to Expect in Your First Run

Once you have installed uBO Scope in a supported browser, it immediately begins monitoring network connections for each tab you open. Your first hands-on run will involve:

- Opening a new browser tab
- Navigating to a website (for example, your preferred homepage or a simple site)
- Observing the **badge icon** on the toolbar, which displays the count of distinct third-party domains your tab connects to
- Opening the **uBO Scope popup panel** to examine detailed connection outcomes

This process helps you immediately visualize the number of remote servers your browser interacts with, highlighting both allowed and blocked connections.

---

## 2. Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Step 1: Open a New Tab

- Launch your browser.
- Open a new tab using the browser's usual control (e.g., `Ctrl+T` or `Cmd+T`).

### Step 2: Visit a Website

- In the new tab, navigate to a website you choose.
- For clarity, consider starting with a well-known or simple page (e.g., https://example.com).

### Step 3: Observe the Toolbar Badge

- Look at the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser's toolbar.
- The badge number shows how many distinct **third-party** remote servers your browser has successfully connected to while loading the page.
- A lower count indicates fewer third-party connections, often reflecting higher privacy.

<Tip>
The badge **does not count first-party connections** associated with the website’s own domain. It counts only unique third-party domains contacting your browser.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

- Click on the uBO Scope icon to open its popup panel.
- The panel displays detailed lists sorted into three categories:
  - **Not Blocked**: Third-party domains where connections succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections silently blocked by stealth techniques.
  - **Blocked**: Connections explicitly blocked.

- Each domain entry shows how many connections occurred.

<Tip>
If the popup panel shows "NO DATA" or remains empty, reload the tab and try again to allow uBO Scope to collect fresh network data.
</Tip>

### Step 5: Interpret First-Party vs. Third-Party Connections

- The main domain of the site you visited is not reflected in the badge count.
- Third-party domains are those different from the site’s domain — typically CDNs, analytics, ad networks, or other external services.
- uBO Scope's counts and detailed lists help you differentiate these seamlessly.

## 3. Best Practices During Your First Run

- **Start simple**: Use basic websites to avoid confusion caused by complex analytics or ad networks.
- **Reload the page**: Ensure the popup is populated with recent data.
- **Check permissions**: If no data appears, confirm uBO Scope has necessary permissions (see _Initial Configuration_ guide).
- **Use multiple tabs**: Observe how each tab’s badge and popup data vary based on site content and network connections.

<Warning>
The badge count reflects **distinct third-party domains contacted** — it does not measure how many individual requests were made, only unique domains.
</Warning>

---

## 4. What Success Looks Like

- You see a number on the extension badge after visiting a page.
- Clicking the badge opens a popup showing allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains.
- The popup dynamically reflects connections made by the site.

<Check>
If these occur, uBO Scope is monitoring your browser's network activity correctly.
</Check>

If not, revisit the _Initial Configuration_ and _Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues_ guides.

## 5. Troubleshooting Tips for First Runs

- **No badge or no number:**
  - Ensure the extension is enabled.
  - Verify the browser version meets minimum requirements (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
  - Confirm permissions for webRequest and storage have been granted.
  - Reload the active tab after installing uBO Scope.

- **Popup shows no data:**
  - Reload the web page to trigger new requests.
  - Restart the browser if persistent.

- **Unexpectedly high counts:**
  - Some websites load many third-party resources; try a simpler site.
  - Review the domains listed in the popup to identify which third parties are connecting.
