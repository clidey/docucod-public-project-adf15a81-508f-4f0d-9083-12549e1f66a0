# Quick Validation Checklist

Ensure that uBO Scope is actively monitoring and accurately reporting third-party network connections with this practical checklist. Follow these steps to verify that the extension is installed correctly and functioning as expected.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation and Activation

- Verify that uBO Scope is installed in your supported browser:
  - Look for the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar.
  - The icon should display a badge (number) when network requests are detected.

- Ensure the extension has been activated:
  - After installation, permissions such as `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` should be granted.
  - See the [Initial Configuration & Permissions](https://docs.uBOscope/getting-started/installation-and-setup/initial-configuration) guide for details.

<Check>
If you do not see the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar, or if the badge never changes from blank, the extension may not be installed or enabled.
</Check>

## 2. Test Basic Network Monitoring

- Open a new browser tab.
- Navigate to any publicly accessible website (e.g., https://example.com).
- Observe the badge count on the uBO Scope icon:
  - It should display a number representing the count of distinct third-party domains connected during the page load.

- Click the icon to open the popup panel:
  - Confirm that the popup lists domains under these categories:
    - **Not Blocked** — domains from which connections succeeded.
    - **Stealth-Blocked** — domains for which redirects were intercepted or stealth blocking applied.
    - **Blocked** — domains for which connections failed (blocked).

<Check>
A zero count or an empty popup after browsing a site with external content might indicate an issue with monitoring permissions or extension functionality.
</Check>

## 3. Verify Badge Updates Reflect Activity

- While browsing different websites, observe if the badge count increases, decreases, or clears:
  - When you open a new tab or navigate to a new main frame, the badge count resets accordingly.
  - Connections to third-party servers during page loads update the badge to the new count.

- Tip: Some pages may have few or no third-party connections; trying different sites improves the test.

## 4. Check Permissions and Settings

- Go to your browser's extensions management page.
- Locate uBO Scope and review granted permissions:
  - `webRequest`
  - `activeTab`
  - `storage`
  - Host permissions covering `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` (and `ws://*/*` / `wss://*/*` in some browsers).

- Make sure no conflicting extensions are blocking uBO Scope from monitoring network requests.

## 5. Observe Toolbar Icon and Popup Responsiveness

- The icon badge text updates quickly after page navigation.
- The popup panel should open promptly and display the domain connection data.
- If the popup appears empty or does not reflect current activity, try restarting the browser or reloading the extension.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Badge does not update:**
  - Restart the browser.
  - Confirm all required permissions are granted.
  - Disable other extensions that might interfere with `webRequest` monitoring.

- **Popup panel shows 'NO DATA' or empty lists:**
  - Ensure you have opened a tab with an active main frame navigation.
  - Verify the extension is not disabled or restricted by browser policies.

- **Network requests outside `webRequest` API scope are not visible:**
  - Some web requests made by browsers internally might not be reportable.
  - uBO Scope only monitors network requests available through the browser's `webRequest` API.

## Simple Validation Test

Follow this quick test to confirm core functionality:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a New Tab and Visit a Website">
Navigate to a website with typical third-party resources, such as https://news.ycombinator.com.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Toolbar Badge">
Check the badge on the uBO Scope icon updates to a non-empty count of third-party domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel">
Click the icon and verify that the popup lists several connected domains under the "not blocked" section.
</Step>
<Step title="Navigate to Another Site">
Browse to another site such as https://www.wikipedia.org.
The badge count should update accordingly.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Success Indicators

- Toolbar badge shows a clear number after page loads.
- The popup panel displays domains under multiple outcome categories.
- Badge counts reset appropriately upon tab closure or navigation.
