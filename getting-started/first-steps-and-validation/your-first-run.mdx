# First Use: Launching uBO Scope

Welcome to your first encounter with **uBO Scope**, the browser extension designed to reveal all remote server connections a webpage makes. This guide will walk you through opening the uBO Scope popup for the first time, understanding what the badge count on the toolbar icon represents, and how to interpret connection details for the site you're visiting.

---

## 1. Opening uBO Scope’s Popup Interface

The extension adds an icon to your browser’s toolbar, which acts as the gateway to uBO Scope’s insights.

### Steps to Access the Popup:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon** in your browser toolbar—it displays the uBO Scope logo.
2. Click the icon **once** to open the extension’s popup panel.

> The popup interface is the central place where uBO Scope displays real-time network connection summaries for the active tab.


## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Icon Badge

On the toolbar icon, you will notice a small badge number. This count is crucial for quick privacy insights.

### What the Badge Number Means:

- The badge shows the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** currently connected to by the active webpage.
- A **lower badge count means fewer third-party connections**, which generally implies better privacy.
- The count only includes **third-party domains**, not the website’s own domain.

### Important Notes:

- Not all third parties are inherently bad. For example, legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs) often appear here.
- The badge updates dynamically as you navigate or reload the page.

<Check>
If the badge is empty (no number), it means:

- No third-party connections detected yet for the active tab, or
- The extension is still gathering data.
</Check>

## 3. Viewing Connection Details in the Popup

Once the popup is open, it presents a categorized summary of domains connected by the currently active tab.

### Popup Panel Structure:

- **Top Header**: Shows the domain and hostname of the current tab.
- **Summary Section**: Displays the total number of connected domains.
- **Connection Outcome Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains where connections succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections intercepted silently (e.g., due to redirects).
  - **Blocked**: Requests that failed or were actively blocked.

### Interpreting the Domain Lists

Each section lists relevant domains with a count of how many connections were made to each.

1. **Not Blocked**
   - These domains successfully connected.
   - You can investigate them to understand legitimate and third-party services used by the website.
2. **Stealth-Blocked**
   - These connections were redirected or suppressed covertly.
   - Useful to identify stealthy filter behaviors.
3. **Blocked**
   - Connections that failed or were blocked outright.

### Visual Example

```text
Tab Hostname: example.local (example.com)

domains connected: 5

--- not blocked ---
cdn.example.net    4
images.thirdparty.com 2

--- stealth-blocked ---
adtracker.xyz 1

--- blocked ---
adserver.badsite.com 3
```


## 4. What to Expect When You First Launch

- Depending on the website, the popup may initially display "NO DATA" or zero counts if no network activity has been recorded yet.
- After page navigation or reload, network requests will be captured, and the popup will update.
- The extension listens for network events in the background and aggregates the information per tab.

### Best Practices for a Smooth Start:

- Open uBO Scope **after loading the webpage** to see immediate network connections.
- Reload the page if no data appears initially.
- Keep the popup open to observe live updates when navigating.

## 5. Tips on Interpreting Initial Output

- The number of connected third-party domains often offers a privacy baseline for the webpage.
- A surprisingly high number might indicate many trackers or ads loading.
- Use the domain counts to identify frequent connections from the same third party.
- Reducing the third-party count (e.g., via content blockers) improves privacy but may affect site functionality.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Initial Viewing Issues

<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA or is Empty">
- Ensure uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled.
- Confirm the page has finished loading network resources.
- Reload the active tab and then open the popup again.
- Check browser permissions as explained in the Basic Configuration guide.

If problems persist, consult the Troubleshooting Initial Setup page.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- Make sure you are viewing the popup on an active tab with an HTTP, HTTPS, or WebSocket connection.
- Some pages with limited network activity may show zero.
- The extension relies on the browser’s webRequest API; verify compatibility.
- Restart your browser if updates stall.
</Accordion>

## 7. Next Steps

After you’ve successfully launched uBO Scope and observed its initial data:

- Review your [Quick Validation: Is uBO Scope Working?](../quick-validation) guide to confirm proper functioning.
- Explore the [Understanding the Popup Interface](../../guides/getting-started/understanding-popup) for detailed insights into the UI.
- Dive into the [Your First Analysis: Reviewing Connections](../../guides/getting-started/first-analysis) for practical use cases.

<Tip>
Remember, uBO Scope’s purpose is to give you transparency on connections, not to block or alter content. Use its insights to make informed decisions about your browsing privacy.
