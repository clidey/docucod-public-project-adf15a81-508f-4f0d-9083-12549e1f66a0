# Quick Validation Checklist

Ensure that uBO Scope is correctly installed and actively monitoring your browser's network connections by following this practical validation checklist. This guide helps you confirm that the extension is working as intended by checking the toolbar badge, domain lists, and popup panel statistics.

---

## 1. Confirm uBO Scope is Installed and Enabled

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
2. Verify the icon is visible and not disabled or hidden behind the overflow menu.
3. If you do not see the icon:
   - Check your browser's extensions page to ensure uBO Scope is installed.
   - Enable the extension if it is disabled.

<Check>
If the icon is missing, install or enable uBO Scope by following the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/install-on-your-browser).
</Check>

## 2. Check the Toolbar Badge Count

The toolbar badge displays the number of unique third-party domains your browser has connected to on the active tab.

1. Open a website in a new tab.
2. Watch the uBO Scope icon badge:
   - It should show a number representing the count of distinct third-party domains connected.
   - If the badge is empty (no number), it means zero detected allowed connections for the tab.

3. Try browsing to sites with third-party content (news websites, social media, or e-commerce) to see the badge update.

<Tip>
A lower badge number generally indicates fewer third-party connections, which is more desirable for privacy.
</Tip>

## 3. Open and Inspect the Popup Panel

The popup panel provides detailed breakdowns of third-party domains categorized by their connection status.

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
2. Verify the presence of the main site domain at the top.
3. Observe the **domains connected** count at the summary section.
4. Sections you should see:
   - **not blocked**: List of third-party domains from which connections were allowed.
   - **stealth-blocked**: Domains whose network requests were redirected stealthily (without user-visible block), indicating subtle blocking.
   - **blocked**: Domains whose network requests were explicitly blocked.

5. Ensure that these lists populate as you browse. For example, on popular sites, you should see several allowed and blocked domains.

<Note>
The displayed numbers and domain lists directly reflect real-time network activity from the current browser tab.
</Note>

## 4. Validate Live Monitoring Behavior

1. With the popup still open, navigate to a different website in the same tab or open a new tab and activate it.
2. Confirm the toolbar badge updates after page load.
3. Re-open the popup and check that domain lists refresh with new data.

If the extension is not updating:

- Make sure your browser version meets the minimum supported versions for uBO Scope (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Confirm you have granted all required permissions during initial setup.

## 5. Troubleshoot Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- Reload the current tab and watch for badge changes.
- Try disabling and re-enabling uBO Scope.
- Verify your browser supports the `webRequest` API the extension relies upon.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or 'NO DATA'">
- Make sure you have an active tab selected with network activity.
- Check that the extension has storage and webRequest permissions.
- Restart the browser in case the service worker or background script has crashed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension Icon Missing">
- Confirm installation from official sources following the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/install-on-your-browser).
- Check for conflicting extensions or browser profile issues.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Confirm Success

You have successfully validated that uBO Scope:

- Is installed and enabled in your browser.
- Updates the toolbar badge based on browsing activity.
- Displays domain lists in the popup panel categorized by allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.
- Monitors live network requests as you browse different websites.

<Tip>
Regularly review the popup panel during browsing sessions to maintain transparency about third-party connections.
