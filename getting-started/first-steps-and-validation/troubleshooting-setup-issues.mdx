# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This page helps you diagnose and resolve frequent issues encountered during the installation and initial configuration of uBO Scope.

## 1. Extension Not Appearing in Browser Toolbar

### Possible Causes
- Extension installation incomplete or failed
- Browser has disabled the extension
- Toolbar icon hidden or removed

### How to Fix
1. **Verify Extension Installation:**
   - Open your browser's extensions page:
     - **Chrome:** `chrome://extensions`
     - **Firefox:** `about:addons`
     - **Safari:** `Safari > Preferences > Extensions`
   - Confirm that **uBO Scope** is listed and enabled.

2. **Enable or Re-enable the Extension:**
   - If disabled, toggle the extension to enable it.

3. **Show the Toolbar Icon:**
   - Some browsers hide extension icons by default. Locate the puzzle or extensions icon on the toolbar and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.

4. **Reinstall if Needed:**
   - If the extension is missing, reinstall it from the official store:
     - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
     - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
     - For Safari, follow the Safari installation instructions in the Installation Guide.

<Tip>
Always install uBO Scope from official browser extension stores to ensure security and proper updates.
</Tip>

## 2. Badge Count Not Updating or Showing Zero

### Possible Causes
- Extension lacks necessary permissions
- Browser restrictions or conflicts
- No network activity detected yet or filtered incorrectly

### Step-by-Step Resolution

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Required Permissions">
Verify uBO Scope has the following permissions enabled:
- `webRequest`
- `activeTab`
- `storage`

**How to check:**
- In the extension details page, ensure these permissions are granted.
- Reinstall or re-enable permissions if missing.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Browser Version Supports uBO Scope">
- Ensure your browser meets minimum version requirements for uBO Scope:
  - Chromium-based browsers: version 122 or later
  - Firefox: version 128 or later
  - Safari: version 18.5 or later
</Step>
<Step title="Browse to Popular Websites">
Open common websites to stimulate network activity such as news sites or well-known portals. Observe the badge for changes.
</Step>
<Step title="Check for Conflicting Extensions">
- Disable other extensions that might interfere with `webRequest` API.
- Restart browser and verify if badge updates.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload or Restart Browser">
- Sometimes a browser restart is needed after installation.
- Reload the extension or browser if the badge remains inactive.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Sites without third-party connections will cause the badge to remain empty or zero — this can be normal behavior.
</Warning>

## 3. Missing Permissions or Errors in Browser Console

### How to Identify
- Open browser’s developer console for extensions:
  - **Chrome:** `chrome://extensions/` > Developer mode > Inspect views > service worker
  - **Firefox:** `about:debugging` > This Firefox > Inspect

- Look for errors mentioning permission denial or API blocked.

### Fixing Permissions
1. Confirm the extension manifest includes these permissions for your browser (they should be set by default):
    - `webRequest`
    - `activeTab`
    - `storage`

2. If your browser blocks or modifies permission granting (e.g., some corporate policies), adjust settings or ask your administrator.

3. Clear your browser cache and restart the browser if permissions change.

## 4. Extension Toolbar Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Empty Results

### Explanation
"NO DATA" means uBO Scope hasn't received data about current tab's network connections yet.

### What to Do
1. Reload or open a new tab and navigate to a website.
2. Make sure there is network activity from the page (third-party connections).
3. Wait a few seconds for data to populate.
4. Inspect the badge count—if it remains zero, see above badge troubleshooting steps.

<Tip>
Opening developer tools for the extension popup can provide clues if data fails to load—look for messaging or data parsing errors.
</Tip>

## 5. Extension Not Monitoring on Some Websites

### Possible Causes
- Browser privacy mode restrictions
- Site-specific permissions or policies
- Secure connection restrictions

### Suggestions
- Test uBO Scope on multiple sites with known third-party resources.
- Avoid using the extension in strict incognito or private tabs unless explicitly enabled.
- Verify your browser allows extensions to run in incognito/private mode (adjust in permissions).
