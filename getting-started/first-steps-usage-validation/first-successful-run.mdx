# Your First Measurement with uBO Scope

Welcome to the first step in using uBO Scope to gain real-time visibility into your browser's network connections. This guide walks you through navigating to a website, opening the uBO Scope popup interface, and interpreting the initial data it provides. You'll learn how to read domain connection summaries, understand badge counts on the toolbar icon, and get immediate feedback on third-party server connections.

---

## 1. Navigate to a Website

Begin your journey by visiting any website in your browser where uBO Scope is installed and active.

1. Open your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) where uBO Scope is installed.
2. Enter the URL for any website (e.g., `https://example.com`) in the address bar.
3. Allow the page to load completely.

<u>uBO Scope immediately begins monitoring all network connections initiated by this webpage during loading and interaction.</u>

<Check>
Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and you are not in private/incognito mode unless the extension is allowed there.
</Check>

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup

To view the measurement data for the active tab:

1. Locate the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar. The icon typically shows the uBO Scope logo.
2. **Click the icon once.** This opens the uBO Scope popup window presenting detailed information about network connections related to the current webpage.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the extension icon, check your browser’s extensions menu or pin uBO Scope to the toolbar for quick access.
</Tip>

## 3. Understand the Main Popup Interface

Once the popup opens, you will see structured information divided into sections:

### Hostname Display

At the top is the hostname (website domain) of the active tab:

- The hostname and domain are shown to help you identify which site’s connections you are viewing.
- If the full hostname differs from the main domain (e.g., `subdomain.example.com` vs. `example.com`), both are displayed.

### Summary Section

- Displays the number of distinct domains connected by the webpage.
- This count corresponds to the number shown as a badge on the uBO Scope toolbar icon.

### Connection Outcome Sections

Three main panels categorize connected domains by their connection status:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Connections that succeeded and were allowed without interference.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections prevented silently, typically via redirect or stealth techniques used by content blockers.
- **Blocked:** Connections actively blocked, usually by content blockers or network restrictions.

Each category lists domains with a badge count indicating the number of requests made to that domain.

### Domain Rows

Each domain entry shows:

- The domain name (decoded with proper Unicode representation if needed).
- A badge count showing how many network requests were made involving that domain.

This layout helps you quickly identify which third-party servers your browser connected to and how those connections were handled.

## 4. Interpreting the Toolbar Badge Count

The badge count displayed on the uBO Scope icon corresponds to the number of distinct third-party domains that successfully established connections during page load.

- **Lower counts** generally indicate fewer third-party connections, meaning less exposure to external servers.
- **Higher counts** indicate more third parties involved.

<Note>
The badge count reflects only "allowed" connections. Blocked or stealth-blocked domains are not counted in the badge. This helps you focus on actual third-party exposure.
</Note>

## 5. Practical Example

After opening uBO Scope on a popular news website, you might observe:

- A badge count of `5` on the toolbar icon.
- The popup lists:
  - Allowed domains like `cdn.news.com` with a badge count of `12` indicating multiple resources loaded.
  - Stealth-blocked domains such as `tracker.example.com` with a count of `3`.
  - Blocked domains like `ads.anothertrack.com` with a count of `6`.

This tells you the webpage loaded resources from five distinct third-party domains and blocked or stealth-blocked others, giving you a clear snapshot of your network exposure.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Popup & Measurement Issues">
<Accordion title="The popup shows 'NO DATA' or is empty">
- This indicates no network data is available for the active tab.
- Make sure you have navigated to a webpage and not a new blank tab.
- Refresh the webpage to trigger new network activity.
- Verify uBO Scope is enabled and has the required permissions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge count does not update after page load">
- The badge count updates dynamically after network requests have been processed; there may be a delay of a few seconds.
- Try switching tabs and returning to ensure the latest data is shown.
- Restart the browser or reload the extension if problems persist.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unexpected domains in allowed or blocked lists">
- Some legitimate services use third-party CDNs or APIs, which will appear as allowed domains.
- Blocked or stealth-blocked domains may be related to trackers or ads.
- Review your content blocker settings if you want to adjust blocking behavior.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. What to Do Next

- Repeat this process on other websites to compare network exposures.
- Use the detailed lists in the popup to identify and investigate unexpected connections.
- Explore other guides to configure uBO Scope for more advanced scenarios and understand its configuration options.
