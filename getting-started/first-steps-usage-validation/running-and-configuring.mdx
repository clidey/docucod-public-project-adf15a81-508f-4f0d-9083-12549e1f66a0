# Launching and Basic Configuration

This guide helps you launch the uBO Scope browser extension after installation and reviews essential default settings, permissions, and configuration notes to get you started smoothly with network connection measurements.

---

## 1. Opening uBO Scope for the First Time

Once you have installed uBO Scope from your browser's official extension store, the extension integrates immediately and begins monitoring third-party network connections.

### Step-by-Step Launch

1. **Locate the uBO Scope Icon**
   - Look for the uBO Scope icon on the browser toolbar. It appears as a small shield logo.
   - If not visible, check your browser’s extensions menu to pin or enable it.

2. **Click the Icon to Open the Popup Interface**
   - Clicking the icon opens the popup window which summarizes third-party connections per active tab.
   - The popup divides connections into three categories: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**, each showing the count of distinct domains.

3. **View the Toolbar Badge**
   - The badge number on the icon reflects the count of distinct third-party domains allowed in the current tab.
   - A lower count indicates fewer third-party connections, which generally correlates with better privacy.

<Tip>
Start by opening a few websites and observe how the badge changes. This real-time feedback is the core value of uBO Scope.
</Tip>

## 2. Default Configuration and Permissions

uBO Scope runs silently after installation, requiring minimal manual setup.

### Key Default Settings

- **Permissions Granted:**
  - The extension automatically requests permissions to monitor network requests (`webRequest`), access active tabs, and store data.
  - These permissions are essential to capture accurate network connection data.

- **Host Permissions:**
  - By default, the extension listens to HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and secure WebSocket requests to all hosts (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).

- **Badge Display:**
  - Badge text updates automatically based on live network activity to notify you of allowed third-party domains.

- **Storage and Session Management:**
  - uBO Scope stores session data locally to remember connection details per tab.

<Check>
Do not disable any permissions or host access; without these, uBO Scope cannot gather or display the connection data.
</Check>

## 3. Reviewing Permissions Prompts

When you first launch uBO Scope post-installation, your browser may display permission prompts.

### What to Expect

- The extension will request to monitor network traffic on all sites.
- Granting permission is necessary for the extension to capture all third-party connections reliably.

### Granting Permissions

- Accept requests promptly to ensure full functionality.

- If you declined permissions accidentally, revisit the browser’s extension settings to enable permissions manually.

<Warning>
Failing to grant full permissions will limit uBO Scope’s visibility into network requests, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete reporting.
</Warning>

## 4. Basic Settings to Review

uBO Scope is deliberately kept simple with essentially no user-configurable settings on launch to reduce friction.

However, some indirect settings affect behavior:

- **Browser Compatibility:**
  - Ensure you use a supported browser version as specified in the [System Requirements](../introduction-and-installation/system-requirements).

- **Content Blocker Coexistence:**
  - uBO Scope works alongside your existing content blockers. It does not block or interfere with connections by itself.

- **Session Persistence:**
  - Network connection data is saved per browser tab session and updated dynamically.

<Tip>
Since uBO Scope automatically updates its data live, you don’t need to adjust anything manually after launch to benefit from insights.
</Tip>

## 5. Using uBO Scope Immediately After Launch

Follow these practical steps to verify that everything is working:

### Step 1: Navigate to a Website

Open a typical website you frequently visit.

### Step 2: Check the Toolbar Badge Count

Note the number displayed on the uBO Scope icon’s badge – it reports the count of distinct third-party domains allowed.

### Step 3: Open the Popup to See Details

Click the icon:

- Confirm domains appear under the three categories, confirming that data collection is active.
- Modify browser tabs or reload the page and observe the popup update.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- If the badge shows no count and the popup reads "NO DATA," refresh the page or switch to another tab.
- Permissions might be missing; verify that uBO Scope has the required permissions enabled.
- Confirm you are using a supported browser version.

## 6. Next Steps After Launch

To deepen your understanding and usage:

- Explore [Your First Measurement](../first-steps-usage-validation/first-successful-run) to learn how to interpret your first real data run.
- Consult [Validation & Troubleshooting](../first-steps-usage-validation/validation-and-troubleshooting) if you face issues.
- Review key concepts in [Key Concepts & Terminology](../../overview/introduction-core-concepts/key-concepts-terminology) for clarity on domain and connection classifications.

## Summary

Launching uBO Scope post-installation is designed for immediate impact with minimal configuration required. The extension requests essential permissions automatically, begins passive monitoring, and displays live data on third-party network connections per browser tab. Users can begin analyzing their browsing exposure rapidly and confidently with live badge counts and detailed popup summaries.
