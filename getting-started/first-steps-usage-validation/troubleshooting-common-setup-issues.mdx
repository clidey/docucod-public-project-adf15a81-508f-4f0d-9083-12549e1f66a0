# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve frequent issues encountered during uBO Scope installation and configuration. Whether your extension’s icon is missing, the extension does not record data, or the badge count does not update as expected, the following practical solutions will guide you step-by-step to diagnose and fix these problems.

## 1. The uBO Scope Toolbar Icon Is Missing or Not Displayed

If you cannot see the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar after installation, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Confirm Installation
- Verify that uBO Scope appears in your browser’s extension manager/list.
- Ensure you installed uBO Scope from an official source:
  - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

### Step 2: Pin the Extension to the Toolbar
- Some browsers hide newly installed extensions by default.
- In Chrome/Edge: Click the puzzle icon > find uBO Scope > pin it to the toolbar.
- In Firefox: Click the overflow menu or customize toolbar > drag uBO Scope icon to the toolbar.

### Step 3: Verify Browser Version Compatibility
- uBO Scope requires minimum browser versions: Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+.
- Update your browser to the latest stable version.

### Step 4: Check for Conflicting Extensions
- Temporarily disable other extensions that manipulate toolbar icons.
- Restart the browser to see if the icon reappears.

<Tip>
If the icon still does not appear, try removing and reinstalling uBO Scope, then restart your browser.
</Tip>

## 2. The Extension Is Installed but Not Recording or Showing Network Data

If your uBO Scope icon appears but it does not reflect any collected data or the popup shows 'NO DATA', apply these troubleshooting steps:

### Step 1: Verify Permissions
- uBO Scope relies on browser permissions `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`.
- Ensure these permissions are granted during installation.
- You can check this in your browser’s extension manager under Permissions.

### Step 2: Check Host Permissions
- Make sure the extension has permission to observe network requests to all URLs.
- uBO Scope requests host permissions for `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, and `ws://*/*`.
- Some browsers prompt you to review and accept these permissions after installation.

### Step 3: Reload the Current Tab
- Because uBO Scope monitors network requests in real time, refresh currently open tabs to allow data collection to start.

### Step 4: Confirm Extension Service Worker or Background Script Is Running
- In Chromium browsers, open `chrome://extensions/` > uBO Scope details > inspect background page or service worker console for errors.
- In Firefox, use `about:debugging` to inspect the extension background.

### Step 5: Check Browser Network Request API Support
- uBO Scope depends on the browser’s `webRequest` API.
- Confirm that no browser settings or policies disable monitoring.

<Tip>
If you're using strict privacy settings or other network filtering extensions, ensure they don't block or interfere with uBO Scope's network monitoring.
</Tip>

## 3. Badge Count on the Toolbar Icon Does Not Update or Shows Zero

The badge count shows the number of distinct third-party domains contacted by the current tab. If this badge count does not update, try the following:

### Step 1: Confirm Tab Focus
- uBO Scope updates the badge based on the active tab's network connections.
- Ensure you have selected and interacted with a web page in the tab.

### Step 2: Refresh the Tab to Restart Monitoring
- The badge count resets on navigation.
- Reload the page to trigger fresh request recording.

### Step 3: Wait for Data Collection
- Badge updates may take a few seconds after loading to reflect network connections.
- Wait briefly after navigation.

### Step 4: Disable Conflicting Extensions
- Some extensions might interfere with network monitoring or badge updates.
- Temporarily disable other content blockers or similar tools.

### Step 5: Restart Your Browser
- In some cases, browser sessions or extension processes encounter glitches.
- Restarting the browser resets extension state.

## 4. Common Tips and Best Practices

- **Keep uBO Scope Updated:** Always use the latest version to benefit from bug fixes.
- **Use Supported Browsers:** The extension is tested and supported on recent Chrome, Firefox, and Safari versions.
- **Understand Badge Counts:** A low badge count implies fewer third-party connections, not necessarily fewer blocked requests.
- **Review Extension Settings:** Although uBO Scope has minimal configuration, ensure settings from `Initial Configuration` are complete.
