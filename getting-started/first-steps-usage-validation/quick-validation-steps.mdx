# Quick Validation: Is uBO Scope Working?

Ensure your uBO Scope extension is correctly capturing and displaying third-party remote server connections with this straightforward validation guide. This single-page checklist helps you rapidly confirm successful operation after installation.

---

## 1. Confirm uBO Scope Installation and Active Status

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar. It should appear as the extension's logo.

2. Verify the icon badge displays a number or is blank (when zero).

3. If the icon is missing, revisit the installation instructions or troubleshooting documentation to reinstall or show the extension.


<Check>
If the uBO Scope icon is missing, check your browser's extension management page and ensure the extension is enabled.
</Check>

## 2. Open uBO Scope Popup to View Active Data

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup interface.

2. Observe the heading at the top. It should display your current tab's hostname and primary domain.

3. Look at the “domains connected” count summary — it shows how many distinct third-party domains uBO Scope has detected connections to for the active tab.

4. Review the three categories listing domains:
   - **Not Blocked**: Third-party domains from which resources loaded successfully.
   - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains whose connection attempts were stealthily blocked.
   - **Blocked**: Domains with blocked connections.

<Note>
The badge count on the toolbar icon corresponds to the count of distinct third-party domains in the 'Not Blocked' category.
</Note>

## 3. Validate Badge and Popup Consistency

1. Open any website known to load third-party resources (e.g., news sites, social networks).

2. Click the uBO Scope icon and verify the popup updates with domain data relevant to that page.

3. Ensure the badge count reflects the number of domains listed under "Not Blocked".

4. Navigate between multiple tabs and observe that the data corresponds to the active tab.

<Warning>
If badge count or popup data appears static or empty despite normal browsing activity, data capture is not working properly.
Refer to troubleshooting guidance.
</Warning>

## 4. Perform a Basic Troubleshooting Check

- Refresh the current active tab to trigger new network requests.
- Wait a few seconds for data to gather, then reopen the popup.
- Confirm the popup shows updated connections.
- If still no data, confirm necessary permissions are granted (webRequest, activeTab, storage).


## 5. Recommended Simple Tasks to Confirm Operation

- Visit a site with embedded videos or social widgets and check the 'allowed' third-party domains increase.
- Visit another domain and verify the popup resets to show data for the new tab.

## Summary

| Indicator                  | Expected Result                                  |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Toolbar icon presence       | Visible with the uBO Scope logo                   |
| Toolbar badge               | Number or blank (zero) reflecting active data    |
| Popup hostname display      | Shows active tab's hostname and domain            |
| Domains listing             | Populated with allowed, stealth, and blocked sets|
| Badge and popup consistency | Badge matches ‘Not Blocked’ domains count         |

---

## Additional Tips

- The badge never counts first-party domains—only third-party remote servers.
- A lower badge count indicates fewer distinct third-party connections, generally better for privacy.
- Remember that uBO Scope reflects actual network events as the browser reports them; some network activity might not be visible due to browser or extension limitations.

## Troubleshooting Quick Checks

- Make sure the browser version supports the extension (typically Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Verify uBO Scope has access to webRequest permissions.
- Refresh tabs to allow new network requests to be captured.
- Restart the browser if data isn't updating after attempts.
