# Accessing the Popup & Verifying Installation

This guide will walk you through opening the uBO Scope popup in your browser, understanding the data it shows, and verifying that the extension is actively monitoring network connections as expected. By following these practical steps, you’ll quickly confirm that uBO Scope is working to reveal all third-party remote server connections made by your current web page.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

The popup UI is the primary interface where uBO Scope reports on the third-party connections made by the active browser tab.

### Steps to Open the Popup

1. **Locate the uBO Scope toolbar icon:**
   - This icon appears in the browser's extension area, usually near the address bar.
   - The icon’s badge number shows the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected to by the current tab.

2. **Click the uBO Scope icon:**
   - This opens a small popup window displaying detailed connection data for the current tab.

3. **Confirm the popup loads:**
   - The popup includes the hostname of the active tab and a summary of connected domains categorized by their connection outcome.

<Tip>
If the popup does not open or shows "NO DATA," try reloading the active tab or verifying your extension installation (see Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues).
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface

The popup summarizes remote connections in three categories with counts and domain lists:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which resources were successfully loaded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with redirected or stealth-blocked connections.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were blocked or failed.

### Popup Components Explained

- **Hostname Display:** Shows the active tab's hostname and its domain (converted to Unicode for display).
  - For example, if browsing `news.example.com`, you’ll see the subdomain (`news.`) and main domain (`example.com`) portion.

- **Domains Connected:** A numeric summary at the top indicating the total count of distinct third-party domains connected.

- **Outcome Sections:** Three collapsible areas each listing domains grouped by connection status with a count of requests.

### Practical Example

| Outcome       | Meaning                    | What You See in Popup                               |
|---------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Allowed       | Connections allowed        | Domains like `cdn.example.net` with counts         |
| Stealth-Blocked | Redirected or hidden blocks | Domains you do not see in your traffic but were contacted |
| Blocked       | Connections blocked/fail   | Domains prevented from connecting by your content blockers |

This helps you quickly identify which third-party servers webpages connect to and how your content blocker settings affect these connections.

## 3. How the Badge Count Works

uBO Scope's badge count on the toolbar icon reflects the **number of distinct allowed third-party domains** connected to by the current tab.

- A **lower badge count** indicates fewer third-party connections, often desirable for privacy.
- The badge updates in real-time as you navigate and reload pages.

<Tip>
Do not interpret the badge count as a 'block count' — it reflects allowed third parties, helping assess privacy exposure effectively.
</Tip>

## 4. Verifying uBO Scope is Functioning

Follow these steps to confirm uBO Scope is actively monitoring connections:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check the Badge Count">
- Visit a website with known third-party resources (e.g., news or social media sites).
- Note the badge number on the uBO Scope icon. It should be a numeric value (or empty if no connections).
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup and Inspect Domains">
- Click the icon to open the popup.
- Confirm you see the tab's hostname at the top.
- Review the lists under 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' to see connected domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload the Tab and Observe Changes">
- Refresh the active webpage.
- Watch the badge update and the popup domain lists refresh accordingly.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify No Errors in Console">
- If comfortable, open the browser developer console on the popup page.
- Confirm there are no errors related to the extension.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
If the badge stays empty, or the popup shows no data, verify the extension is enabled and properly installed (see Installation Instructions and Troubleshooting).
</Check>

## 5. Common Scenarios and What to Expect

| Scenario                           | Expected Behavior                                 |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Browsing a site with many third parties | Badge shows a higher number; popup lists multiple domains under allowed and possibly blocked. |
| Visiting a site with no third parties | Badge shows empty; popup lists 'NO DATA' or minimal entries. |
| Using a restrictive content blocker | Badge count should be lower; 'blocked' and 'stealth-blocked' sections show relevant domains. |

## 6. Troubleshooting Tips

### Popup Does Not Open or Shows "NO DATA"
- Ensure uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled in your browser.
- Reload the current tab or open a new tab.
- Check browser permissions: the extension requires `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and storage permissions.

### Badge Count Does Not Update
- Reload the webpage to trigger fresh network request monitoring.
- Check for browser updates or restart the browser.

### Data Seems Incomplete
- uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API which might have limitations based on browser version or settings.

<Tip>
For persistent issues, consult the Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues page or the official GitHub repository issues for support.
