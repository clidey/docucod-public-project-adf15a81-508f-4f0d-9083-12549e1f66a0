# Quick Validation: Is uBO Scope Working?

This guide walks you through straightforward steps to confirm that uBO Scope is actively monitoring remote connections in your browser immediately after installation. By following these instructions, you will learn how to open the extension popup, understand the badge counts on the toolbar icon, interpret connection categories, and review lists of remote servers contacted by the currently active tab.

---

## 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar. It displays the extension's logo.
2. Click the icon to open the popup window.
3. The popup will show details for the currently active browser tab, including the hostname and the number of unique remote domains connected.

> The popup provides instant insight into network activity on the current tab without navigating away or opening developer tools.

## 2. Understand the Toolbar Badge

- The badge shows a **count** representing the number of distinct third-party remote servers your current tab has connected to.
- A lower badge count generally indicates fewer external connections, which is desirable for privacy.
- The badge count reflects allowed remote servers only; it does not count blocked or stealth-blocked domains.

> Note: The count updates dynamically as your tab loads and network requests complete.

## 3. Interpreting Connection Outcomes in the Popup

The popup organizes remote servers contacted into three outcome categories:

| Outcome        | Meaning                                                  | Visual Cue                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Not Blocked**  | Connections that were allowed to succeed                   | Green highlight and badge area   |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Requests blocked in a way that is hidden from webpages   | Red highlight and badge area     |
| **Blocked**      | Requests that were explicitly blocked and reported         | Red highlight and badge area     |

### What You See:
- Each category lists remote server domains with a count of requests made.
- Domains are sorted alphabetically for easy scanning.
- The total number of domains connected to the current tab is shown at the top.

> This clear separation helps you quickly assess the nature of your tab's web connections.

## 4. Review the List of Remote Servers Per Tab

- The popup lists domains contacted only for the active browser tab.
- To check another tab’s connections, switch to that tab and reopen the popup.
- The extension uses the public suffix list to accurately group hosts by domain.

> This makes domain grouping consistent with widely accepted rules, so you get reliable domain classifications.

## Practical Steps to Confirm uBO Scope Activity

<Steps>
<Step title="Ensure uBO Scope Is Installed and Active">
- Confirm that uBO Scope is installed from your browser's official extension store.
- Verify the icon is visible in the toolbar.
- If missing, review the [Installing uBO Scope guide](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/installation).
</Step>
<Step title="Open a New Website Tab">
- Open a new tab and navigate to a commonly used website (e.g., example.com).
- This generates network traffic for uBO Scope to monitor.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon">
- Click the extension icon to open the popup.
- You should see the tab’s hostname displayed prominently at the top.
- The badge on the icon updates with the count of connected third-party domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine the Connection Outcome Sections">
- Look under the "not blocked" section to see servers your browser connected to successfully.
- Check "stealth-blocked" and "blocked" sections for any blocked domains.
- If these sections are empty, the tab might have no blocked connections or uBO Scope is freshly installed.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Badge Count Matches Domains">
- The number on the badge corresponds exactly to the number of unique allowed domains listed.
- If zero, try refreshing the page to trigger network requests.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting Common Verification Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup & Badge Verification">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Empty">
- Confirm the tab is fully loaded; incomplete loading may delay data.
- Refresh the tab to generate fresh network activity.
- Ensure that the extension has proper permissions (activeTab, webRequest).
- See the [Troubleshooting Installation & First Run Issues guide](/getting-started/first-steps-usage-validation/troubleshooting) for detailed steps.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update or Shows Zero">
- The badge counts only unique allowed third-party domains per tab.
- Some pages with no or minimal third-party content will have zero badge count.
- Make sure content blockers or DNS filters you use don’t block all network requests, limiting the data uBO Scope can track.
- Restart your browser to refresh extension activity.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains Are Missing or Data Seems Incorrect">
- uBO Scope relies on the browser’s webRequest API. Network requests made outside this API scope won’t be tracked.
- Some special protocols or local files are not monitored.
- Validate by comparing with browser developer tools network tab.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How Does This Fit In the Bigger Picture?

This quick validation complements the [Initial Launch & Configuration guide](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/first-launch) where you first set up uBO Scope and learn about its UI. For deeper understanding of what these network connections represent, refer to [How uBO Scope Monitors Connections](/getting-started/first-steps-usage-validation/how-it-works) and explore best practices in the [Best Practices guide](/guides/exploring-network-insight-workflows/best-practices-content-blockers).

---

## Summary

By completing this verification you have ensured that uBO Scope is:

- Running correctly with active monitoring enabled.
- Accurately showing the number of distinct third-party domains connected per browser tab.
- Categorizing connection outcomes to help you understand your exposure online.

You’re now ready to start using uBO Scope to gain transparent insights into your browsing connections.
