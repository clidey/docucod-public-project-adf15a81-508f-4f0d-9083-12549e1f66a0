# Troubleshooting Installation & First Run Issues

A concise guide to resolving common obstacles encountered during the installation or initial operation of **uBO Scope**. This page focuses on permissions, browser compatibility, missing UI elements, or lack of detected network activity. Each section provides practical, step-by-step instructions for quick diagnostics and effective remedies.

---

## 1. Verify Browser Compatibility and Version

uBO Scope supports the latest major browsers with specific minimum version requirements to leverage essential WebExtensions APIs for accurate monitoring.

### Supported Browsers & Minimum Versions

- **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)**: Version 122 or later
- **Mozilla Firefox**: Version 128 or later
- **Safari**: Version 18.5 or later

> If your browser version is below these thresholds, the extension may not function correctly or could fail to load.

### How to Check Your Browser Version

1. Open your browser.
2. Navigate to the About page (e.g., `chrome://settings/help`, `about:support`, or Safari > About Safari).
3. Confirm that your version meets or exceeds the requirement.

### Upgrade Browser if Needed

- Update your browser to the latest stable release from the official source to ensure compatibility.

## 2. Confirm uBO Scope Installation and Permissions

Proper installation and granted permissions are critical for uBO Scope to monitor your network activity.

### Steps to Verify Installation

1. Locate the **uBO Scope** icon in your browser toolbar.
2. Click the icon to open the popup UI.
   - If the icon or popup does not appear, the installation may be incomplete or disabled.

### Permissions to Check

uBO Scope requires the following permissions as per its manifest configuration:

- `activeTab`
- `storage`
- `webRequest`
- `host_permissions` covering `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` (plus WebSocket URLs on Firefox)

### How to Check and Enable Permissions

1. Open your browser’s extension management page (e.g., `chrome://extensions`, `about:addons`).
2. Find **uBO Scope** and click on **Details**.
3. Verify that it has permission to access websites and network requests.
4. If any are disabled, toggle them on and reload the extension.

<Tip>
Permissions are what enable uBO Scope to access HTTP and WebSocket traffic information. Missing permissions will prevent any network data collection.
</Tip>

## 3. Troubleshoot Missing or Empty Popup UI

If the popup UI opens but shows 'NO DATA' with no domain counts or details, proceed with these checks.

### Step 1: Reload the Active Tab

- Refresh the active browser tab to allow uBO Scope to capture new network requests.
- After reload, open the popup and check for updated connection data.

### Step 2: Check Network Activity

uBO Scope only reports network requests observable via browser APIs.

- Try browsing to a site known for loading external resources (e.g., a news website).
- Wait a few seconds, then check whether the popup badge shows a count and the domains list populates.

### Step 3: Confirm Extension Background Activity

- In Chromium browsers, ensure the service worker (`background.js`) is active.
- Go to `chrome://serviceworker-internals/` or equivalent and check the uBO Scope worker status.

### Step 4: Verify No Conflicting Extensions

- Disable other extensions that might interfere with WebRequest APIs or content blocking.
- Restart your browser and retry.

<Warning>
Some privacy and security extensions may restrict or block access to network request information, causing uBO Scope to fail to detect activity.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Addressing Permissions Issues on Safari

Safari imposes stricter version and permission controls, requiring special attention.

### Minimum Version Requirement

- Safari 18.5 or later is mandatory for uBO Scope to function correctly.

### Permission Settings

- Open Safari > Preferences > Extensions
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
- Verify permissions allow the extension to access websites and network data.

### Troubleshooting

- If the extension appears inactive, uninstall and reinstall from the official source.
- Restart Safari after installation and permission changes.

---

## 5. Verify Toolbar Badge Behavior

The badge on the toolbar icon visually communicates the number of unique third-party remote servers connected.

### What the Badge Indicates

- A numeric count representing the distinct allowed third-party domains connected from the active tab.
- No number or an empty badge means no third-party connections detected.

### If Badge is Absent

- Ensure active tab has network requests with third-party domains.
- Confirm extension permissions and background script are running.
- Reload the page or the browser.

<Tip>
A lower badge count is better as it indicates fewer third-party connections, which aligns with uBO Scope’s purpose of revealing connections, not blocking them.
</Tip>

## 6. Diagnosing No Detected Network Activity

If you consistently see zero connections despite browsing active sites, perform the following:

### Step 1: Confirm WebRequest API Support

- Browsers must support the `webRequest` API fully and expose it to extensions.
- Some restricted environments or browser forks may limit this.

### Step 2: Check for Content Blockers or DNS Filters

- uBO Scope can detect network outcomes despite other blockers, but extreme filtering at the OS or network level may prevent request visibility.

### Step 3: Test Using a Known Network-Active Site

- Visit a known site with many third-party resources (e.g., https://news.ycombinator.com).
- Observe if the badge or popup updates.

## 7. Resetting Extension Data

Occasionally, clearing stored session data can resolve stale or corrupted state errors.

### Reset Procedure

1. Open your browser’s extension storage page or developer tools.
2. Clear the data stored by uBO Scope (session and local storage).
3. Reload the browser and extension.
4. Refresh active tabs and check for updated data.

---

## 8. Additional Diagnostic Tips

- **Use Developer Tools:** Check browser console logs for error messages related to uBO Scope.
- **Check Network Permissions:** Some browsers prompt periodically for extra permissions after updates.
- **Restart Browser:** Simple restart can resolve transient issues with service workers or background scripts.
