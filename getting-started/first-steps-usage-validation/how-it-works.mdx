# How uBO Scope Monitors Connections

uBO Scope provides transparent insight into all remote network connections that your browser attempts or successfully makes while browsing. This guide explains in clear, non-technical terms how the extension tracks these outgoing requests, classifies them into allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked domains, and presents this information through its toolbar badge and popup interface.

---

## 1. Overview of uBO Scope's Connection Monitoring Workflow

When you visit a webpage, your browser initiates multiple network requests to load resources such as scripts, images, fonts, and other data. Some of these requests are to first-party servers (the site you visit), and others are to third-party servers (external services, ad networks, CDNs).

uBO Scope listens closely to these network activities via the browser’s `webRequest` API, which reports every network request made. It collects detailed information about each request’s URL, status (allowed, blocked, or redirected stealthily), and which browser tab initiated it.

Through real-time monitoring, uBO Scope builds a categorized map of all third-party hostnames and their associated higher-level domains encountered during your browsing session.


## 2. How Requests Are Categorized

Each network request is analyzed and assigned to one of three outcomes:

- **Allowed:** The request successfully connected to a remote server and was not blocked.
- **Blocked:** The request was prevented from completing (e.g., blocked by a content blocker or network error).
- **Stealth-Blocked:** The request was redirected or interfered with in a way that tries to remain undetectable by the webpage.

uBO Scope maintains separate lists for each of these categories, counting how many times each specific domain and hostname appeared under these outcomes.


## 3. Tracking and Data Storage Per Browser Tab

Requests are tracked individually for each browser tab. This means the extension keeps a session-based record of:

- The main domain and hostname associated with the tab.
- The count of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains and hostnames encountered while browsing that tab.

Internally, this per-tab data is stored efficiently and updated continuously as new network requests occur.


## 4. Representing Network Activity in the UI

### Toolbar Badge

The colored badge on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon shows a simple count: the number of distinct third-party domains for which connections were allowed in the active tab. This count helps users quickly assess how many external services their browser successfully connected to while visiting a webpage.

### Popup Interface

To get a deeper understanding:

- Open the uBO Scope popup by clicking the extension icon.
- The popup displays the main domain of the active tab.
- It lists connected domains grouped by their outcome: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- For each domain, the popup shows how many requests were made.

All domain names are displayed in user-friendly Unicode, decoding any encoded international domain names.


## 5. Step-by-Step User Flow

<Steps>
<Step title="Browsing a Website">
When you navigate to a webpage, uBO Scope starts monitoring all outgoing network requests from that tab in real time.
</Step>
<Step title="Requests Classification">
Each request event is captured and classified as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked based on the request’s network outcome and browser signals.
</Step>
<Step title="Data Aggregation per Tab">
uBO Scope updates the tab-specific collections of domains and hostnames, tracking how often each appears.
</Step>
<Step title="Updating Toolbar Badge">
The extension updates the toolbar badge count to reflect the number of distinct allowed third-party domains for the current tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Popup Display">
When you open the popup, the detailed categorized view shows the domain lists and counts derived from monitoring.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 6. Example Scenario

Imagine you visit a news website that loads ads and content from multiple external servers:

- uBO Scope will record all these requests.
- Allowed connections to ad servers will appear under the 'allowed' section.
- Requests blocked by your content blocker show under the 'blocked' section.
- Some stealth-blocked domains (often those redirected silently to avoid detection) appear under 'stealth-blocked'.

The toolbar badge count updates live, showing how many distinct allowed third-party domains were contacted.

By inspecting the popup, you can see exactly which domains were interacting with your browser, helping you understand the network footprint of the website.


## 7. Key Terms Explained

| Term            | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Allowed domain**        | A remote server that successfully handled a network request from your browser. |
| **Blocked domain**        | A domain for which a connection attempt was prevented or failed. |
| **Stealth-blocked domain**| A domain whose request was intercepted and modified such that the webpage cannot detect it. |
| **Hostnames**             | Specific full hostnames (e.g., `ad.example.com`) observed in requests. |
| **Domains**               | The base domain name derived from hostnames, using the Public Suffix List (e.g., `example.com`). |


## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Network Monitoring Questions">
<Accordion title="Why does my badge count sometimes show zero?"><p>This can happen if the network requests for the tab are minimal, or your content blocker blocks nearly all third-party requests.</p><p>Also, ensure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions to monitor web requests in your browser.</p></Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does stealth-blocked mean and why does it matter?"><p>Stealth blocking refers to network requests that get redirected or interfered with silently, so the webpage can’t detect they were blocked.</p><p>This is important to detect because these connections may be hidden from ordinary web debugging tools, and uBO Scope exposes them.</p></Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why are some domains repeated in different sections?"><p>Domains are categorized based on the outcome per request. A domain may appear in both allowed and blocked lists during a single session if some requests succeeded and others were blocked.</p></Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 9. How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Privacy Workflow

Using uBO Scope gives you a clear, real-time picture of your third-party network exposure per site:

- **Monitor transparency:** See which external services your browser contacts.
- **Validate blockers:** Confirm the actions of your content blockers by comparing allowed vs blocked domains.
- **Identify stealth blocking:** Detect redirections or hidden request blocking that ordinary tools miss.
