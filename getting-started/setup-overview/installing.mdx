### 2.2 Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

If you prefer manual installation or need to work with development versions, follow these instructions.

#### Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository

- Clone the uBO Scope repository or download the latest source code from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
```

#### Step 2: Build the Extension Package

- A shell script `tools/make-package.sh` is available to prepare the extension for your target platform.

Example to prepare Chromium build:

```bash
cd uBO-Scope
./tools/make-package.sh chromium
```

- This creates a packed extension folder in `build/uBO-Scope.chromium`.

<Note>
You must have a Linux environment or compatible shell to execute this script.
</Note>

#### Step 3: Load the Extension into Your Browser

##### Chromium-based Browsers

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right toggle).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the folder `build/uBO-Scope.chromium`.

##### Firefox

1. Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Select the `manifest.json` file inside `build/uBO-Scope.firefox`.

##### Safari

1. Open Safari and go to Preferences > Advanced.
2. Check **Show Develop menu in menu bar**.
3. Use the Web Extension Builder tool to load the unpacked extension from `build/uBO-Scope.safari`.

<Tip>
Manual installation is ideal for developers or users who want to test upcoming versions or customize the extension.

## 3. Required Permissions

Upon installation, uBO Scope requests these permissions to operate:

- **`webRequest`**: To monitor network requests made by webpages.
- **`storage`**: To store session data and public suffix list for domain processing.
- **`activeTab`**: To access the currently active browser tab for real-time monitoring.

<Warning>
These permissions are essential for uBO Scope's functionality and are used solely to provide transparent insight into network connections.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Post-Installation Verification

Once installed, verify that uBO Scope is active and monitoring connections:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
2. Visit any website known to load multiple third-party resources.
3. Observe the badge count on the icon — it shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected.
4. Click the icon to open the popup panel, which displays categorized lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

<Check>
If you see updates to the badge and corresponding domain lists in the popup when browsing, the extension is working correctly.
</Check>
