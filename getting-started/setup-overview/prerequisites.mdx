# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Before installing and using **uBO Scope**, ensure your environment meets the necessary system, browser, and permission requirements. This preparation guarantees a smooth installation process and optimal extension performance.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

**uBO Scope** is a browser extension designed to work on major browsers that support the WebExtension API and the `webRequest` API. Specifically, it supports:

- **Google Chrome** (Chromium-based browsers)
  - Minimum version: **122.0**
  - Installation via Chrome Web Store.
  
- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum version: **128.0**
  - Supports desktop and Android versions.
  - Installation via Mozilla Add-ons.

- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum version: **18.5**
  - Uses Safari’s extension system.
  

> <Check> Ensure your browser is updated to at least the minimum version above to guarantee compatibility.

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

Because **uBO Scope** runs as a browser extension, support depends primarily on the browsers supported on these operating systems:

- **Windows 10 and later**
- **macOS 13 Ventura and later** (required for Safari 18.5+ support)
- **Linux distributions** supporting Chrome or Firefox
- **Android** (for Firefox Android at version 128+)

> <Note> There is no standalone desktop or mobile application; uBO Scope must be run inside a supported browser.

---

## 3. Permissions and Compatibility

### Permissions
To function properly, **uBO Scope** requires these key permissions in the browser:

- **`webRequest`**: To monitor and report all network connection attempts, including HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and secure WebSocket protocols.
- **`activeTab`**: To access the currently active browser tab for associating data with tabs.
- **`storage`**: To save session-related data, such as public suffix lists and user session info.

### Host Permissions

The extension requests access to all URLs using these wildcard patterns:

- `http://*/*`
- `https://*/*`
- `ws://*/*` (WebSocket connections)
- `wss://*/*` (secure WebSocket connections)

### Extension Compatibility

uBO Scope is specifically compatible with modern content blockers and runs alongside them. It uses browser APIs that report network requests regardless of whether the requests are blocked or allowed by other content blockers.

> <Tip> Due to API limitations, some network requests made outside the browser's `webRequest` API scope (e.g., certain DNS-level blocks or requests made by apps outside the browser) will not be detected by uBO Scope.

---

## 4. Extension Compatibility Notes

- The extension operates as a companion to uBlock Origin but can provide detailed connection data independently.
- It supports tracking connection outcomes classified as **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth-blocked** to help you analyze third-party network activity.

---

## 5. Browser Badge and UI Dependencies

uBO Scope integrates with the browser's toolbar through the extension icon badge, which shows a count of distinct allowed third-party domains connected by current tabs.

- The badge count updates dynamically as network requests occur.
- The popup interface provides real-time summaries of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

> <Check> Keep your browser permissions enabled for the extension icon to ensure badge updates work correctly.

---

## 6. Network and Security Considerations

- The extension requires unrestricted access to monitor all network requests, which it requests via host permissions.
- For best security practice, only install uBO Scope from official sources such as the Chrome Web Store or Mozilla Add-ons.

> <Warning> Granting these broad host permissions is necessary for full visibility but ensure you trust the extension before proceeding.

## 8. Before You Begin

Ensure you have:

- A compatible browser updated to the required minimum version.
- Network access without restrictive policies blocking extension permissions.
- Ability to install browser extensions (some managed environments may restrict this).

Starting with this page's checks helps you avoid permissions errors or unsupported environment issues during installation.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with System Requirements & Prerequisites">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
If your browser version is below the minimum:

- Update your browser to the latest stable release.
- Verify the version after updating by checking the browser’s About page.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Insufficient Permissions to Install Extensions">
Some environments like corporate-managed devices might restrict extension installation.

- Check with your IT administrator to permit installation.
- Consider using a personal device for installing the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Restrictions Blocking Extension APIs">
If uBO Scope cannot monitor requests, some restrictive firewall or proxy rules might be in place.

- Confirm no firewall or proxy is blocking your browser’s webRequest API.
- Disable VPNs or security tools that interfere with browser extension operation.
