# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Welcome to the first step in setting up uBO Scope. This guide helps you understand the supported browsers, operating systems, and essential prerequisites for installing and running uBO Scope smoothly. By aligning your environment with these requirements, you will ensure full functionality and avoid common compatibility issues.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed to integrate seamlessly with modern browsers that support the WebExtension APIs, notably the `webRequest` API, which is critical for network monitoring.

### Browser Compatibility

| Browser         | Minimum Version   | Notes                                                      |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chromium-based Browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.) | Chrome 122+         | Includes support for WebSocket monitoring (wss:// and ws:// URLs).           |
| **Mozilla Firefox**            | Firefox 128+        | Fully supported on desktop and Firefox for Android.                          |
| **Safari**                     | Safari 18.5+        | Requires macOS or iOS with Safari 18.5 or newer for extension support.      |

<Tip>
For the best experience, always update your browser to the latest stable release before installing uBO Scope.
</Tip>

### Notes on Browser Differences

- **Chromium**: Uses a Service Worker as the background script (MV3 compliant). Supports full monitoring including WebSockets.
- **Firefox**: Uses background scripts with module support. WebRTC and WebSocket monitoring included.
- **Safari**: Requires version 18.5 or newer with the Safari Web Extensions model. Some limitations exist because of Safari's API differences.

For detailed manifest data and permissions by browser, please refer to the [browser integration documentation](../feature-overview/browser-integration).

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

Since uBO Scope is a browser extension, the key dependencies and compatibility depend largely on your browser's availability and version.

| Operating System | Notes                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Windows 10 or later | Any OS supporting Chromium browsers version 122+ or Firefox 128+   |
| macOS 13 (Ventura) or later | Required for Safari 18.5+. Chromium and Firefox supported too  |
| Linux (modern distributions) | Supporting Chromium 122+ or Firefox 128+              |
| Android (Firefox only) | Firefox 128+ recommended. uBO Scope is not available on Chromium-based browsers on Android. |
| iOS (Safari only) | Safari Web Extensions supported on iOS 18.5+         |

<Info>
Ensure your operating system supports the required browser versions as uBO Scope depends on browser abilities rather than OS features directly.
</Info>

## 3. Prerequisites Before Installation

To successfully install and run uBO Scope, prepare the following prerequisites.

### Browser Setup

- Confirm your browser is updated to meet minimum version requirements as above.
- Ensure the browser’s extension/add-on system is enabled and functioning.
- On Safari, enable 'Allow Extensions' and your extension permissions in System Settings.

### Network & Permissions

- The extension requires permission to monitor all web requests to HTTP and HTTPS URLs. It asks for these permissions during installation.
- If you are behind a firewall or corporate network, confirm that your browser can make external HTTP/HTTPS/WebSocket requests freely.

### User Account or Access

- No user account or registration is necessary to use uBO Scope.
- Extension installation requires administrative or user privileges applicable for installing browser extensions.

---

## 4. Summary of System Requirements

- **Browser**: Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+
- **OS**: Any platform supporting the above browsers
- **Permissions**: Network request monitoring, active tab, storage
- **Network**: Unrestricted HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket access

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Issue: uBO Scope does not install or load

- Verify browser version meets minimum requirements.
- Ensure extensions are enabled and you have sufficient permissions.
- For Safari, check that macOS/iOS and Safari versions meet the 18.5+ limit.

### Issue: Extension does not report connections or shows "NO DATA"

- Confirm you have granted the required permissions during installation.
- Verify your browser is not configured to block extensions’ access to the `webRequest` API.
- Restart the browser after installation to ensure all components initialize.

### Issue: WebSocket traffic is not reported

- This limitation applies only to Safari, which does not currently support WebSocket monitoring via `webRequest` API.

<Warning>
Browser sandboxing or security settings may restrict the extension’s ability to monitor network requests fully. Always check browser permissions and policies if unexpected behavior occurs.
</Warning>

## 6. Next Steps

Once your system meets the requirements and prerequisites outlined here, proceed to the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/setup-overview/installing) to add uBO Scope to your browser.

After installation, visit the [First Launch and Verification](/getting-started/setup-overview/first-launch) page to confirm uBO Scope is working correctly.
