# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Before installing and using uBO Scope, ensure your environment meets the necessary browser and operating system conditions. This page guides you through supported platforms, browser versions, necessary permissions, and compatibility considerations to set you up for a smooth start.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension supporting major browsers that allow webRequest API usage. Compatibility varies slightly by platform:

- **Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)**
  - Minimum supported version: **Chrome 122.0** or newer
  - Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)

- **Mozilla Firefox (Desktop and Android)**
  - Minimum supported version: **Firefox 128.0** or newer
  - Install from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

- **Apple Safari (macOS)**
  - Minimum supported version: **Safari 18.5** or newer
  - Safari web extensions require recent macOS versions supporting the Safari Web Extensions framework


> <Note>
> Minimum browser versions ensure that Manifest V3 extensions and necessary permissions, including `webRequest` API access, are supported and stable.
> </Note>


## 2. Operating System Requirements

uBO Scope operates as a browser extension, so it inherits compatibility from the browser itself. The following OS considerations apply:

- **Windows, macOS, Linux:** Supported as long as your browser meets the minimum version requirements.
- **Android:** Firefox support is confirmed for required extension APIs.
- **iOS:** Safari support limited by Apple's extension framework and permission model. Confirm your Safari version supports the extension.


## 3. Required Permissions and Access

For uBO Scope to function correctly, it requires certain permissions granted during installation:

- **`webRequest` permission:**
  - Allows the extension to monitor all network requests initiated by the browser to capture connection attempts, outcomes, and classifications.

- **`activeTab` permission:**
  - Enables interaction with the currently active browser tab to correlate network requests and display tab-specific data.

- **`storage` permission:**
  - Required to save session data and maintain information about observed remote server connections.

- **Host Permissions:**
  - Access to all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) to observe network requests universally across all sites and protocols.


> <Warning>
> Denying these permissions or installing in browsers that restrict or limit the `webRequest` API functionality will prevent uBO Scope from reporting accurate connection data.
> </Warning>


## 4. Browser Extension Installation Sources

To maintain security and receive updates, install uBO Scope only from official, trusted stores:

| Browser         | Installation Link                                                                                     |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chrome/Chromium | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox         | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)                              |
| Safari          | Distributed via Safari Extensions platform, requires Safari 18.5+                                   |


## 5. Network and Connectivity Considerations

- The extension relies on the browser's ability to monitor network requests via the `webRequest` API.
- If you are using network-level blockers (e.g., firewall rules, DNS filtering), uBO Scope will still attempt to report request outcomes as long as these requests traverse the browser’s network stack.


## 6. Summary Checklist Before Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm Browser Version">
Make sure your browser is updated to at least the minimum required version listed above.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Operating System Support">
Check that your OS supports the chosen browser version.
</Step>
<Step title="Note Required Permissions">
Prepare to grant `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` permissions during installation.
</Step>
<Step title="Plan Installation Source">
Use official browser extension stores only to install uBO Scope.
</Step>
</Steps>


## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Extension installation fails or permissions are blocked:**
  - Verify your browser version meets minimum requirements.
  - Check browser settings or organizational policies that may restrict extensions.

- **Network requests do not appear in uBO Scope data:**
  - Confirm no additional browser privacy features or extensions are masking or blocking the `webRequest` API.
  - Understand that requests made outside the reach of `webRequest` cannot be detected.

- **Problems on restricted environments (e.g., corporate networks or limited-user devices):**
  - Some network configurations may obscure network sessions; usage on such devices may be limited.
