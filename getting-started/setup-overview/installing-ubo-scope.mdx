## Verifying Installation

After installation, verify that uBO Scope is properly installed and ready:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It shows the extension logo.
2. Click the icon to open the popup panel.
3. You should see a UI listing domains connected by the active tab (or “NO DATA” if no network activity detected yet).

### Quick Verification Steps:

- Open any website.
- Click on the uBO Scope icon.
- Confirm you see the domains grouped under **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked**.
- Observe the badge count on the toolbar icon, reporting the number of distinct third-party remote servers – a key indicator the extension is capturing network connections.

## Managing Permissions

uBO Scope requires these permissions to function correctly:

- `activeTab`: To access the current tab context.
- `storage`: To save session and settings data.
- `webRequest`: To listen and report network requests.

If you encounter issues with these permissions, ensure that your browser settings allow the extension to access these capabilities.

## Tips for a Smooth Installation

- **Keep your browser updated** to the latest version to avoid compatibility issues.
- **Allow extension permissions carefully:** Denying essential permissions will limit the extension’s functionality.
- **Restart your browser** after installation if you do not see the extension icon or it does not respond.
