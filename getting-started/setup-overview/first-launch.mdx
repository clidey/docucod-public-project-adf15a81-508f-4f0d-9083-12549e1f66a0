# First Launch: What to Expect

Welcome to uBO Scope! After installing the extension, it’s important to understand exactly what you will see and how to interact with the key elements of the extension’s interface. This page guides you through what to expect on your first launch — so you know where to focus and what the visual indicators mean.

---

## 1. Toolbar Icon & Badge Count

### What You See
- **uBO Scope’s toolbar icon** appears in your browser’s extension area (usually to the right of the address bar).
- The icon features the uBO Scope logo, consistent across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari.

### Badge Count Behavior
- The badge number displayed on the icon shows the **count of distinct third-party remote domains for which connections are currently allowed in the active tab**.
- If no third-party connections are detected or allowed, the badge will remain empty (no number shown).

### Why It Matters
- A **lower badge number means fewer third-party connections**, which is generally better for privacy.
- The badge update is dynamic — it responds as you navigate pages or as content blockers affect connections.

<Check>
Ensure you see the uBO Scope icon after installation. If the badge shows a number, that means the extension is actively monitoring connections for your current tab.
</Check>

## 2. Opening the Popup Interface

### How to Open
- Click the toolbar icon to open uBO Scope’s **popup UI**.
- This popup is a small window attached to the icon that reports detailed connection information.

### What You Will See Initially
- At the top, a domain heading representing the current tab’s hostname.
- The **summary** section indicating the total number of connected domains.
- Three main outcome sections:
  - **Not Blocked:** Lists domains that were allowed connections.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Lists domains where connections were redirected silently.
  - **Blocked:** Lists domains where connections failed or were actively blocked.

### Visual Layout
- Each domain listed includes a count badge indicating the number of connection attempts or events recorded.
- When no data is available for the current page, the header will display 'NO DATA'.

<Info>
The popup updates in real-time as you browse, showing connection categories grouped by their outcome. It helps you see at a glance which third parties are allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked.
</Info>

## 3. Popup Interface Behavior & Interaction

### Dynamic Content Updating
- As network requests occur, the popup reflects changes dynamically when opened or refreshed.
- If you switch tabs, clicking the icon again will update the popup to show data specific to the active tab.

### Understanding Badge Counts in the Popup
- The count next to a domain corresponds to the total connection attempts recorded.
- Domains are grouped by their **connection outcome status:**
  - 'not blocked' for allowed connections
  - 'stealth-blocked' for redirected connections
  - 'blocked' for failed or actively blocked connections

### No Manual Configuration Needed
- The popup interface is designed for immediate use with no setup.
- You simply open it to view the connection summary and domain details.

<Warning>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' for a page you expect to see connections for, try reloading the page or switching to another tab to trigger connection tracking.
</Warning>

## 4. What You Should NOT Expect on First Launch

- There are no initial settings or configuration screens during first launch — the extension is ready to work out of the box.
- The badge does not count every single network request but rather distinct third-party remote domains with established connections.
- You will not see API keys, logs, or detailed technical diagnostics at this point.

---

## 5. Practical Tips for Getting Started

- To see meaningful data, browse websites with third-party content such as images, scripts, or ads.
- Observe how the badge count changes and how the popup categorizes domains.
- Use the popup to audit which third parties your browser connects with on any given site.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common First Launch Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting First Launch Issues">
<Accordion title="I don’t see the uBO Scope icon after installation">

- Check your browser’s toolbar overflow area; the icon might be hidden.
- Restart your browser to apply the installation fully.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The badge count never appears or stays empty">
- The badge shows counts only for tabs with network activity involving third-party connections.
- Try navigating to a website known for third-party resources (e.g., news sites with ads).
- Disable any conflicting extensions that may block network requests and prevent tracking.
- Verify your browser supports the extension and minimum version requirements.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' even on active tabs">
- Reload the active tab’s page to generate fresh connection data.
- Wait a few seconds as some connections might be established asynchronously.
- Open the popup again after the page has fully loaded.
