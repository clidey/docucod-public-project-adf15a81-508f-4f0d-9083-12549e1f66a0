# First Successful Run

Ensure uBO Scope is accurately monitoring your browser's network connections by following this verification guide. You'll learn to access the popup panel, understand the toolbar badge count, and confirm third-party server connections are displayed as expected.

---

## 1. Accessing the Popup Panel

The popup panel displays a detailed summary of network requests associated with the active browser tab.

### Steps:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope Browser Icon**
   - The icon is visible in your browser's toolbar, labeled 'uBO Scope' with its distinctive logo.

2. **Click the Toolbar Icon**
   - Clicking opens the popup panel linked to the active tab.
   - This panel reveals the domain and subdomains loaded, along with categorized outcomes for each remote connection.

3. **Verify the Domain Display**
   - The header shows the hostname and primary domain for the active tab.
   - If no data is present (e.g., "NO DATA"), ensure you have an active browsing session on a website.

<Tip>
If the popup displays 'NO DATA', refresh the active webpage to trigger network connections for uBO Scope to detect.
</Tip>

## 2. Interpreting the Toolbar Badge Count

The badge on the uBO Scope icon represents the number of distinct third-party remote domains contacted by the current tab.

- **What It Indicates**: Number of unique third-party domains where connections were successfully made.
- **Ideal Outcome**: Lower counts typically suggest fewer external resource interactions, which is preferable for privacy.

### How to Confirm Badge Accuracy:

1. After opening a webpage, observe the badge number update dynamically.
2. Click the toolbar icon to verify the domains listed under the "not blocked" section correspond roughly to the badge count.

<Note>
The badge only counts distinct third-party domains with successful connections, not blocked or stealth-blocked ones.
</Note>

## 3. Understanding the Popup Sections

The popup is divided into three key categories of network request outcomes:

- **Not Blocked**: Connections that were allowed and successfully completed.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Requests that were redirected or stealth-blocked by content blockers.
- **Blocked**: Requests explicitly blocked, often by external tools or browser mechanisms.

Each section lists domains along with how many times requests to each occurred.

### Validation:

- Confirm the "not blocked" section includes domains you expect your current tab to interact with, such as main site resources or common CDNs.
- Stealth-blocked and blocked sections may be empty if no blocking occurred.

<Tip>
If all sections are empty or 'NO DATA' persists, verify uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled, and the site being browsed generates network activity.
</Tip>

## 4. Confirming Third-Party Network Tracking

To ensure uBO Scope tracks third-party connections:

1. Open a popular website known for third-party content, such as news or social platforms.
2. Watch the badge count increase as distinct third-party domains are contacted.
3. Open the popup to see these third-party domains listed under the different outcome categories.

### Practical Example:

- Visit a news site.
- The badge updates to '5' (for example).
- Popup shows entries like `cdn.example.com`, `ads.example.org`, and other third-party domains.

This confirms that uBO Scope is actively monitoring and reporting network connections.

## 5. Troubleshooting Tips

If you do not see expected data or badge counts:

- **Refresh the tab** to prompt fresh network connections.
- **Check extension permissions**: Make sure uBO Scope has permissions for `webRequest` and access to all URLs.
- **Restart the browser** to reload extension and network hooks.
- **Try a different website** to ensure the issue isn’t with the specific site lacking network requests.

If issues persist, consult the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-steps-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-common-issues) page for detailed diagnostics.

## 6. What’s Next?
