# Validate Your Setup

Welcome to the final step of your uBO Scope onboarding journey! This guide helps you quickly verify that your installation is working as expected by walking you through a simple test process. You will visit a test webpage, open the uBO Scope popup panel, and confirm that domain connection summaries appear correctly.

---

## 1. Prepare for Testing

Before testing, ensure that you have installed uBO Scope following the official installation instructions and that your browser meets the system requirements:

- Supported browsers and minimum versions:
  - Firefox 128 or newer
  - Chromium 122 or newer (including Chrome and Edge)
  - Safari 18.5 or newer
- The extension permissions have been granted:
  - `activeTab`
  - `storage`
  - `webRequest`

If you have not completed those steps, please visit [Install from Official Sources](../installation-and-setup/install-from-official-sources) and [Initial Launch and Configuration](../installation-and-setup/initial-launch-and-configuration).

---

## 2. Visit a Test Webpage

To trigger network requests that uBO Scope can monitor:

1. Open your browser and navigate to a website known to have network activity from multiple third-party domains. For a simple start, you can try popular sites such as https://example.com or https://news.ycombinator.com.

2. Allow the page to fully load to generate connection data that uBO Scope tracks.

3. If you want, open the browser's Developer Tools Network panel to observe network requests, but this is optional.

<Info>
Choosing a webpage with varied resources helps uBO Scope demonstrate its full range of network connection detection.

## 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

Now, access the uBO Scope interface to inspect your browser's recorded connections:

1. Locate the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser's toolbar.

2. Click the icon to open the popup panel.

3. Wait a moment as the popup loads and renders data for the current tab.

You should see a header at the top indicating the hostname of the page you visited, followed by a domain connection summary number, and three distinct sections:

- **Not Blocked**: Domains with allowed network connections.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains with stealth-blocked connections (requests that were redirected or hidden).
- **Blocked**: Domains with explicitly blocked requests.

<Info>
If the popup remains blank or displays 'NO DATA', refresh the tab or verify your installation and permissions.
</Info>

---

## 4. Verify Domain Connection Summaries

Carefully review the popup panel information:

- The header shows the hostname and domain of the active tab, translated to Unicode if necessary.
- The **domains connected:** count reflects the number of distinct domains contacted.
- Each outcome section lists domains categorized by their connection status with counts showing how many times each domain was contacted.

Example:

```plaintext
Hostname: example.com
Domains connected: 15
Sections:
- Not Blocked: 10 domains
- Stealth-Blocked: 3 domains
- Blocked: 2 domains
```

This data confirms that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your network connections.

## 5. What to Do If Something Isn’t Working

If you do not see expected data or encounter issues:

- Refresh the test webpage and reopen the popup panel.
- Confirm that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions in your browser's extension settings.
- Make sure no other extension conflicts exist by temporarily disabling other privacy or network extensions.
- Check the browser’s console log for errors related to uBO Scope.
- Visit the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../first-steps-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-common-issues) guide for detailed support.

<Warning>
Ensure you only use official sources for installation to avoid tampered versions causing errors.
</Warning>

## 6. Understanding Initial Data and Next Steps

Congratulations! Seeing connection summaries means your setup is successful.

### What You’re Seeing

- **Hostname Header** helps you confirm which tab’s network activity is reported.
- **Domain Counts** quantify unique remote servers your tab contacts.
- **Categorized Domains** assist in interpreting allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked network requests.

### What to Explore Next

- Dive into the [Understanding the Popup Panel and Toolbar Badge](../../guides/getting-started/understanding-popup-and-badge) guide to learn how to interpret the UI in depth.
- Use the [Analyzing 3rd-Party Network Requests on Any Site](../../guides/using-analyzing-connections/analyzing-3rd-party-requests) for practical analysis techniques.
- Review the [Investigating Stealth-Blocked Requests](../../guides/advanced-usage/investigating-stealth-blocking) to understand stealth blocking.
