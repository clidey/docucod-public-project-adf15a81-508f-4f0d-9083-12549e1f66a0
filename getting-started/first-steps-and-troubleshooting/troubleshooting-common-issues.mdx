# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide helps you resolve frequent problems encountered during the setup and first use of uBO Scope. Whether the extension icon doesn't appear, data fails to update in the popup, or some features behave unexpectedly due to browser settings, this documentation provides clear steps to diagnose and fix these issues. Additionally, it offers advice on when and how to seek further help.

---

## 1. Extension Icon Not Appearing

If you cannot see the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar, follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Installation">
Ensure uBO Scope is installed from the official source for your browser:
- **Chromium-based browsers:** Install from [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- **Firefox:** Install from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- **Safari:** Install from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/ubo-scope)

If not installed, follow the respective installation guide.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Browser Toolbar Settings">
- For Chromium and Firefox, check if uBO Scope is hidden in the extension overflow menu. Pin it permanently.
- In Safari, verify that the extension is enabled in Safari > Preferences > Extensions.
</Step>
<Step title="Restart Browser">
Close all browser windows and restart the browser to refresh extension state.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Permissions">
Ensure uBO Scope has the required permissions to run:
- These include access to activeTab, storage, webRequest, and host permissions.
- You can check under the browser extension settings.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the icon still does not appear after these steps, uninstall and reinstall the extension from official sources to resolve installation corruption.
</Tip>

## 2. Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Does Not Update

If the popup interface loads but shows 'NO DATA' or does not reflect ongoing network activity:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Webpage After Installing">
uBO Scope collects data only when there is an active page load. Open any website in a tab and then open uBO Scope's popup immediately.
</Step>
<Step title="Check for Page Permissions">
Some browsers may restrict webRequest API data if the extension is not allowed to access certain domains. Ensure the extension is granted full host access to HTTP and HTTPS sites.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload the Tab">
Try reloading the current tab(s) to trigger network events that uBO Scope monitors.
</Step>
<Step title="Allow Time for Data Processing">
uBO Scope batches network events with a brief delay (~1 second). Wait a moment after page load before opening the popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Browser Compatibility">
Confirm the browser version meets minimum requirements:
- Chromium 122+
- Firefox 128+
- Safari 18.5+

Outdated browsers may not provide the necessary API support.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Private or incognito windows may have restrictions that prevent uBO Scope from capturing data unless explicitly enabled in extension settings.
</Note>

## 3. Data Counts or Domains Appear Incorrect

Sometimes the domains or counts shown in the popup seem lower or higher than expected.

<Steps>
<Step title="Understand Badge Count Meaning">
Remember, the extension reports the number of **distinct third-party domains** for which network connections were allowed, not raw blocked request counts or total request counts.
</Step>
<Step title="Close and Reopen Tab">
Opening tabs anew resets tracking for accurate measurement; prolonged tab sessions may accumulate stale data.
</Step>
<Step title="Check for Conflicting Extensions">
Some privacy or content blocking extensions can interfere with network request reporting. Try disabling other blockers temporarily to test.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Filtering Behavior">
uBO Scope shows three categories:
- Allowed connections
- Stealth-blocked connections (red but treated specially)
- Blocked connections

Review sections carefully for nuanced insights.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Extension Features Limited by Browser or Settings

Certain browser configurations or security policies may affect uBO Scope’s capabilities.

<Steps>
<Step title="Review Browser Settings for Data Privacy">
Some browsers disable or limit APIs like webRequest in private browsing or restrict extensions in corporate or managed profiles.
</Step>
<Step title="Avoid Non-Standard Browsers">
Browsers that use proxy-based or DNS-level blocking without webRequest API support will not allow uBO Scope to capture connection data.
</Step>
<Step title="Ensure No Network-Level Filtering Bypass">
If your network uses DNS-blockers or proxies that prevent the browser from reporting fully, uBO Scope may miss requests.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Keep your browser updated to receive bug fixes and API improvements that benefit uBO Scope.
</Tip>
