# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide helps you resolve typical problems encountered during the installation and initial use of **uBO Scope**. Whether the extension shows no data, fails to update its badge, or exhibits permission issues, the following actionable steps and checks will guide you to a fully functional setup.

---

## 1. Confirm Browser Compatibility and Installation

Before diving into troubleshooting, ensure that your browser and uBO Scope installation meet all requirements:

- **Browser Support:**
  - Chromium-based browsers require version 122.0 or higher.
  - Firefox requires version 128.0 or higher.
  - Safari requires version 18.5 or higher.
- **Extension Installation:** Confirm that uBO Scope is installed from official sources:
  - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

If your browser or installation does not meet these, please update or reinstall accordingly.

## 2. Addressing Missing Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network requests and update its badge:

- **Essential Permissions:**
  - `activeTab`
  - `storage`
  - `webRequest`
  - Host permissions for `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and websocket URLs (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) on supported browsers.

### How to Check Permissions:

1. Open your browser's extensions or add-ons page.
2. Find uBO Scope and inspect the listed permissions.
3. If permissions are missing or disabled, remove and reinstall the extension.

### Tip

Enabling uBO Scope after disabling content blockers or changing browser privacy settings may require a restart of the browser.

## 3. No Data Displayed in the Popup

If you open the uBO Scope popup and see **NO DATA** or the domains count is empty, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Ensure the Extension Is Active on the Current Tab

- Visit a website with known third-party connections (e.g., a news site or popular platform).
- Check that the uBO Scope icon is visible and enabled in the toolbar for this tab.

### Step 2: Refresh the Page

- Reload the web page to trigger network activity.
- Open the uBO Scope popup again to check for updated data.

### Step 3: Verify Browser Settings

Some browsers or privacy-enhancing extensions may restrict the `webRequest` API:

- Go to your browser's settings.
- Verify that the `webRequest` API is enabled for uBO Scope.
- In Firefox, ensure `browser.webRequest` is not blocked by strict privacy settings.

### Step 4: Check for Conflicting Extensions

- Other security or content blockers might interfere.
- Temporarily disable other extensions and retest uBO Scope.

## 4. Toolbar Badge Not Updating

If the badge count on the toolbar icon does not update or shows no number:

### Step 1: Reload the Tab

- Close and reopen the current tab, or navigate to a new page.
- Observe if the badge updates after page load.

### Step 2: Check Network Activity

- uBO Scope relies on actual network requests made by the browser.
- Visit dynamic or media-heavy sites to test changes in the badge.

### Step 3: Confirm Background Script Is Running

- This extension uses the service worker or background scripts to process data.
- Restart your browser to ensure service workers are active.

### Step 4: Verify No Profile or Storage Corruption

- uBO Scope uses browser storage for session data.
- Clearing the browser cache or local storage related to extensions can resolve anomalies.

<Note>
Clearing browsing data might remove stored settings for other extensions. Backup essential data before proceeding.
</Note>

## 5. Permissions and Browser Settings to Check

### For Chromium and Firefox

- Confirm sites listed in manifest’s `host_permissions` allow monitoring across HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and Secure WebSocket protocols.
- Verify permissions for `webRequest` and `storage` are granted.

### For Safari

- Ensure you have Safari 18.5 or later.
- Confirm the extension is allowed in Safari’s Extensions preference pane.

### Inspect Browser Console Logs

- Open developer tools (F12 or CMD+Option+I). Navigate to the Console tab.
- Look for any error messages relating to uBO Scope or permission denials.
