# Quick Validation Steps for uBO Scope

This page guides you through a straightforward checklist to confirm that uBO Scope is correctly installed, functioning, and actively monitoring your browser's network activity. By verifying key visual cues such as the extension's icon visibility, badge updates, and the real-time network data displayed in the popup panel, you can quickly self-diagnose your setup and ensure it's working as expected.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Icon Visibility

**Goal:** Ensure the uBO Scope icon appears in your browser toolbar.

- After installation, check your browser's extension toolbar for the uBO Scope icon.
- The icon uses the uBO Scope logo in various sizes (16x16 to 128x128 pixels) depending on context.


<Check>
The icon must be visible without requiring you to expand hidden icons or open additional menus.
</Check>

**Common Pitfalls:**
- In some browsers, extensions may be hidden by default.
- Use your browser's extension management UI to pin or enable the uBO Scope icon if not immediately visible.


## 2. Verify Badge Count Updates

**Goal:** The badge count on the extension icon reflects the number of connected third-party domains.

- Navigate to any actively loaded website (preferably with external content).
- Observe the uBO Scope icon badge:
  - The badge shows a numeric count representing distinct third-party domains contacted.
  - If no external domains are contacted, the badge will not display a number.


<Check>
The badge number should change dynamically as you navigate between tabs or reload pages.
</Check>

**Tips:**
- The count indicates distinct domains allowed to connect; it does not indicate blocked connections.
- If no badge appears on external sites, double-check permissions and browser compatibility.


## 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

**Goal:** Access the extension popup to see summary data and connection details.

- Click on the uBO Scope icon in your toolbar to open the popup panel.
- The popup displays:
  - The hostname of the current tab on top.
  - A summary of the number of domains contacted.
  - Three categorized sections with headings:
    - **not blocked** (allowed connections)
    - **stealth-blocked** (redirected connections)
    - **blocked** (failed connections)
  - Each section lists domains and counts of connection attempts.


<Check>
All sections dynamically update as you navigate to different pages with network activity.
</Check>

**Notes:**
- If the popup shows "NO DATA", it indicates no tracked connections for the current tab yet.
- Refresh the active tab or navigate to other sites to generate data.


## 4. Confirm Real-Time Data Updates

**Goal:** Validate that the popup data changes according to browser activity.

- Open the popup panel while browsing.
- Open multiple tabs or reload existing tabs.
- Watch for live updates in the domain counts and category sections.


<Check>
Domains and counts should reflect new connections as they occur, updating in near real-time.
</Check>

**Troubleshooting Tip:**
- If the popup does not update after navigation or reload, try closing and reopening the popup.
- Ensure the extension has necessary permissions like `webRequest` and host permissions.


## 5. Self-Diagnosis and Common Issues

If any of the above checks fail, use the following to troubleshoot:

- **Icon not visible:** Confirm the extension is enabled and permissions are granted.
- **Badge not updating:** Reload the page or restart the browser. Verify the extension’s permissions include webRequest.
- **No popup data:** Confirm you have navigated to a page with network requests. Some static/internal pages may show no connections.
- **Popup displays NO DATA persistently:** Try disabling/enabling the extension, then reload the page.


## Summary

This quick validation confirms that uBO Scope is reliably monitoring network connections:

- The extension icon is visible in the toolbar.
- The badge count dynamically reflects connected third-party domains.
- The popup panel opens and shows live categorized connection data.

After completing these steps successfully, you can proceed to deeper use and analysis with uBO Scope.
