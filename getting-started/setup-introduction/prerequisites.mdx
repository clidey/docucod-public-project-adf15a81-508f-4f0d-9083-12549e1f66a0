# Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

Ensure you have the correct system and browser environment to use **uBO Scope** effectively. This guide covers the supported browsers, version requirements, necessary permissions, and key considerations to set up smoothly.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed for modern browsers supporting the `webRequest` API fully enough to monitor network requests, including connections blocked by content blockers or DNS filtering. The extension works on the following platforms:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.)
  - **Minimum Chrome version:** 122.0 or newer
  - Supports monitoring HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS protocols.

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - **Minimum Firefox version:** 128.0 or newer
  - Supports HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS protocols.

- **Apple Safari**
  - **Minimum Safari version:** 18.5 or newer
  - Supports HTTP and HTTPS protocols. WebSocket support is limited due to API restrictions.


<Tip>
Using outdated browser versions can prevent uBO Scope from accurately monitoring network requests. Always update your browser to the latest stable release.
</Tip>


## 2. System Requirements

- A device capable of running your supported browser versions
- No additional software dependencies outside of the browser are required

Since uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension, resource usage is minimal.


## 3. Required Permissions for Installation and Functionality

When you install uBO Scope, the extension will ask for the following permissions:

- **ActiveTab:** Allows the extension to access information about the currently active browser tab for accurate per-tab domain monitoring.
- **Storage:** Permits saving session and configuration data locally within the browser to maintain tracking across page loads.
- **webRequest:** Essential to monitor HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket network requests and their outcomes, including whether requests were blocked, allowed, or stealth-blocked.

Additionally, uBO Scope requests **host permissions** for all URLs matching the following schemes and hosts:

- HTTP and HTTPS: `http://*/*` and `https://*/*`
- WebSocket and Secure WebSocket (Chromium, Firefox): `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*`


<Note>
These permissions allow uBO Scope to inspect all network requests the browser handles during your browsing sessions. The extension **does not** modify or block any traffic by itself.
</Note>


## 4. Installation Considerations by Platform

| Browser      | Notes & Version Requirements                                                                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chromium** | Requires Chrome 122+ or equivalent. Installs from Chrome Web Store. Supports full monitoring including WebSocket. |
| **Firefox**  | Requires Firefox 128+. Installs from Mozilla Add-ons. Supports full monitoring including WebSocket.        |
| **Safari**   | Requires Safari 18.5+. Installs via Safari Extensions Gallery or manual sideloading. Limited WebSocket monitoring support. |


<Tip>
Some platform-specific quirks may exist due to browser API differences, notably:

- Safari enforces a stricter minimum version and has limited WebSocket event support.
- Chromium uses a service worker background script, while Firefox and Safari use background scripts.
</Tip>


## 5. Network and Firewall Settings

For uBO Scope to function fully:

- Ensure your network or firewall does not block browser extensions from receiving webRequest events.
- Since uBO Scope only reads network request data and never blocks or alters traffic, no special outbound firewall rules are needed.


## 6. Common Pitfalls

- **Using older browsers:** Browsers below the minimum specified versions will either fail to install or malfunction.
- **Blocked extension permissions:** Denying permissions during installation disables uBO Scope from tracking network requests properly.
- **Browser privacy settings:** Some privacy-focused configurations or third-party privacy extensions might restrict the `webRequest` APIs, affecting uBO Scope’s accuracy.


<Warning>
If you experience inaccurate or missing network request data, confirm that the browser is up-to-date, uBO Scope has all required permissions, and no other extensions interfere with `webRequest` API events.
</Warning>


## 7. Verification After Installation

Once installed, uBO Scope will:

- Display a badge count on its toolbar icon representing the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- Track requests regardless of your content blockers.

See the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/setup-introduction/installation) and [First-Time Setup & Permissions](/getting-started/first-use-configuration/initial-setup) pages to verify your setup step-by-step.
