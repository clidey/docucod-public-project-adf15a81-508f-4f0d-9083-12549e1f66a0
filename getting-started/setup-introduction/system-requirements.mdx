Ensure a smooth installation and optimal operation of uBO Scope by verifying your environment meets these system requirements. This page outlines the supported browsers, minimum versions, and operating system compatibility, so you can confidently prepare for installation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed to integrate with major modern web browsers that support the native `webRequest` API, enabling it to observe and report network connections effectively.

| Browser      | Minimum Version | Comments                                            |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium     | 122.0+          | Requires Chromium-based browsers like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. | 
| Firefox      | 128.0+          | Compatible with desktop and Firefox for Android.    |
| Safari       | 18.5+           | Supported on macOS and iOS Safari.                   |


<Note>
The extension uses browser-specific manifests and APIs available from these minimum versions onward to guarantee full functionality.
</Note>

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

Because uBO Scope runs as a browser extension, it supports all operating systems compatible with the supported browsers. Specifically:

- **Windows, macOS, Linux:** Platforms where Chromium (v122+) or Firefox (v128+) browsers can be installed.
- **iOS and macOS:** With Safari v18.5 or later (including Apple Silicon Macs).


<Info>
Compatibility depends primarily on browser support rather than the OS itself. Make sure your OS version supports the required browser versions.
</Info>

## 3. Browser Permissions Required

To operate correctly, uBO Scope requires explicit permissions granted during installation:

- **Active Tab Access:** To monitor connections on the currently open tab.
- **WebRequest API Permission:** To listen to and intercept network requests.
- **Storage Access:** To save session data and configuration.

These are standard permissions for extensions that monitor browser network activity and will be requested automatically during installation.

## 4. Network Considerations

uBO Scope relies on the browser's native network request reporting. No special network configurations are needed beyond having internet access for extension installation.

<Warning>
Firewalls or network proxies that block extension updates or browser connectivity might affect uBO Scope’s ability to load its public suffix list or update session data.
</Warning>

## 5. Compatibility Notes

- uBO Scope operates independently and complements existing content blocking extensions or DNS filtering services without interference.
- It listens to all network requests reported by the browser’s `webRequest` API, including those blocked at various levels, giving accurate visibility of network activity.
- Legacy browsers or versions earlier than the ones listed will not support uBO Scope due to incompatible API availability, and installation may be blocked by the browser.
