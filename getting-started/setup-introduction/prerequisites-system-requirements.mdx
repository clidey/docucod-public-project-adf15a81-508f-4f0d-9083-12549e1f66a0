# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Ensuring your environment meets the prerequisites before installing uBO Scope is crucial to avoid compatibility or setup issues. This guide focuses on what browsers and operating systems are supported, what permissions and browser features are required, and any network considerations to keep in mind.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to work across major modern browsers that support the `webRequest` API with Manifest V3 extensions. The specific supported platforms are:

- **Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge):**
  - Minimum version: Chrome 122.0 or later
- **Mozilla Firefox:**
  - Minimum version: Firefox 128.0 or later
  - Also supports Firefox on Android with the same minimum version
- **Apple Safari:**
  - Minimum version: Safari 18.5 or later


<Tip>
Check your browser’s version before installation to ensure compatibility. Upgrading to the latest stable release is strongly recommended for the best experience.
</Tip>

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

As a browser extension, uBO Scope inherits the compatibility of your chosen browser. It operates on any operating system on which the supported browser versions run—including but not limited to:

- **Windows 10 and Later** (for Chromium and Firefox)
- **macOS Ventura and Later** (for Safari, Chromium, and Firefox)
- **Linux** (for supported Chromium and Firefox versions)
- **Android** (Firefox 128+)


<Info>
uBO Scope does not require any special OS-level dependencies or administrator privileges. Ensure your OS and browser combination meets the minimum required browser versions.

## 3. Browser Permissions and Features Required

uBO Scope relies on several core browser capabilities to observe and report network connections:

- **`webRequest` API:**
  - Captures network requests, including blocked and allowed connections.
  - Full support with Manifest V3 required.

- **Storage Permissions:**
  - Uses browser local and session storage to manage data per tab and user settings.

- **ActiveTab Permission:**
  - Allows the extension to access the active tab’s data necessary for session tracking.

- **Host Permissions:**
  - Access to all HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) to track connections broadly.


<Note>
These permissions are essential for full functionality. The extension declares these explicitly and users must accept them during installation.
</Note>

## 4. Network and Connectivity Requirements

- **Internet Access:**
  - Needed to fetch extension updates and to observe actual webpage connections.

- **No Special Network Configuration Required:**
  - uBO Scope works through standard browser APIs and does not require proxies or VPNs.

- **Firewall Considerations:**
  - Ensure that your firewall or security software allows unrestricted operation of your browser’s `webRequest` API; blocking this may limit the extension’s ability to monitor network requests.

---

## 5. Hardware and Resource Recommendations

- uBO Scope is lightweight and does not impose significant resource demands.
- It runs efficiently on typical consumer-grade computers and mobile devices supporting the listed browsers.
- No dedicated hardware acceleration or large storage needs are associated with the extension.

---

## 6. Important Preparatory Steps

### 6.1 Verify Browser Compatibility

To check your browser version:

- **Chrome/Edge:**
  - Navigate to `chrome://settings/help` or `edge://settings/help`
- **Firefox:**
  - Go to menu > Help > About Firefox
- **Safari:**
  - Go to Safari menu > About Safari

Confirm that the version number matches or exceeds the minimum stated above.

### 6.2 Review Extension Permissions

Upon installation, review all requested permissions carefully. These allow uBO Scope to observe and report all network connections and cannot be modified after installation.

### 6.3 Disable Conflicting Extensions (Optional)

If you use other extensions that heavily modify network behavior or restrict the `webRequest` API, consider disabling them temporarily during setup to avoid conflicts.
