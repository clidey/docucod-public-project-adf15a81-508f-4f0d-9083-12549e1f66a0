## 1. Installing uBO Scope

### Method 1: Install from Official Browser Stores

#### Steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Google Chrome and Chromium Browsers">
1. Open [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore).
2. Search for 'uBO Scope' or visit [uBO Scope on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
3. Click 'Add to Chrome' and confirm the installation.
4. After installation, you’ll see the uBO Scope icon in your toolbar.
</Step>

<Step title="Mozilla Firefox">
1. Open [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/).
2. Search for 'uBO Scope' or visit [uBO Scope on Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
3. Click 'Add to Firefox' and follow prompts to complete installation.
4. Find the uBO Scope icon added to your Firefox toolbar.
</Step>

<Step title="Apple Safari">

> **Note:** Safari requires macOS 13.4+ and Safari 18.5+. Permissions are granted upon first use.
</Step>
</Steps>


### Method 2: Manual Installation (For Advanced Users)

If you prefer or require manual installation (e.g., for testing or development), follow these platform-specific instructions.

#### Prerequisites:
- A Linux environment (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) or WSL on Windows.
- `bash`, `zip`, and `jq` command-line tools installed.

#### Steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone or Download the Source Code">
Download the uBO Scope repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
cd uBO-Scope
```
</Step>

<Step title="Build the Extension Package">
Use the provided build script for your target browser platform.

For Firefox:
```bash
./tools/make-firefox.sh "<version>"
```

For Chromium:
```bash
./tools/make-package.sh "chromium" "<version>"
```

Replace `<version>` with the desired version number or leave empty to use the default.

This command creates a packaged extension in the `build/uBO-Scope.<platform>/` directory.
</Step>

<Step title="Load the Extension into Your Browser">
- **Firefox:**
  1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
  2. Click "Load Temporary Add-on".
  3. Select the `build/uBO-Scope.firefox/manifest.json` file.

- **Chromium Browsers:**
  1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
  2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right).
  3. Click "Load unpacked".
  4. Select `build/uBO-Scope.chromium/` folder.

- **Safari:** Manual installation requires building an appropriate `.appex` package and loading it via Xcode; this is more involved and suited only for developers.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Manual installation is intended for developers or advanced users. For most users, installing from the official stores ensures smoother updates and better security.
</Tip>


## 2. Verifying Installation

### Confirmation Steps:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
2. Click on the icon — a popup displaying your current tab’s remote connection data should appear.
3. Reload a standard website (e.g., https://example.com), and observe the badge count change dynamically as connections are recorded.

If these steps complete without error, uBO Scope has installed correctly and is active.
