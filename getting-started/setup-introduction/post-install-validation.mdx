# First Run & Quick Validation

Welcome to your first exploration with **uBO Scope** — a powerful extension designed to show you all network connections a webpage attempts to make. This guide will help you verify your installation, understand how to operate the extension's core features, and interpret your initial results.

---

## 1. Verify Installation Success

Before diving into analysis, confirm that uBO Scope is correctly installed and active.

### Step-by-Step Verification

1. **Open your browser** (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
2. Visit any website with active external content, for example: [https://example.com](https://example.com).
3. Look at the **uBO Scope toolbar icon** in your browser’s extension area:
   - The icon should be visible.
   - The badge number on the icon shows the count of distinct third-party domains connected by the current tab.

<Tip>
If the toolbar icon does not appear, ensure that the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions/add-ons manager.
</Tip>

4. Click the toolbar icon to open the **popup window**.
   - The popup will display summary information about domains connected under three categories:
     - **Not blocked**: Domains from which connections were allowed.
     - **Stealth-blocked**: Domains where connections were redirected or stealth-blocked.
     - **Blocked**: Domains where connections were actively blocked.

## 2. Understanding Initial Results

This first run provides raw insights into your webpage’s network activity.

- The **badge count** reflects how many distinct third-party domains your current tab has connected to.
- The popup’s domain lists explain the outcomes per domain, helping you quickly identify allowed versus blocked connections.

### What to Expect

- **Some third-party connections are legitimate** (e.g., content delivery networks like CDN providers).
- A **lower badge count generally means better privacy** but verify if critical resources load correctly.
- **Domains in the 'blocked' list indicate connections intercepted by your content blocker or by network-level blocking**.

<Tip>
Remember that not all third-party connections are harmful; uBO Scope empowers you to see exactly who your browser talks to.
</Tip>

## 3. Walkthrough: Open a Website and Check uBO Scope

Follow this real-world user flow to validate your setup:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a new tab and navigate to example.com">
Open a new browser tab and visit https://example.com or any website you frequently use.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge">
Look at the badge on the uBO Scope icon. It shows the number of third-party domains connected. A number appearing confirms the extension is active and monitoring.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope popup">
Click the toolbar icon to open the popup. Confirm it loads and shows numbers for 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the domain lists">
Review domains under each category. Domains listed under 'not blocked' are active connections the site used; those 'blocked' or 'stealth-blocked' indicate filtering or redirecting events.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Tips for Your First Validation Session

- **Test with multiple websites** to see different patterns (e.g., news sites, social media, e-commerce).
- **Reload pages** to observe dynamic updates in the badge and popup data.
- If the badge shows no data or the popup shows "NO DATA":
  - Ensure you have granted permissions.
  - Confirm your browser supports the required APIs.
  - Try restarting the browser.

<Warning>
If the extension consistently shows no data, revisit the installation instructions or check the troubleshooting guide.
</Warning>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common First-Run Issues

### Issue: No Badge or Popup Data
- Confirm extension is enabled.
- Check browser version meets minimum requirements.
- Verify permissions (`activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`) are granted.

### Issue: Badge Count Doesn’t Change
- Try visiting a different website.
- Clear browser cache or restart your browser.

### Issue: Popup Loads Slowly or Is Blank
- Wait a few seconds; data processing occurs asynchronously.
- Refresh the page and reopen the popup.

<Note>
For persistent problems, consult the "Troubleshooting Common Issues" guide linked below.
