# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Ensure your system and browser meet the prerequisites for installing and running uBO Scope smoothly. This guide details supported platforms, necessary permissions, and dependencies to help you verify compatibility before installation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with the major modern browsers that support Manifest Version 3 (MV3) extensions and their associated APIs.

| Browser           | Minimum Version | Notes                                      |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Google Chrome**  | 122.0+          | Available on Chrome Web Store               |
| **Mozilla Firefox**| 128.0+          | Available on Firefox Add-ons                 |
| **Safari**        | 18.5+           | Available via Safari Extensions             |

> These versions ensure compatibility with browser APIs such as `webRequest` and service worker backgrounds required for uBO Scope to function effectively.

## 2. Operating System Compatibility

uBO Scope works on any operating system that supports the compatible browsers listed above:

- Windows 10 and later
- macOS 12 (Monterey) and later
- Linux distributions supporting Chrome or Firefox
- iOS/iPadOS via Safari 18.5+ (limited by Safari's extension model and policies)

## 3. Required Permissions

uBO Scope operates with three critical browser extension permissions, which you need to approve during installation:

- **activeTab**: Access the currently active tab to monitor its network requests.
- **storage**: Save session data and configuration locally to persist network request details.
- **webRequest**: Listen to and analyze network requests made by webpages.

Additionally, it requires **host permissions** to observe all webpage network traffic:

- `http://*/*`
- `https://*/*`
- `ws://*/*` (WebSocket support)
- `wss://*/*` (WebSocket Secure support)

These permissions enable uBO Scope to track and report every remote connection attempt made by active browser tabs.

<Note>
All permissions are essential and are limited strictly to what uBO Scope needs to accurately reveal third-party connections. Review these carefully during installation.
</Note>

## 4. Browser Extension Dependencies

- uBO Scope requires browsers that support Manifest Version 3 extensions. Browsers using earlier Manifest versions will not support this extension.
- The extension relies on the browser's `webRequest` API for accurate network request event reporting, including redirects, errors, and successes.
- The service worker model is used for background tasks, which means the extension may unload and reload as per browser lifecycle rules but will maintain session data persistency.

## 5. Network and Connectivity Requirements

- The extension requires uninterrupted internet access for the tabs you want to monitor because it observes live network requests.
- No specific firewall configurations are generally necessary but ensure the browser is permitted to make network requests unrestricted in your network setup.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Tips

- **Updating Your Browser**: Ensure your browser is updated to the versions stated above. Older versions may cause installation failures or missing functionality.
- **Permissions Review**: During installation, grant the required permissions. Without them, uBO Scope cannot monitor network requests properly.
- **Third-Party Network Access**: uBO Scope’s accuracy depends on your browser allowing network event reporting. Some privacy or security tools could interfere with this.

## 7. Verifying Compatibility

Before proceeding to install uBO Scope:

1. Check your browser version:
   - Chrome: navigate to `chrome://settings/help`
   - Firefox: navigate to `about:support`
   - Safari: Check via the 'About Safari' option in the menu
2. Confirm that your browser supports Manifest Version 3.
3. Confirm you can grant the required extension permissions.

If these criteria are met, your environment supports uBO Scope installation and operation.
