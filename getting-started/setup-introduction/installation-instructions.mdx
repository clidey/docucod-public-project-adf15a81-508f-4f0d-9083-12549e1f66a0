## 3. Verifying the Installation

After installation, confirm uBO Scope is properly set up:

- Look for the uBO Scope icon near your browser’s address bar.
- Click the icon — the popup window should open immediately and display ‘NO DATA’ if you haven’t browsed yet.
- Visit any website to begin capturing connection data. The icon’s badge will update showing the count of distinct remote servers detected.

<Tip>

## 4. Post-Installation Tips

- **Permissions**: uBO Scope requires permissions to observe network requests (`webRequest`), active tab data, and storage. Granting these permissions is essential for complete functionality.
- **Browser Version**: Using the supported minimum version or newer ensures API availability and stable operation.
- **Icon Visibility**: If the icon is hidden by default (some browsers do this), pin it to the toolbar to access uBO Scope quickly.

## 6. Installing From Source or Packaged Files (Advanced Users)

If you prefer to build or install uBO Scope manually:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git`
2. Use the provided packaging scripts for your platform:
   - For Chrome/Chromium: run `./tools/make-chromium.sh [version]`
   - For Firefox: run `./tools/make-firefox.sh [version]`
   - Replace `[version]` with the desired version number or leave blank to keep default.
3. Load the generated package as an unpacked extension:
   - Chrome/Chromium: Open `chrome://extensions/`, enable Developer mode, and load the unpacked folder.
   - Firefox: Use `about:debugging` to load temporary add-on from the unpacked folder.

This method is recommended only if you want to customize, test, or develop the extension.
