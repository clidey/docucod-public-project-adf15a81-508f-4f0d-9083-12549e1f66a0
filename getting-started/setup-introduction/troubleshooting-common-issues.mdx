# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide provides clear solutions to frequent setup and installation problems encountered when using uBO Scope. Whether you run into permission errors, do not see the extension badge, or face browser compatibility challenges, this document will help you resolve issues quickly and get uBO Scope running smoothly.

---

## 1. Permission Errors

### Issue: Extension Does Not Appear to Have Required Permissions

uBO Scope relies on specific browser permissions to monitor network connections accurately. If permissions are denied or not granted, the extension cannot function properly.

#### How to Fix:

1. **Check Permission Prompts:**
   - After installation, most browsers will prompt for permissions such as `webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab`. Ensure you accept these prompts.

2. **Manually Verify Permissions:**
   - **Chrome**: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, locate uBO Scope, click `Details`, and ensure all listed permissions are enabled.
   - **Firefox**: Go to `about:addons`, find uBO Scope, click on the `Permissions` section to confirm.
   - **Safari**: Review Preferences > Extensions, confirm permissions granted.

3. **Reinstall if Necessary:**
   - If permissions were denied initially, removing and reinstalling the extension usually triggers permission prompts again.

<Tip>
Always ensure uBO Scope has permission to access URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`), and use of the `webRequest` API for full functionality.
</Tip>

## 2. Missing or Inactive Toolbar Badge

### Issue: You do not see the uBO Scope icon badge on the browser toolbar, or it appears inactive.

The badge is a key visual indicator showing the count of distinct third-party remote connections detected.

#### How to Fix:

1. **Check Extension Visibility:**
   - On the browser toolbar, ensure uBO Scope is not hidden behind the overflow menu or extensions menu.
   - Pin or drag the uBO Scope icon to the visible toolbar area.

2. **Verify Extension is Enabled:**
   - In the browser extensions page, ensure the extension toggle is turned ON.

3. **Reload Browser Window:**
   - Sometimes the badge may not update until a browser refresh or reopening the browser.

4. **Check Tab Context:**
   - The badge only shows data relevant to active browser tabs. Make sure you are on a website page (some internal pages or new tabs may show no data).

5. **Update Browser:**
   - Make sure your browser version meets the minimum requirements (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

6. **Restart Extension:**
   - Disable and re-enable uBO Scope from extensions page to restart the service worker and UI.

<Warning>
If the badge remains missing after following these steps, try reinstalling the extension as a last resort.
</Warning>

## 3. Unsupported Browser or Version

### Issue: uBO Scope does not install or does not launch on your browser.

uBO Scope supports the following browsers with minimum version requirements:

| Browser   | Minimum Version |
| --------- | ----------------|
| Chrome    | 122.0           |
| Firefox   | 128.0           |
| Safari    | 18.5            |

#### How to Fix:

- **Upgrade Your Browser:**
  - Make sure you are running a supported, up-to-date version of your chosen browser.

- **Alternative Browser:**
  - If your current browser version is unsupported, consider installing a supported browser version or switching platforms.

- **Check Extension Stores:**
  - Install uBO Scope only from official extension stores:
    - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
    - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
    - Safari Extensions via the Safari Extensions Gallery or Mac App Store

<Note>
Installing the extension outside official stores or on unsupported browsers may cause unpredictable behavior or lack of updates.
</Note>

## 4. Network Request Data Not Showing or Incomplete

### Issue: uBO Scope's popup shows "NO DATA" or incomplete details for the active tab.

This indicates that uBO Scope is unable to capture or display network connection data.

#### How to Fix:

1. **Confirm WebRequest API Availability:**
   - uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API to observe network requests. Some browsers or certain contexts restrict this API.
   
2. **Reload the Webpage:**
   - After installing or enabling uBO Scope, reload the active webpage to allow the extension to monitor new network requests.

3. **Check for Conflicting Extensions:**
   - Some extensions or browser settings may interfere with request monitoring; try temporarily disabling other extensions.

4. **Check Browser Settings:**
   - Ensure privacy settings do not block `webRequest` access for extensions.

5. **Verify Active Tab:**
   - uBO Scope only shows data for currently active tabs with loaded webpages. Background tabs or internal pages may show no data.

## 5. Other Common Issues and Solutions

### Extension Service Worker Not Running

- **Symptom:** Extension appears unresponsive.
- **Solution:** Restart your browser or disable and re-enable the extension.

### Badge Count Shows Too High or Unexpected Values

- **Symptom:** Badge count appears larger than anticipated.
- **Solution:** Understand that the count reflects distinct third-party remote servers contacted, not total requests. This behavior assists in revealing cross-site tracking, not just blocked content.

### Extension Crashes or Browser Slows Down

- **Solution:** Update to latest browser and extension versions. Clear browser cache. Disable conflicting extensions.
