# Configuration & Setup

This page guides you through the initial configuration and setup steps after installing uBO Scope. You'll learn how to handle permission prompts, verify that the extension is active, interpret the toolbar badge, and perform optional post-install actions to ensure uBO Scope is ready to provide accurate insights into your network connections.

---

## 1. Permission Prompts on First Run

Upon installation and initial activation, your browser will ask for permission requests essential for uBO Scope to function correctly. These permissions are critical, as they enable the extension to monitor network connections and report outcomes.

### What Permissions Are Requested?
- Access to network requests across all websites (`webRequest` permission).
- Ability to access the active tab (`activeTab` permission).
- Storage permission to save extension states.

### How to Respond?
- **Always allow these permissions.** Rejecting required permissions will prevent uBO Scope from collecting and displaying connection data.

- If your browser allows manual permission management post-install, ensure these remain enabled.

<Tip>
Granting the requested permissions upfront guarantees you get complete and accurate visibility into all remote server connections within your browser.
</Tip>

## 2. Verifying uBO Scope Activation

After permissions are granted, it's important to confirm that uBO Scope is running and actively monitoring your network connections.

### Steps to Verify Activation

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Toolbar Icon Badge">
Look at the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. Initially, it will display a badge showing the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected during your active tab session.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup. You should see connection data summarized by categories: "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked", with domain counts displayed.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm No 'NO DATA' Display">
The header on the popup shows the current tab's hostname and domain. If you see 'NO DATA' here, it means no connection data has been captured yet. Try reloading the page or visiting a different site.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Successful popup data rendering and a non-zero badge count indicate that uBO Scope is actively monitoring connections.
</Check>

## 3. Understanding Badge Meanings

The toolbar badge number is central to interpreting uBO Scope's output. Here's what it tells you and how to use it:

- **Badge Count = Number of Distinct 3rd-Party Remote Servers:** This count reflects the number of unique third-party servers your browser connected to on the active tab.

- **Lower Count is Better:** A lower badge count means fewer external servers were involved, usually indicating better privacy.

- **Not a Block Count:** The badge does not represent blocked requests but distinct servers contacted, regardless of blocking.


### Badge Behavior Tips
- If the badge is empty or zero, either no third-party connections occurred or uBO Scope isn’t capturing data properly.
- High badge values reflect many unique external connections, which may warrant further investigation.

<Note>
Always interpret the badge in context with the connection data in the popup for a clear view of allowed versus blocked outcomes.
</Note>

## 4. Optional Post-Install Actions

To ensure uBO Scope functions optimally and the data you view is accurate, consider these optional setup steps after installation.

### Step 1: Reload Active Tabs

Reload key tabs (especially those where you want to observe connection behavior) to trigger uBO Scope's data collection from scratch.

### Step 2: Check Extension Management

- On some browsers, verify that uBO Scope is enabled in your extensions/add-ons manager.
- Prevent the browser from disabling the extension automatically due to resource constraints.

### Step 3: Configure Browser Privacy Settings (Optional)

To maximize the accuracy of connection reporting:
- Avoid browser network features that bypass standard request paths (such as proxy or VPNs that obscure connections at the browser level).
- Ensure no conflicting extensions interfere with uBO Scope’s ability to intercept web requests.

### Step 4: Familiarize With the Popup Interface

Spend a few moments exploring the popup UI:
- Note the categorization of connections into **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
- These categories allow you to interpret how your current content blocker setup interacts with network requests.

<Tip>
Regularly reviewing the popup and badge after installation helps catch any setup problems early and ensures reliable, actionable data.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Setup Issues

If you experience problems during setup or notice discrepancies in connection data, try the following:

- **Reload Your Browser:** Sometimes extension permissions or new installs require a full restart to take effect.

- **Check Extension Permissions:** Ensure all necessary permissions (webRequest, activeTab, storage) remain enabled.

- **Disable Conflicting Extensions:** Other security or privacy extensions might interfere with uBO Scope’s data collection.

- **Verify Browser Version:** uBO Scope requires minimum browser versions (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+) for full functionality.

- **Consult Troubleshooting Guide:** For more detailed solutions, visit the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/setup-introduction/troubleshooting-common-issues) page.

<Warning>
Ignoring permission prompts or disabling critical extension permissions will result in missing or inaccurate data.
Always grant and preserve requested permissions.
</Warning>
