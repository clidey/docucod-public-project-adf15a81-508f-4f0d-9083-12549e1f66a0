# What is uBO Scope?

## Introduction

Imagine browsing the web with full clarity on every external connection your browser attempts or succeeds in making. uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension built precisely for this purpose: to reveal **all remote server connections**, regardless of which content blockers or DNS-level filters you use. It shines a light on the true network activity behind the scenes, empowering you to see beyond the surface.

## The Problem uBO Scope Solves

Modern browsers often interact with many third-party remote servers invisibly, making it difficult to understand the actual flow of data. Content blockers and DNS filters may hide or block some connections, yet the question remains — how many distinct third-party connections were truly allowed or blocked?

Current toolbar badge counts on content blockers can be misleading indicators of privacy — a high block count does not always mean better protection. Some blockers may block aggressively but still allow a large number of third-party connections overall.

uBO Scope reveals this hidden truth by reporting not just blocked requests but the full spectrum of attempted, allowed, and stealth-blocked connections from each webpage you visit.

## Key Benefits

- **Complete Transparency:** See *every* attempted remote connection reported by your browser, independent of content blockers or DNS filtering.

- **Accurate Third-Party Count:** The toolbar badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to — a critical privacy measure.

- **Cross-Blocker Insight:** Understand how different content blockers affect network requests and their actual effectiveness.

- **Privacy Validation:** Validate whether your content blockers truly limit remote connections or simply block obvious requests.

- **Educational:** Perfect for curious users who want to learn what websites are communicating with.

- **Filter List Support:** Helps filter list maintainers by exposing real network traffic behind filters.

## Typical Usage Scenarios

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Quickly check the diversity and number of third-party connections a website makes, helping you identify privacy concerns.

- **Validating Content Blockers:** Compare how one blocker’s badge count and blocking behavior compare against another, beyond superficial block counts.

- **Investigating Webpage Behavior:** Detect unexpected third-party communications or stealth redirects that might leak data.

- **Filter List Maintainers:** Understand real-world network patterns to improve and optimize blocking rules.

## How uBO Scope Works (At a Glance)

uBO Scope listens to the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor all network requests triggered by webpages. This enables it to detect:

- Requests that were **allowed** through,
- Requests that were **blocked** by content blockers or network errors,
- Requests that were **stealth-blocked** (redirected or cancelled in subtle ways).

All data is aggregated per-tab and presented in a clear interface showing domain counts and outcomes.

## What the Toolbar Badge Number Means

The badge on the browser toolbar reports the number of **distinct third-party domains** your browser connected to successfully (i.e., allowed connections). 

> A **lower number** is better for privacy, as it indicates fewer third-party servers your browser is contacting.

This number excludes the first-party domain and focuses exclusively on remote third parties. Not all third parties are harmful; common ones include legitimate CDNs delivering site resources.

## Myths Debunked Using uBO Scope

- **Myth:** More blocks mean better content blocking.
  - *Fact:* High block counts may correlate with more overall third-party connections.

- **Myth:** "Ad blocker test" webpages provide reliable blocker evaluation.
  - *Fact:* These test pages often use unrealistic scenarios and can’t detect stealth blocking strategies.

## Summary

uBO Scope is an essential utility for anyone serious about understanding and controlling their web privacy. By exposing the real third-party network connections regardless of blockers, it helps users make informed decisions and supports filter list developers in refining their rules.

### Troubleshooting and Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions and Tips">
  <Accordion title="Why doesn’t uBO Scope show all connections?">
    uBO Scope relies on the browser's <code>webRequest</code> API, which cannot detect requests initiated outside the browser or requests that the browser doesn’t report (e.g., some WebSocket connections). Therefore, some network activity may not appear.

    Ensure your browser supports <code>webRequest</code> API calls fully and that no restrictive settings block such monitoring.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does 'stealth-blocked' mean?">
    Stealth-blocked connections are network requests that were subtly redirected or cancelled by blockers, often in a way that prevents webpages from detecting the block. This allows the content blocker to avoid breaking webpages.

    uBO Scope reports these so you can distinguish them from outright blocked requests.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How should I interpret the badge number?">
    The badge number reports how many unique third-party domains your browser accessed. Aim for as low a count as possible to minimize privacy leaks. However, some third parties are benign or essential, such as CDNs.

    Comparing badge counts across sites or blockers gives meaningful privacy cues.
