description: "An overview introducing uBO Scope: its purpose, the value it brings in surfacing third-party remote server connections, and why content transparency matters for users and filter list maintainers. Highlights the extension’s unique capability to observe network requests regardless of traditional content blockers, and debunks common misconceptions around block count and adblocker reliability."

# What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to provide transparent insight into all connections—attempted or successful—to third-party remote servers initiated by webpages you visit. Unlike typical content blockers, uBO Scope reveals accurate network-level activities regardless of any content blocker in effect, offering unparalleled clarity about third-party exposure.

## Why Does This Matter?

Every webpage you load may trigger requests to numerous third-party servers—ranging from ad networks to content delivery networks (CDNs) and analytics services. While content blockers aim to reduce unwanted connections, understanding exactly which third parties are contacted, and whether those connections were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked, is crucial for assessing your privacy and security posture.

uBO Scope surfaces this data in real time, enabling users to:

- Evaluate actual third-party connections on any webpage without interference or distortion from blockers
- Verify content blocker effectiveness beyond badge counts or opaque indicators
- Debunk common misconceptions that equate higher block counts with better privacy
- Assist filter list maintainers by providing raw, unfiltered measurements of network requests

## Unique Capabilities

### Transparency Beyond Content Blockers

Most content blockers show you only what they block or allow. uBO Scope goes deeper by leveraging the browser's `webRequest` API to observe and classify *all* network requests at the browser level, including those invisible to content blockers or blocked at the DNS level. This means uBO Scope can expose connections regardless of how they were handled.

### Accurate Outcome Categorization

The extension categorizes remote server connections into three clear outcomes:

- **Allowed**: Connections that succeeded without being blocked
- **Blocked**: Connections explicitly blocked by content blockers or other mechanisms
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections subject to stealth blocking techniques, often hidden from most monitoring tools

By displaying these outcomes per domain and hostname, uBO Scope provides actionable awareness rather than guesswork or abstract scores.

## Debunking Common Myths

### Myth: Higher Block Counts Mean Better Blocking

A higher block count on an extension’s toolbar icon can be misleading. It often means the blocker sees and attempts to block more requests but may paradoxically result in *more* third-party connections if some domain connections bypass blocking or resources are re-routed.

uBO Scope emphasizes **distinct** third-party server counts in its badge—reminding users that fewer distinct third parties connected is more desirable for privacy, not just raw block numbers.

### Myth: Ad Blocker Test Pages Are Reliable Benchmarks

The so-called "ad blocker test" webpages usually simulate network requests artificially and fail to capture stealthy blocking or real-world scenarios accurately. uBO Scope bypasses this unreliability by monitoring real network traffic in your browser.

## How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Workflow

- When you install and run uBO Scope, the extension listens to all network requests from the browser's perspective without altering or blocking any connection.
- It aggregates connection outcomes per browser tab, presenting you with a domain-level breakdown as well as counts.
- The toolbar icon badge shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the active tab, offering you an immediate privacy snapshot.
- The popup UI lists domains segmented by their allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked status, helping you quickly assess exposure.

## Value for Different Users

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** See every network request transparently, empower informed decisions about your browsing habits.
- **Researchers:** Gather unbiased data about third-party connections across websites.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Use precise measurements unaffected by the blocker’s internal heuristics or web page antics.
- **Developers and Power Users:** Validate content blockers' true effectiveness beyond cosmetic badges.

## What uBO Scope Does NOT Do

- uBO Scope does not block or modify network requests itself. It is a measurement and reporting tool.
- It cannot detect requests made outside the scope of your browser's `webRequest` API.
- It does not provide complex filtering options or user policies.

## Summary

In a digital world filled with opaque tracking and content delivery methods, uBO Scope shines a light on the true network footprint of the pages you browse. It empowers users and maintainers alike with clarity and factual visibility into third-party server connections at the browser level.
