## 3. Manual Installation and Packaging

Advanced users or those who need to sideload uBO Scope can build and install the extension manually. This is particularly useful for development, customization, or running versions not yet published in stores.

### Prerequisites for Manual Packaging

- Linux environment (recommended for build scripts).
- Node.js and npm installed (for dependency management).
- `jq` command-line tool installed (for manifest version injection).
- `zip` utility available.

### Building and Packaging the Extension

The extension supports building for three target browsers: Firefox, Safari, and Chromium.

### Step-by-Step:

#### a. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
cd uBO-Scope
```

#### b. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### c. Build Package for Firefox
```bash
./tools/make-firefox.sh 1.0.1
```
This script will generate a `.xpi` file in the `build/` directory ready to be installed.

#### d. Build Package for Safari
```bash
./tools/make-safari.sh 1.0.1
```
Generates a ZIP archive for manual installation on Safari.

#### e. Build Package for Chromium
```bash
./tools/make-package.sh chromium 1.0.1
```
Prepares the extension folder under `build/uBO-Scope.chromium`, which you can load unpacked in Chromium.

### Installing the Unpacked Extension

#### Firefox
1. Open `about:debugging` in Firefox.
2. Click **This Firefox** (or **This Nightly**).
3. Click **Load Temporary Add-on...**.
4. Select the generated `.xpi` file or manifest in `build/uBO-Scope.firefox/`.

#### Safari
1. Unzip the generated archive.
2. Follow Safari’s developer guide to load unpacked extensions (requires enabling the Develop menu and allowing unsigned extensions).

#### Chromium
1. Open `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the `build/uBO-Scope.chromium` directory.

<Tip>
Manual installation is intended for developers or users comfortable managing browser extensions outside official stores.
</Tip>

## 4. Verifying Successful Installation

After installing uBO Scope, confirm it is working:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. Click the icon to open the popup interface.
3. Visit any webpage and observe the badge count indicating third-party remote server connections.
4. The popup lists allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains per tab.

<Tip>
If the icon does not appear or the popup fails to open, revisit the installation steps and check browser extension permissions.
</Tip>

## 5. Permissions and Privacy

uBO Scope requires the following permissions:

- Access to active tabs to observe network requests per open page.
- Storage permission to save session state.
- webRequest permission to monitor network requests.

These permissions are essential for the extension’s core functionality and do not collect or transmit any personal data.
