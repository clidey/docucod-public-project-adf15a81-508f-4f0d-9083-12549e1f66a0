# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing uBO Scope, make sure your environment meets the following criteria to ensure smooth operation and accurate network request measurement.

## Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension and supports the following browser families:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave)
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Apple Safari**

Compatibility specifics for each browser are detailed below.

### Chromium

- Minimum version: **Chrome 122.0**
- Supports Manifest Version 3 extensions
- Uses a service worker background script to manage extension logic

### Firefox

- Minimum version: **Firefox 128.0**
- Requires Firefox to support Manifest Version 3 extensions
- Background scripts run as modules

### Safari

- Minimum version: **Safari 18.5**
- Supports Safari Web Extensions with strict minimum version enforcement
- Background script is a module

> These minimum versions are critical to support the required APIs, particularly the `webRequest` API in Manifest Version 3 context.

## Operating System Compatibility

uBO Scope runs on any operating system capable of supporting the specified browser versions, such as Windows, macOS, Linux, or iOS/iPadOS for Safari and Firefox Mobile. Ensure your OS and browser are updated to at least the minimum supported versions.

## User Privileges

- Installation requires **standard user privileges** sufficient to add browser extensions.
- No elevated or administrative rights are necessary.

## Network & Permissions Requirements

uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network requests. To do this, it requires the following permissions:

- `activeTab`
- `storage`
- `webRequest`

Additionally, host permissions are broad to track any HTTP(S) and WebSocket request:

- `http://*/*`
- `https://*/*`
- `ws://*/*` (Chromium and Firefox)
- `wss://*/*` (Chromium and Firefox)

> Ensure your browser profile or security settings allow the extension to access these permissions, and no enterprise or security policies block such monitoring.

## Hardware Requirements

- No specific hardware requirements beyond a system capable of running the supported browser versions.

## Summary Table of Supported Platforms

| Browser    | Minimum Version | Notes                                    |
|------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Chrome     | 122.0           | MV3 with service worker background       |
| Edge       | 122.0           | Chromium-based with Chrome compatibility  |
| Brave      | 122.0           | Chromium-based                            |
| Firefox    | 128.0           | MV3 with gecko strict version enforcement |
| Safari     | 18.5            | Safari Web Extension support              |


## Additional Considerations

- **Extension Version**: Use the latest uBO Scope version (1.0.1 or later) ensuring compatibility and up-to-date features.
- **Content Blockers**: uBO Scope works independently and reports network requests regardless of content blocker extensions active in the browser.


# Troubleshooting Prerequisites Issues

If you encounter problems related to prerequisites, consider the following steps:

- Confirm your browser is updated to the supported minimum version or newer.
- Verify that your operating system supports running the updated browser.
- Check browser settings or enterprise policies that may restrict extension installation or required permissions.
- Ensure you have the required permissions to install extensions.
- On Safari, 18.5 or above is mandatory, as earlier versions do not support the extension’s manifest requirements.


# Next Steps

Once your system meets these prerequisites, proceed to the [Installation: Step-by-Step](./install-instructions) guide to install uBO Scope. After installation, review [Configuring and Using uBO Scope for the First Time](../first-run-validation/configure-first-use) to begin monitoring connections.
