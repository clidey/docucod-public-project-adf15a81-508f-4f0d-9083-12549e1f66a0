# First-Time Setup & Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions and user configurations during its initial setup to function effectively. This guide walks you through the first-run prompts, explains the permissions requested by the extension, and points out any settings you may need to configure to start monitoring browser network connections immediately.

---

## 1. Overview of First-Run Prompts

When you install uBO Scope on your preferred browser, the extension will prompt for several permissions necessary to capture and report remote server connections made by web pages. These prompts usually appear right after installation or during the first time you activate the extension. 

Granting these permissions ensures uBO Scope can monitor your browsing activity transparently and accurately.

<Check>
To avoid interruptions, allow all permission requests promptly during the first launch.

## 2. Permissions Explained

uBO Scope requests the following key permissions, essential for its operation across supported browsers (Chrome/Chromium, Firefox, Safari):

### 2.1 Host Permissions

- **`https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, `ws://*/*`**

These permissions allow uBO Scope to listen to all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and Secure WebSocket network requests issued by web pages, regardless of domain. This wide coverage is critical for reporting every remote connection attempt or success your browser makes.

### 2.2 Extension Permissions

- **`activeTab`**
  
  Grants the extension access to the currently active browser tab, enabling it to retrieve details about the network connections specific to the tab you are viewing.

- **`storage`**
  
  Allows uBO Scope to store your session data and settings persistently. This includes saving connection data to maintain state across browser sessions.

- **`webRequest`**
  
  The fundamental permission that lets uBO Scope use the browser's webRequest API to observe network requests, including those that are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

<Info>
These permissions are standard for extensions monitoring network activity and do not allow uBO Scope to modify or block network traffic itself.
</Info>

## 3. Browser-Specific Considerations

Depending on your browser, there are a couple of configuration steps you may need to take for uBO Scope to work optimally.

### 3.1 Enabling uBO Scope in Private/Incognito Mode

By default, extensions are disabled in private or incognito browsing sessions. If you want uBO Scope to monitor connections in private tabs, follow these instructions:

- **Chrome/Chromium:**
  1. Open your browser's extensions page via `chrome://extensions` or the main menu.
  2. Find uBO Scope in the list.
  3. Enable the "Allow in incognito" toggle.

- **Firefox:**
  1. Navigate to `about:addons`.
  2. Select uBO Scope.
  3. Check the box "Run in Private Windows".

- **Safari:**
  Currently, enabling extensions in Private Browsing requires enabling it through Safari's Extensions preferences. Confirm through Safari's extension manager.

<Warning>
Without enabling this option, uBO Scope will not monitor private browsing network connections.
</Warning>

### 3.2 Browser Version Requirements

- **Chrome/Chromium:** Minimum version 122
- **Firefox:** Minimum version 128
- **Safari:** Minimum version 18.5

Ensure your browser meets these minimum versions to guarantee compatibility with uBO Scope’s manifest and APIs.

## 4. What Happens After Permissions Are Granted

Once you accept and configure permissions:

- uBO Scope begins tracking all network requests across tabs using the webRequest API.
- The extension builds an internal map of network outcomes by request type (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked).
- The toolbar icon badge updates to reflect the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected per tab.
- The popup interface becomes fully operative, allowing you to inspect connection details per tab instantly.

---

## 5. Additional User Configuration Options

While uBO Scope requires minimal setup after installation and permission grants, consider these options:

### 5.1 Permissions Audit

Regularly check extension permissions in your browser to ensure uBO Scope maintains full operational status.

### 5.2 Reset or Revoke Permissions

If uBO Scope fails to operate or shows no data, reviewing and re-granting permissions often resolves the issue.

### 5.3 Extension Updates

Keep the extension updated to latest versions to benefit from improvements related to permissions handling or browser API usage.

<Note>
You will not be asked repeatedly for permissions unless you remove and reinstall the extension, or manually revoke permissions.
</Note>

<AccordionGroup title="Common First-Time Setup Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope shows 'no data' after installation">
Verify you have granted all requested permissions during installation. If unsure, reinstall the extension and carefully grant all prompts.
Check that you are not in a private/incognito window without enabling the extension for it.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Toolbar badge does not update">
Confirm uBO Scope has the necessary host and webRequest permissions.
Try refreshing your active tab or reloading the browser.
Ensure your browser is updated to the required minimum version.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension prompts for permissions repeatedly">
Check for conflicting extensions or browser policies that might revoke permissions.
Review browser settings for extension management.

## 7. Summary

After granting the requested permissions and configuring any necessary browser-specific settings (such as enabling in private browsing), uBO Scope will immediately begin monitoring and reporting remote server connections for all web pages you visit. This foundational setup ensures you get real-time, accurate visibility of network activity through the extension’s popup interface and toolbar badge.

For ongoing use, verify permissions periodically, especially after browser updates or extension reinstallations, to guarantee uninterrupted operation.
