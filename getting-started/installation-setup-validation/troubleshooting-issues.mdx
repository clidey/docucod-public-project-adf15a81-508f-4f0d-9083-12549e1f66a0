# Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

This guide helps you quickly resolve frequent problems encountered during or after installing the uBO Scope browser extension. If you find that the extension's popup does not appear, you receive permissions errors, or no connection data is shown, follow the steps below to verify, diagnose, and fix these issues.

---

## 1. Verify the Extension is Installed and Enabled

To use uBO Scope, the extension must be properly installed and enabled in your browser.

### Step-by-Step Verification

1. **Open your browser's extensions page:**
   - **Chrome/Chromium:** Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - **Firefox:** Navigate to `about:addons`
   - **Safari:** Go to Safari > Preferences > Extensions

2. **Locate uBO Scope in the list.**

3. **Check that the extension is enabled:**
   - The toggle or checkbox should be active.

4. **Confirm the extension icon appears in the toolbar:**
   - If hidden, use your browser’s extension menu or customize toolbar to pin it.

<Check>
If uBO Scope is missing from the extensions list, the installation did not complete properly. Please reinstall using your browser’s official extension store:

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- Safari extension installation is managed via the App Store or developer-signed packages.
</Check>

## 2. Confirm Required Permissions are Granted

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network requests and display connection data correctly.

### Required Permissions

- **`activeTab`** — Allows tracking the active browser tab.
- **`webRequest`** — Enables intercepting and reporting on network requests.
- **`storage`** — Saves temporary data session-wise.
- **Host permissions:** Access to all HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket URLs.

### How to Verify Permissions

1. In your browser's extensions page, click **Details** or **Preferences** for uBO Scope.
2. Scroll to **Permissions** and ensure the required permissions are listed and enabled.

<Warning>
If any permissions are missing or disabled, the extension cannot function properly. Some browsers may require explicit consent to enable all permissions.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Check Extension Activation in Private/Incognito Mode

If you want uBO Scope to work in private browsing sessions, you must allow it explicitly.

### Enable in Private Browsing

- **Chrome/Chromium:** On the extensions management page, toggle 'Allow in incognito.'
- **Firefox:** Enable 'Run in Private Windows' under extension settings.
- **Safari:** Permissions in Safari preferences > Extensions.

<Tip>
Using the extension in private mode helps monitor connections made even in those sessions.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshoot Extension Popup Not Showing or Showing "NO DATA"

If clicking the uBO Scope icon opens the popup but it remains blank or says "NO DATA," try the following:

### Step 1: Reload the Tab

- Reload the current page to generate fresh network requests that the extension can monitor.

### Step 2: Confirm the Site Generates Network Requests

- Extensions display connections per active tab. Ensure the website you visit actually makes remote connections.

### Step 3: Check for Conflicting Extensions

- Some security or content-blocking extensions can interfere with webRequest API usage.
- Temporarily disable other extensions to isolate the issue.

### Step 4: Restart Your Browser

- Sometimes restarting clears extension runtime issues.

<Note>
Since uBO Scope relies on the browser's WebRequest API, web requests made outside of this scope (e.g., native apps, certain special protocols) will not be captured.
</Note>

## 5. Address Permissions or Network Errors

If you see explicit error messages about permissions or the extension does not collect data:

### a. Verify Browser Version Compatibility

- Minimum supported versions:
  - Chromium-based browsers ≥ 122.0
  - Firefox ≥ 128.0
  - Safari ≥ 18.5

### b. Check Network and Security Settings

- Corporate or restrictive firewalls and security policies may block extension access to required APIs.
- On managed systems, consult your system administrator to ensure required permissions and webRequest API access are allowed.

### c. Review Browser Logs

- Open your browser's developer console for the extension (e.g., via `chrome://extensions/` > uBO Scope > background page console).
- Look for error messages related to runtime or webRequest API.

<Warning>
Some browsers may evict or temporarily disable extension service workers, especially in MV3 architectures. This can result in intermittent data collection. Reloading the extension or the browser often resolves this.
</Warning>

---

## 6. Handling Restrictive or Limited Systems

Systems with elevated security or strict content policies may limit extension capabilities.

### Recommendations for Restricted Environments

- **Use latest browser version** supporting manifest v3 and all APIs.
- Check that required host permissions cover target URLs.
- Where possible, test on a non-restricted profile or browser to confirm functionality.
- If uBO Scope is deployed in corporate environments, coordinate with IT to whitelist or allow necessary APIs.

<Info>
If permanent restrictions exist, uBO Scope’s ability to report remote connections may be impaired or blocked.
</Info>
