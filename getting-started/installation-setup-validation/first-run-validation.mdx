# Validate Installation & View Results

Welcome to the critical step where you confirm that uBO Scope is properly installed and actively monitoring your browser's network connections. This guide walks you through the process of opening a website, interacting with the uBO Scope toolbar icon, and interpreting the results displayed in the popup interface — empowering you to verify that the extension is working exactly as intended.

---

## 1. Open a Website to Monitor Network Connections

To test uBO Scope, start by navigating to any website in your browser where the extension is installed. uBO Scope tracks all third-party remote connections your browser attempts or successfully completes while loading and rendering the page.

**Tip:** Choose popular sites with rich content such as news sites, social media, or e-commerce websites to see meaningful connection data.


## 2. Locate and Click the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

Once the page has loaded, locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. It typically looks like the uBO Scope logo.

- The toolbar icon badge displays a **count of distinct third-party domains** contacted by that page.
- The badge number directly reflects the total number of unique third-party remote servers contacted (attempted or successful).

Click the icon to open the uBO Scope popup panel, which reveals detailed connection data for the current active tab.

<Check>
Make sure the toolbar icon is visible and not hidden under browser overflow menus, especially in browsers with crowded toolbars.
</Check>

## 3. Understand the Popup Interface and Results

The popup panel consists of:

### a. Header: Current Site Information

At the top, you will see two parts:

- The **hostname** of the active tab's top-level site.
- The **registered domain**, which is the primary domain without subdomains.

This helps you verify which website's connections are being displayed.

### b. Summary Section

Below the header, a summary shows the total **number of distinct domains connected** during the page load.

### c. Three Outcome Sections

The core of the popup shows domains grouped into three categories based on connection outcomes:

| Outcome         | Description                                         | What It Means                                  |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**   | Domains that the browser connected to successfully. | Resources loaded from these domains were allowed. |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains where stealth blocking prevented connection. | The request was silently stopped by a content blocker avoiding page breakage or detection. |
| **Blocked**      | Domains where connection was blocked and reported as an error. | A resource request was actively blocked by the content blocker.

Each domain entry lists the domain name and the number of distinct hostnames observed during connection attempts.

<Note>
Domains are listed using human-readable Unicode names, even if punycode was involved.
</Note>

## 4. Quick Validation That uBO Scope Is Working

### What to Expect:

- The toolbar badge count should update dynamically as you navigate tabs and load pages.
- Opening the popup will reveal a list of domains grouped by their outcome.
- The counts displayed for each domain indicate multiple connections from subdomains or individual hosts.
- For a new tab or page with no network requests, the popup will show 'NO DATA' and no counts.

### Practical Steps to Confirm:

1. Open a website known to generate third-party connections.
2. Observe the badge count on the extension icon: it should be a non-zero number.
3. Click the icon; the popup panel should load quickly and display the site hostname.
4. The **summary** should show the number of connected domains.
5. Review the lists:
   - "not blocked" domains show allowed connections.
   - "stealth-blocked" domains indicate background blocking without errors.
   - "blocked" domains show actively blocked resources.

If you see these, uBO Scope is correctly reporting network connections.

<Warning>
If the badge never updates or the popup shows 'NO DATA' repeatedly:
- Verify installation and permissions.
- Reload your browser and try again.
- Ensure you accessed a website that makes outgoing network requests.
</Warning>

## 5. Best Practices and Troubleshooting Tips

- **Reload the page** if you want to refresh observed connections.
- **Permissions**: Some connections may not appear if the extension doesn’t have required host permissions; refer to installation and setup documentation.
- **Private Browsing**: Permissions for private browsing must be enabled separately.
- **Network Types**: uBO Scope tracks HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS schemes visible to the browser's `webRequest` API.

## 6. What’s Next?

Now that you can validate uBO Scope’s function:

- Explore the [Interpreting Network Activity](https://docs.example.com/guides/analyzing-connections/interpreting-activity) guide to better understand connection outcomes.
- Review [Optimizing for Accuracy and Privacy](https://docs.example.com/guides/best-practices-troubleshooting/optimizing-privacy) for maximizing value.
- Dive into the [Installation & Setup Instructions](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/installation-setup-validation/installation-instructions) if you suspect setup issues.

Keep monitoring your browsing for full transparency on third-party connections, enhancing your privacy awareness.

## Reference: Popup UI Structure

The popup UI dynamically displays data retrieved from the active tab’s network requests. Each section is coded to show:
- Site hostname and domain.
- Summary domain count.
- Lists of domains by connection outcome with access counts.

This interface reflects real-time data and confirms that the extension is actively measuring network activity.
