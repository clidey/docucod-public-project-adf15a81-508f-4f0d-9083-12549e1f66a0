# Troubleshooting Installation & Setup Issues

Welcome to the troubleshooting guide for uBO Scope's installation and setup. This page addresses the most common hurdles first-time users might face—such as missing toolbar icons, unexpected permission prompts, or a badge count that doesn’t update—and provides quick, actionable solutions to get your extension running flawlessly.

---

## 1. Verify Extension Installation and Activation

Before diving into troubleshooting, ensure the extension is correctly installed and active for your browser:

### Step-by-Step Verification

1. **Check the Toolbar Icon**:
   - Look for the uBO Scope icon (a stylized shield) on your browser’s toolbar.
   - If missing, the extension might not be installed, or it could be hidden.

2. **Ensure the Extension Is Enabled**:
   - Chrome: Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` and verify that uBO Scope is enabled.
   - Firefox: Navigate to `about:addons`, click on Extensions, and ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
   - Safari: Open Preferences, go to Extensions, and check if uBO Scope is checked.

3. **Restart Your Browser**:
   - After installation, restart the browser to finalize setup and activate the extension service.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the icon in your toolbar, check your browser’s extension overflow menu or customize your toolbar to pin the icon for quick access.
</Tip>

## 2. Addressing Permission and Host Access Prompts

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network requests effectively. Missing or declined permissions can cause issues.

### What Permissions Does uBO Scope Need?

- **Active Tab**: To read network requests from the current tab.
- **Storage**: To save session and configuration data.
- **WebRequest**: To monitor all outgoing HTTP(s) and WebSocket requests.
- **Host Permissions**: Access to all HTTP and HTTPS URLs your browser accesses (varies slightly per browser).

### Resolving Permission Issues

1. **Grant All Required Permissions**:
   - During installation, accept all prompted permissions.
   - If permissions are missing, reinstall the extension or adjust permissions via your browser’s extension settings.

2. **Host Access Settings**:
   - Some browsers allow restricting host access post-installation. Ensure host permissions cover at least `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` as uBO Scope needs this breadth to monitor traffic.

3. **Popup Permission Prompts Not Showing?**
   - Try disabling other extensions temporarily to rule out conflicts.
   - Confirm your browser version meets the minimum required version (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

<Warning>
Denying any of the essential permissions will cripple uBO Scope’s ability to monitor network requests accurately.
</Warning>

## 3. Badge Count Not Updating or Showing Incorrect Data

The toolbar badge displays the count of distinct third-party domains connected during the active tab session. If it remains blank or stale:

### Quick Checks

1. **Reload Active Tab**
   - The badge updates based on active tab network requests. Reloading ensures fresh data is tracked.

2. **Verify Extension Is Not Disabled or Blocked for the Site**
   - In some browsers, extensions may be disabled per site. Confirm uBO Scope is allowed to run on the active page.

3. **Wait a Moment**
   - uBO Scope batches network request data and processes it with short delays. A 1-2 second pause post-navigation is normal before updates.

4. **Restart Browser or Extension**
   - Restart your browser or disable and re-enable the extension to reset its internal state.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check for Conflicting Extensions**
   - Other network-monitoring or content-blocking extensions can interfere.
   - Disable other extensions temporarily and observe if badge updates correctly.

2. **Inspect Extension Logs (Advanced Users)**
   - Use browser developer tools on the extension’s background page or service worker to see if errors appear.

<Tip>
Frequently clearing your browser cache and reloading tabs helps if the badge count looks stuck.

## 4. Missing or Non-Responsive Popup UI

When clicking the icon, the popup showing connection data should open immediately. If it doesn’t or shows 'NO DATA':

### Actions to Take

1. **Focus an Active Tab with Network Activity**
   - Ensure you have a tab open with active web pages loaded.
   - uBO Scope tracks only the active tab's network requests.

2. **Reload the Tab or Navigate to a Different Page**
   - This triggers network requests logged by the extension.

3. **Update uBO Scope Extension**
   - Ensure you're running version 1.0.1 or later.

4. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

## 5. Fixing Installation Issues by Browser

### Chrome / Chromium

- Install from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
- Confirm minimum browser version is 122.0 or higher.
- Verify that background service worker is active.

### Firefox

- Install from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
- Minimum Firefox version 128.0.
- Check browser-specific extension ID `uBO-Scope@raymondhill.net`.

### Safari

- Safari requires macOS 14 with Safari 18.5 minimum.
- Install from Safari Extensions Gallery or Apple App Store.
- Confirm the extension is enabled in Safari preferences.

## 6. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

- **Installing Older Versions**: Always install the latest version to ensure compatibility with recent browser updates.
- **Ignoring Permission Requests**: Always accept the required permissions during installation.
- **Running in Private / Incognito Mode Without Allowing Access**: Explicitly allow uBO Scope to run in incognito/private mode if needed through extension settings.
- **Multiple Extensions Overlap**: uBO Scope works independently, but other extensions with similar functionality can cause confusion or blockage.

## 7. Diagnostic Command for Developers

If you are comfortable with developer tools, open the background console:

- Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`, enable Developer mode, click on 'Service worker' under uBO Scope.
- Firefox: `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, open console for uBO Scope.
- Safari: Safari Develop menu > Show Web Inspector for the extension.

Look for errors related to permission issues or failed background script executions.
