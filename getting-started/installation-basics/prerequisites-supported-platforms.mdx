# Prerequisites & Supported Browsers

Ensure your environment meets these minimum requirements to successfully install and run uBO Scope. This guide helps you verify browser versions, operating systems, and other essentials to start with confidence.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers & Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed to offer comprehensive visibility into outgoing third-party connections by leveraging your browser's `webRequest` API. Because implementation details vary across browsers, the extension supports only specific browsers and their versions to guarantee full functionality.

| Browser         | Minimum Supported Version | Notes                                      |
|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Google Chrome**   | 122.0+                    | Requires Manifest V3 support and `webRequest` API compliance.
| **Mozilla Firefox** | 128.0+                    | Supports the full extension API and native session storage.
| **Apple Safari**   | 18.5+                     | Limited support with certain API restrictions; uses Safari Web Extension model.


<Tip>
Ensure you are running these or later versions to avoid incomplete data or malfunctioning features.
</Tip>


## 2. Supported Operating Systems

- **Windows 10 and later** for Chrome and Firefox
- **macOS 13 Ventura and later** for Safari and other browsers
- **Linux distributions** supporting Chromium-based browsers, latest Firefox releases


## 3. Permissions and APIs Required

To function correctly, uBO Scope requires these browser permissions:

- `webRequest`: To monitor all network requests triggered by web pages.
- `storage`: To save session data and extension settings.
- `activeTab`: To interact with the currently focused browser tab.


<Note>
Browsers might prompt you during installation to approve these permissions. Declining may result in limited or no functionality.
</Note>


## 4. Network Requirements

- Internet access is needed only to fetch the public suffix list on first run (used internally to determine third-party domains).
- uBO Scope intercepts network requests locally and does not require external servers.


## 5. Installation Source Recommendations

To maintain security and integrity:

- Install uBO Scope exclusively from official browser extension stores:
  - Chrome Web Store for Chrome users
  - Firefox Add-ons site for Firefox users
  - Safari Extensions Gallery or Mac App Store for Safari users

<Warning>
Avoid downloading uBO Scope from unofficial or third-party sites to prevent malware risks.
</Warning>


## 6. Browser Compatibility Matrix

|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Manifest Version           | 3                          | 3                         | 3                           |

| Minimum Browser Version    | 122.0+                    | 128.0+                    | 18.5+                       |
| Host Permissions          | HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS       | HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS      | HTTP, HTTPS only             |


## 7. Verifying Compatibility Before Installation

1. **Check your browser version:**
   - Chrome: `chrome://settings/help`
   - Firefox: `about:support`
   - Safari: Click “About Safari” in the menu.
2. **Ensure your browser supports Manifest V3 extensions.** uBO Scope requires Manifest V3.
3. **Confirm availability of the `webRequest` API:**
   This is a standard API in supported browsers at the required versions.


## 8. Common Compatibility Pitfalls & Best Practices

- **Browser Updates:** Keep your browser updated to avoid missing new API features or security improvements.
- **Legacy Browsers:** Browsers like older Microsoft Edge versions or Internet Explorer are not supported.
- **Mobile Browsers:** At this time, uBO Scope focuses on desktop browsers. Mobile browser support is limited or unavailable.


## 9. Next Steps After Verifying Requirements

Once you confirm your environment meets these prerequisites:

- Proceed to [Install uBO Scope](/getting-started/installation-basics/extension-installation) to safely add the extension to your browser.
- After installation, review the [Launching uBO Scope](/getting-started/first-run-and-configuration/starting-extension) guide for initial use.
