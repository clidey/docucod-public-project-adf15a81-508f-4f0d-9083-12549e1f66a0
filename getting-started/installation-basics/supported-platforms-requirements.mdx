# Supported Browsers & Requirements

Understand which browsers and versions are compatible with uBO Scope. This guide also details required permissions, extension compatibilities, and system prerequisites you must know before you begin installation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is available as a browser extension designed to provide precise measurement of third-party network connections. It supports the following browsers and minimum versions:

| Browser           | Minimum Version | Notes                                              |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Google Chrome**  | 122.0+          | Requires manifest v3 extension support              |
| **Mozilla Firefox**| 128.0+          | Supports desktop and Android                         |
| **Safari**        | 18.5+           | Safari Web Extension with strict minimum version    |

> These minimum versions ensure full compatibility with manifest version 3 and required browser APIs.

### Why These Version Requirements?

- **Manifest Version 3**: uBO Scope utilizes MV3 APIs such as service workers (Chromium) or background scripts (Firefox, Safari).
- **WebRequest API**: Accurate monitoring of network requests relies on up-to-date implementations of the webRequest API.
- **Browser Security Updates**: Ensuring security and stability when handling sensitive network data.


## 2. Required Permissions

To function effectively, uBO Scope requires the following permissions from your browser:

- `activeTab` — Allows the extension to access the currently active tab to gather network request data.
- `storage` — Enables the extension to store session and configuration data securely.
- `webRequest` — Core permission that allows the extension to monitor all outgoing and incoming network requests.
- `host_permissions` — Permissions for URLs the extension monitors, e.g., all HTTP(S) and WebSocket URLs:

  - Chromium & Firefox: `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`
  - Safari: `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`

<Note>
These permissions are necessary to accurately report third-party connections and their outcomes (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked).
</Note>


## 3. Extension Compatibility and Coexistence

uBO Scope is designed as a companion extension and will coexist gracefully alongside popular content blockers like uBlock Origin and other extensions using the webRequest API.

- **No Conflict with Content Blockers:** uBO Scope reports actual network request outcomes regardless of whether a separate content blocker is installed.
- **Works with DNS-Level Blockers:** As long as the browser reports network events, uBO Scope can measure requests even if blocked outside the browser (e.g., system DNS filters).

<Tip>
Installing uBO Scope alongside existing blockers empowers you with granular insight into third-party connections without interfering with your current content blocking configuration.
</Tip>


## 4. System and Environment Prerequisites

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure the environment meets these basic conditions:

- **Operating System:** Any OS supported by your browser’s minimum version (e.g., Windows 10+, macOS 12+, Linux distributions supported by Chrome/Firefox, recent iOS/macOS for Safari).
- **Sufficient Disk Space:** Minimal space required (< 10MB) for extension installation and local storage.
- **Network Access:** Stable internet connection is necessary for downloading the extension and subsequently loading the public suffix list used internally.

<Warning>
Private or restricted browsing modes may limit extension permissions or network monitoring. Use standard browsing modes for full functionality.
</Warning>


## 5. Installation Sources

Obtain uBO Scope from your browser’s official extension repository for security and automatic updates:

- **Chrome Web Store**: [Install for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- **Mozilla Add-ons**: [Install for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

For Safari, manually add or manage extensions from the App Store or Safari extension preferences consistent with macOS/iOS policies.


## 6. Summary Checklist Before You Install

<Check>
- Using a supported browser version or newer (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+)
- Understand uBO Scope requires permissions: activeTab, storage, webRequest, host permissions
- Confirm coexistence with any existing content blockers you have
- Confirm browsing environment supports extension installation
- Make sure you have network access to download and update extension data
</Check>


## 7. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Compatibility and Permission Issues">
<Accordion title="Extension Not Installing">
- **Cause:** Browser version too old or unsupported.
- **Solution:** Upgrade your browser to the latest version.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Not Updating or Data Not Shown">
- **Cause:** Missing required permissions or disabled APIs (e.g., webRequest disabled).
- **Solution:** Check your browser extension settings and re-enable necessary permissions.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Conflicts with Other Extensions">
- **Cause:** Extensions interfering at network level (rare).
- **Solution:** Temporarily disable other extensions to isolate conflict, then configure accordingly.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Restricted Browsing Modes Block Functionality">
- **Cause:** Incognito/private mode blocks webRequest API.
- **Solution:** Use uBO Scope in a normal browser window to get full insights.
