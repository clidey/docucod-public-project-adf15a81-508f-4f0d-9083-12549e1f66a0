# Supported Browsers & System Requirements

Ensure uBO Scope runs smoothly by verifying your browser and system meet the necessary compatibility and permission requirements. This page guides you through supported browsers, minimum versions, and required permissions to get started effortlessly.

---

## Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a lightweight companion browser extension that operates seamlessly across the major modern browsers. Support includes:

- **Google Chrome**
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Apple Safari**

Each browser platform is supported in accordance with its own extension architecture, ensuring consistent functionality and user experience.

### Minimum Supported Versions

To guarantee stable operation and full feature availability, use uBO Scope with the following minimum browser versions:

| Browser | Minimum Version |
|---------|-----------------|
| Chrome  | 122.0+          |
| Firefox | 128.0+          |
| Safari  | 18.5+           |


<u>Why these versions?</u> 

- Minimum versions are based on support for Manifest V3 extensions and relevant webRequest APIs.
- Ensures access to required browser APIs used by uBO Scope such as action badges, background scripts, and host permissions.


## Required Permissions

uBO Scope requests a focused set of permissions essential for its core functionality of monitoring remote server connections without blocking or interfering.

### Permission Details

| Permission  | Usage Description                                  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `activeTab` | Allows interaction with the currently active tab |
| `storage`   | Enables saving session-based browsing data       |
| `webRequest`| Listens to web requests to track connections     |

These permissions are requested during extension installation and are used solely for the purpose of connection reporting.

## Host Permissions

To effectively monitor network requests, uBO Scope obtains host permissions for the following URL schemes:

- `https://*/*`
- `http://*/*`
- For Chromium and Firefox: also `wss://*/*` and `ws://*/*`

This broad access is necessary to observe third-party remote server connections comprehensively.

## System Requirements

uBO Scope is a browser extension and has minimal system requirements beyond those mandated by your chosen browser:

- Operating System: Any OS supported by Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
- Disk Space: Negligible, as it only installs as a browser add-on
- Network: Internet connection required to load and parse the Public Suffix List and to report remote connections


## Checking Browser Compatibility

Follow these steps to confirm your system and browser versions meet uBO Scope's requirements:

<Steps>
<Step title="Identify Your Browser and Version">
- Open your browser.
- Navigate to the "About" page (e.g., `chrome://settings/help` for Chrome, `about:support` for Firefox, Safari > About Safari).
- Note the browser version number.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Minimum Version">
- Compare your version against the minimum required:
  - Chrome 122.0 or higher
  - Firefox 128.0 or higher
  - Safari 18.5 or higher
- If your browser is below the minimum version, update to the latest version.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Permissions During Installation">
- When installing uBO Scope, watch for permission prompts.
- Ensure the extension requests the necessary permissions: `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
</Step>
<Step title="Network Permissions">
- Verify uBO Scope has host permissions for `http`, `https`, `ws`, and `wss` schemes as applicable.
- These permissions enable the extension to track connections fully.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If your browser does not meet these minimum requirements, uBO Scope may not function correctly or at all. Please update your browser or switch to a supported one.
</Note>


## Best Practices for Compatibility

- Always keep your browser updated to the latest stable release.
- Review extension permissions carefully during installation.
- In case of browser policy restrictions (corporate settings, managed devices), ensure that the required permissions and APIs are allowed.
