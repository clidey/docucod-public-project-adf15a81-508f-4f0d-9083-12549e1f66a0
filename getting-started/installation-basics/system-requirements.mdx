# System Requirements & Supported Browsers

Welcome to the first step in your uBO Scope journey! Before installing and using uBO Scope, it's essential to understand the environment and prerequisites this extension requires to work smoothly. This page outlines the system requirements, supported browser versions, and necessary permissions for the extension — so you can avoid early setup issues and get straight to gaining visibility on your network connections.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope supports the three major browser platforms, each with defined minimum versions reflecting compatibility and feature availability:

| Browser   | Minimum Version       |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| Chromium  | 122.0                 |
| Firefox   | 128.0                 |
| Safari    | 18.5                  |

> **Why these versions?** uBO Scope relies on the modern Manifest V3 extension framework and `webRequest` API features introduced and stabilized around these browser versions.


### Browser-Specific Notes

- **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)** require at least version 122.0. The extension uses a service worker-based background script in these browsers.
- **Firefox** support requires Firefox 128.0 or newer. The extension has specific background script handling and permissions tailored for Firefox, including Android versions (128.0+).
- **Safari** requires version 18.5 or newer. Due to Safari’s stricter extension environment, compatibility begins at this version with Manifest V3 support.


## 2. Supported Operating Systems

The extension runs on any OS that supports the above browser versions:

- **Windows**
- **macOS**
- **Linux**
- **Android** (Firefox only for now, Chromium browsers on Android do not support Manifest V3 fully at this time)


## 3. Required Permissions

uBO Scope requests permissions necessary for its core function: monitoring and reporting network activity. These permissions are explicitly declared in each browser's manifest file:

| Permission  | Purpose                                                |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `activeTab` | Enables the extension to interact with the currently active browser tab.           |
| `storage`   | Allows saving and reading settings and session data locally.                      |
| `webRequest`| Essential to listen and analyze network requests made by the browser.              |

Additionally, **host permissions** define which network requests can be monitored:

| Browser         | Host Permissions                                           |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium        | `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`       |
| Firefox         | `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`       |
| Safari          | `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`                                |

> Note: Safari currently does not request websocket permissions explicitly.


## 4. Implications of Permissions

- The `webRequest` permission is crucial and sensitive — it empowers uBO Scope to observe all network connections made by webpages to remote servers. No other extraneous permissions are requested, maintaining your privacy.
- Host permissions cover all standard HTTP(S) and WebSocket connections to ensure comprehensive monitoring.

<Tip>
Ensure that your browser's security and privacy settings allow installing extensions with these permissions — corporate or restrictive setups might block such extensions.
</Tip>

## 5. Practical Suggestions

- **Update your browser**: Confirm you are on or above the specified minimum version for your browser to guarantee compatibility.
- **Check for extension support on mobile platforms**: uBO Scope currently supports Firefox on Android but not Chromium-based browsers on Android.
- **Keep system software current**: OS-level issues can occasionally interfere with browser performance or extension stability.

## 6. Verify Browser Version

You can check your browser version as follows:

- **Chrome/Chromium**
  1. Open `chrome://settings/help` or `edge://settings/help`
  2. Your browser version appears on this page

- **Firefox**
  1. Open `about:preferences` or click the menu > Help > About Firefox
  2. Version information is displayed

- **Safari**
  1. Click on the Safari menu > About Safari
  2. Version information appears in the window


## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with System Requirements and Browsers">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
If you see installation errors or malfunctions:
- Double-check your browser’s version.
- Update to the latest stable release.
- Restart your browser before retrying the install.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Permissions or Host Access">
Some corporate or privacy-focused environments might restrict extension permissions:
- Review any browser policies or management settings.
- Try installing without restrictive profiles or in a fresh browser profile.
- If permissions are denied, uBO Scope cannot monitor all network requests effectively.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported Browser Platform">
- uBO Scope is not supported on browsers lacking Manifest V3 or webRequest API support.
- Mobile Chromium browsers do not support uBO Scope at this time.
- Use Firefox on Android if mobile monitoring is needed.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Manifest File Insights

Here’s a quick glimpse at relevant snippets from uBO Scope’s browser manifests that govern supported browsers and permissions:

### Chromium (manifest.json excerpt)
```json
{
  "minimum_chrome_version": "122.0",
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://*/*",
    "http://*/*",
    "wss://*/*",
    "ws://*/*"
  ]
}
```

### Firefox (manifest.json excerpt)
```json
{
  "browser_specific_settings": {
    "gecko": {
      "strict_min_version": "128.0"
    },
    "gecko_android": {
      "strict_min_version": "128.0"
    }
  },
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://*/*",
    "http://*/*",
    "wss://*/*",
    "ws://*/*"
  ]
}
```

### Safari (manifest.json excerpt)
```json
{
  "browser_specific_settings": {
    "safari": {
      "strict_min_version": "18.5"

  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://*/*",
    "http://*/*"
  ]
}
```

These define the baseline environment where uBO Scope operates with necessary privileges to observe remote connections effectively.
