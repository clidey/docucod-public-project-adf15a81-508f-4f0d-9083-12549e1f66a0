# System Requirements & Supported Browsers

Ensure that your environment is compatible with **uBO Scope** to guarantee a smooth installation and optimal experience. This section details the supported browsers, their minimum versions, and operating system requirements.

---

## Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with major modern browsers that support WebExtensions and the Manifest V3 standard. The following browsers are officially supported:

- **Chromium-based Browsers** (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.)
- **Mozilla Firefox** (Desktop and Android)
- **Apple Safari** (macOS, starting Safari 18.5)

### Browser-Specific Requirements

The extension’s manifest configuration varies slightly per browser, reflecting platform-specific capabilities and limitations.

| Browser   | Minimum Version  | Additional Notes                               |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium  | 122.0+           | Supports WebSocket connections (`ws://` & `wss://`) |
| Firefox   | 128.0+           | Supports WebSocket connections               |
| Safari    | 18.5+            | Limited to HTTP/HTTPS (`http://` & `https://`) URLs; no WebSocket support |

<Note>
Safari's implementation requires version 18.5 or newer due to the use of WebExtension's manifest version 3 and module background scripts.
</Note>

## Operating System Compatibility

Supported operating systems are those that can run the latest versions of the above browsers:

- **Windows 10/11** and later
- **macOS 11 Big Sur** and later (required for Safari 18.5+)
- **Linux-based distributions** compatible with Chromium and Firefox
- **Android** (Firefox only, limited support for Chromium-based mobile browsers)

<Warning>
Ensure that your browser installation is up to date to avoid compatibility issues, especially with Manifest V3 requirements and APIs uBO Scope depends on.
</Warning>

## System Requirements

While the extension is lightweight, optimal performance is influenced by the underlying system and browser capabilities:

- **Memory**: At least 2GB of RAM recommended for smooth browser operation
- **Storage**: Minimal disk space required; extension size is less than 10MB
- **Network**: Active internet connection for real-time network request tracking

## Permissions Required

uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions to monitor network requests effectively:

- `webRequest` permission to observe all network requests
- `activeTab` permission to access information for the current tab
- `storage` permission to save session data and settings

These permissions are declared explicitly in the extension's manifest and are necessary for its core functionality.

## Compatibility Considerations

- Browsers must support the **webRequest API** with event listeners for `onBeforeRedirect`, `onErrorOccurred`, and `onResponseStarted` to fully track network activities.
- WebSocket traffic monitoring (`ws://` and `wss://`) is available only on Chromium and Firefox platforms; Safari currently does not support this due to platform restrictions.

<Info>
If your browser does not support these required APIs or permissions, uBO Scope's ability to report network connections will be limited or non-functional.
</Info>

## Verification of Compatibility

To verify if your browser and system meet these requirements:

1. Confirm browser version:

    - **Chromium/Edge/Brave:** Go to `chrome://settings/help` or equivalent.
    - **Firefox:** Go to `about:support`.
    - **Safari:** Click `Safari > About Safari`.

2. Check for the required permissions during extension installation.
3. Confirm extension installs without errors and the toolbar icon appears.

If you encounter installation issues or missing functionality, please consult the [Resolving Common Installation and Usage Issues](#) guide.
</Check>

## Summary
uBO Scope supports the latest versions of Chromium-based browsers (122+), Firefox (128+), and Safari (18.5+). It requires a compatible OS capable of running these browsers and needs permissions including activeTab, storage, and webRequest to function effectively.

<Info>
For best results, keep your browser updated, and ensure uBO Scope's required permissions are granted during installation.

## Practical Tips

- Always verify your browser's version before installing uBO Scope to avoid incompatibilities.
- For Safari users, ensure macOS and Safari are updated to version 18.5 or later for full extension support.
- Note that WebSocket monitoring is currently unavailable on Safari due to platform limitations.

## Common Pitfalls

- Trying to install the extension on browsers older than the specified minimum versions will lead to failures or incomplete functionality.
- Ignoring extension permission requests will disable crucial monitoring capabilities.
