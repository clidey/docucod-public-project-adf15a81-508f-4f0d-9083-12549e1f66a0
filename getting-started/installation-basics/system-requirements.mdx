# Supported Browsers & Requirements

Ensure your environment is fully compatible with uBO Scope before installation to unlock its full power in revealing all network connections your browser makes. This page guides you through the supported browsers, required browser versions, and critical APIs that enable uBO Scope’s accurate monitoring.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is compatible with the major modern browsers, but due to its reliance on specific browser APIs for network request monitoring, you must meet the minimum version requirements listed below.

| Browser           | Minimum Supported Version |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Chromium-based    | 122.0 and above           |
| Firefox           | 128.0 and above           |
| Safari            | 18.5 and above            |

> These versions reflect the baseline needed to support the `webRequest` API behaviors that uBO Scope depends on for network insights.

### Why version matters

- **Chromium 122+** supports modern manifest and service worker background scripts essential for extension operation.
- **Firefox 128+** ensures full support for `webRequest` permissions and host permission scopes.
- **Safari 18.5+** is required due to Safari’s specific adoption of Manifest Version 3 and modern extension APIs.

If your browser version is older, uBO Scope cannot guarantee accurate network request capture.

## 2. WebRequest API and Permissions

uBO Scope uses the browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor network connections made by webpages. This API allows the extension to listen to events such as request initiation, redirects, errors, and successful responses.

### Key considerations:

- The API must report web requests regardless of other content blockers or DNS-level blocking.
- Requests made outside the scope of the `webRequest` API are invisible to uBO Scope. For example, some browsers or versions limit APIs for certain protocols or sandbox environments.

### Required permissions foruBO Scope:
- **`webRequest`**
- **`storage`** (for session data persistence)
- **`activeTab`** (to interact with the current tab)
- Specific **host permissions** covering all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS requests:
  - `http://*/*`
  - `https://*/*`
  - `ws://*/*` (WebSocket)
  - `wss://*/*` (Secure WebSocket)

These permissions are declared in the extension manifest and are mandatory for seamless monitoring.

## 3. Browser-Specific Notes

### Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Brave)

- Require minimum version 122.0 to support Manifest V3 service worker background scripts.
- WebSocket (`ws://` and `wss://`) requests are fully monitored.

### Mozilla Firefox

- Minimum version 128.0 supports all required APIs, including `webRequest` and host permissions.
- Mobile Firefox also supported at the same minimum version, enabling mobile use cases.

### Safari

- Minimum version 18.5 is required due to Safari’s gradual adoption of Manifest V3.
- Safari’s extension background script uses standard JavaScript modules.
- WebSocket monitoring is supported.


## 4. System & OS Requirements

While uBO Scope itself is browser-based and has minimal system requirements, your overall browsing environment should meet your browser’s system needs. The extension is compatible across Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems where the supported browsers run.

> No additional hardware or OS-level requirements are needed beyond your browser’s own.

## 5. Ensuring Accurate Monitoring

To get the most accurate and complete report from uBO Scope:

- Confirm your browser is updated to the listed minimum versions or higher.
- Avoid using browsers or environments that heavily restrict or do not expose the `webRequest` API (enterprise or kiosk modes may interfere).
- Understand that some network requests (e.g., made by apps outside of the browser or browser subprocesses not exposing `webRequest`) will not appear.

## 6. Verifying Browser Support

### Step-by-step:

1. Open your browser and navigate to its About page (e.g., `chrome://settings/help` for Chrome).
2. Check the current browser version.
3. Verify it meets or exceeds the minimum version for uBO Scope.
4. Confirm the browser supports extensions with Manifest V3.


## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **Using outdated browsers**: Extension installation might fail or not work correctly.
- **WebRequest API restrictions**: Some browsers or custom builds disable this API, leading to incomplete data.
- **Permissions denied**: Incorrect installation or denied permissions prevent data capture.
- **Enterprise policy restrictions**: Corporate environments may disable WebExtensions APIs.

If you encounter missing data or installation issues, check the Troubleshooting Installation guide for targeted help.

## Appendix: Manifest Extracts on Browser Support and Permissions

For transparency, here is the relevant excerpt of permissions and minimum versions from the main browser manifests:

```json
// Chromium manifest excerpt
{
  "minimum_chrome_version": "122.0",
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*", "wss://*/*", "ws://*/*"]
}

// Firefox manifest excerpt
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*", "wss://*/*", "ws://*/*"],
  "browser_specific_settings": {
    "gecko": {
      "strict_min_version": "128.0"
    },
    "gecko_android": {
      "strict_min_version": "128.0"
    }
  }
}

// Safari manifest excerpt
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*"],
  "browser_specific_settings": {
    "safari": {
      "strict_min_version": "18.5"
    }
  }
}
```

These directly affect compatibility and how comprehensive network metrics are reported by the extension.
