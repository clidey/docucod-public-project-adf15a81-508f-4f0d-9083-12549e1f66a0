# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Ensure you have the right environment and permissions before installing and running uBO Scope. This primer clarifies supported browsers, necessary permissions, and access prerequisites to guarantee a seamless start.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed for modern browsers that support Manifest Version 3 (MV3) extensions with robust `webRequest` APIs. It currently supports:

- **Google Chrome**: Version **122 or newer**
- **Mozilla Firefox**: Version **128 or newer** (including Firefox for Android)
- **Apple Safari**: Version **18.5 or newer**

Each browser requires MV3 compliance to leverage service workers or background scripts properly.

<Info>
If you are running an older version of your browser, the extension may not function correctly because it relies on updated browser APIs and permissions.
</Info>

## 2. Required Permissions

To capture and report network connections, uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions declared in its manifest:

- **`webRequest`**: To intercept network requests and observe their outcomes (allowed, redirected, blocked).
- **`storage`**: To maintain session data and cache domain information between usages.
- **`activeTab`**: To operate on the current active browser tab and gather relevant connection insights.

Additionally, the extension needs **host permissions** to monitor network requests issued from web pages:

- Permission to access URLs matching `http://*/*` and `https://*/*`.
- Some browsers (Firefox, Chrome) also include WebSocket permissions (`ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*`) to track WebSocket connections.

<Note>
The extension _does not_ require access to personal user data, browsing history, or credentials. Its focus is monitoring network request metadata.
</Note>

## 3. Browser API Support

uBO Scope depends on the following core browser APIs for its functionality:

- **`webRequest` API**: To observe detailed lifecycle events of network requests. This includes requests that succeed, are redirected, or encounter errors.
- **`storage.local` and `storage.session` APIs**: To read and write session information, including the Public Suffix List cache and tab connection data.
- **Extension's background service worker or background script**: To process incoming network events persistently.

<Warning>
Browsers that restrict `webRequest` API capabilities or run in limited privacy modes may cause uBO Scope features to be partially disabled or unavailable.
</Warning>

## 4. Minimum System Requirements

While uBO Scope is lightweight, ensure your system meets the following baseline for optimal performance:

- **Operating System**: Any OS supporting the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
- **Memory**: At least 100 MB of free RAM is recommended to manage ephemeral session data effectively.
- **Network Connectivity**: Requires internet access as it monitors live network requests.

Since uBO Scope runs as a browser extension, no additional installation dependencies are required beyond the supported browser.

---

## 5. User Account and Access

uBO Scope requires no special user accounts or login credentials. Installation and usage are fully self-contained within the browser environment.

Permissions to install extensions and access the specified host permissions must be granted during installation.

---

## 6. Common Compatibility Considerations

- **Browser Version**: Using the minimal or newer versions above is mandatory to ensure compatibility with MV3 and the extension's permission model.
- **WebRequest Coverage**: Some browsers limit what the `webRequest` API can see, especially for requests made by certain system components or private browsing modes. Results reported by uBO Scope will reflect what the browser exposes.
- **Multiple Content Blockers**: uBO Scope is designed to work alongside other content blockers or DNS-level blockers without conflict, as it relies on the browser's actual network events.

---

## 7. Summary Checklist Before Installation

- [ ] Running Chrome >=122, Firefox >=128, or Safari >=18.5
- [ ] Capable of installing MV3 extensions
- [ ] Willing to grant permissions for `webRequest`, `storage`, and access to all URLs
- [ ] Internet connectivity available

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Before You Begin

### Issue: Extension cannot access network details
- Ensure your browser version meets the minimum requirement.
- Verify no restrictive privacy or security settings block extension access.
- Confirm that `webRequest` permissions are granted and active.

### Issue: Extension badge does not update
- Some websites use non-standard protocols or browser features which may bypass `webRequest`.
- Network connections made outside the browser (e.g., system apps) are not visible.

<Tip>
If you encounter persistent issues with permissions or network events not being captured, consult the 'Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues' guide for detailed solutions.
