# Prerequisites & Supported Browsers

Before installing and running uBO Scope, it's essential to confirm your environment meets the minimal requirements. This ensures a smooth installation, proper functionality, and reliable reporting of remote server connections.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with the major modern browsers that support Manifest Version 3 extensions. Specifically, it fully supports:

- **Chromium-based browsers:**
  - Minimum version: 122.0
  - Examples include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge (Chromium), Brave
- **Mozilla Firefox:**
  - Minimum version: 128.0
- **Safari:**
  - Minimum version: 18.5


Each platform has a dedicated manifest file configuring platform-specific requirements and permissions.

> These minimum versions ensure compatibility with required extension APIs, especially `webRequest` for network monitoring.

## 2. Platform Compatibility & Permissions

uBO Scope requires access to specific browser APIs to monitor network requests accurately. The permissions manifest for supported browsers includes:

- **Permissions:**
  - `activeTab`: Access to the currently active tab to display results.
  - `storage`: To store session and configuration data.
  - `webRequest`: To intercept and analyze network requests in real-time.

- **Host Permissions:**
  - Access to all HTTP and HTTPS URLs (e.g., `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`).
  - For Firefox and Chromium, WebSocket URLs `wss://*/*` and `ws://*/*` are also included.

These permissions enable uBO Scope to accurately detect and log connections to third-party remote servers.

## 3. System Prerequisites

### Operating Systems

uBO Scope runs within the supported browsers on any platform where those browsers are available. There are no additional OS-level system requirements specific to the extension.

### Network Conditions

- Stable internet or intranet connection is expected to observe meaningful data.
- No special firewall or proxy configurations are required, but some network environments may limit WebSocket or HTTP monitoring.

## 4. How to Confirm Your Environment is Ready

### Step 1: Check Browser Version

- Open your browser.
- Navigate to:

  - Chrome/Chromium: `chrome://settings/help`
  - Firefox: `about:support`
  - Safari: `Safari > About Safari` (from the menu)

- Verify the version number meets or exceeds the required minimum.

### Step 2: Confirm Extension Compatibility

- uBO Scope is built upon Manifest Version 3 (MV3).
- Only browsers supporting MV3 extensions can run uBO Scope.
- Check browser documentation if unsure.

### Step 3: Verify Permissions and Settings

- Upon installation, uBO Scope will request permissions listed above.
- Grant the permissions fully to ensure accurate monitoring.

### Step 4: Confirm Network Accessibility

- Confirm your browserâ€™s network communication is not blocked by local firewalls or policies.
- Make sure WebSocket connections are allowed for Firefox and Chromium to support full network monitoring.

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Tips

- **Browser version too old:** Older browsers may silently fail to load or run uBO Scope.
- **Partial permissions:** Declining required permissions will limit functionality.
- **Incompatible browser:** Browsers without MV3 support or custom forks may not work.
- **Network restrictions:** Enterprise environments with strict policies can affect data reporting.

<Tip>
If you encounter issues during installation or initial usage, first verify your browser version and permissions before troubleshooting further.

## 6. Next Steps

Once you've confirmed your environment meets these prerequisites, proceed to [Installing uBO Scope](/getting-started/installation-basics/installing-ubo-scope) for actionable installation guidance. After installation, you can continue with [Activating and Accessing uBO Scope](/getting-started/getting-up-and-running/initial-launch-activation) to begin using the extension.
