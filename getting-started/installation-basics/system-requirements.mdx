# System Requirements & Browser Compatibility

Ensure your environment supports uBO Scope before installation to guarantee smooth operation and accurate connection reporting. This page helps you verify that your browser and system meet the necessary criteria.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed for modern browsers that support Manifest Version 3 extensions and the `webRequest` API. Below are the officially supported browsers and their minimum required versions:

| Browser        | Minimum Version | Notes                                         |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Google Chrome  | 122.0           | Requires Chrome 122+ for MV3 compatibility    |
| Mozilla Firefox| 128.0           | Firefox 128+ supports all required features   |
| Safari         | 18.5            | Safari 18.5+ with WebExtension MV3 support    |


### Important Compatibility Notes
- **Chromium-based browsers:** uBO Scope should work on any Chromium browser that supports Manifest V3 extensions with version 122 or later.
- **Firefox on Android:** Supported from Firefox 128.0 onwards.
- **Safari:** Requires strict minimum 18.5 due to extension API constraints.


## 2. System Prerequisites

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- **Operating System:** Any OS capable of running a supported browser (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS/iPadOS for Safari)
- **Browser Permissions:** uBO Scope needs the following permissions to operate:
  - `webRequest` access to monitor network traffic
  - `activeTab` to interact with the active browser tab
  - `storage` to save session data and public suffix lists
- **Network Access:** For first-time setup, access to fetch the Public Suffix List online is required (done automatically by the extension).


<Check>
Verify your browser version by navigating to your browser's "About" page or settings. Updating to the latest version ensures compliance.
</Check>

## 3. Platform-Specific Details

| Platform | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Chrome / Chromium** | Manifest Version 3 extension using a service worker background script (`/js/background.js`). Requires Chrome 122+. Permissions: `webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`. Host permissions include HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS schemes. |
| **Firefox** | Uses MV3 background service worker. Version 128 minimum. Permissions and host access similar to Chrome. Supports desktop and Android. |
| **Safari** | Uses a background script with MV3 manifest. Minimum version 18.5 required. Host permissions cover HTTP and HTTPS only (no WS/WSS).


## 4. Verifying Your Environment Is Ready

Follow these steps to ensure your setup supports uBO Scope:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Version">
Open your browser's About page:

- **Chrome:** Go to `chrome://settings/help`
- **Firefox:** Go to `about:preferences` > General > Firefox Updates
- **Safari:** Use `Safari` > `About Safari` from the menu
- Confirm your version is equal to or greater than the minimum required.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Permissions Support">
Ensure your browser supports extension permissions `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`.

This is standard on supported versions, but enterprise or privacy-focused builds may alter default permissions.

</Step>
<Step title="Test Extension Installation (Optional)">
Try installing uBO Scope from the official store for your browser (see links below). Once installed
- Click the toolbar icon; if the popup opens without errors, basic compatibility is confirmed.
- If you see errors related to permissions or background scripts, the browser likely does not meet requirements.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Browser Store Installation Links

To ensure you install the official and compatible version, use these trusted sources:

| Browser    | Store Link                                                                                     |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chrome     | [Chrome Web Store - uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox    | [Firefox Add-ons - uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)             |

## 6. Common Compatibility Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Below Minimum">
If your browser version is below the required minimum, uBO Scope will fail to install or load correctly.

**Solution:** Update your browser to the latest stable release.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Non-standard or Hardened Browsers">
Browsers focused on extreme privacy or custom builds may disable the `webRequest` API or block extension host permissions.

**Solution:** Confirm your browser supports extensions fully and permits the requested permissions. Consult your browser documentation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Safari Websocket Permissions">
Safari does not support `wss://` or `ws://` in host permissions for this extension, limiting visibility of websocket connections.

**Note:** This is a platform limitation; full websocket monitoring is available on Chromium and Firefox.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Restrictions During Setup">
The extension requires internet access during first run to fetch the up-to-date Public Suffix List, crucial for accurate domain parsing.

**Tip:** Ensure no firewall or network policy blocks the download from `publicsuffix.org`.
