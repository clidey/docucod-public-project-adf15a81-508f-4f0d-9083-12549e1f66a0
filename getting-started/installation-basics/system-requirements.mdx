# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Get started confidently with uBO Scope by ensuring your environment meets the necessary requirements. This page explains supported browsers, operating system compatibility, and required extension permissions to prevent setup blockers.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to deliver transparent insights into your browser's network activity. It supports the following major browsers with specific minimum versions and installation notes:

- **Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.)**

  - Installation: Available on [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum Firefox version: **128.0**
  - Installation: Available on [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum Safari version: **18.5**
  - Note: The Safari extension requires the latest macOS supporting this version.


> <Note>
> Ensure you update your browser to these minimum versions or higher to guarantee uBO Scope functions correctly.
> </Note>

## 2. Operating System Compatibility

Because uBO Scope is a browser extension, it inherits the compatibility of its supported browsers. It can therefore run on any operating system where these browsers are available:

- **Windows:** Supported for Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.
- **macOS:** Supported for Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari (minimum macOS version depends on Safari 18.5 availability).
- **Linux:** Supported for Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.
- **Android:** Supported on Firefox for Android (version 128.0 or higher).


> <Tip>
> Safari support is tied to macOS updates. Confirm your macOS version supports Safari 18.5 or newer before installation.
> </Tip>

## 3. Extension Permissions & Capabilities

To deliver its full network auditing functionality, uBO Scope requires specific permissions from your browser during installation. Understanding these permissions will help you trust the extension and anticipate its behavior.

### Required Permissions

- **activeTab:** Access information about the current active tab to track network requests originating from that page.
- **storage:** Store session and configuration data locally to maintain state between browser sessions.
- **webRequest:** Monitor network requests made by the browser to report and categorize connection outcomes.

### Host Permissions

- Access to all HTTP and HTTPS URLs (`http://*/*` and `https://*/*`) to monitor network connections from all websites.
- For Chromium and Firefox, also includes WebSocket URLs (`ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*`) to track WebSocket connections.


> <Info>
> uBO Scope functions by hooking into the browser's webRequest API, which requires broad host permissions to monitor network traffic accurately.
> </Info>

## 4. Important Considerations Before Installation

- **Browser Privacy Settings:** Certain privacy or security settings may limit the webRequest API's ability to intercept network traffic fully. Ensure your browser settings or other privacy extensions do not restrict extension permissions.
- **Content Blockers Interaction:** uBO Scope reports network requests regardless of content blockers in use; however, browsers differ in how they expose these requests to extensions.
- **Session Storage:** The extension relies on session storage to maintain network request data per tab. Persistent data is supported via local storage but primarily focuses on ongoing sessions.


> <Warning>
> Browsers occasionally update their extension APIs, which may temporarily affect uBO Scope's functionality until compatibility updates are released.
> </Warning>

## 5. Verification of Environment Compatibility

Before installing uBO Scope, verify your browser version and OS:

### Checking Browser Version

- **Google Chrome / Chromium-based browsers:**
  1. Open the browser.
  2. Go to `chrome://settings/help`.
  3. Confirm the version number is 122.0 or higher.

- **Mozilla Firefox:**
  1. Open Firefox.
  2. Go to `about:support` or `Help` > `About Firefox`.
  3. Confirm the version is 128.0 or higher.

- **Safari:**

  2. Go to `Safari` menu > `About Safari`.
  3. Confirm the version is 18.5 or higher.

### Checking Operating System

- **Windows:**
  1. Open `Settings` > `System` > `About`.
  2. Confirm you are running a supported OS version for your browser.

- **macOS:**
  1. Click the Apple menu > `About This Mac`.
  2. Confirm the macOS version supports Safari 18.5 if using Safari.

- **Linux:**
