# Supported Browsers & System Requirements

Ensure a smooth and reliable experience with uBO Scope by verifying your browser compatibility and system readiness. This guide details the supported browsers, minimum versions, operating system compatibility, and other essential requirements vital to leverage uBO Scope’s full capabilities.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed to function as a browser extension that tracks all network connections in real time. Compatibility varies per browser due to differences in browser APIs and their support for required features such as the `webRequest` API and Manifest V3.

| Browser       | Supported Version           | Notes                                    |
|---------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Google Chrome**  | Version 122.0 and later      | Chromium-based browsers supporting Manifest V3 are compatible. |
| **Mozilla Firefox** | Version 128.0 and later      | Full support including Android Firefox. |
| **Apple Safari**   | Version 18.5 and later       | Available as Safari Web Extension, but some API differences apply. |

<u>Key Details:</u>

- **Minimum version requirements** are explicitly defined in each browser’s extension manifest.
- Browsers older than these versions do not support uBO Scope due to API or security limitations.

<Tip>
Always use the latest stable version of your browser to ensure full support and security.
</Tip>

## 2. Operating System Compatibility

uBO Scope runs on all major desktop and mobile operating systems supported by the browsers listed above:

- Windows 10/11
- macOS 13 (Ventura) and later
- Linux distributions supported by the browser
- Android (Firefox only, Chrome on Android does not support extensions)
- iOS/macOS Safari 18.5 and later

<Note>
On platforms where browser extensions are limited or unsupported (such as Chrome on iOS), uBO Scope cannot run, as it relies on deep system and browser integration via extension APIs.
</Note>

## 3. Browser API Dependencies and Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific browser APIs and permissions to monitor all outgoing network connections:

- **`webRequest` API:** Captures detailed request and response events to detect allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.
- **Extension permissions:** Must include `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
- **Host permissions:** Set to allow monitoring of HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and secure WebSocket URLs (e.g., `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).

These dependencies ensure uBO Scope can accurately report every remote server connection made by the browser, regardless of other content blockers or DNS filtering mechanisms in place.

## 4. System Requirements

While uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension, please confirm your system meets these baseline requirements:

- **Memory:** At least 2 GB RAM recommended to maintain smooth browsing while running uBO Scope.
- **Disk space:** Minimal disk space usage, primarily for extension and cached data storage.
- **CPU:** Modern CPU compatible with your browser’s latest version.

These specifications align with your browser’s requirements since uBO Scope relies on browser integration rather than standalone application execution.

## 5. Points to Keep in Mind

- uBO Scope does not operate outside supported browser ecosystems.
- The extension works independently of other content blockers but depends on the browser’s `webRequest` API availability.
- Some browser vendors impose limitations on `webRequest` functionalities, which may affect precise monitoring results.

<Tip>
If your browser’s version is below the minimum required, update it promptly to enable uBO Scope and improve overall security.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

If you experience issues such as uBO Scope not activating or showing no data:

1. Confirm your browser meets the exact version minimum as outlined.
2. Check that the extension has the necessary permissions enabled.
3. Verify that your browser’s extension APIs, particularly `webRequest`, are not restricted or disabled.
4. On Safari, ensure the extension is enabled via Safari Extensions preferences.
