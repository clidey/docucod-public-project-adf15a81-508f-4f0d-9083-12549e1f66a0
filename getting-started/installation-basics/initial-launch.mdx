# Launching uBO Scope for the First Time

Welcome to your first steps with **uBO Scope** — a powerful browser extension that reveals all remote server connection attempts made by webpages. This guide will walk you through how to locate the extension icon in your browser's toolbar, open the popup interface, and understand what you'll see on your first launch.

---

## 1. Locating the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

Once you have installed the uBO Scope extension, the first step is to find its icon in your browser's toolbar. This icon serves as the gateway to accessing the extension’s detailed insights about network connections.

### Step-by-Step

1. **Open your browser** (Chromium-based, Firefox, or Safari).
2. **Look for the uBO Scope icon:**
   - The icon displays a distinctive logo in multiple sizes (16, 32, 64, 128 pixels).
   - It is typically positioned in the toolbar or address bar area next to the URL.
3. **If you don’t see the icon:**
   - For Chromium or Firefox, check under the extensions menu (puzzle piece icon) and pin uBO Scope.
   - For Safari, ensure you enabled the extension in Safari > Preferences > Extensions.

<Tip>
If the toolbar icon is missing, verify that the extension is enabled in your browser’s extension/add-ons manager.
</Tip>

## 2. Opening the uBO Scope Popup Interface

The core of uBO Scope’s user experience is the popup panel which presents real-time data about connections made by the active tab.

### How to Open

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
2. The popup window will appear immediately, overlaying a small panel anchored to the icon.

### What You Should See

Upon first launch, the popup shows key information:

- **Hostname Section:** Displays the current webpage's hostname and its domain. For example, if visiting `www.example.com`, you will see the decomposition between `www.` and `example.com`.
- **Summary:** The number of distinct third-party domains that the webpage has connected to.
- **Three connection outcome categories:**
  - **Not blocked:** Domains where connections were successful.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains blocked in a stealthy manner (not overtly visible as blocked).
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.

Each category lists connected domains along with a count representing the number of connections.

<Info>
The extension uses the browser's `webRequest` API to collect this information in real time.
</Info>

## 3. Understanding the First Launch View

The first time you open the popup, the UI might initially display a loading state, after which it populates with data.

### Details

- The header shows the active tab's hostname and domain parts.
- The summary reports the distinct number of connected domains.
- The allowed, stealth, and blocked categories are presented as sections with domain rows and counts.

### Example:

```plaintext
[ Popup Header ]
 www.      example.com

Summary:
 domains connected: 5

Not blocked:
 - cdn1.example.net (15)
 - fonts.cloudflare.com (4)

Stealth-blocked:
 - stealth.example.org (2)

Blocked:
 - tracker.badexample.com (7)
```

If no data is available, the popup displays "NO DATA" as a placeholder.

## 4. Tips for Your First Use

- **Visit different webpages** to see how uBO Scope tracks connections dynamically.
- Notice the **badge count on the toolbar icon** updates reflecting the number of distinct remote servers successfully connected.
- Use this information for privacy audits or to understand external connections your browser tab is making.

<Check>
You must have an active webpage loaded to see meaningful data in the popup.
</Check>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

If your popup does not show data or does not open:

- Confirm the extension is installed and enabled.
- Make sure your browser version meets the minimum requirements: 
  - Chromium 122 or higher
  - Firefox 128 or higher
  - Safari 18.5 or higher
- Reload the active browser tab to trigger the extension to capture data.
- Restart your browser to refresh extension state if needed.

<Warning>
The extension requires permissions to access webRequest data and tab information. Ensure these permissions were granted during installation.
</Warning>

## 6. What’s Next?

After successfully launching the UI and familiarizing yourself with the popup:

- Explore the [Toolbar Badge Explanation](https://your-docs-domain/overview/introduction-and-value/badge-count-meaning) to interpret the badge count meaningfully.
- Review the [Typical User Scenarios](https://your-docs-domain/overview/concepts-and-use-cases/primary-use-cases) to understand practical uses of uBO Scope.
- If you encounter installation issues, consult [Troubleshooting Installation Issues](https://your-docs-domain/getting-started/first-use-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues).

## Appendix: Technical Snapshot of the Popup Interface

The popup interface is defined in `popup.html` and enhanced by `popup.js`. Highlights include:

- Dynamic text updates of hostname and domain using Punycode decoding for international domains.
- Sections for allowed, stealth, and blocked domain lists, rendered from serialized session data.
- Loading state until data retrieval completes.

You do not need to interact with the technical implementation to achieve your goals but this knowledge can be useful for advanced troubleshooting or contributing to development.
