## 3. Verifying Successful Installation

Once installed, confirm uBO Scope is active and monitoring your browser connections:

1. Look for the **uBO Scope icon** in your browser’s toolbar. It typically looks like a magnifying glass over a network icon.

2. Click the icon to open the uBO Scope popup panel.

3. Open any website in a browser tab. The uBO Scope popup panel should:
   - Display the domain of the active tab.
   - Show a count of connected third-party domains.
   - List domains categorized as "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked."

4. The toolbar badge should show a numeric count representing distinct third-party domains connected by the tab.

<Tip>
If after installation the popup shows "NO DATA" or remains empty, try refreshing the current tab or opening a new tab and revisiting a website.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Installation Issues

  - In Chrome and Firefox, right-click the toolbar and select "Pin" or "Show" uBO Scope.
  - In Safari, ensure the extension is enabled in Preferences.

- **Permissions Denied:**
  - You may have declined essential permissions; reinstall the extension and accept permissions.

- **Unsupported Browser Version:**
  - Confirm your browser's version meets minimums. Update your browser if needed.

- **Conflicts with Other Extensions:**
  - Temporarily disable other privacy or security extensions to identify conflicts.
