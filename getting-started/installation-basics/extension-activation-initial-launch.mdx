# Extension Activation & Initial Launch

Welcome to your first step after installing uBO Scope. This guide walks you through activating the extension in your browser, making sure it’s easily accessible, and verifying that it is running properly. By completing these steps, you’ll gain immediate confidence in how to recognize uBO Scope in action and how to access its full functionality.

## 1. Pin the uBO Scope Extension to Your Browser Toolbar

Upon installation, the extension is installed but might not be visible in your browser's toolbar by default. Pinning it ensures quick and consistent access.

### How to Pin uBO Scope:

### For Chromium-based Browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave):
1. Click the puzzle-piece icon (Extensions) at the top-right of your browser toolbar.
2. Find “uBO Scope” in the dropdown list.
3. Click the pin icon next to it to move uBO Scope’s icon into the toolbar.

### For Firefox:
1. Click the hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) at the top-right.
2. Select “Manage Toolbar” or “Customize Toolbar.”
3. Locate the uBO Scope icon and drag it onto your main toolbar.
4. Click “Done” to save your changes.

### For Safari:
1. Open Safari’s Preferences (Safari > Settings).
2. Go to the Extensions tab.
3. Ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
4. Customize the toolbar to show the uBO Scope icon by right-clicking the toolbar and selecting 'Customize Toolbar', then drag the extension icon.

<Tip>
Pinning the extension ensures you can quickly glance at the live badge count and open the popup without navigating menus.

## 2. Access the uBO Scope Popup Interface

The popup is your window into the live summary and detailed information of third-party remote servers connected during your browsing session.

### How to Open the Popup:

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.

The popup window will appear showing:
- The current page’s main hostname.
- The total number of distinct domains connected.
- Sections listing domains categorized as **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

<Tip>
If the popup shows “NO DATA” shortly after opening, refresh the active tab or browse to a new page to start seeing activity.
</Tip>

## 3. Verify the Extension is Running Correctly

After activation, it’s important to confirm that uBO Scope is operational and reporting connections.

### Steps to Verify:

1. Open any website in a new tab (preferably one with known third-party content).
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup interface.
3. Verify the following:
   - The domain name of the site appears at the top.
   - The badge on the toolbar icon displays a number representing distinct third-party domains.
   - The popup lists domains under “not blocked”, “stealth-blocked”, or “blocked” categories.

### What Success Looks Like:
- A non-empty domain name shown in the popup header.
- A badge count appears on the toolbar icon (or it’s blank if no third-party domains are connected).
- Domains appear under the respective categories, with counts beside them.

<Tip>
The badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party domains your current tab connected to. A lower number generally indicates fewer external connections.
</Tip>

## 4. Understanding the Badge and Popup at First Glance

### The Badge:
- Displays distinct third-party remote servers connected.
- Shows a number or remains empty if no connections are detected.

### The Popup Sections:
- **Not Blocked:** Domains successfully connected.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where network requests were redirected or stealthily handled.
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed or were blocked.

This categorization lets you instantly assess how your browser and content blockers are handling remote connections.
