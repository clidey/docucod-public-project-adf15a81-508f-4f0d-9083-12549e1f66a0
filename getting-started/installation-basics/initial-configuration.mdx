# First Launch & Basic Configuration

Welcome to your first look at uBO Scope! This guide helps you open the uBO Scope popup, understand its interface, and confirm that the extension is properly activated and configured. You will learn how domains are categorized into allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked, plus how to interpret the badge counter on your browser toolbar.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

Once uBO Scope is installed, you can quickly access the connection report via its toolbar icon.

### Steps:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope toolbar icon:**
   - The icon displays the uBO Scope logo (colored badge icons for different sizes).
   - It is usually next to your address bar or in the browser's extensions panel.

2. **Click the icon to open the popup window:**
   - The popup displays current tab network connection statistics.
   - It loads automatically when you click the icon, showing live data for the active tab.

<Tip>
If you do not see the toolbar icon, ensure uBO Scope is enabled in your browser’s extensions manager. Refer to your browser's extension management UI for help.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the uBO Scope Popup UI

The popup presents a categorized view of remote server connections made by the active tab. It helps you visually assess which domains have been accessed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

### UI Sections:

- **Tab Hostname Header:**
  - Shows the hostname and domain of the current page in Unicode format.
  - If a subdomain is present, it appears on the first line, with the main domain below.

- **Domains Connected Summary:**
  - Displays the count of unique third-party domains connected to by the current tab.
  - A lower count means fewer third-party remote connections.

- **Domain Outcomes Sections:**
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were stealthily redirected or modified.
  - **Blocked:** Domains with network requests that were explicitly blocked or failed.

- **Domain Rows:**
  - Each domain listed shows the number of connection attempts as a badge.
  - Domains are listed alphabetically.

### What Each Category Means:

| Category        | Description                                                                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Allowed         | Remote servers contacted successfully from the active tab’s requests.                          |
| Stealth-Blocked | Connections that underwent stealthy redirects or other non-obvious blocking actions.           |
| Blocked         | Connections explicitly blocked or leading to errors (DNS or network failures).                 |

<Note>
Domains are presented in Unicode using punycode decoding, making international domain names readable.
</Note>

## 3. What the Toolbar Badge Means

- The badge number on the uBO Scope icon represents the **number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections** from the current tab.
- This count helps you gauge how many unique external servers the page is communicating with.

### Key Points:

- A **lower badge count** means fewer third-party servers contacted — often a sign of better privacy.
- Badge numbers update live as you browse different tabs and pages.
- The badge does **not** count blocked or stealth-blocked domains, focusing solely on successful connections.

<Tip>
Hover your mouse over the toolbar icon to see a tooltip with the count and information about the extension.
</Tip>

## 4. Confirming Initial uBO Scope Configuration

uBO Scope requires minimal configuration and works out of the box after installation. However, verifying its operation ensures you get accurate connection data.

### Verification Steps:

1. **Check Permissions:**
   - uBO Scope requires permissions including `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`. These are granted automatically during installation.
   - Confirm permissions in your browser extension settings.

2. **Verify Badge Appearance:**
   - Visit any website and observe the toolbar badge.
   - The badge should display a numeric count or be empty if no connections are reported.

3. **Open the Popup:**
   - Click the uBO Scope icon and observe the domain listing.
   - The hostname and domain should match the active tab.
   - Domains should appear categorized correctly into allowed, stealth, and blocked sections.

4. **Test Connection Reporting:**
   - Navigate to a site known to load third-party resources (e.g., a news site).
   - Watch the popup update dynamically with new domain entries.

<Warning>
If the badge never updates or the popup shows 'NO DATA', the extension might be disabled, lacking permissions, or the browser does not support required features. See Troubleshooting documentation for help.
</Warning>

## 5. How Domains Are Categorized Internally

Understanding domain categorization will help you interpret the reports presented by uBO Scope.

- Domains extracted and resolved using the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/), ensuring accurate identification of main domains from hostnames.
- Network requests are classified by their outcome:
  - **Success:** Recorded under Allowed.
  - **Redirects:** Counted under Stealth-Blocked as these might bypass normal blocking.
  - **Errors:** Such as failed DNS or network requests, recorded under Blocked.

## 6. Best Practices and Tips for First Use

- Start with familiar websites to validate the output.
- Observe badge changes as you navigate different tabs and pages.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your existing content blockers for richer insights.
- Remember, a low number of allowed connections typically means better privacy.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common First Launch Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues on First Launch">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA'">
- This occurs if uBO Scope has no network data for the active tab yet.
- Wait a few seconds after loading the page.
- Reload the tab or navigate to another site.
- Confirm extension is enabled and permissions are granted.
- Restart your browser if the problem persists.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Counter Does Not Appear or Update">
- Ensure uBO Scope is not disabled or hidden in the extensions toolbar.
- Verify that your browser supports the `webRequest` API and toolbar badges.
- Visit multiple websites to see if any connections are reported.
- See the Troubleshooting section in documentation for detailed steps.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Loads Slowly or Stalls">
- uBO Scope collects data asynchronously; slight delays are normal.
- Disable other conflicting extensions that might interfere.
- Clear browser cache and reload the tab.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
