# First-Time Configuration

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide will walk you through opening the uBO Scope popup for the first time, reviewing the initial permissions, and confirming that the extension is actively monitoring your network connections. You'll also learn what the badge counts and interface elements mean so you can confidently begin your network auditing journey.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

The uBO Scope popup is your main interface for viewing live network connection data per browser tab. Here's how to access it:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It uses the official uBO Scope logo.
2. Click the icon to open the popup window.
3. Upon opening, uBO Scope will load recent data about the current tab's third-party network connections, categorized by allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

<Tip>
If you don't see any data immediately, try refreshing the current tab to trigger new network requests.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Understanding Initial Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network requests:

- **Access to webRequest APIs:** This enables uBO Scope to capture and categorize network connection attempts.
- **Host permissions:** uBO Scope needs access to all HTTP and WebSocket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).

When installed following [Installing uBO Scope](/getting-started/installation-basics/installing-extension), these permissions are requested and granted automatically.

<Note>
If you experience issues seeing network data, ensure the permissions are enabled in your browser's extension settings.
</Note>

## 3. Confirming Active Monitoring and Badge Counts

Once uBO Scope is running and permissions are granted, it actively monitors all network connections initiated by web pages you visit.

### Badge Count on the Toolbar Icon

- The badge number represents the count of unique third-party domains contacted successfully by the current tab.
- An empty badge means no detected connections yet.

### Popup Interface Elements

The popup is divided into three main sections:

- **Not Blocked (allowed):** Domains that the browser connected to without restriction.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with connections that were redirected or partially blocked stealthily.
- **Blocked:** Domains with connection attempts that were explicitly blocked (e.g., via other content blockers).

Each section lists the domains involved and the count of requests made to them.

## 4. Step-by-Step First-Time Configuration Flow

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Browser Toolbar and Click uBO Scope Icon">
Find the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar and click it to open the popup interface.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Initial Popup Display">
Observe the summary and domain lists in the popup. Initially, you may see 'NO DATA' or no domains if no network activity has occurred.
</Step>
<Step title="Refresh Your Current Tab">
Reload the current webpage to start generating network connection data that uBO Scope can monitor.
</Step>
<Step title="Reopen the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon again to view the updated list of domains contacted by the page.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Toolbar Badge Count">
Look at the badge on the uBO Scope icon to see how many unique third-party domains were allowed for the active tab.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## 5. What to Expect Next

- The domain lists will populate as you browse the web, providing insight into third-party connections happening behind the scenes.
- Badge counts update live to reflect unique allowed domains seen per tab.
- The extension works alongside any existing content blocker you may have.

<Tip>
Remember, seeing no blocked or stealth-blocked domains can be a sign of either a very private browsing session or lack of network activity. Try navigating to different sites to see varied results.
</Tip>
