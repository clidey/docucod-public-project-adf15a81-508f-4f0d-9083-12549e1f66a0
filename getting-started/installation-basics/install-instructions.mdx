## 3. Understanding Required Permissions

During installation, uBO Scope requests several permissions necessary for its core functionality:

- **`webRequest`**: To monitor all network requests your browser makes, including allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.
- **Active Tab Access**: To access information scoped to the currently active browser tab.
- **Storage**: To save session data and filter data efficiently.
- **Host Permissions**: To access all HTTP(s) and WebSocket URLs for comprehensive monitoring.

These permissions are essential for providing accurate, real-time visibility into third-party network connections.
