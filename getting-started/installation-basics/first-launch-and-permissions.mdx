# First Launch & Permissions

Welcome to your first interaction with uBO Scope. This guide walks you through opening the extension for the first time, accepting the required permissions, and verifying that the extension icon and popup are functioning correctly in your browser toolbar. Ensuring these steps are completed properly guarantees that you will get accurate and reliable reports of network connections made by web pages.

---

## 1. Understanding Required Permissions

To effectively monitor and report network connections, uBO Scope requires specific permissions:

- **webRequest**: Allows the extension to listen to network request events inside the browser.
- **activeTab**: Grants the ability to access the active tab’s URL and interact with it.
- **storage**: Enables persisting data across sessions.

These permissions are essential for obtaining precise network connection outcomes, including allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked requests.

<Tip>
Missing any of these permissions will limit the extension's ability to report accurate or complete data. The extension cannot function properly without them.
</Tip>

## 2. Opening uBO Scope for the First Time

Follow these steps to open and initialize the extension:

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the Extension Icon in Your Browser Toolbar">
_uBO Scope adds a distinctive icon labeled 'uBO Scope' or 'uBlock Origin Scope' to your browser's toolbar._

- On Chrome and Firefox, look near the address bar or extensions menu.
- On Safari, confirm the icon appears in the toolbar area matching the version's requirements.
</Step>

<Step title="Click the uBO Scope Icon">
_Clicking the icon opens the popup interface (`popup.html`). This popup will display domains connected by the current tab and their connection statuses._

- If no data appears yet, proceed to the next step to confirm permissions.
</Step>

<Step title="Accept Permission Prompts">
_Your browser may prompt you to grant the extension access to webRequest and host permissions._

- Click _Allow_ or _Grant Access_ to authorize the extension.
- Without granting, uBO Scope will not receive the necessary network events.

<Warning>
If you dismiss permission requests accidentally, you must re-enable them via your browser’s extensions or add-on settings.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Reload Your Active Tab">
_uBO Scope starts capturing network connections after permissions are granted._

- Refresh the webpage in your active tab.
- The extension will intercept network requests and update the popup accordingly.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Verifying Extension Functionality

After permissions are accepted and the webpage is reloaded, confirm uBO Scope is working:

- Look for the badge count on the toolbar icon showing the **number of distinct third-party domains connected**.
- Open the popup to see these domains categorized as:
  - **Not Blocked** — Connections allowed without interference.
  - **Stealth-Blocked** — Requests that were redirected or stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked** — Requests that were outright blocked.

<Check>
The badge text updates dynamically to reflect the current tab’s active connections.
</Check>

If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or the badge remains blank after several reloads, review troubleshooting tips in the related documentation.

## 4. Common First-Launch Scenarios and Tips

- **No Badge or Popup Data?
**
  - Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extension manager.
  - Confirm you accepted all permission prompts.
  - Refresh the page after granting permissions.

- **Multiple Content Blockers?
**
  - uBO Scope works alongside content blockers like uBlock Origin, uBlock Origin Lite, or uBlock Origin Plus.
  - The extension relies on browser `webRequest` API events; it reports outcomes regardless of which content blocker handled the requests.

- **Permissions Revoked or Disabled?
**
  - If permissions are revoked manually, the extension cannot operate.
  - Revisit the extension’s settings in the browser to restore permissions.

## 5. Next Steps After First Launch

With the extension running and permissions accepted, you can:

- Explore the connections shown in the popup to understand third-party network requests.
- Refer to the **[Understanding Domain Status: Allowed, Stealth, Blocked](../guides/interpreting-results/understanding-domain-status)** page to interpret these results.
- Visit the **[Debunking Common Extension Myths](../guides/interpreting-results/debunking-common-myths)** to appreciate how uBO Scope clarifies content blocking realities.

## Appendix: Visual Reference of the Popup Interface

The popup shows network connection details organized into three outcome categories:

```html
<section id="summary">
  domains connected: <span>?</span>
</section>
<section class="outcome allowed">
  <h3>not blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
<section class="outcome stealth">
  <h3>stealth-blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
<section class="outcome blocked">
  <h3>blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
```

Each `.domains` contains a list of connected domains and their count, giving you a transparent view of the third-party network activity on the current page.

**By following this guide, your extension will be properly launched, granting the permissions it needs to offer you complete network connection visibility right from your browser toolbar.**
