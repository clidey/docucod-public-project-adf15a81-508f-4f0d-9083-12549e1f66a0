# Prerequisites and Requirements

Ensure that your environment is fully prepared to install and use **uBO Scope** for a seamless experience. This page covers the essential system requirements, browser support, necessary permissions, and environment considerations that lay the foundation for a trouble-free installation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is a modern browser extension built using Manifest Version 3 (MV3), requiring the latest browser capabilities for optimal function.

| Browser       | Minimum Version | Notes                                         |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Chromium-based| 122.0           | Includes Chrome, Edge, Brave, and others      |
| Firefox       | 128.0           | Desktop and Firefox Android                    |
| Safari        | 18.5            | Latest Safari supporting MV3                   |


> **Why these versions?** uBO Scope relies on the `webRequest` API's MV3-compatible features and service workers that are fully supported starting from these versions.


## 2. System Requirements

- **Operating Systems:** Any OS supporting the above browsers (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android for Firefox)
- **Memory:** Minimal, as the extension runs lightweight background scripts
- **Disk Space:** Negligible as the extension is small (roughly under a few megabytes)


## 3. Permissions Needed

uBO Scope requires explicit browser extension permissions to monitor and analyze network connections, detailed below:

- **`activeTab`** — Allows the extension to interact with the active browser tab.
- **`storage`** — Stores session data and persistent settings locally.
- **`webRequest`** — Monitors network requests to record connection outcomes.
- **`host_permissions`** — Grants the extension access to URLs with protocols:
  - `http://*/*`
  - `https://*/*`
  - `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*` (except on Safari, which only supports HTTP/S)


> uBO Scope does *not* collect or transmit your data externally; permissions are solely used to observe connections within your browser.


## 4. Browser Capabilities and Restrictions

- **Manifest Version 3 Compliance:** All targeted browsers must fully support MV3 extensions with service workers.
- **`webRequest` API:** Critical for the extension to detect and classify network requests as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- **Host Permissions:** The extension requires access to all HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket URLs to monitor network activity.
- **Safari Limitations:** Safari currently supports only HTTP and HTTPS host permissions, leaving out WebSocket monitoring.


## 5. Network and Security Considerations

- **Local Network Access:** Ensure no firewall or security software blocks WebSocket or HTTP/S traffic which uBO Scope monitors.
- **Browser Updates:** Keep your browser up-to-date to prevent incompatibilities.
- **Extension Stores:** Download uBO Scope only from official sources like the Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or the Apple Safari Extensions Gallery to guarantee authenticity and proper permissions.


## 6. Access and Accounts


- No user account or external service login is required. uBO Scope runs entirely within your browser context.

## 7. Summary Checklist Before Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Browser Version">
Confirm your browser is at or above the minimum supported version listed.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Permissions">
Ensure your browser allows extension permissions for `webRequest` and host access.
</Step>
<Step title="Stable Network Connectivity">
Check that your internet connection does not interfere with HTTP/S and WebSocket monitoring.
</Step>
<Step title="Install from Trusted Source">
Only use official extension stores for downloading uBO Scope.
</Step>
</Steps>


## Troubleshooting Prerequisites Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Problems">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope does not show connection data after install">
Verify that your browser meets minimum version requirements and that the extension has the necessary permissions enabled. On some browsers, you might need to manually grant host access after installing the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="WebSocket connections not reported in Safari">
Safari restricts WebSocket host permissions to `http` and `https` schemes only, preventing monitoring of `wss` and `ws` protocols. This is a known limitation affecting uBO Scope’s WebSocket tracking capabilities on Safari.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Blocked network requests are not showing correctly">
Ensure your content blockers or firewall settings are not interfering in unexpected ways. Also, check that uBO Scope has permissions to access the network requests; alternatively, try disabling conflicting extensions temporarily.
