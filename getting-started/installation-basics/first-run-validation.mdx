# First Run & Quick Validation

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide helps you confirm that your installation is successful and walks you through your first use of the extension. It focuses on interpreting the browser toolbar badge, opening the extension popup, and understanding key interface elements to verify that uBO Scope is actively monitoring third-party remote server connections.

---

## 1. Open uBO Scope After Installation

After installing uBO Scope, you should see its icon in your browser's toolbar next to the address bar.

### Steps:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope Icon** in your browser’s toolbar. It shows the extension's logo (a stylized shield).
2. **Click the icon** to open the popup interface.

<Check>
If you do not see the icon:
- Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser's extension manager.
- Pin the extension to the toolbar if it is hidden under the extensions menu.
</Check>

## 2. Understand the Toolbar Badge Count

One of uBO Scope's most important indicators is the badge count on the toolbar icon.

### What the Badge Represents:

- The badge number corresponds to the **count of distinct third-party remote domains** your currently active tab connected to successfully without being blocked.
- A **lower number indicates fewer third-party connections**, which often correlates with better privacy.

### What to Expect Initially:

- On a fresh tab or a simple webpage, the count may be **0** or very low.
- On content-heavy pages with many resources (such as news sites or social media), expect a higher count.

<Info>
Remember, this count is a **distinct domain count**, not the number of requests blocked or allowed. It helps reveal the variety of external connections rather than traffic volume.
</Info>

## 3. Inspect the Extension Popup Interface

The popup provides a detailed breakdown of the network connections for the active tab.

### Core UI Elements:

- **Hostname Display**: Shows the host of the currently active tab.
- **Summary Section**: Displays the total number of connected domains (matches the badge count).
- **Outcome Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains with allowed requests.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains that had requests stealth-blocked (requests redirected or hidden).
  - **Blocked**: Domains for which requests were outright blocked.

### How to Interpret:

- Domains listed under **Not Blocked** are actively communicating with the webpage.
- The **Stealth-Blocked** category typically represents connections that were redirected or obscured by content blockers.
- **Blocked** domains are those prevented from loading by content filters.

### Example Walkthrough:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
2. Observe the hostname at the top to confirm it matches your active tab.
3. Review the domains listed under each outcome section.
4. The number next to each domain shows the count of requests related to that domain.

## 4. Validate uBO Scope Operation on Any Webpage

To confirm uBO Scope is functioning properly, test on webpages with varying levels of external content.

### Validation Steps:

1. Open a webpage (e.g., https://example.com).
2. Click the uBO Scope icon.
3. Check if the badge count updates to reflect third-party domains contacted.
4. Review the popup breakdown for allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

<Tip>
Try visiting a popular news site or a social media page for a richer set of network requests.
</Tip>

### Troubleshooting:

- If the badge count never updates:
  - Refresh the page and try again.
  - Confirm that your browser supports the necessary permissions (activeTab, webRequest, storage).
  - Restart the browser to ensure the extension’s service worker is active.
- If the popup shows "NO DATA":
  - Ensure you are viewing a webpage and not a blank new tab.
  - Check for network connectivity.

- Explore the breakdown of connection outcomes to deepen your privacy awareness.
- Use uBO Scope alongside other content blockers to compare third-party domain counts.
- Visit the [Extension Setup & Configuration](../configuring-troubleshooting/basic-configuration) page to customize your experience.
