If direct store installation is not an option, you can manually build and load uBO Scope in your browser.

### Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with browser developer extension modes.

### Step-by-step Manual Install

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the Repository">
Open a terminal and clone the uBO-Scope GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
cd uBO-Scope
```
</Step>
<Step title="Install Dependencies">
Install the necessary Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install
```
</Step>
<Step title="Build the Extension Package">
Run the build script for your platform (chromium, firefox, safari):

```bash
./tools/make-package.sh chromium
```

This creates a `build/uBO-Scope.chromium` directory containing the extension files.
</Step>
<Step title="Load Extension into Browser">

#### Chrome (or Chromium-based browsers):

#### Safari:

- Open Safari _Develop_ menu.
- Choose _Show Extension Builder_.
- Add the built extension folder (e.g., `build/uBO-Scope.safari`).
- Follow Safari-specific guidelines to enable the extension.

</Step>
</Steps>
