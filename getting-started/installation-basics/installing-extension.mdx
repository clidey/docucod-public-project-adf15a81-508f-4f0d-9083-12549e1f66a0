## Step 2: Install for Your Browser

### Chrome / Chromium Browser

2. Click **Add to Chrome**.
3. Confirm any permission prompts to complete the installation.

2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Accept the permissions and allow it to install.

### Safari

## Step 3: Confirm Permissions & Access

uBO Scope requires the following permissions to function correctly:

- Access to active browser tabs
- Storage permissions for settings and session data
- Ability to listen to and inspect web requests (network activity)

Upon installation, your browser will prompt you to grant these permissions. Accepting them ensures uBO Scope can accurately report your network connections.

---

## Step 4: Locate uBO Scope in Your Browser Toolbar

- After installation, look for the uBO Scope icon (a shield with a scope design) in your browser's toolbar near the address bar.
- **Icon behavior:**
  - The icon badge shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected by the active tab.
  - Clicking the icon opens the uBO Scope popup interface where connection details per tab are displayed.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the icon immediately:
- In Chrome, check the extensions menu (puzzle piece icon) and pin uBO Scope.
- In Firefox, open the Add-ons panel and enable the icon in the toolbar.
- In Safari, ensure the extension is enabled in settings as detailed above.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Verify Installation Success

You can confirm uBO Scope is installed and working by:

1. Navigating to any website with network activity (e.g., a news site).
2. Clicking on the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
3. Observing the popup shows a summary of connected domains under "domains connected".

If a count of connected domains appears and detailed allowed, stealth, and blocked domain lists populate, the installation is successful.

<Check>
Successful installation indicators:
- uBO Scope icon is visible and interactive.
- Toolbar badge updates with a number reflecting distinct third-party connections.
- Popup displays domain lists categorized as "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked."
</Check>
