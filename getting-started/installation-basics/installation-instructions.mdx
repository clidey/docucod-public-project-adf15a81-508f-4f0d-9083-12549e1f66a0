## 1. Verify Browser Compatibility

Before beginning installation, confirm your browser version meets the minimum requirements:

| Firefox     | 128+            |

Check your browser’s version by visiting its About page or settings.

<Note>
Using unsupported browser versions can prevent uBO Scope from working correctly. Update your browser if necessary.

## 2. Installation Options by Browser

### 2.3 Installing on Safari

Safari requires a packaged extension distributed as a `.safari.zip` file.

## 3. Post-installation Confirmation

To confirm uBO Scope was installed correctly:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
2. Click the icon to open the popup interface.
3. Upon opening any webpage, the extension will display remote server connection counts and lists.
4. The popup will show categories:
   - **Not Blocked** – connections allowed
   - **Stealth-Blocked** – requests blocked stealthily
   - **Blocked** – explicitly blocked connections

If the popup shows "NO DATA" or stays empty after loading sites, try:
- Reloading the webpage.
- Checking the extension permissions (ensure webRequest permission is granted).

<Check>
A working installation shows live connection data reflecting network activity of the current tab.
</Check>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

- **Extension icon not visible**:
  - Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser extensions/settings page.
  - Some browsers hide new icons by default; pin it from the extensions menu.

- **Extension does not show connection data**:
  - Verify all required browser permissions (especially `webRequest`) are granted.
  - Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements.
  - Disable conflicting extensions that might interfere with network monitoring.

- **Manual install fails or is not accepted (Firefox / Safari)**:
  - Ensure the browser is set to allow extensions from outside the store.
  - For Safari, confirm you have proper code-signing and developer setup.
