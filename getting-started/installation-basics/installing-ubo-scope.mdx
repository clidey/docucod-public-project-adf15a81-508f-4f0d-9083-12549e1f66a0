## What Happens After Installation?

Once installed and enabled, uBO Scope immediately begins monitoring network requests on all open tabs. You will see a badge on the toolbar icon indicating the number of unique third-party domains connected to by the active tab.

- Lower badge counts indicate fewer third-party connections, usually reflecting higher privacy.
- Clicking the toolbar icon will open a detailed popup, showing distinct domains categorized by connection status: allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

This functionality works alongside any existing content blockers without interference.
