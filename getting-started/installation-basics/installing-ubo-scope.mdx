## 7. Advanced: Building uBO Scope Locally for Firefox

For technical users who want to compile and package uBO Scope manually for Firefox:

1. Ensure you have a Linux environment with `bash`, `zip`, and `jq` installed.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to its root directory.
3. Run:

```bash
./tools/make-firefox.sh
```

This script builds the Firefox XPI package in `build/uBO-Scope.firefox.xpi`.

4. Load the generated `.xpi` file into Firefox via **about:debugging** > **Load Temporary Add-on**.

<Tip>
This is useful for developers or users requiring a custom version or the latest updates not yet published in stores.
</Tip>
