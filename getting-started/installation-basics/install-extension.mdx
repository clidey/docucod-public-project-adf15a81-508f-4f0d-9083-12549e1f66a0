## 3. Confirm Permissions and Installation

uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor network requests and storage access. During installation, you will be asked to grant these permissions.

- Permissions include access to active tabs, web requests, and local storage.
- The extension uses the browser's `webRequest` API to intercept and report all network connections initiated by webpages.

You must accept these permissions for the extension to function properly.

## 4. Verify the Extension is Installed and Active

### Look for the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

1. After installation, locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It displays a stylized uBO logo.
2. If you do not see it, check your browser's extensions list and ensure uBO Scope is enabled.

### Inspect the Badge Count

- The badge number on the icon represents the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected for the active tab.
- A visible badge with a number (or empty if zero) indicates the extension is monitoring network requests properly.

### Open the uBO Scope Popup

1. Click the extension icon.
2. A popup panel appears showing connection summaries:
   - Domains connected
   - Categories of network request outcomes: not blocked, stealth-blocked, blocked

This panel confirms that uBO Scope is correctly tracking network connections.

<Check>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or does not open, try reloading the page or restarting the browser.
