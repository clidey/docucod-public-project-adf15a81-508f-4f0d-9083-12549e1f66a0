# System Requirements and Prerequisites

Before installing and using **uBO Scope**, it's crucial to ensure your environment meets certain requirements. This page helps you verify browser compatibility, operating system support, and essential preconditions for a smooth installation and operation.

---

## Supported Browsers

uBO Scope operates as a browser extension designed to provide comprehensive visibility into network requests made by your browser. It depends heavily on the modern browser APIs, especially `webRequest`, to track network connections.

### Supported Browsers and Versions

- **Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers**
  - Minimum version: **122.0**
  - Installation available through the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum version: **128.0**
  - Supports desktop and Android versions meeting the minimum version
  - Installation available on [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum version: **18.5**
  - Supports Safari's new WebExtension Manifest V3 implementation


<Note>
Compatibility depends on the browser fully supporting Manifest V3 extensions and the `webRequest` API. Browsers or versions lacking complete support for these APIs cannot run uBO Scope effectively.
</Note>

## Operating System Compatibility

Since uBO Scope is a browser extension, its OS compatibility follows the requirements of the compatible browsers:

- **Windows, macOS, Linux**
  - Supported on desktop because browsers are available for these OSes

- **Android**
  - Supported only on browsers like Firefox that implement Manifest V3 and expose required webRequest APIs

- **iOS / iPadOS**
  - Limited support due to restrictions in Safari and other browsers on these platforms

<Tip>
Check your browser's exact version and update to the minimum specified or above. For example, in Chrome, enter `chrome://settings/help` to view the version.
</Tip>

## Essential Requirements

### 1. Browser Permissions and API Support

uBO Scope requires the following permissions to monitor network activity:

- Access to all HTTP and WebSocket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`)
- Active Tab access
- WebRequest API
- Storage API for persisting session data

These permissions are requested during extension installation.

### 2. Network Conditions

- Internet access or a local intranet connection is needed for network requests to be observed.
- Ensure no aggressive proxy or firewall settings obstructing browser extension APIs.

### 3. Extension Environment

- Minimum **Manifest Version 3** support in your browser, as uBO Scope uses a service worker background script.
- JavaScript must be enabled and functioning in the browser.

## Verifying Your Setup

Follow these steps to confirm your environment is ready:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Your Browser and Version">
Ensure your browser is one of the supported browsers and meets the minimum version requirements.

- Go to your browser's About page.
- Verify the version number is at or above minimum requirements.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Browser API Support and Permissions">
- When installing uBO Scope, your browser will ask for required permissions.
- If no permission prompt appears or permissions are denied, extension will not function correctly.
</Step>
<Step title="Network Accessibility">
- Verify your system’s firewall or proxy settings allow web requests.
- Disable any conflicting extensions that might block or mask requests from uBO Scope.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Without proper browser API support or permissions, uBO Scope cannot detect network connections reliably. Using unsupported or outdated browsers will prevent the extension from working correctly.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues related to system compatibility, consider the following:

- **Extension fails to install**: Confirm browser version. Upgrade if necessary.
- **Permissions were denied**: Remove and reinstall extension, granting the required permissions.
- **No network data visible**: Ensure no network blockers interfere, try disabling other extensions.
- **Browser API limitations on mobile or iOS**: Understand that some platforms do not expose required APIs to extensions.
