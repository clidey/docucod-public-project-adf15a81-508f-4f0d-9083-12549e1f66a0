# Requirements & Supported Browsers

Welcome to the foundational guide for getting started with **uBO Scope**. This page details everything you need before installation: supported browsers, required permissions, system compatibility, and essential security considerations. Understanding these requirements ensures a smooth installation and optimal operation of the extension.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a modern browser extension compatible with the three major web browsers, leveraging their respective WebExtension APIs.

| Browser        | Minimum Version | Notes                                                                                         |
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Google Chrome / Chromium-based browsers** | 122.0           | Requires manifest v3 support; minimum version 122 due to extension API dependencies.     |
| **Mozilla Firefox** | 128.0           | Strict minimum version 128 on desktop and Android platforms.                                |
| **Apple Safari**    | 18.5            | Requires Safari 18.5 or later, leveraging Safariâ€™s WebExtension support with manifest v3.    |


These versions ensure full compatibility with uBO Scope's background scripts and permissions.

## 2. Required Permissions and Host Access

To function effectively, uBO Scope requires explicit permissions granted during installation.

### Permissions

- **activeTab**: Enables access to the active tab to monitor its network requests.
- **storage**: Allows reading and writing session data related to observed connections.
- **webRequest**: Core permission for monitoring all network requests initiated by web pages.

### Host Permissions (Scope of Network Monitoring)

- Access to all HTTP and HTTPS URLs, including WebSocket connections:
  - `http://*/*`
  - `https://*/*`
  - `ws://*/*`
  - `wss://*/*`

This broad host access is necessary to detect and report connection attempts to any remote server from loaded pages.

<Tip>
During installation, the browser will clearly prompt you to approve these permissions. These are standard and essential for any extension that monitors web traffic.
</Tip>

## 3. System Compatibility & Requirements

### Operating Systems

- **Windows 10 or later**
- **macOS 11 or later**
- **Linux (any modern distribution with supported browsers)**
- **Android (for Firefox mobile only, supporting WebExtensions)**

### Hardware

- Standard modern hardware capable of running the supported browsers smoothly.
- No special hardware acceleration or GPU resources required.

### Network

- Requires an active internet connection.
- uBO Scope does not require special firewall configuration but ensure the browser has unrestricted network access.

## 4. Security and Privacy Considerations

uBO Scope operates strictly as a passive observer of network requests - it does not modify or block content but reports connection attempts.

- There is **no access to page content or user data** beyond the domain names of remote servers connected.
- The extension does **not transmit collected data externally**; all analysis is performed locally within the browser.
- Permissions are limited to those necessary for monitoring requests, minimizing risk.

<Note>
Always install uBO Scope from trusted sources such as official browser extension stores (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Safari Extensions Gallery) to guarantee security.
</Note>

## 5. Browser-Specific Details

### Chromium-based Browsers

- Manifest v3-based extension using Service Worker for background processing.
- Minimum required Chrome version is 122 due to API dependencies.

### Firefox

- Designed for Firefox 128 and newer.
- Uses standard WebExtension background scripts.

### Safari

- Uses manifest v3 with ES module background scripts.
- Minimum Safari version 18.5 required.

Each platform manifest defines the necessary permissions and scripts under the hood, ensuring consistent behavior across supported browsers.

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- **Installing on unsupported browser versions:** Verify your browser version before installation to avoid compatibility problems.
- **Denying permissions:** The extension will not function if denied the necessary permissions (especially `webRequest`).
- **Using browsers without WebExtension API support:** uBO Scope requires browsers implementing the WebRequest API as indicated.

## 7. Verification & Next Steps

Once your browser and system meet these requirements, proceed with installation:

- Visit the proper extension store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari Extensions Gallery).
- Install uBO Scope and accept all permission prompts.
- After installation, launch the extension to grant any required runtime permissions (see [First Launch & Permissions](/getting-started/installation-basics/first-launch)).

For detailed installation and setup instructions, see the [Installing uBO Scope](/getting-started/installation-basics/installing-extension) page.
