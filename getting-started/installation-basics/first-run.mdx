# Launching and Using uBO Scope for the First Time

Welcome to your first exploration of uBO Scope! This guide will take you step-by-step through activating the extension popup, understanding the initial network request data, and verifying that uBO Scope is tracking your browser's third-party server connections correctly. By following this walkthrough, you will confidently confirm that uBO Scope functions as expected on your browser.

## 1. Accessing the uBO Scope Popup UI

uBO Scope relies on its popup interface to present live data about network connections initiated by your active browser tab. The popup is where you’ll find detailed summaries of third-party domains and their connection outcomes.

### Steps to Activate the Popup:

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon">
Find the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. It looks like a shield with the uBO Scope logo and shows a badge count reflecting the number of distinct third-party servers connected.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the uBO Scope Icon">
Click the icon to open the extension’s popup window. This triggers the interface where connection data is displayed live for the active tab.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the icon is not visible, ensure the extension is properly installed and enabled in your browser's extension settings.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface and Initial Data

Once the popup opens, you will see sections that group network connections by their outcome status. This helps you analyze which domains your active tab has connected to and their request results.

### Popup Components Explained:

- **Top Header:** Displays the active tab’s hostname and domain to contextualize the data.
- **Domains Connected Summary:** Shows the count of distinct third-party domains connected (the same as the toolbar badge).
- **Outcome Sections:** 
  - *Not Blocked (Allowed)*: Domains with successful connections.
  - *Stealth-Blocked*: Domains subject to stealth blocking (redirected or obscured requests).
  - *Blocked*: Domains where the connection was blocked or failed.

### What You Should See Initially:

- If you have just opened a website in the active tab, the popup should display the domains contacted by the webpage's requests.
- A clear number summarizing how many unique third-party domains were contacted.
- Lists of domains per outcome category, each showing domain names and the count of requests.

<Note>
If all sections show **NO DATA** or remain empty, it indicates uBO Scope hasn't recorded any network activity yet for that tab.
</Note>

## 3. Validating uBO Scope’s Core Functionality with a Simple Scenario

To confirm uBO Scope is working correctly, perform a simple live test on a popular website known to load third-party resources.

### Step-by-Step Validation Workflow:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Popular Website">
Navigate to a website such as https://example.com or any content-rich page known to load external resources.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the uBO Scope Icon to Open the Popup">
Open the popup UI to observe the network request data captured for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Data Shown in the Popup">
- Verify the header shows the correct hostname of the active tab.
- Check the “domains connected” count matches the badge number.
- Look at the domains listed under *not blocked* and confirm they make sense (e.g., cdn providers, trackers).
- Observe if any domains are listed under *stealth-blocked* or *blocked* — these reflect connections handled differently or blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Refresh the Page for Updated Network Logs">
Reload the page and open the popup again to see live updates as the extension records fresh network activity.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
To see a variety of connection statuses, try visiting websites with ads or content blockers enabled, which may increase blocked or stealth-blocked domains.
</Tip>

## 4. How to Interpret the Data and Recognize Normal Behavior

Understanding what the popup presents helps you gauge your network privacy posture and whether uBO Scope detects connections as intended.

- **A Higher Count in *Not Blocked* Indicates:**
  More third-party resources successfully loaded.
- **Presence of *Stealth-Blocked* or *Blocked* Domains Indicates:**
  Your browser or filters are actively managing or blocking some connections.
- **Mismatch Between Badge and Popup Count:**
  The badge counts distinct third-party domains with allowed requests only; the popup shows all outcome types.

<Info>
Remember that seeing some third-party domains is normal, as many sites rely on content delivery networks (CDNs) and analytics services.

## 5. Troubleshooting Tips for First Use

If uBO Scope does not appear to track any network requests, consider these checks:

<AccordionGroup title="Common First-Run Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="The Popup Shows ‘NO DATA’ After Loading a Website">
- Refresh the page once or twice.
- Verify the extension permissions to access page URLs are granted.
- Ensure you are on a supported browser version (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The Badge Count is Absent or Always Zero">
- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled and active on the current tab.
- Check for conflicting extensions that might interfere with webRequest API access.
- Restart the browser to reload the extension background scripts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Fails to Open or Load Properly">
- Try disabling and re-enabling the extension.
- Clear browser cache or reload extension.
- Inspect browser console for errors related to uBO Scope.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
