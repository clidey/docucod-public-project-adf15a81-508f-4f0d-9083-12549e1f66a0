# Prerequisites & System Requirements

To ensure a smooth installation and optimal functioning of **uBO Scope**, please review the following prerequisites and system requirements carefully. This will prepare your environment, align expectations, and avoid common pitfalls during setup.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to work seamlessly with modern browsers. It specifically supports the following:

- **Google Chrome / Chromium-based browsers**
  - Minimum version: **122.0**
  - Available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum Firefox version: **128.0**
  - Available on [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

- **Safari**
  - Minimum Safari version: **18.5**


> <Info>
> Always ensure your browser is updated to at least these minimum versions to guarantee full compatibility with uBO Scope’s features and APIs.
> </Info>


## 2. Operating System Compatibility

uBO Scope leverages browser APIs available through modern web extensions and is therefore supported
on any operating system where the supported browsers can run, including:

- Windows (latest versions)
- macOS (latest versions with Safari 18.5+ for Safari users)
- Linux distributions running supported browsers


> <Note>
> While uBO Scope does not impose additional OS-specific restrictions, the extension requires browser support for the `webRequest` API and **Manifest Version 3** extensions.
> </Note>


## 3. Browser Permissions and Access

During installation and use, uBO Scope requires the following permissions to monitor network connections effectively:

- **Host permissions:**
  - `http://*/*`
  - `https://*/*`
  - `ws://*/*`
  - `wss://*/*`

  These permissions allow the extension to observe all HTTP(S) and WebSocket network requests made by your browser.

- **Other permissions:**
  - `activeTab` — to interact with the currently active tab
  - `storage` — to save session data and cached information
  - `webRequest` — to observe and respond to network requests in real-time


> <Warning>
> No data is sent outside your browser. The permissions are strictly used to gather connection information locally.
> </Warning>


## 4. Browser Extension Environment

- **Manifest Version:** uBO Scope uses Manifest Version 3, which is now the standard for extension development, ensuring stronger security and performance.
- **Background scripts:**
  - Chrome and Chromium use a service worker background script (`service_worker`)
  - Firefox and Safari use a module-type background script

These differences are handled internally by the extension and require no action from the user.


## 5. Network and Browser Configuration Requirements

- **Network Access:** uBO Scope requires internet connection to function normally but does not transmit user data externally.
- **API Availability:** The browser must support the `webRequest` API with ability to observe network request outcomes.


> <Tip>
> Browsers running in strict privacy modes or with APIs disabled may limit uBO Scope's ability to report fully accurate network request data.
> </Tip>


## 6. System Resources and Performance

uBO Scope is lightweight and designed for minimal resource usage. However:

- It processes network request data continuously when tabs are active.
- Performance impact is negligible on modern hardware.

No explicit memory or disk space requirements are needed beyond those obligatory for the browser itself.


## 7. Limitations to Consider

- **Network requests outside browser scope:**
  - uBO Scope tracks *only* network connections as reported by the browser’s `webRequest` API.
  - Network activity initiated outside the browser or invisible to the API will not be reported.

- **Content blocker interference:**
  - uBO Scope observes connections regardless of other content blockers but relies on browser permissions.
  - Stealth blocking by other extensions or DNS-based blocking is detected as distinct categories in uBO Scope.


## 8. Summary of Requirements Checklist

<Check>
- Modern browser with minimum version as specified
- Installation permissions granted (host and webRequest)
- Browser supports Manifest Version 3
- Active internet/network connection
- No restrictive privacy settings disabling webRequest API
- Adequate system resources for typical browser use
</Check>

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| Extension cannot detect network requests | Browser version too low or API disabled | Update browser, ensure `webRequest` API enabled |
| Permission requests rejected | Incomplete install or disabled permissions | Reinstall extension, accept permissions fully |
| Interface shows no data or "NO DATA" | Extension not active on current tab or no network activity | Switch tabs with network requests, reload page |


<Tip>
If you encounter issues upgrading browsers or permissions, consult official browser support documentation.
