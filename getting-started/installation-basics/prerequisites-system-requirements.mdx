# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Ensure your environment is fully prepared before installing and using uBO Scope. This guide highlights the supported browsers and operating systems, key permissions, and technical requirements that guarantee the extension functions reliably.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with major browsers that support the WebExtensions Manifest Version 3 standard and the `webRequest` API. Below are the current officially supported browsers along with their minimum version requirements:

| Browser   | Minimum Version Supported | Notes                                      |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Google Chrome / Chromium | 122.0+                    | Requires Manifest V3 and `webRequest` support |
| Mozilla Firefox          | 128.0+                    | Supports required APIs on desktop and Android |
| Apple Safari            | 18.5+                     | Safari extension with specific minimum version |


<Note>
Older or unsupported browser versions cannot guarantee reliable operation due to missing or deprecated APIs. Ensure your browser is up to date before continuing.
</Note>

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

uBO Scope runs on all platforms where the above browsers are supported and meet their minimum version:

- **Windows** (latest versions compatible with Chrome and Firefox)
- **macOS** (requires Safari 18.5+ for Safari-specific support; Chrome/Firefox also supported)
- **Linux** (Chrome and Firefox support)
- **Android** (Firefox only, version 128.0+)


## 3. Required Browser Permissions

To monitor and report network connections accurately, uBO Scope needs the following permissions:

- `webRequest` — To observe the network traffic details across tabs.
- `activeTab` — To interact with and update information for the current active tab.
- `storage` — To store session data and Public Suffix List data for domain parsing.

These permissions enable deep inspection of network activity and update the extension’s UI and badge reliably.

## 4. Network API Support: WebRequest API

uBO Scope’s core functionality revolves around the browser's `webRequest` API. This API provides real-time events related to network requests, including redirects, errors, and successful responses. 

<u>Why this matters:</u>

- The `webRequest` API lets the extension see every connection attempt initiated by the browser.
- It requires browser support for this API at Manifest V3 level, which varies by browser and version.

Without this API, uBO Scope cannot detect network requests or update its badge correctly.

<Tip>
If you use a browser or platform that does not fully support the `webRequest` API, uBO Scope will not function as intended.
</Tip>

## 5. Browser Action and UI Behavior Requirements

- **Badge Support:** The extension uses the browser’s action badge (the icon in the toolbar) to display the number of distinct third-party remote domains with allowed connections.
- **Popup Support:** The extension popup displays categorized network outcomes, requiring HTML/CSS rendering consistent with latest WebExtension standards.


## 6. Summary of Key Requirements

| Requirement                  | Details                                      |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Browser APIs                 | Manifest V3, `webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab` |
| Minimum Browser Version      | Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+      |
| Operating System             | Windows, macOS, Linux, Android (Firefox only) |
| Network Permissions          | Host permissions for `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` URLs |


## 7. Preparing Your Environment

To ensure a smooth installation and operation:

1. Verify your browser version meets the stated minimum version.
2. Confirm your browser supports Manifest V3 extensions with `webRequest` API.
3. If installing on Safari, ensure macOS and Safari version meets the strict minimum (Safari 18.5+).
4. Confirm no conflicting extensions block `webRequest` API or override permissions.
5. Ensure network access is unrestricted, especially if behind corporate firewalls.

<Warning>
Disabling or limiting permissions such as `webRequest` or `storage` will reduce or break the extension’s functionality.
</Warning>

## 8. Additional Notes on Compatibility and Limitations

- uBO Scope can only track network requests that pass through the browser’s `webRequest` API scope. Requests made outside this scope (e.g., native apps or VPN-handled traffic) are not tracked.
- The extension supports both HTTP(S) and WebSocket (`ws`, `wss`) protocols, depending on platform and browser support.
- Extensions or content blockers that modify network traffic outside of the browser may affect data reported.

## 9. Next Steps

Once you have confirmed your environment meets these prerequisites, proceed to the [Installing uBO Scope](https://.../getting-started/installation-basics/extension-installation) guide to begin installing the extension.

## Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with Prerequisites and Environment">

<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
Check your browser's version by navigating to its About page. Update to the latest stable release to ensure compatibility with uBO Scope.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing Permissions or APIs">
Sometimes, permission settings or browser customizations block access to the `webRequest` API. Disable other extensions that might interfere, or try installing in a clean profile.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unsupported Browser or Platform">
If your browser or platform is not listed in the supported set, uBO Scope will not function correctly. Consider switching to a supported browser or updating your OS.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network or Firewall Blocking">
If your network environment restricts access to URLs or ports, the extension may fail to gather necessary data or update the Public Suffix List. Verify firewall settings allow standard HTTP(S) traffic.
