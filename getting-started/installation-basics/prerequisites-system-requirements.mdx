# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the following criteria before installing and using uBO Scope to guarantee a smooth setup and accurate functionality.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed to operate on major modern browsers, leveraging their native `webRequest` API for network monitoring.

| Browser       | Minimum Supported Version | Installation Source                              |
|---------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium-based| 122.0 and above           | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox       | 128.0 and above           | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)          |
| Safari        | 18.5 and above            | Safari Extensions Gallery / App Store           |

<Note>
The extension uses Manifest Version 3 and requires these minimum versions due to API dependencies, including the use of modern webRequest listeners and service workers.
</Note>

## 2. Platform Compatibility

- **Operating Systems:** Any OS running supported browser versions can run uBO Scope.
- **Device Types:** Desktop and laptop computers are fully supported.
- **Mobile Browsers:** Firefox Android requires minimum version 128.0; Chromium-based mobile browsers are not officially supported.

</Info>

## 3. Permissions Required

To function fully, uBO Scope requests the following permissions at installation:

- **`activeTab`**: Access data about the current active browser tab.
- **`storage`**: Store session data and configuration persistently.
- **`webRequest`**: Monitor and intercept network requests to report connection outcomes.
- **Host permissions:**
   - `https://*/*`
   - `http://*/*`
   - `wss://*/*`
   - `ws://*/*`

These allow uBO Scope to observe all your web page connections, including traditional HTTP/S and WebSocket traffic.

<Warning>
Provide these permissions only if you trust the extension since it monitors all network requests made by webpages.
</Warning>

---

## 4. System and Browser Settings

- **Network Access:** No special VPN or proxy settings are required; however, the browser must allow webRequest API access to network requests.
- **Firewall & Antivirus:** Ensure your firewall or security software does not block the extension's network monitoring functionality.
- **Browser Configuration:** No additional browser configuration is needed beyond the requested extension permissions.

---

## 5. Recommended Environment Best Practices

- Always use the latest stable version of your browser for maximum security and compatibility.
- Avoid running multiple conflicting content blockers simultaneously that might interfere with webRequest events.
- Confirm your browser allows extensions and that your security settings do not restrict their operation.

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting Before Installation

<Tip>
If you experience issues installing or running uBO Scope:

- Check you meet the minimum browser version requirements.
- Verify extension permissions during installation.
- Ensure no enterprise policies block extension installation.
- Disable conflicting extensions temporarily to check for interference.
</Tip>
