# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Before installing uBO Scope, it is important to ensure that your environment meets the necessary prerequisites for a smooth and reliable experience. This page provides you with clear guidance on supported browsers, minimum browser versions, required permissions, and network access essentials.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed to work seamlessly across the major modern browsers, leveraging the standard `webRequest` API available in these environments. Below are the currently supported browsers and their minimum version requirements:

| Browser          | Minimum Version | Notes                                  |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Chromium-based    | 122.0           | Includes Chrome and other Chromium browsers |
| Firefox          | 128.0           | Desktop and Firefox for Android        |
| Safari           | 18.5            | Requires macOS or iOS Safari 18.5+    |


### How to Check Your Browser Version

- **Chrome/Chromium:** Go to `chrome://settings/help`.
- **Firefox:** Open `Help > About Firefox`.
- **Safari:** Click `Safari > About Safari`.

If your browser does not meet these version criteria, update it before installing uBO Scope to ensure compatibility.

## 2. Permissions Required by the Extension

To provide accurate reporting on network connections, uBO Scope requests specific permissions that enable it to monitor and analyze requests made by webpages you visit.

### Permissions Explained

- **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to access the current active tab to detect network requests.
- **`storage`**: Enables persistent storage of session data and settings.
- **`webRequest`**: Grants the ability to observe network requests as they occur, essential for measuring connections.

### Host Permissions

uBO Scope actively monitors all network requests matching these patterns:

- **Chromium and Firefox:**
  - `https://*/*`
  - `http://*/*`
  - **Additionally for Firefox and Chromium:** websocket URLs `wss://*/*` and `ws://*/*` are included to track WebSocket connections. 

- **Safari:**
  - Supports only `https://*/*` and `http://*/*` URL schemes as per Apple's extension policies.

<Tip>
These permissions are carefully scoped to enable comprehensive and accurate monitoring without unnecessary wider access.
</Tip>

## 3. Internet Access Requirements

uBO Scope functions by observing network requests your browser initiates during web browsing. This means:

- **Active internet connection is required** for uBO Scope to detect remote server connections.
- It does not modify, block, or interfere with network requests but only reports on them.
- The extension relies on your browser's ability to access the web, so network restrictions like firewalls or VPNs that block traffic may reduce visibility.

### Best Practices for Reliable Operation

- Ensure your firewall or network security software allows your browser to operate normally.
- The extension requires that the browser's `webRequest` API is fully functional, which may be blocked or limited by privacy settings or aggressive security extensions.

<Warning>
If you use other content blockers or privacy tools, uBO Scope still reports connections as long as the browser exposes them via `webRequest`. However, any network activity hidden from the browser will not be visible to uBO Scope.
</Warning>

## 4. Platform-Specific Notes

| Platform  | Notes on Compatibility and Permissions                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chromium**  | Requires Chrome 122+ or Chromium 122+. Uses service worker background script. Full websocket monitoring enabled. |
| **Firefox**   | Requires Firefox 128+. Extension ID set to `uBO-Scope@raymondhill.net`. Supports websocket monitoring as well. |
| **Safari**    | Requires Safari 18.5+. Background scripts run as ES modules. WebSocket monitoring is not supported due to Safari API limitations. |
