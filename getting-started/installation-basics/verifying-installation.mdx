# Verifying Installation of uBO Scope

Ensure that your uBO Scope extension is correctly installed and enabled with this straightforward verification guide. Confirm the extension's presence, recognize the toolbar icon, and understand the badge indicator to start using uBO Scope confidently.

## 1. Confirm uBO Scope Installation

Follow these steps to verify that uBO Scope is installed and active in your browser.

### Step 1: Locate the Toolbar Icon
- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. The icon resembles a shield with the letters "uBO" inside, featuring a distinct color palette.
- Its appearance is consistent across Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari (minimum versions required). 

### Step 2: Extension Listing
- Open your browser’s extensions or add-ons page.
  - **Chromium (Chrome, Edge):** `chrome://extensions/` or via menu > Extensions
  - **Firefox:** `about:addons`
  - **Safari:** Safari > Preferences > Extensions
- Verify that "uBO Scope" (or "uBlock Origin Scope") appears in the list and is toggled on or enabled.

<Tip>
If you cannot find the icon, ensure the extension is installed correctly by revisiting the installation guide for your browser.
</Tip>

## 2. Understand the Toolbar Badge Indicator

The badge on the uBO Scope toolbar icon provides at-a-glance information about your browsing network footprint.

### Badge Meaning
- **Numerical Badge:** Shows the count of distinct third-party domains connected by your browser.
- **Empty Badge:** Indicates no third-party connections recorded for the active tab.

### What the Badge Tells You
- A **lower badge number** indicates fewer third-party connections, generally suggesting a smaller network footprint.
- The badge updates **in real-time** as you browse different pages.

<Info>
The badge count reflects only third-party domains, helping you assess your browsing privacy footprint independent of other content blockers.
</Info>

## 3. First Launch and Popup Confirmation

Check that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browsing.

### Step 1: Open the Extension Popup
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.

### Step 2: Review Popup Content
- You should see the page’s hostname at the top.
- Sections titled **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** will categorize domains based on connection outcomes.
- The domains list dynamically updates reflecting your current tab's network connections.

<Tip>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or remains blank on active web pages, this likely means the extension isn’t tracking network requests properly—verify permissions and try reloading the tab.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Quick Verification Issues

Address common issues that may prevent correct installation indication.

### Issue: Missing Toolbar Icon
- Ensure the extension is enabled in your extensions page.
- Check browser menus for hidden extensions.
- Restart the browser if necessary.

### Issue: Badge Does Not Appear or Update
- Confirm the extension has the required permissions (`webRequest` and host access).
- Refresh the active tab’s webpage to trigger network monitoring.
- Verify your browser version meets the minimum required version (Chromium >= 122, Firefox >= 128, Safari >= 18.5).

### Issue: Popup Shows No Data
- Make sure you have navigated to a valid webpage with network activity.
- Reload the page to ensure the extension records requests.
- If issues persist, try reinstalling the extension.

## 5. Summary

You have now confirmed that uBO Scope is installed, enabled, and functioning via visual confirmation of the toolbar icon, badge indication, and extension popup content.
