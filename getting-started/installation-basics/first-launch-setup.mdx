# First Launch & Configuration

Welcome to the first step in using **uBO Scope**, your essential tool for uncovering every network connection your browser attempts or establishes while viewing websites. This guide walks you through what happens when you activate the extension for the first time, how to access its key interface, and any initial settings or permissions you may encounter.

---

## What Happens on First Launch

Once you install uBO Scope, it integrates immediately with your browser's network stack. Upon activation, it:

- Begins monitoring all network requests initiated by your active browser tabs.
- Tracks connection outcomes, such as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked remote servers.
- Updates the toolbar icon badge to reflect the count of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to.

This process runs silently in the background without requiring further setup, allowing you instant visibility into your network activity.

## Accessing the uBO Scope Popup

The main user interface to view connection summaries is the extension's popup panel:

1. **Click the uBO Scope icon** in your browser toolbar. The icon usually looks like the product logo.
2. The popup will open, presenting an overview of connection data related to your active tab.

### Popup Panel Overview

- **Top Header**: Displays the hostname of the active tab or indicates if no data is available.
- **Domains Connected**: Shows the number of unique domains contacted from the page.
- **Connection Outcomes Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains and hosts where connections were allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where attempts were silently blocked (often by content blockers).
  - **Blocked**: Domains explicitly blocked.

This panel updates dynamically as you browse.

## Initial Permissions & Settings

uBO Scope requires certain browser permissions to function optimally:

- **ActiveTab**: To monitor network activity on the current tab.
- **WebRequest**: To listen to network requests and their outcomes.
- **Storage**: To save session data and the public suffix list.

### Granting Permissions

When you first launch uBO Scope:

- Your browser may prompt you to grant these permissions explicitly.
- Accept these permissions to enable full functionality.

<Tip>
If you decline permissions, uBO Scope cannot analyze network connections and will not display data.
</Tip>

### No Manual Configuration Needed

There are no additional manual setup steps or configurations required to start monitoring. uBO Scope’s internal architecture manages everything automatically after launch.

## Real-Time Integration with the Browser

uBO Scope integrates through the browser's `webRequest` API:

- It listens for all network requests matching permissions (e.g., https://*/*, http://*/*).
- Categorizes each connection attempt as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Updates the badge count per tab to give at-a-glance summaries.

## Troubleshooting Common First-Use Issues

### No Data Displayed in Popup

- Ensure you have granted all requested permissions.
- Refresh your active webpage.
- Try clicking the icon again.

### Badge Count Not Updating

- The badge count reflects distinct third-party domains connected. Visits to sites with no third-party connections will show no badge.
- Verify the extension is enabled and has active permissions in your browser’s extension settings.

<Tip>
If needed, restart your browser to ensure the extension activates properly.
</Tip>

### Popup Panel Shows 'NO DATA' on a Tab

- This means uBO Scope has not recorded any connection events for the current tab yet.
- Navigate to a webpage that loads external content to see data populate.

## Best Practices for Your First Use

- Start by visiting a few common websites (e.g., news, social media) to observe network requests.
- Use the popup panel to differentiate between allowed and blocked connections.
- Note the badge icon count change to understand third-party server visibility.

## Summary

By following these steps, you will have uBO Scope running and actively reporting your browser’s remote connections. The extension works automatically with no further configuration, giving you immediate insights through its popup panel and icon badge.
