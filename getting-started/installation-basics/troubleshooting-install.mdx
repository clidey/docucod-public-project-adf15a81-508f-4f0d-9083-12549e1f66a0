# Troubleshooting Installation

If you encounter issues during the installation of uBO Scope or do not see the expected UI elements after installation, this guide provides practical solutions and checks to resolve common problems. Whether you face browser compatibility challenges, missing permissions, or startup failures, follow these steps to ensure uBO Scope runs correctly and delivers accurate network monitoring.

---

## 1. Verify Browser Compatibility and Version

uBO Scope works exclusively with browsers that support the required APIs, particularly the `webRequest` API, and meet minimum version requirements.

### Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

- **Chromium-based browsers:** Version **122.0** or later.
- **Firefox:** Version **128.0** or later.
- **Safari:** Version **18.5** or later.

> Make sure your browser is updated to at least these versions to guarantee expected functionality.

### How to Check Browser Version

- **Chrome / Edge / Chromium:**
  - Go to `chrome://settings/help` or `edge://settings/help`

- **Firefox:**
  - Go to `about:support` and look for the "Application Basics" section.

- **Safari:**
  - From the Apple menu, select "About Safari."

## 2. Confirm Extension Installation and Permissions

Proper permissions are essential because uBO Scope relies on the `webRequest` API to monitor network connections.

### Verify Installation

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.

2. Click to open the popup; it should show domain connection statistics.

3. If the icon is missing:
   - Check your browser's extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions`) to confirm the extension is installed and enabled.

### Required Permissions

uBO Scope needs the following permissions to function:

- `activeTab`
- `storage`
- `webRequest`
- [host permissions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/host_permissions/) for HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs

> These permissions allow the extension to monitor all network requests made by pages in your browser.

### How to Check Permissions

- In your browser's extensions/settings page, review the permissions granted to uBO Scope.
- If permissions are missing or blocked, remove the extension and reinstall it from the official store to reset permissions.

## 3. Common Installation Issues and Fixes

### Issue: Extension Icon Does Not Appear

**Cause:** The browser may not have enabled the extension or it is hidden.

**Solution:**

- Go to your browser's extensions management page.
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
- In Chrome/Chromium, click the puzzle-piece icon and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.

### Issue: Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or No Domain Information

**Cause:**

- Extension startup incomplete
- Missing runtime permissions
- Browser version too low
- `webRequest` API blocked or unavailable

**Solution:**

- Reload the browser and open a new tab.
- Navigate to a website to trigger requests.
- Open uBO Scope popup again.
- If still no data, verify permissions.
- Check for conflicting extensions that may interfere.

### Issue: Badge Count Not Updating or Blank

**Cause:** Extension may have failed to monitor network requests.

**Solution:**

- Confirm browser version supports the required APIs.
- Restart the browser.
- Reinstall the extension from the official source.

<Tip>
Ensure you are visiting websites that initiate network requests for uBO Scope to detect connections. Blank results often occur on pages with no third-party network activity.
