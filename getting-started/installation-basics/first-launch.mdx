# First Launch & Verifying Installation

Welcome to the moment where your installation effort becomes real: verifying that uBO Scope has successfully installed and is actively monitoring your web traffic. This guide walks you through the essential checks to ensure uBO Scope is working as intended right from your browser toolbar.

---

## 1. Open the uBO Scope Extension

Follow these quick steps to access uBO Scope and confirm it is loaded:

1. **Locate the extension icon (toolbar badge):** Look at your browser's toolbar (usually at the top-right corner).
   - The uBO Scope icon resembles a shield or the extension logo you installed.
2. **Click the toolbar icon:** This action opens the uBO Scope popup panel.
3. **Observe the popup display:**
   - The header shows the current active tab’s hostname.
   - Sections are listed for **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** domains with connection counts.

<Tip>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or no domains connected, ensure you have freshly loaded a website after installing uBO Scope to generate network traffic.
</Tip>

## 2. Recognize the Toolbar Badge Indicator

The toolbar badge on the extension icon is your quick health check:

- **Badge number:** Displays the count of distinct third-party domains from which connections have been made by the active web page.
- **No badge or zero:** Means no third-party connections were recorded yet for the current tab.

The badge count is a direct measure of third-party remote servers contacted **but not blocked**. This number dynamically updates as you navigate across pages.

<Note>
A higher badge number indicates more third-party connections, which may or may not be desirable depending on your privacy filtering goals.
</Note>

## 3. Confirm Active Monitoring on Your Web Pages

uBO Scope works silently in the background, using browser network events to tally connection outcomes. You can confirm this real-time monitoring is functioning:

1. Open any typical webpage known to load multiple third-party resources (for example, news sites, online stores).
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon again.
3. Check if the popup shows domains under “not blocked” or other outcome categories.
4. See that the badge count updates accordingly on the toolbar icon.

<Tip>
Try visiting a site you trust with a variety of content or reload the tab after opening the popup to refresh connection data.
</Tip>

## 4. How It Works Behind the Scenes (Brief Overview)

While you do not need to know internal details to use uBO Scope, understanding the monitoring steps can boost confidence:

- uBO Scope listens for network activities using your browser’s webRequest API.
- Each network request is classified by outcome: **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked**.
- This data is tallied per tab and shown in real time via the badge and popup.

The extension tracks unique third-party domains contacted, updating the toolbar badge count to give you a straight, independent measure.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common First Launch Challenges

If your toolbar badge does not appear or shows zero consistently, check the following:

- **Verify extension is enabled:** Open your browser’s extensions page and ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
- **Reload web pages:** uBO Scope starts tracking from the time it is installed; reload pages to generate data.
- **Browser compatibility:** Confirm your browser meets minimum version requirements (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- **Permissions granted:** The extension requires webRequest and storage permissions; check no browser policy is blocking it.

<Warning>
Private/incognito mode may require separate enabling of uBO Scope if you want it active there.
</Warning>

If issues persist, consult the [Troubleshooting Installation & First Use](https://docs.ubo-scope/guides/core-usage-and-setup/troubleshooting-installation) guide.
