# First Launch & Permissions

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through what happens the moment you activate the extension for the first time — the permission prompts you will encounter, how the extension integrates into your browser, and how to verify that your initial setup is working correctly.

---

## 1. Understanding Permissions and Why They Matter

uBO Scope needs specific permissions from your browser to monitor remote server connections accurately. These permissions enable the extension to observe network requests as they happen, report outcomes, and present data intuitively.

### Permissions Required

- **Active Tab**: To collect data about the current tab's network activity.
- **Storage**: To save session and configuration data securely.
- **WebRequest**: To monitor all network requests your browser makes, including connections initiated by webpages.
- **Host Permissions**: Access to all URLs using HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS protocols (e.g., `https://*/*`). This allows monitoring of all web-accessible resources.

<Tip>
These permissions are essential for the extension’s core function: reporting which remote servers your browser connects to and the outcome of each request.
</Tip>

## 2. What Happens on First Launch

Launching uBO Scope for the first time will trigger the browser to ask for your consent to grant the permissions listed above. The exact prompts depend on your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), but the flow is similar:

1. **Install and Enable the Extension**
2. **Permission Request Popup**: Your browser will inform you about the network access and storage permissions the extension requires.
3. **User Consent**: You must allow these permissions for uBO Scope to function.
4. **Extension Badge Appears**: A small toolbar icon labeled “uBO Scope” (or its abbreviated form) appears.

### The Extension Badge

- Displays a numeric count indicating the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to through the active tab.
- It provides an immediate, visual summary of connection activity.

<Info>
The badge updates live as you browse and connections are made, with a lower count generally meaning fewer third-party connections.
</Info>

## 3. Confirming uBO Scope is Active and Working

Follow these steps to verify your extension is set up correctly:

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Badge
- Look for the extension icon in your browser toolbar; the icon matches the "uBO Scope" images detailed in the extension assets.
- If the icon is missing, ensure the extension is enabled in your browser's extensions management page.

### Step 2: Open the Extension Popup
- Click on the uBO Scope icon.
- The popup will appear showing summary information:
  - The hostname of the current active tab.
  - Counts of domains categorized under "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked."

### Step 3: Verify Data is Displayed
- Initially, on a new tab or a blank page, you may see "NO DATA," indicating no network activity has been recorded yet.
- Browse to any website. The popup will then begin to populate with connection data.

<Tip>
If no data appears after visiting a site, refresh the page and reopen the popup. Sometimes network request data is collected asynchronously.
</Tip>

## 4. Typical First-Use Scenario

Imagine you just installed uBO Scope and want to check which remote servers a news website connects to:

1. Open your browser and navigate to your favorite news site.
2. Click the uBO Scope badge icon.
3. You'll see the domain names listed under "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked," with counts of individual connections.
4. The badge number reflects how many distinct third-party servers were connected during that page load.

This immediate feedback tells you which external servers engage with the site, providing powerful insight into third-party tracking and resource loading.

## 5. Best Practices & Tips

- **Keep Permissions Enabled:** Disabling permissions will prevent uBO Scope from reporting accurately.
- **Check Browser Compatibility:** Ensure you meet minimum browser versions (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- **Don’t Rely on Badge Alone:** Dive into the popup for detailed per-domain information.
- **Manage Extension Visibility:** Pin the icon on your toolbar for quick access.

<Warning>
If you deny permissions during the first launch, uBO Scope cannot function until permissions are granted. You may need to remove and reinstall or adjust permissions manually in the browser extension settings.
</Warning>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues on First Launch

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues on First Launch">
<Accordion title="Extension Icon Doesn't Appear">
- Verify the extension is properly installed in your browser.
- Ensure the extension is enabled and not blocked by your browser or antivirus software.
- In some browsers, manually pin the extension to the toolbar.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Prompt Didn’t Show or Was Denied">
- Check your browser’s extension permissions page.
- Re-enable the necessary permissions, or consider reinstalling to re-trigger the prompt.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' Even After Browsing">
- Refresh the web page and then open the popup again.
- Try browsing to a site with known network activity.
- Make sure no network restrictions block webRequest events.
- Restart your browser and try again.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Is Zero or Incorrect">
- The badge counts distinct third-party domains, not total requests.
- Some connections may be blocked by other content blockers or network filters.
- Confirm that the browser supports the webRequest API fully.
</Accordion>
