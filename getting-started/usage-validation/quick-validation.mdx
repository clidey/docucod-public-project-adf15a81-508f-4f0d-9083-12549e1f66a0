# Quick Validation: Confirming uBO Scope Is Working

Welcome to the uBO Scope quick validation guide. This page helps you verify that uBO Scope is actively tracking your browser's network requests and correctly displaying connection data for the websites you visit. Follow the simple workflow below to ensure your installation is fully operational and that the extension is delivering its core value: insightful visibility into your browser's remote network connections.

---

## 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup

- **Locate the uBO Scope icon** on your browser toolbar. This is typically next to the address bar and represented by the uBO Scope logo.
- **Click the icon** to open the popup window.

### What You Should See
- A large header showing your current tab's hostname and its effective domain.
- Sections labeled **Not Blocked**, **Stealth-Blocked**, and **Blocked**, each listing domains.
- A summary indicator showing the total number of connected domains.

<Tip>
If the popup shows "NO DATA", it means uBO Scope has not yet gathered any connections for the current tab. This is expected initially or on blank tabs.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Navigate to a Dynamic Website

- In the active tab, **visit a website with dynamic and diverse external content**—for example, a news site, a social media platform, or a popular web app.
- Allow the page to fully load and interact with it if necessary (e.g., scrolling, clicking links).

### Why a Dynamic Site?
Dynamic websites trigger multiple network requests to various third-party domains, providing rich data for uBO Scope to observe and track connections.

---

## 3. Observe the Popup Updates

- **Reopen or refresh the uBO Scope popup** to see the updated network data.
- Check that the **hostname and domain fields** now display the site you visited.
- Look for populated lists under **Not Blocked**, **Stealth-Blocked**, and **Blocked** domains.
- Verify the **summary count** of connected domains reflects the number of distinct third-party connections.

### Understanding the Outcome Sections
- **Not Blocked**: Domains from which your browser successfully received content.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains that were redirected or blocked in a way that is less visible.
- **Blocked**: Domains explicitly blocked by content blocking mechanisms.

<Tip>
The summary count corresponds to the number of distinct domains from which network connections were allowed for the site you visited. A higher count means more third-party connections.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Verify Badge Count on Browser Toolbar

- Notice the **badge number appearing on the uBO Scope icon in your toolbar**.
- The badge count shows the number of **distinct allowed third-party domains for the active tab**.

<Tip>
If the badge does not update to a number or remains blank, try refreshing the tab or visiting another site with active external content.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Quick Validation">  
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data">  
If the popup displays 'NO DATA' after visiting a site with external resources:
- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled and installed correctly.
- Refresh the current tab to trigger new network requests.
- Wait a few seconds and reopen the popup as data updates asynchronously.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Badge Count Remains Empty or Static">  
- Ensure you are on a site that performs network requests to third-party domains.
- Disable other conflicting extensions temporarily to check for interference.
- Restart the browser if the badge does not update after navigation.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Allowed, Stealth, or Blocked Sections Are Empty">  
- Some sites may have few or no third-party connections.
- Try different websites known to load ads, CDNs, or trackers.
- Make sure your content blocker or network settings do not prevent request reporting.
</Accordion>  
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Confirming Operational Status: What Success Looks Like

- The popup clearly lists domains under the respective categories.
- The hostname and domain correspond to the active tab's website.
- The toolbar badge shows a numeric count reflecting current connections.
- New network activity from additional browsing is reflected shortly in the popup and badge.

<Check>
A successful quick validation confirms uBO Scope is fully functioning and capturing your browser’s network request outcomes in real time.
</Check>

## Appendix: Example Walkthrough

**Example:**

1. Click the uBO Scope icon on your browser.
2. The popup shows 'NO DATA'.
3. Go to `https://news.ycombinator.com` and let the page load.
4. Click the uBO Scope icon again.
5. You see `news.ycombinator.com` as the domain.
6. Lists of domains appear under "not blocked" and possibly "blocked".
7. The badge in the toolbar now shows a number, e.g., '12'.

You have confirmed uBO Scope is tracking and displaying network requests correctly.

## Additional Tips

- uBO Scope updates data asynchronously, so slight delays in popup updates are normal.
- Reloading a tab or navigating to a new site refreshes network tracking immediately.
- Install uBO Scope in a supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+) for full compatibility.
