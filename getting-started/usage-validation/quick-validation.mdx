# Quick Validation Checklist

This page provides a straightforward, practical checklist to quickly confirm that uBO Scope is correctly capturing and reporting network activity. Use these simple steps to verify that the extension is operational and reflecting real-time third-party connection data for the webpage you are browsing.

---

## 1. Reload the Webpage

1. Navigate to any webpage you want to check.
2. Reload the page fully (press F5 or use your browser’s reload button).

> Reloading ensures that all network requests are made afresh and properly captured by uBO Scope.

## 2. Observe the Toolbar Badge Count

- After the reload completes, look at the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
- The badge will show a number representing the **count of unique third-party domains successfully connected to** during the page load.

> A non-zero badge number indicates uBO Scope is tracking network connections.

## 3. Open the Extension Popup

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
- Review the data shown for the current active tab:
  - The main domain name is displayed prominently at the top.
  - Sections labeled **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** will list domains contacted by the page.
  - Each domain includes the number of requests seen.

> This detailed view confirms uBO Scope is collecting connection outcomes accurately.

## 4. Verify Badge Count Matches Popup Summary

- Confirm the badge number reflects the count of "not blocked" domains in the popup.
- The number at the top summary in the popup corresponds to the total unique domains seen.

> This synchronization helps confirm consistent data representation.

## 5. Test with Different Websites

- Repeat steps 1 through 4 on multiple websites, including those with varied third-party content (e.g., news sites, retail stores, blogs).
- Different badge counts and domain listings will demonstrate uBO Scope’s responsiveness to real network activity.

## 6. Check for Common Issues

- If the badge remains empty (no number) after reloading pages known to have third-party content, verify:
  - The extension is enabled and active.
  - Browser permissions for `webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab` are granted.
  - Your browser version is supported (Chromium v122+, Firefox v128+, Safari v18.5+).

- Reinstall the extension or review the [First Launch & Permissions](./first-launch-setup) guide if problems persist.

## Practical Tips

- Use the Quick Validation Checklist regularly after installation or browser updates to ensure uBO Scope remains fully operational.
- Remember the badge count represents **unique third-party domains contacted**, not the number of blocked or allowed requests.
- If the data seems unexpectedly low or high, try validating on well-known sites with extensive third-party content as a sanity check.

### Callout

<Check>
Reload the page and watch the badge count change dynamically. A change confirms uBO Scope is observing your network requests.
</Check>

<Info>
If you see a consistent zero or no badge even after visiting sites rich in third-party content, you likely need to review installation, permissions, or browser support.
