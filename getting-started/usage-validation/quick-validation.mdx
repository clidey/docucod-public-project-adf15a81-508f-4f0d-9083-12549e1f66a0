# Quick Validation: Is It Working?

This guide helps you quickly confirm if **uBO Scope** is actively tracking network connections on the current webpage. You'll learn how to open the popup UI, understand the badge count on the browser toolbar icon, and interpret the information shown for various websites—including counts of third-party servers causing connections.

---

## 1. Accessing the uBO Scope Popup UI

The popup UI is your window into real-time connection tracking data collected by uBO Scope.

### Steps to Open the Popup:

1. Locate the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser's toolbar. It looks like a small shield or the uBO Scope logo, depending on your browser.
2. Click on the icon once. This action opens the popup UI showing connection details about the active tab.

> <Check> If you do not see the extension icon:
> - Make sure uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
> - Check your browser's extension management to pin or reveal the icon.

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The badge displayed on the uBO Scope icon serves as a quick health check indicating the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected by the current webpage.

- **Badge Number**: Represents **the count of distinct allowed third-party domains** with successful connections.
- **No Number/Blank Badge**: Means no allowed third-party remote server connections detected yet.

### Practical Example:

- A badge showing "3" means the page has connected to three different third-party domains.
- Lower numbers generally indicate fewer third-party servers accessed, which often means less tracking or resource loading.

## 3. Interpreting the Popup UI Contents

The popup UI breaks down third-party connection outcomes into three categories, presenting clear insight into what happens behind the scenes.

### Popup Sections:

| Section          | Meaning                                                 | Description                                                              |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**  | Allowed connections                                      | Lists domains where network requests succeeded and were allowed.         |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Stealth-blocked connections                            | Lists domains where connections were stealthily blocked (hidden from the site).|
| **Blocked**      | Blocked connections                                      | Lists domains explicitly blocked by content blockers or network errors.  |

### Reading the Popup Data:

- At the top, you'll see the hostname of the active tab.
- Below the hostname, a **summary line** shows the total number of connected domains (third-party servers) the page accessed.
- Each section lists domains with a count badge indicating the number of individual network request hosts encountered under that domain.

> <Tip> Hover over or look closely at domain names to understand specific third-party connections.

## 4. Confirming uBO Scope is Tracking Connections

To verify uBO Scope is working correctly:

### Steps:

1. Open a well-known website with multiple third-party connections, e.g., `https://www.nytimes.com` or `https://www.wikipedia.org`.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
3. Confirm the badge count is a positive number indicating the number of third-party domains connected.
4. In the popup:
   - Check that domains appear under the **not blocked** section (typical third-party services).
   - Confirm there may be entries under **stealth-blocked** or **blocked** based on your system and blockers.

### What You Should See:

- The hostname of the current page at the top.
- The summary line shows the count of connected domains.
- Sections populate dynamically with domains and their request counts.

> <Note> Some websites have very few legitimate third-party requests, often limited to CDN domains, while others may have many third parties. Seeing data here validates uBO Scope is monitoring network activity.

## 5. What Different Websites Show in uBO Scope

uBO Scope categorizes third-party connections using the **Public Suffix List** to accurately group domains.

- **Simple Sites With Few Third Parties:** Might show only 1-2 domains in "Not Blocked", for example a CDN.
- **Complex Sites (News, Social Platforms):** Typically show multiple third-party domains including analytics, ads, social widgets.
- **Privacy-Oriented or Highly Blocked Environments:** Expect more entries in the **stealth-blocked** or **blocked** sections.

This variation helps you understand how many remote servers your browser is connecting to, giving a clear picture beyond standard ad block counting.

## 6. Troubleshooting Quick Validation

If no data or badge count appears:

- Confirm uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your browser.
- Make sure you have reloaded the active tab after installing.
- Check that the site is loaded over HTTP/HTTPS (or WebSocket protocols supported).
- Try opening the popup on different websites known for third-party resources.
- Verify your browser permissions allow the extension to access network requests.

If issues persist, refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](getting-started/usage-validation/troubleshooting-installation) guide.
