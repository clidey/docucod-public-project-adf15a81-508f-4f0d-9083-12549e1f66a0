# Configuration: No Setup Needed

uBO Scope is designed to work seamlessly **without any manual configuration or setup**. As a lightweight companion extension, it operates fully out of the box, delivering immediate insights into network connections as soon as it is installed.

---

## Why No Configuration Is Required

uBO Scope automatically captures and reports third-party remote server connections using the browser’s native WebExtension APIs. This means:

- **Zero user action needed:** The extension listens for network events across active tabs transparently.
- **Automatic classification:** It categorizes network requests into `allowed`, `stealth`, or `blocked` outcomes internally.
- **Instant visibility:** Users can instantly see relevant connection data in the popup panel without any additional setup or permissions.

This hands-free design lowers the barrier to meaningful network insight and helps users focus on understanding their web exposure immediately.

## How uBO Scope Collects Data Automatically

1. **Listening for Network Requests**
   - The extension registers listeners on the browser’s network requests API (`webRequest`) to observe outgoing connections.
   - These listeners track all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket (where supported), and related network traffic to remote servers.

2. **Aggregating Connection Outcomes in Real-Time**
   - Each connection attempt is recorded along with its outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked).
   - Hostnames and domains are parsed and normalized using the Public Suffix List for accurate categorization.

3. **Session State Management**
   - Connection data is maintained per browser tab, automatically resetting with new main frame navigations.
   - The extension leverages browser session storage to persist and manage this information during the browsing session.

4. **UI Updating Without User Intervention**
   - The toolbar badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party domains currently connected, updating dynamically.
   - The popup interface is populated live with categorized domain lists, ready to review at any time.

## What to Expect When You Use uBO Scope

- The extension icon on your browser toolbar immediately indicates connection counts.
- Clicking the icon opens a clear, categorized popup listing domains connected during the active tab session.
- Categories include:
  - **Not blocked**: Domains with allowed requests.
  - **Stealth-blocked**: Domains with stealthily blocked requests.
  - **Blocked**: Domains with outright blocked requests.

No buttons, settings, or permissions need manipulation. The extension simply starts working from the moment it is installed.

## Practical Tips for Immediate Success

- **Keep the extension enabled:** To continue collecting data, ensure uBO Scope remains active in your browser.
- **Refresh tabs after installation:** To see network data for pages already open before installation, refresh or navigate to new pages.
- **Use supported browsers:** uBO Scope supports modern Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari with minimal browser prerequisites.

## Common Questions

### Can I customize what uBO Scope tracks or shows?

No. uBO Scope is intentionally minimalistic and non-configurable to ensure simplicity and reliable reporting.

### Do I need to grant special permissions?

The extension requests permissions required for network request observation by design, but no additional user input or configuration is required.

### Will uBO Scope interfere with my content blockers?

No. uBO Scope passively monitors network requests and reports outcomes from other content blockers without altering them.

### How often is data refreshed?

Connection data updates dynamically within a short delay (about 1 second) after network events to reflect real-time activity.

## Troubleshooting Tips

If you do not see network data immediately:

- Ensure the extension is properly installed and enabled in your browser.
- Refresh the current tab or open a new tab to trigger data collection.
- Verify your browser version meets uBO Scope’s minimum requirements.
- Check for possible browser restrictions on extension permissions or network monitoring APIs.
