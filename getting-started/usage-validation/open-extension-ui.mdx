## Why Access the Popup?

The popup window is your central dashboard for understanding the number and types of third-party connections initiated by the webpage you are visiting. By clicking the toolbar icon, you surface a detailed breakdown of all distinct remote domains your browser contacted — including those allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked — empowering you to make informed decisions about your privacy and content blockers.


## Step-by-Step Instructions to Open the Extension Popup

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon">
Find the uBO Scope icon on your browser's toolbar. It is typically displayed as a stylized shield or badge symbol representing the extension. It may show a numeric badge indicating the number of distinct third-party connections detected on the current page.

- The icon is visible once uBO Scope is installed and active.
- Depending on your browser, you might need to pin it if it is hidden in the overflow menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Click the uBO Scope Icon">
Click directly on the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup window.

- The popup will open anchored below or beside the icon.
- It loads connection data related to the currently active tab instantly.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Popup Content Loading">
When the popup opens, it might show a brief loading state, then display summary information:

- The main heading shows the hostname and domain of the webpage.
- Sections list domains categorized as "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked," along with the count of connections for each domain.
- A summary shows the total number of distinct third-party domains connected.

Ensure this data appears correctly to confirm proper extension functionality.
</Step>
</Steps>

## What You See in the Popup

The popup provides a clear, categorized list of third-party domains:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains successfully connected without interference.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were quietly blocked without raising errors.
- **Blocked:** Domains whose connections were explicitly blocked or failed.

Each domain entry displays how many connection attempts were recorded, giving a quantitative sense of network activity.


## Practical Tips

- **Ensure the Webpage is Fully Loaded:** Connection data populates after page load; opening the popup too early may show partial results.
- **Check for Permissions:** If the popup does not open or shows no data, verify you have granted necessary permissions during installation.
- **Refresh the Page:** For updated connection data, reload the page and reopen the popup.


## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Access and Data Display">
<Accordion title="Popup Does Not Open When Clicking the Icon">
- Verify uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Confirm the toolbar icon is visible and not hidden.
- Restart your browser to resolve temporary glitches.
- Check for browser restrictions or policies preventing popup display.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup Opens but Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists">
- Ensure you have allowed the extension to access the active tab (permissions).
- Wait for the page to fully load before clicking the icon.
- Reload the active tab and reopen the popup.
- Confirm you are browsing on supported browsers: Chromium (v122+), Firefox (v128+), or Safari (v18.5+).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating or Showing Zero">
- Badge counts reflect distinct connected domains detected; if the site makes no third-party connections, zero is normal.
- Refresh the page to capture the latest network activity.
- Check that no other security software is interfering with extension operation.

## Behind the Scenes (Optional Insight)

- The popup dynamically requests data from the extension's background processes to summarize network activity of your current tab.
- This data updates based on web requests tracked by the “webRequest” API and categorized into allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked groups.

Although technical details are abstracted away, understanding the expected flow helps diagnose popup behaviors if issues arise.
