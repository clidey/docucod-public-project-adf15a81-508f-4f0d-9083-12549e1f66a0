# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide helps you quickly resolve common issues encountered during installation or the first use of **uBO Scope**, such as missing permissions, unsupported browsers, or when no data appears in the popup. Follow these practical steps to get your extension running smoothly and ensuring accurate reporting of third-party network connections.

---

## 1. Verify Browser Compatibility and Version

**Why it matters:** uBO Scope relies on modern browser features and webRequest APIs supported by Chromium (version 122+), Firefox (version 128+), and Safari (version 18.5+).

### Steps:

1. Check your browser and its version:
   - **Chromium-based browsers:** Go to `chrome://settings/help` or equivalent.
   - **Firefox:** Navigate to `about:support` or use the menu.
   - **Safari:** Check the “About Safari” menu.

2. Confirm your browser version meets or exceeds the minimum requirements:
   - Chromium 122.0 or later
   - Firefox 128.0 or later
   - Safari 18.5 or later

3. If outdated, update your browser to the latest stable release.

<Tip>
Running an unsupported or outdated browser version will prevent uBO Scope from collecting and displaying network connection data.
</Tip>

## 2. Confirm Extension Permissions

**Purpose:** uBO Scope needs explicit permissions to listen to network requests and store session data.

### What to Check:

- Permissions granted include `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
- Host permissions cover all HTTP/S and WebSocket URLs as applicable to your browser.

### How to Verify and Fix:

1. Open your browser's extensions/settings page.
2. Locate **uBO Scope** and click on its details.
3. Confirm the permissions listed under "Permissions" and "Site access" cover:
   - `activeTab`
   - `storage`
   - `webRequest`
   - Host permissions such as `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, and `wss://*/*` (Chromium)
   - For Firefox and Safari, confirm the host permissions match their manifest.

4. If any required permissions are missing, remove and reinstall the extension from the official store:
   - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
   - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

<Tip>
Reinstalling the extension refreshes permissions and solves many issues stemming from incomplete or corrupted installs.
</Tip>

## 3. Check for Extension Conflicts or Browser Settings

**Issue:** Other extensions or strict browser privacy settings can interfere with uBO Scope's access to network events.

### What to do:

1. Temporarily disable other privacy or content-blocking extensions.
2. Verify the browser does not block extension APIs or restrict network event access.
3. Check that the browser’s tracking protection or privacy mode does not prevent webRequest reporting.

<Tip>
uBO Scope requires webRequest API access, which can be limited or disabled by some strict security or privacy configurations.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Resolving “No Data” in the Popup Interface

If the popup displays **NO DATA** or does not update:

### Step-by-step:

1. **Reload the current tab:**
   - Network events are populated per active tab once the extension records network requests.
2. **Ensure the tab is a web page with network requests:**
   - uBO Scope tracks outbound network requests; static tabs or internal browser pages will show no data.
3. **Check that the extension badge is present and shows a count:**
   - An empty badge or missing icon indicates the extension may not be active or properly installed.
4. **Restart your browser:**
   - This often clears transient issues, especially if service workers or background processes failed.

<Tip>
If the popup UI remains empty across multiple tabs, verify permissions and browser compatibility as described in previous sections.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Unsupported Browser or Feature Limitations

### Common scenarios:

- **Safari users:** Older versions may have limited or no support for the `webRequest` API. Use Safari 18.5 or later.
- **Chromium users:** Minimum Chrome version is 122; older versions will not support required service worker APIs.
- **Firefox users:** Minimum Firefox version is 128 to align with manifest and API capabilities.

---

## 6. Inspect Background Script and Network Logs (Advanced)

For power users or maintainers:

1. Open browser developer tools for extensions:
   - Chromium: `chrome://extensions/` > Enable Developer mode > Inspect background page
   - Firefox: About Debugging > This Firefox > Inspect for uBO Scope
2. Look for console errors or warnings related to messaging or storage.
3. Network requests outside the scope of `webRequest` API won't be visible.

## Appendix: Understanding Extension Permissions in uBO Scope

Each browser manifest for uBO Scope includes a set of permissions and host permissions necessary for its operation:

| Browser | Key Permissions | Host Permissions |
