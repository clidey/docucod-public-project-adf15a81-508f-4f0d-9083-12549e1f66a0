# Understanding Connection Data

This page demystifies the summary of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains presented in the uBO Scope extension popup. It clarifies how to interpret the badge count and the categories of connections you see on your first use — helping you gain clear insight into what your browser is doing in terms of third-party connections.

---

## 1. Overview of Connection Data

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, you see a popup that summarizes the network activity related to the active browser tab. This summary breaks down connections into three key categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed Domains)**
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains**
- **Blocked Domains**

Additionally, the popup header displays the number of distinct third-party domains contacted, which corresponds to the badge count on the extension icon.

These categories help you understand which remote servers your browser attempted to connect with, which ones were allowed, and which were blocked by content blockers or network errors.

---

## 2. What Each Category Means

### Not Blocked (Allowed Domains)
This section lists all third-party domains for which your browser successfully established a connection. These are remote servers contacted by the webpages that you visited, and no blocking was performed on those connections.

- The count next to each domain shows how many times connections were established during the page lifecycle.
- The total number of distinct allowed domains directly updates the badge count on the toolbar icon.

> **Tip:** A lower number here generally means fewer third-party connections, which aligns with better privacy and efficiency.

### Stealth-Blocked Domains
These domains represent third-party connections that were **stealth-blocked**. Stealth-blocking is a subtle blocking technique where network requests are intercepted and canceled quietly without notifying the webpage or showing typical block indications.

- These connections were prevented from loading but in a way that tries to avoid detection by websites.
- The stealth-blocked list helps you see which domains are silently blocked by extensions or privacy mechanisms.

> **Tip:** Seeing entries here implies active content blocking working behind the scenes to protect your privacy.

### Blocked Domains
This category lists domains where connection attempts failed, usually due to explicit blocking by content blockers or network errors preventing the request.

- Unlike stealth-blocking, these are explicit blocks or failures reported by the browser.
- The presence of blocked domains confirms that certain third-party resources were denied access during page load.

> **Note:** Some domains may appear in both stealth and blocked categories depending on how their requests were handled at different times.

## 3. Interpreting the Badge Count

The badge count reflects the **number of unique allowed third-party domains** your browser connected to from the current tab.

- This count excludes domains that were blocked or stealth-blocked.
- A smaller badge count generally indicates fewer third-party servers contacted, which usually signals better privacy.
- The count only represents domains, not the total number of requests.

Understanding this helps you assess the real impact of content blockers. For example, a larger block count elsewhere does not necessarily mean better privacy because what matters is how many third-party domains are allowed to load content.

## 4. Practical Walkthrough

Follow these steps to interpret your connection data in the popup:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the connection summary popup for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Header for the Base Domain">
Observe the top area showing the current tab's base domain (e.g., example.com). This is the site you are visiting.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Domains Connected Count">
Notice the number next to “domains connected” — this is how many distinct third-party domains your browser contacted (allowed).
</Step>
<Step title="Explore the Allowed Domains Section">
Look at the 'not blocked' list to see all unique third-party domains your browser fetched resources from.
- Each row shows the domain and the number of connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Scroll to the 'stealth-blocked' section to discover domains where network requests were silently blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Blocked Domains">
Finally, review the 'blocked' section for domains where connections were explicitly denied or failed.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Best Practices & Tips

- **Regularly check connection data:** Use the popup to verify the privacy impact of visited pages.
- **Understand the difference between blocking modes:** Stealth-blocking is less visible but equally important in controlling unwanted requests.
- **Don't rely solely on block counts:** Focus on the number of allowed domains (badge count) rather than how many requests were blocked for a true privacy assessment.
- **Refresh popup after loading:** The data updates dynamically but may reflect network events only after some delay.

## 6. Common Questions & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Asked Questions">
<Accordion title="Why do some domains appear in both allowed and blocked lists?">
Some third-party domains may have both successful connections and blocked attempts during the same page load due to redirects, multiple resources, or timing of blocking rules.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The badge count is zero, but I see domains listed in stealth/blocked sections. Why?">
The badge count only reflects allowed domains (successful connections). Stealth-blocked and blocked domains do not count toward the badge.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The popup shows 'NO DATA' or is empty. What should I do?">
- Make sure you have properly granted all permissions on first launch.
- Ensure the tab has active web requests after loading.
- Reload the page to trigger fresh network events.
- Consult the 'First Launch & Permissions' guide if issues persist.
