# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

Unexpected problems during installation or initial use of uBO Scope can slow you down. This guide addresses frequent setup issues like the popup not showing data, the badge count not updating, or the extension missing from your browser's toolbar. Follow the steps below to identify and fix these common problems swiftly.

---

## 1. The Popup Does Not Display Any Data

### Symptoms
- Clicking the uBO Scope icon opens the popup, but it remains blank or shows 'NO DATA'.
- Domain lists (allowed, stealth, blocked) are empty even after browsing.

### Causes & Solutions

1. **Extension Not Properly Installed or Enabled**
   - Confirm the extension is installed via your browser’s extensions/add-ons page.
   - Ensure uBO Scope is enabled.

2. **Insufficient Permissions Granted**
   - uBO Scope requires `webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab` permissions.
   - Reinstall from the official source if permissions were declined during installation.

3. **Browser Compatibility Issues**
   - Supported browsers: Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+ (desktop & select mobile).
   - Verify you are running a supported version.

4. **No Network Requests Captured Yet**
   - Visit or reload a few websites after installation to generate data.
   - Ensure browsing activity happens on HTTP/HTTPS or WebSocket protocols.

5. **Session Data Not Loaded or Corrupted**
   - Reload the browser or disable and re-enable the extension to reset any session state.

### How to Verify
- After browsing a few sites, open the popup and check if domain counts appear.
- The badge on the extension icon should also update to show the number of third-party domains connected.

<Check>Please reload a webpage after installing or restarting the extension to ensure data collection begins.</Check>

## 2. The Badge Count on Toolbar Does Not Update

### Symptoms
- The numeric badge remains blank or stuck at zero despite active browsing.

### Causes & Solutions

1. **Browser Action or Toolbar Hidden**
   - Some browsers hide extension icons if not pinned.
   - Pin uBO Scope in your toolbar or customize the toolbar to show the icon.

2. **Permissions or Network Restrictions
**
   - Confirm that uBO Scope has permissions for `webRequest` and `activeTab`.
   - Some privacy settings or firewalls may block network event monitoring.

3. **Browser or Extension Cache Issue**
   - Restart the browser to clear transient extension issues.
   - If problem persists, remove and reinstall the extension.

4. **Background Service Worker Not Running Properly**
   - The extension’s background script monitors requests — it can be disrupted if the browser suspends the service worker.
   - Reopening your browser or refreshing the active tab usually restores functionality.

### How to Verify
- Watch the badge as you browse various sites with multiple third-party embedded resources.
- If it remains static despite browsing, check permissions and reload the extension.

<Warning>If you use aggressive privacy-enhancing tools or VPNs, they might interfere with `webRequest` events and cause the badge count to not update correctly.</Warning>

## 3. The Extension Does Not Appear in Your Browser

### Symptoms
- After installing, uBO Scope icon is missing from the browser toolbar.
- You can’t find uBO Scope listed in your extensions.

### Causes & Solutions

1. **Installation Was Not Completed or Was Interrupted**
   - Install exclusively from the official store for your browser:
     - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
     - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

2. **Browser Version Is Unsupported**
   - Verify your browser is updated to meet minimum version requirements:
     - Chrome 122+
     - Firefox 128+
     - Safari 18.5+

3. **Browser Profile or Sync Issues**
   - Sometimes profiles or sync issues cause extensions to appear missing.
   - Restart the browser or try installing in a new browser profile.

4. **Extension Disabled by Policy or Security Settings**
   - Corporate or managed devices may block installation.
   - Check browser or system-level policies restricting extensions.

### How to Verify
- Visit your browser’s extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions/`, `about:addons` for Firefox) and check uBO Scope’s presence and status.

## 4. uBO Scope Does Not Detect Any Blocking (All Domains Show as Allowed)

### Symptoms
- Domains appear only under "not blocked" category.
- "stealth-blocked" or "blocked" domain lists remain empty even if you know blockers are active.

### Causes & Solutions

1. **No Content Blocker Active or Blocking Outside Browser Scope**
   - uBO Scope reports outcomes based on webRequest API events.
   - If blocking happens outside your browser or API scope (e.g., external DNS blockers or network firewalls), uBO Scope might not see it.

2. **Browser API Limitations**
   - Certain browser versions or configurations might restrict the visibility of blocking events.

3. **Check Content Blocker Compatibility**
   - Ensure your content blocker is compatible and actively working during your test.

### How to Verify
- Test with known blocker configurations enabled.
- Visit sites with clear third-party resources and observe if "blocked" or "stealth-blocked" domains appear.

2. **Reload the Extension:** Disable and re-enable uBO Scope via the extensions management page.
3. **Reinstall the Extension:** Remove and install uBO Scope anew from the official store.
