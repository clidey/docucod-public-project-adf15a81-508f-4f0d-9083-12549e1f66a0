# Configuring uBO Scope

Understand how uBO Scope works with its default settings, requiring no manual configuration to start, and learn what permissions it operates under to seamlessly track third-party connections within your browser.

---

## 1. Default Configuration: Ready to Use Out of the Box

From installation onward, uBO Scope activates automatically with zero input needed from you. This means no manual setup steps are necessary before you begin monitoring third-party remote server connections on the websites you visit.

- **Automatic Activation:** As soon as the extension is installed, it starts tracking network requests immediately.
- **No User Configuration Required:** There is no settings page or initial configuration to perform.
- **Seamless Integration:** uBO Scope works quietly in the background alongside your browsing activity, collecting connection data transparently.

### Why No Configuration Is Needed

uBO Scope's functionality hinges on listening to network events directly via the browser’s `webRequest` API. Since its role is strictly observational, it does not modify network traffic or require user-tuned filters.

This design ensures you see an accurate, real-time picture of all third-party server connections regardless of other content blockers or DNS filtering active on your system.

<Tip>
You can start using uBO Scope immediately after installation without performing any setup—a smooth experience designed for immediate insight.

## 2. Permissions & Access Requirements

uBO Scope operates with specific permissions outlined in its manifest, enabling it to track connections securely and privately.

### Key Permissions Granted

- **`webRequest` Permission:** Allows monitoring of browser network requests for URLs matching `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and (depending on the browser) `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*`. This enables uBO Scope to capture both HTTP(S) and WebSocket connection attempts.

- **`activeTab` Permission:** Grants access to the tab currently in focus to retrieve domain details and deliver immediate UI updates such as the toolbar badge count and popup summary.

- **`storage` Permission:** Enables uBO Scope to save session data temporarily within the browser for faster retrieval and continuity during your browsing session.

### Why These Permissions Matter

These permissions ensure that uBO Scope can capture every network request your browser reports, categorize them, and display them in an intuitive UI.

<Note>
All permissions are declared transparently in the extension's manifest file on platforms including Chromium, Firefox, and Safari to maintain user trust and browser security compliance.

## 3. How uBO Scope Tracks and Categorizes Connections

Though you do not configure this directly, understanding the built-in tracking mechanism will help you interpret the data uBO Scope provides.

- **Network Requests Monitored:** HTTPS, HTTP, and WebSocket requests.
- **Connection Outcomes Categorized as:**
  - **Allowed:** Requests successfully connected.
  - **Blocked:** Requests that failed due to blocking or errors.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Redirects or other indirect interventions indicating stealthy blocking.

This categorization enables the popup interface and toolbar badge to display meaningful counts and summaries seamlessly.

---

## 4. Integration With Your Browsing Workflow

Because uBO Scope activates automatically and continuously:

- The **toolbar badge** updates live, showing the count of distinct allowed third-party domains per active tab.
- The **popup interface** provides detailed real-time breakdowns of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains without user input.

There is no need to refresh, restart, or configure anything after installation. Just open the popup to see connection details directly related to the webpage currently in your active tab.

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Keep uBO Scope Enabled:** Disabling or uninstalling stops all monitoring.
- **No Additional Settings to Modify:** Focus on interpreting connection data rather than managing configuration.
- **Understand Badge Counts:** Lower numbers represent fewer distinct third-party connections, which often indicates better privacy.

<Tip>
If you want to see connection details for a tab, simply click the uBO Scope toolbar icon and explore the categorized domain lists in the popup.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Permission or Configuration Issues

If uBO Scope appears not to be tracking connections:

- **Verify Extension Permissions:** Check your browser’s extension settings to ensure uBO Scope has permissions for network requests.
- **Confirm Installation:** The toolbar icon should be visible; if hidden, enable it from the browser toolbar customization.
- **Check Browser Compatibility:** Supported on Chromium-based browsers (version 122+), Firefox (version 128+), and Safari (version 18.5+).

<Warning>
Due to the nature of underlying browser APIs, uBO Scope can only monitor requests reported by the browser’s `webRequest` interface. Requests made outside this scope, such as those from native apps or limited API access environments, will not appear.
</Warning>
