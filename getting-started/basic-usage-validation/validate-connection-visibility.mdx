# Quick Validation: See uBO Scope in Action

Welcome to the quick validation guide for uBO Scope. This page helps you confirm that uBO Scope is actively tracking third-party remote server connections and that it is correctly reporting them in real time. By following these straightforward steps, you will learn how to recognize changes in the toolbar badge, use the popup interface to explore connection details, and verify that the extension collects accurate network data.

## 1. Recognize the Toolbar Badge Count

The uBO Scope extension icon, located on your browser’s toolbar, displays a badge count reflecting the number of distinct third-party remote servers your current tab contacted and which were allowed (not blocked).

### How to use the badge count as a quick check:

- After navigating to a webpage, observe the badge number on the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- The number updates dynamically, showing how many unique third-party domains your tab contacted successfully.
- A badge showing no count (empty) means no third-party connections have been observed yet.

### Best practices:

- Keep in mind: a **lower** badge count generally indicates fewer third-party connections, which is often preferable for privacy.
- This count updates as your browsing page loads and interacts with external services.

<Check>
Check that the badge count changes as you visit different websites or reload a page.
</Check>

## 2. Open and Use the Popup Interface to Inspect Connections

uBO Scope provides a detailed popup interface that shows visible third-party connections categorized by their status.

### How to open the popup:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon on your browser’s toolbar.
2. The popup window will open displaying data for the active tab.

### Popup Interface overview:

- **Top Header:** Shows the hostname and the main domain of the current tab.
- **Domains Connected:** Displays the total count of distinct connected domains.
- **Sections:** Three categorized lists of domains:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains that established successful connections.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were redirected or stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were blocked outright.

### How to use the popup:

- Browse each section to understand which third-party domains your current tab is interacting with.
- Domains are listed alongside a badge count that indicates the number of requests made to that domain.

### Tips for interpretation:

- A populated **Not Blocked** section means connections went through.
- Entries under **Stealth-Blocked** or **Blocked** indicate locations where content blocking or request failures occurred.

<Note>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or no domains, try refreshing the page or verifying the extension is enabled.
</Note>

## 3. Confirm Accurate Data Collection

To verify that uBO Scope is collecting accurate network request information, perform these practical steps:

### Step-by-step verification:

1. **Browse a website with known third-party content** (for example, popular news sites with ads and trackers).
2. Observe the toolbar badge updating dynamically as the page loads.
3. Open uBO Scope’s popup and confirm:
    - The current tab’s domain is correctly displayed.
    - The domain counts under each category reflect what you expect from the page’s content.
4. Reload the tab and check that the badge and popup data update accordingly.

### Additional validation:

- Visit different websites to see different sets of third-party domains.
- Use a new tab or window to test if data is correctly scoped per tab.

<Warning>
If you see no badge updates or no domain information in the popup, ensure your browser supports `webRequest` API and the extension has the necessary permissions.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

When validating uBO Scope, you may encounter some common scenarios that hinder visibility or data accuracy.

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Quick Validation">
<Accordion title="Badge not updating">
- Confirm the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions page.

<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty lists">
- Verify you clicked the icon on the tab you intend to observe (only active tab data is shown).
- Reload the page; data appears after network requests are processed.
- Confirm permissions (webRequest, activeTab, storage) are granted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Inaccurate or missing data">
- Some network requests might not be observable if your browser restricts webRequest API usage.
- Ensure your browser version is supported and up to date.
- Restart the browser or reinstall the extension if issues persist.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
