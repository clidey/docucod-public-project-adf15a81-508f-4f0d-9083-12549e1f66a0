# Troubleshooting Installation & Setup

This page helps you quickly identify and resolve issues that may arise during the installation or initial use of uBO Scope. Common problems such as the extension icon not appearing, permission denials, and unsupported browser alerts are covered with actionable diagnostic steps. You'll also learn where to find logs and error messages essential for troubleshooting.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation

Before diving into troubleshooting, verify that uBO Scope is correctly installed in your browser.

### Steps

1. **Check the Browser Toolbar:** Look for the uBO Scope icon (depicted as the extension logo). It should appear near your address bar or extensions area.
2. **Access Extension Management:** Open your browser's extensions or add-ons page:
   - **Chromium-based browsers:** `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`
   - **Firefox:** `about:addons`
   - **Safari:** `Safari > Preferences > Extensions`
3. **Verify uBO Scope is Enabled:** Ensure the extension is toggled "on" and has no reported issues.

<Check>
If you don't see the extension icon or it is disabled, reinstall using the official extension store links:

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

Refer to the [Installing uBO Scope](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/quick-setup/install-extension) page for full installation instructions.

## 2. Verify Browser Compatibility and Minimum Version

uBO Scope requires modern browsers with the following minimum versions:

| Browser           | Minimum Version |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Chromium-based*   | 122.0           |
| Firefox           | 128.0           |
| Safari            | 18.5            |

> *Chromium-based includes Chrome, Edge, Brave, and similar browsers.

### How to check your browser version

- Open browser menu > Help > About [Browser Name]

<Warning>
Using unsupported or outdated browsers can cause installation or runtime errors, including the extension not appearing or loading failures.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Confirm Required Permissions

uBO Scope needs these key permissions to function correctly:

- `webRequest` - To monitor all network requests.
- `activeTab` - To access data on the active tab.
- `storage` - To save session data.
- Host permissions for protocols `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and websocket equivalents.

### Checking permissions

1. Navigate to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions/` or similar).
2. Open uBO Scope's details page.
3. Confirm the listed permissions include the above.

<Note>
Permissions are declared in the extension's manifest files (platform-specific), e.g., `manifest.json`.

If permissions are missing or revoked, certain features might break, such as connection tracking.
</Note>

## 4. Extension Icon Not Appearing or Popup Fails to Open

### Causes & Fixes

- **Extension Disabled:** Re-enable in extensions page.
- **Browser Does Not Support MV3 or Manifest Requirements:** Update browser to minimum version.
- **Icon Hidden by Browser:**
  - In Chrome, use the extensions toolbar menu to pin the uBO Scope icon.
  - In Firefox, check if the icon is hidden behind the overflow.
- **Conflicting Extensions:** Disable other extensions that might block uBO Scope’s action.

### Verification

After resolving, reload the browser and confirm the icon appears and the popup opens when clicked.

---

## 5. Unsupported Browser Alert

uBO Scope uses Manifest Version 3 (MV3) features and permissions that are supported by modern browsers only.

If you receive alerts about unsupported browsers:

- Upgrade to the latest stable browser release.
- Confirm the browser version meets the minimum stated in section 2.
- If using lesser-known browsers, switch to officially supported browsers (Chromium, Firefox, Safari).

---

## 6. Permissions or Functionality Issues on First Run

Sometimes the extension may encounter restrictions preventing its network monitoring features.

### How uBO Scope uses permissions internally

- It uses background scripts (service workers or scripts depending on browser) to track HTTP/S and WebSocket connections.
- Permissions like `webRequest` and host permissions are essential for these listeners.

### Common issues

- Browser privacy or security settings restrict access to webRequest API.
- Administrator or enterprise policies block extension permissions.

### Diagnostics & Solutions

- Review your browser’s privacy/security settings for extension permissions.
- In enterprise environments, consult your IT policies.
- Check for warning messages in the extensions management page.

<Warning>
Note that uBO Scope cannot operate if `webRequest` API access is blocked; there is no workaround due to browser security model.
</Warning>

## 7. Accessing Logs and Error Messages

While uBO Scope runs silently, you can access diagnostic information via browser developer tools:

### Steps to view logs

1. Open browser developer tools:
   - Press `F12` or right-click > Inspect
2. Navigate to the Extensions or Add-ons debug view:
   - **Chrome:** Visit `chrome://extensions/`, enable "Developer mode", then click "service worker" link under uBO Scope.
   - **Firefox:** Visit `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, locate uBO Scope, and open its console.
3. Observe logs for errors or warnings.

### What to look for

- Permission denied errors
- Manifest or background script loading errors
- Network request listener related errors

## 8. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

| Issue                             | Cause                                          | Solution                                   |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Extension icon missing            | Browser update reset extensions or icon hidden| Pin icon to toolbar, reinstall if necessary|
| Network data missing in popup    | Permissions not granted or extension disabled | Re-enable extension, verify permissions     |
| Extension not working on mobile   | Unsupported browser version or platform        | Use supported browsers on desktop/mobile    |
| Conflicts with other blocking tools| Other blockers interfere with extension        | Temporarily disable others to test           |

## 9. Quick Reference: Where to Get More Help

- Visit the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) for issues and source code.
- Check the browser's extension page for detailed status messages.
- Consult related documentation sections for installation and configuration guidance:
  - [Prerequisites & Supported Platforms](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/quick-setup/prerequisites-requirements)
  - [Installing uBO Scope](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/quick-setup/install-extension)
  - [First Run: What to Expect](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/quick-setup/first-run)
  - [Configuring uBO Scope](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/basic-usage-validation/configuring-ubo-scope)

<Tip>
If problems persist after following the troubleshooting steps, gather console logs from the extension's background page and open an issue on GitHub with detailed descriptions for developer support.
</Tip>

## Appendix: Understanding uBO Scope Setup from Manifest

The extension's manifest file (e.g., `manifest.json` for Chromium and Firefox) shows the declared permissions and critical platform requirements:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "minimum_chrome_version": "122.0",  // Chromium versions only
  "permissions": [ "activeTab", "storage", "webRequest" ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://*/*",
    "http://*/*",
    "wss://*/*",
    "ws://*/*"
  ]
}
```

This enforces that browsers support Manifest V3 and that the extension can intercept web requests necessary for operation.

# Summary

This page equips you to diagnose and resolve issues related to installing or initially using uBO Scope. Ensuring compatibility and required permissions remain the key pillars to a successful setup experience. Where relevant, you can access error logs directly from the extension background scripts to uncover deeper issues.

Once installed and working, uBO Scope monitors and reveals remote server connections robustly, as detailed in other sections of this documentation.
