## 3. Manual Installation Using Manifest Files

If you cannot use the store installation (e.g., enterprise policy, development, or troubleshooting), follow these manual steps.

### 3.1 Download the Extension Files

- Clone or download the [uBO Scope repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
- Make sure you have the latest `main` branch to ensure you get the latest stable manifest and scripts.

### 3.2 Locate the Correct Manifest for Your Browser

| Browser        | Manifest Location                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Chromium-based | `platform/chromium/manifest.json` |
| Firefox        | `platform/firefox/manifest.json`  |
| Safari         | `platform/safari/manifest.json`   |

### 3.3 Load the Extension

#### Google Chrome / Chromium

1. Open `chrome://extensions/` in your browser.
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle top-right).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the directory containing the extracted extension files with the `manifest.json` from `platform/chromium`.
5. Confirm the extension loads and the icon appears.

#### Mozilla Firefox

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Select the `manifest.json` file inside `platform/firefox` folder.
4. The extension will load temporarily (until browser restart).

#### Apple Safari

Safari manual loading requires Xcode:

1. Open the `platform/safari` folder in Xcode.
2. Choose the appropriate signing identity.
3. Build and run the extension in Safari.
4. Enable the extension in Safari's **Extensions** settings.

<Note>
Temporary manual installations may not auto-update and might be disabled after restarting the browser.

For persistent use, it is recommended to use official store installations.
</Note>
