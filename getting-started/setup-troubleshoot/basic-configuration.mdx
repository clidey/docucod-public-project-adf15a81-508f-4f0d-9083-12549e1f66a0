# Basic Configuration Steps

This guide walks you through the essential post-install steps to get uBO Scope fully functional. It explains how to ensure the extension is enabled, highlights the default behaviors of the tool, and introduces you to the popup interface for exploring observed third-party network connections. By completing these steps, you will have uBO Scope working with minimal friction and ready for practical use.

---

## 1. Verify Extension is Enabled and Active

Before using uBO Scope, confirm that the extension is properly installed and enabled in your browser:

1. Open your browser’s extensions management page:
   - **Chrome:** Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
   - **Firefox:** Go to `about:addons`
   - **Safari:** Open Safari Preferences and select the Extensions tab

2. Find **uBO Scope** in the list.
3. Ensure the toggle or checkbox to enable the extension is on.

<Tip>
If you do not see uBO Scope listed, install the extension following the instructions in [Install uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) or the official browser stores.
</Tip>

## 2. Understand Default Behavior and Permissions

uBO Scope works passively by listening to network requests passing through your browser. It requires the following permissions automatically granted on installation:

- Access to network requests via `webRequest` API
- Storage permission for temporary session data
- ActiveTab permission to detect the current tab you are browsing

The extension does **not** block or alter connections; its sole purpose is transparency. It tracks network activity from third-party domains, categorizing connections into:

- **Allowed:** Network connections that succeeded
- **Blocked:** Requests the browser or blocker prevented
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that were redirected or intercepted invisibly

<Tip>
You do not need to configure or grant additional permissions beyond these; the extension activates immediately once enabled.
</Tip>

## 3. Get to Know the Popup Interface

The primary way to interact with uBO Scope is through its popup panel accessible from the browser toolbar icon.

### Steps to Open the Popup:

1. Navigate to any webpage you want to inspect.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
3. The popup will show:
   - The domain of the current tab at the top
   - Summary count of distinct third-party domains contacted
   - Sections categorizing connections as **Not Blocked**, **Stealth-Blocked**, or **Blocked**

### Popup Layout Highlights:

- Each section lists domains with the count of connection attempts observed.
- Domains are displayed using Unicode where applicable to ensure readability.
- Sections with no data are hidden to keep the interface clean.

<Tip>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA', try refreshing the webpage or verifying that the tab is active and network activity occurred.
</Tip>

## 4. Enable and Use uBO Scope with Minimal Friction

To ensure seamless usage:

1. After installation and enabling, open a new tab and browse to a site.
2. Watch the badge count on the uBO Scope icon—it indicates the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
3. Click the icon anytime to open the popup and review detailed third-party connection info for the current tab.

<Tip>
The badge count is your quick privacy indicator: a lower number means fewer third-party connections, which generally indicates better privacy.
</Tip>

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Refresh to Update:** The popup updates dynamically when you reload the tab or navigate to a new domain.
- **Check Different Tabs:** Each tab maintains its connection data independently.
- **Focus on Domains:** uBO Scope categorizes by domain, giving you a clear view beyond raw request counts.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Post-Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Basic Configuration Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA Even on Active Tabs">
- Ensure the extension is enabled in the browser.
- Reload the tab to prompt fresh network activity.
- Verify that your browser version supports the extension (see System Requirements).
- Check for conflicting privacy extensions that might interfere with the webRequest API.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- The badge updates after network requests are processed (usually within seconds).
- Close and reopen the tab if the count remains stagnant.
- Restart the browser if issues persist.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Is Empty or Sections Are Missing">
- Sections with no data are hidden by design.
- If you expect connections but don't see them, confirm you are on the correct tab.
- Check your network connection or try visiting different websites.
