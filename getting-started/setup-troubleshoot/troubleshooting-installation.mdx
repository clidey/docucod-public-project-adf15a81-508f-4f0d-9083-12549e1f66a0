# Troubleshooting Installation Issues

This guide helps you resolve common problems encountered during the installation or initial use of the uBO Scope browser extension. Whether you cannot see the extension icon, experience browser compatibility warnings, or face confusing permission prompts, this page offers clear, step-by-step solutions to get uBO Scope working smoothly.

## 1. Extension Icon Not Visible After Installation

If you have installed uBO Scope but do not see its toolbar icon, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Confirm Extension Installation
- Open your browser's extension or add-ons page:
  - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
  - Firefox: `about:addons`
  - Safari: `Safari > Preferences > Extensions`
- Look for '**uBO Scope**' or '**uBlock Origin Scope**' in the list.
- If not present, reinstall the extension from the official browser store:
  - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

### Step 2: Enable the Extension
- Ensure the extension is toggled to **enabled**.

### Step 3: Pin the Extension Icon (Chromium browsers)
- Click the extensions puzzle icon in the toolbar.
- Find uBO Scope and click the pin icon to make it always visible.

### Step 4: Restart Your Browser
- Sometimes extensions load only after one or more restarts.
- Close all browser windows and reopen the browser.

### Step 5: Check Toolbar Space
- If your toolbar is crowded, some icons may be hidden.
- Adjust toolbar settings or customize to ensure space for the icon.

<Note>
If the icon remains missing after these steps, confirm you installed the correct extension version for your browser platform.

## 2. Browser Compatibility Warnings or Installation Failures

uBO Scope requires specific minimum browser versions due to its reliance on Manifest V3 APIs and the `webRequest` API. Ensure your environment meets these prerequisites:

| Browser    | Minimum Version |
|------------|-----------------| 
| Chromium   | 122.0+          |
| Firefox    | 128.0+          |
| Safari     | 18.5+           |

### Step 1: Verify Browser Version
- Navigate to your browser’s “About” page to check the version.
- Update your browser if below the minimum version.

### Step 2: Confirm Browser Supports Manifest V3
- uBO Scope uses Manifest V3, which older browsers do not support.
- Use the latest stable browser releases for best compatibility.

### Step 3: Address Platform-Specific Installation Issues
- Safari requires version 18.5 or later and explicit permissions settings (see Safari documentation).

<Warning>
Attempting to install uBO Scope on unsupported browsers may silently fail or cause incomplete extension behavior.
</Warning>

## 3. Permission Prompt Issues

On first launch, uBO Scope asks for permissions needed to monitor network requests.

### Typical Permissions Requested
- **activeTab:** Allows the extension to access the active browser tab.
- **storage:** Used to store session data and extension settings.
- **webRequest:** Enables monitoring of network connections from webpages.

### Step 1: Accept All Necessary Permissions
- Denying any required permission will prevent uBO Scope from functioning properly.

### Step 2: Manually Review Extension Permissions
- Go to the browser’s extension management page.
- Confirm uBO Scope has all required permissions enabled.

### Step 3: Reinstall If Permissions Are Incorrect
- Remove the extension and reinstall from the official store to reset permissions.

<Note>
Browser permission UI may vary. On some platforms, permissions appear as one combined approval; on others, stepwise or detailed dialogs.
</Note>

## 4. uBO Scope Badge Count Doesn't Update

If, after installation, the toolbar badge does not display a count or remains blank:

### Step 1: Open a Website
- uBO Scope actively monitors network requests per active tab.
- Visit a popular website to trigger network activity.

### Step 2: Check if Other Content Blockers Interfere
- uBO Scope passively observes network connections regardless of blockers, but some network conditions (e.g., VPN, firewall) may influence visibility.
- Temporarily disable other extensions that may block or modify network requests and reload the tab.

### Step 3: Verify Browser Support for `webRequest` API
- Some browsers or configurations restrict the `webRequest` API, limiting uBO Scope’s ability to monitor traffic.

<Warning>
If you rely on privacy-specific browser settings that limit extension network access, uBO Scope might not reflect all or any network activity.
</Warning>

## 5. Troubleshooting Safari-Specific Issues

Safari handles web extensions differently and has stricter version and permission requirements.

### Step 1: Verify Safari Version
- Must be Safari 18.5 or later.

### Step 2: Enable Extension in Safari Preferences
- Go to `Safari > Preferences > Extensions` and enable uBO Scope.

### Step 3: Allow Network Monitoring Permissions
- Safari may prompt separately to allow network monitoring; confirm these permissions.

### Step 4: Restart Safari
- Fully quit and reopen Safari if you encounter unexpected behavior.

## 6. Escalation and Additional Support

If problems persist despite following the above steps:

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache and Data
- This can resolve caching issues affecting extension scripts or session storage.

### Step 2: Review Browser Console for Errors
- Open Developer Tools (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+I`).
- Check console for error messages related to uBO Scope.

### Step 3: Report Issues on GitHub
- Visit the [uBO Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
- Check existing issues for similar problems.
- Open a new issue providing browser version, platform, and troubleshooting steps already tried.

### Step 4: Try Alternative Installation Method
- If installing via store fails, manually load the extension package as an unpacked extension for testing (see *Installing uBO Scope* guide).
