# Validating uBO Scope is Working

uBO Scope is designed to provide immediate, transparent insight into all third-party network connections initiated by the webpages you visit. This page walks you through simple, practical steps to confirm that the extension is actively monitoring your network traffic, helping you build confidence that uBO Scope is functioning correctly.

---

## 1. Understand What to Expect

Upon installing and enabling uBO Scope, the extension passively listens to network requests made by your browser. Its toolbar badge reflects the number of distinct third-party domains your current webpage connects to successfully without being blocked. The detailed list of domains can be viewed through the extension's popup interface.

> Remember: The badge count shows the number of unique third-party domains contacted — a lower number is typically better for privacy.


## 2. Prerequisites

Before validating uBO Scope’s operation, ensure the following:

- The extension is installed and enabled in your browser.
- You have visited at least one webpage after installation to generate connection activity.
- You understand basic navigation to the extension’s popup interface (click the toolbar icon).


## 3. Validation Steps

Follow these steps to confirm uBO Scope is monitoring network requests:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Popular Website">
Visit a well-known, publicly accessible website known to load multiple resources from different domains. Examples include `https://www.wikipedia.org` or `https://www.nytimes.com`.

<Check>
Choosing sites that use common CDNs and various third-party services maximizes the chance of seeing multiple network connections.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Observe the Toolbar Badge">
Look at the uBO Scope badge icon on your browser’s toolbar while viewing the page. The number displayed is the count of distinct third-party domains with connections allowed by uBO Scope.

If the badge is blank or missing, see the troubleshooting tips below.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the Popup Interface">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup UI.

You should see:

- The hostname of the current tab/page at the top.
- A summary showing the number of connected domains.
- Sections categorizing connected domains by status:
  - 'not blocked' (allowed connections)
  - 'stealth-blocked' (redirected/blocking events)
  - 'blocked' (failed connections)

Each section lists domains and the count of connections.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Domain Entries">
Scroll through the domain lists in the popup.

You should:

- See multiple third-party domains listed under "not blocked".
- Possibly see entries under "stealth-blocked" or "blocked," depending on your browsing environment and security settings.

This confirms uBO Scope is capturing network request events and classifying them accurately.
</Step>

<Step title="Refresh the Page and Watch Updates">
Reload the webpage.

Observe the badge count and popup domain lists:

- The count should update reflecting the current tab’s third-party connections.
- The popup domain sections should refresh with updated data.

This step ensures continuous active monitoring.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 4. Troubleshooting If Validation Fails

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Extension Icon or Badge Not Visible">
- Confirm the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions/settings page.
- For Chromium browsers, ensure the extension is not hidden behind the puzzle icon; pin it to the toolbar.
- Restart the browser and try again.
- Check browser version meets uBO Scope’s minimum version requirement ([see System Requirements](../quick-setup/system-requirements)).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists">
- Ensure you have reloaded a page after installing.
- Try opening a different website known for multiple third-party domains.
- Confirm uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (typically 'webRequest' and access to all URLs).
- Review related configuration documentation ([Basic Configuration](../setup-troubleshoot/basic-configuration)).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update on Page Load">
- Check for conflicting extensions that may interfere with network request monitoring.
- Disable other privacy or blocking extensions temporarily to isolate issues.
- Review the troubleshooting guide for installation issues ([Troubleshooting Installation](../setup-troubleshoot/troubleshooting-installation)).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Third-Party Domains Detected on Busy Sites">
- Confirm browsing network requests are not blocked by the browser or network.
- uBO Scope only reports network requests visible through the browser’s webRequest API.
- If you use VPNs or DNS-level blocking, some network data may be invisible.
- See related [Browser Integration & System Compatibility](../../overview/system-concepts-and-architecture/integration-and-compatibility) documentation.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 5. Understanding Validation Results

Validation confirms that uBO Scope is actively:

- Capturing network request events (successful, redirected, failed).
- Categorizing connections as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Presenting an accurate, tab-specific snapshot of third-party network exposure.

Establishing this trust early enables you to use uBO Scope confidently to monitor privacy and network behavior on any site.

## Additional Tip

<Tip>
For the clearest validation results, use websites with dynamic content served from multiple domains, such as popular news sites, ecommerce platforms, or content delivery networks. This variety guarantees observable network connections for uBO Scope to track.
