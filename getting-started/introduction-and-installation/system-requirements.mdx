# Prerequisites & Supported Browsers

Ensure your system meets the minimal requirements and that your browser is supported to use uBO Scope effectively. This page guides you through what you need before installing and running uBO Scope, outlines browser and OS compatibility, and explains limitations related to browser APIs.

---

## 1. System Requirements

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension, but certain baseline conditions must be met:

- **Operating System:** 
  - Windows, macOS, Linux, Android (supported by the chosen browser)
  - Safari support on macOS with minimum version 18.5
- **Browser:** See Supported Browsers section below.
- **Disk and Memory:** Minimal, as it stores session data and a public suffix list locally.

<u>Note:</u> No additional software installations or dependencies are required.

---

## 2. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to work with browsers that expose the `webRequest` API and support Manifest Version 3 extensions, with specific requirements per browser:

| Browser     | Minimum Version   | Notes                      |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **Chrome**  | 122.0+            | Minimum Chrome version to enable required API access. |
| **Firefox** | 128.0+            | Must support Manifest V3 and `webRequest` permission. |
| **Safari**  | 18.5+             | Requires latest Safari Web Extension compatibility.  |


### Browser-specific details

- **Chrome (Chromium engine)**
  - Requires at least Chrome 122.
  - Permissions include `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
  - Access through Chrome Web Store.

- **Firefox**
  - Supports Firefox 128 and newer.
  - Uses `webRequest` API for connection tracking.
  - Available from Mozilla Add-ons.

- **Safari**
  - Supports Safari 18.5 or later.
  - Uses MV3 format with `webRequest` API permissions.
  - Installation via Safari Extensions Gallery or Apple’s developer channel.


## 3. Browser API Limitations & Impact

uBO Scope relies heavily on the `webRequest` API to monitor and classify outgoing network requests made by web pages:

- **Coverage depends on Browser API:** Only network requests visible to the `webRequest` API are monitored.
- **Requests outside `webRequest` reach won't be tracked:** Some browsers or privacy modes might obscure requests from the API.
- **No Support for DNS or Web Extension Blockers:** uBO Scope works independently from DNS blocking and other extension blockers.

<Tip>
If you use browser features or extensions that block or hide network requests before uBO Scope can observe them, such network activity won’t be reported, potentially lowering visibility.
</Tip>

## 4. Public Suffix List (PSL) Dependency

- uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List to accurately interpret domains and classify third-party connections.
- The PSL is loaded on first run and cached in the session storage.
- The list is updated automatically but offline usage depends on the cached data.

<Note>
The PSL file is sourced from https://publicsuffix.org and bundled internally to ensure domain parsing accuracy and up-to-date definitions.
</Note>

## 5. Installation Prerequisites

Before installation:

- Confirm your browser and version meet the requirements above.
- Ensure your browser allows installation from the appropriate extension store.
- Verify that you have sufficient permissions to install extensions.

---

## 6. Summary of Permissions Used

- **webRequest:** Monitor network requests across all tabs to track connections.
- **activeTab:** Access details about the active tab when displaying connection info.
- **storage:** Save session data and the public suffix list.

This minimal permission set ensures uBO Scope can function without intrusive access to browsing data beyond necessary network details.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope badge not updating">
Verify your browser version meets the minimum required. Older browsers may not expose all required APIs for uBO Scope to update the toolbar badge.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension not installing on Safari">
Ensure you have Safari 18.5 or later. Also, check Apple's developer documentation on enabling developer-mode extensions if installing from sources other than the Safari Extensions Gallery.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No data shown after installation">
Confirm that the browser supports the `webRequest` API and that no other extension is blocking or interfering with this API.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Public Suffix List errors or missing data">
Check network connectivity on first installation for PSL download. The list is cached on successful load; failures may reset the list on next run.
</Accordion>
