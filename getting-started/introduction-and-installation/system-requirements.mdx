# Supported Browsers & System Requirements

Ensuring that uBO Scope runs smoothly on your system starts with verifying browser compatibility and meeting system prerequisites. This page guides you through which browsers and platforms are officially supported, including specific installation sources, as well as system requirements for optimal operation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension leveraging the WebExtensions API and the webRequest API to monitor all third-party network connections initiated by your browser. Due to browser platform differences, compatibility varies as follows:

| Browser        | Minimum Version       | Extension Store                                   | Notes                          |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Google Chrome** (and Chromium-based browsers) | 122.0 or later        | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) | Requires manifest_version 3; service worker background script |
| **Mozilla Firefox**               | 128.0 or later        | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)                  | Background script uses module type; strict min_version enforced |
| **Safari**                       | 18.5 or later         | Distributed via Apple's Safari Extensions Gallery or manual installation                   | Uses manifest_version 3; limited to HTTP/S requests only       |

<Tip>
uBO Scope relies on the browser's webRequest API to track network requests. Make sure your browser version supports the necessary API features; older versions or forks may lack full compatibility.
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Sources

Installing uBO Scope from official extension stores guarantees you the latest stable version:

- **Chrome**: Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
- **Firefox**: Install from the [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
- **Safari**: Installation can occur via Safari Extensions Gallery or through manual developer installation conforming to Safari Extension development guidelines.

<Note>
Some Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge or Brave can typically install from the Chrome Web Store. Verify compatibility and permissions if your browser is a Chromium variant.
</Note>

## 3. System Requirements

uBO Scope runs as a lightweight browser extension, but to ensure seamless functionality, please observe the following:

### 3.1 Operating System

- Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux, as long as the browser version requirements are met.
- Safari support requires macOS with Safari version 18.5 or higher.

### 3.2 Browser Version

- Must use one of the supported browsers at or above their minimum versions (see Section 1).

### 3.3 Permissions

- The extension requires permissions for `webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab`.
- For Chromium and Firefox browsers, uBO Scope accesses all `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, and `wss://*/*` URLs to monitor connections.
- Safari currently supports monitoring only HTTP and HTTPS schemes.

### 3.4 Network Considerations

- The extension monitors browser-initiated web requests. Network policies or firewall rules that block or interfere with browser network APIs may affect extension reporting accuracy.

<Warning>
If using browsers or versions outside these specifications, uBO Scope may not function correctly or provide incomplete data.
</Warning>

## 5. Verifying Compatibility

After installation, verify uBO Scope is active and functional:

1. Ensure the extension icon appears in your browser toolbar.
2. Navigate to a website and observe the badge count reflecting distinct third-party connections.
3. Open the popup UI by clicking the extension icon to inspect gathered connection data.

If any of these steps fail, please refer to the [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](../../getting-started/first-use-and-validation/troubleshooting-installation) guide.
