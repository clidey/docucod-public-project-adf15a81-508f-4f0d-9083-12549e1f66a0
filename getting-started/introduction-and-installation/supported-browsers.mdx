# Supported Browsers & Prerequisites

Ensure a smooth and successful experience by verifying that your browser and system meet uBO Scope's compatibility and system requirements. This guide walks you through supported browsers, minimum browser versions, and essential prerequisites for installation and operation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to work on major modern browsers that support the required WebExtensions APIs, specifically the `webRequest` API used for monitoring network connections. Below is the detailed compatibility matrix:

| Browser Type       | Supported Versions                     | Installation Source                                   |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium-based Browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Edge) | Version 122.0 or later                    | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)           |
| Mozilla Firefox    | Version 128.0 or later                | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)                                      |
| Safari             | Version 18.5 or later                 | Distributed as Safari Web Extension (Apple App Store or signed installation)                                 |

### Notes:
- **Chromium Minimum Version**: uBO Scope requires at least Chromium version 122.0 due to API dependencies.
- **Firefox Minimum Version**: Strict minimum version is 128.0, reflecting the adoption of Manifest V3 and related APIs.
- **Safari Minimum Version**: Requires macOS Monterey 12.4+ or later with Safari 18.5+, as defined by Safari Web Extensions compatibility.

<Tip>
If your browser version is below the stated minimum, please update to the latest stable release to use uBO Scope without issues.
</Tip>

## 2. System and Environment Prerequisites

Before installing uBO Scope, verify the following system conditions:

### Operating System Requirements
- **Windows / macOS / Linux**: Supported for Chromium and Firefox browsers.
- **macOS**: For Safari users, macOS Monterey 12.4 or later is required.

### Browser Configuration
- Ensure your browser supports Manifest Version 3 (MV3) and the following APIs:
  - `webRequest` API with access to network request outcomes.
  - `storage.local` and `storage.session` APIs for state retention.
- No special system firewall or proxy configurations are required, but ensure that your browser has permission to use the webRequest API.

### Permissions Required by uBO Scope
- ActiveTab: Access to the current tab to associate data with browser tabs.
- Storage: Access to browser local and session storage for session management.
- WebRequest: To monitor and classify network requests made by web pages.

These permissions are requested by the extension at installation.

## 3. Browser Version & Permission Verification

Follow these steps to verify your browser meets prerequisites:

### Step 1: Check Browser Version
- Open your browser.
- Navigate to the About page (e.g., `chrome://settings/help` for Chrome, `about:support` for Firefox).
- Confirm that your browser version is at or above the minimum stated in the Supported Browsers matrix.

### Step 2: Confirm Extension Permissions
After installation, verify that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions:

1. Open your browser's extensions management page.
2. Find uBO Scope and open its details.
3. Confirm that permissions for **Active Tab**, **Storage**, and **Web Request** are enabled.

<Tip>
Permissions may be automatically granted at install; if permissions are missing, reinstalling the extension or upgrading the browser may resolve the issue.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Common Compatibility Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

- **Unsupported Browser Version**: Older browsers lacking MV3 support or full `webRequest` API will cause uBO Scope to malfunction or fail to monitor network requests.

- **Browser Forks or Third-Party Builds**: Not all Chromium forks or third-party browsers fully implement the necessary WebExtensions APIs.

- **Incompatible Safari Versions**: Ensure Safari is fully updated to support Web Extensions API required by the extension.

- **Enterprise Policies or Security Settings**: Some organizational policies might block extensions from accessing the required permissions or APIs.

<Tip>
If you encounter issues, verify your browser version and permissions first before proceeding to installation or troubleshooting.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting: Supported Browsers & Prerequisites

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
If your browser version is older than the required thresholds:

- Update your browser to the latest stable release.
- Check browser release notes for compatibility with Manifest V3.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension Permissions Not Granted">
Sometimes the extension may not obtain sufficient permissions:

- Remove and reinstall the extension.
- Ensure no security software is blocking extension permissions.
- Verify extension settings in the browser's extension manager.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="WebRequest API Not Fully Supported">
Some browsers or browser versions disable or restrict the `webRequest` API for performance or privacy reasons:

- Confirm your browser supports `webRequest` APIs with full access.
- Use mainstream Chromium-based or Firefox browsers as recommended.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Safari Incompatibility">
Safari requires newer OS and browser versions:

- Upgrade macOS to Monterey 12.4 or later.
- Ensure Safari supports Web Extensions 2.0 APIs.
- Confirm minimum Safari version 18.5 as per extension manifest.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Checking browser version and permissions before installing uBO Scope saves time and avoids unnecessary troubleshooting.
