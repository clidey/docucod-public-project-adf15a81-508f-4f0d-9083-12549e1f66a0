# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This section ensures you are fully prepared to install and run uBO Scope. Before proceeding, verify that your environment meets the system and permission requirements detailed below.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers & Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed to work as a browser extension compatible with the following browsers and versions:

- **Google Chrome** (or Chromium-based browsers): Minimum version 122.0
- **Mozilla Firefox**: Minimum version 128.0
- **Safari**: Minimum version 18.5

Using these versions or later guarantees support for all required browser APIs.


## 2. Required Permissions

To operate correctly, uBO Scope requests the following browser extension permissions:

- `activeTab`: To access the currently active tab and its data.
- `storage`: To read and write session and configuration data.
- `webRequest`: To listen and analyze network requests made by webpages.

These permissions enable uBO Scope to monitor network connections effectively and provide accurate data.


## 3. Host Permissions

uBO Scope needs permission to observe network requests to various URLs. It requires access to these URL patterns:

- `https://*/*`
- `http://*/*`
- `wss://*/*` (WebSocket Secure connections; applicable in Chromium and Firefox)
- `ws://*/*` (WebSocket connections; applicable in Chromium and Firefox)

**Note:** Safari's implementation restricts WebSocket host permissions, so `wss://*/*` and `ws://*/*` are not included for Safari.


## 4. System & Environmental Requirements

- **Operating System**: Any OS supporting the above browsers (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android).
- **Internet Connection**: Required initially to fetch the latest Public Suffix List used for domain identification and network categorization.
- **Browser Settings**: Ensure no policies or security extensions block the webRequest API or storage APIs.


## 5. Network Configuration & Considerations

- Browser firewalls or network-level blocking should allow the extension to monitor web requests.
- If you use VPNs, proxies, or custom DNS servers, note that uBO Scope reports only on network requests visible to the browser's webRequest API.
- Network requests outside the webRequest API’s reach cannot be monitored.


## 6. Additional Notes

- uBO Scope is cross-browser but leverages browser-specific APIs for background processing:
  - **Chrome/Chromium** uses a service worker as the background script.
  - **Firefox** and **Safari** run background scripts with modal differences — the extension package contains browser-specific manifest files to handle these.

- The extension persists session data and network request history using browser storage APIs.

- The extension loads and caches Mozilla's Public Suffix List to accurately determine registrable domains.

## Verification Checklist Before Installation

Before installing uBO Scope, ensure:

- [ ] Your browser version meets or exceeds the minimum required above.
- [ ] Permissions (`activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`) are not restricted by policy or other extensions.
- [ ] Host permissions align with the URLs you wish to monitor.
- [ ] You have an active internet connection for the initial setup.

## Troubleshooting Common Readiness Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Readiness Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Check">
Ensure your browser is updated to the minimum supported version. Older versions may lack necessary APIs, breaking functionality.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denials">
If installation fails or data seems missing, verify that the extension’s permissions were approved. Some browsers require explicit user consent.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network or Security Policies">
Corporate or device-managed browsers may restrict storage or webRequest APIs. Check browser policies or consult IT if you experience limited functionality.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="WebSocket Permissions in Safari">
Safari currently lacks full websocket host permissions for extensions, impacting WebSocket monitoring.
</Accordion>
