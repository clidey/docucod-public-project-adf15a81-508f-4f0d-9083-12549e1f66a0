## 3. Essential Prerequisites

Before installing, verify the following items:

- **Extension Permissions**

  - Ensure that third-party extensions are allowed in your browser settings.
  - In some browsers, you may need to enable Developer Mode to side-load or manually install extensions.

- **Software Dependencies**
  - No external software dependencies are required; uBO Scope runs entirely as a browser extension.

- **Network & Firewall Settings**
  - No special firewall or proxy configurations are needed for the extension to monitor network requests.
  - However, restrictive network environments might impact the browser’s ability to report all requests.
