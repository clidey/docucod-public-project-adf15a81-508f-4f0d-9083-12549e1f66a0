## 2. Installation Methods

You can install uBO Scope by either using official extension stores or through manual installation. Follow the steps for your browser below.

### 2.1 Installing from Official Browser Stores

The easiest and recommended way to install uBO Scope is via your browser's official extension/add-on marketplace.

- **Chrome:**
  1. Visit the [Chrome Web Store page for uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
  2. Click **Add to Chrome**.
  3. Confirm the installation by clicking **Add extension** when prompted.

- **Firefox:**
  1. Visit the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
  2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
  3. Approve requested permissions and finalize installation.

- **Safari:**
  1. Safari extensions are available via the Mac App Store or manual build (see below). If available in your App Store, install it directly.


### 2.2 Manual Installation / Development Installations

If you prefer sideloading or developing the extension, follow these steps:

#### For Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.)

1. Clone or download the [uBO Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
2. Locate the directory `build/uBO-Scope.chromium` generated using the script detailed below.
3. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
4. Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle in the upper-right corner.
5. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `build/uBO-Scope.chromium` folder.

#### To create the Chromium build folder:

Run the provided bash script to prepare the packaged extension:

```bash
./tools/make-package.sh chromium
```

Optionally, specify the version number as the second argument:

```bash
./tools/make-package.sh chromium 1.0.1
```

#### For Firefox

1. Use the same approach as Chromium, but load the folder `build/uBO-Scope.firefox`.
2. Generate it with:

```bash
./tools/make-package.sh firefox
```

3. Then, load as a temporary add-on in Firefox via `about:debugging` > **This Firefox** > **Load Temporary Add-on** and select any file inside the folder.

#### For Safari

Manual packaging for Safari is available but requires a macOS environment.

To prepare the Safari build and zip the package, use:

```bash
./tools/make-safari.sh 1.0.1
```

Follow Apple’s official documentation on installing unsigned extensions for developer builds.

## 3. Verification After Installation

Once installed, confirm the extension is working correctly:

1. **Toolbar Icon & Badge:** uBO Scope will add an icon (uBO Scope) in your browser toolbar.
2. **Badge Display:** When visiting a webpage, the badge will display a numeric count indicating the number of distinct third-party remote server connections detected.
3. **Popup Access:** Click the icon to open the popup, which shows detailed domain connection statuses (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).

<Tip>
If the toolbar icon does not appear immediately, check your browser’s extensions/settings page to ensure uBO Scope is enabled and allowed to show the icon.
</Tip>

## 4. Best Practices for Proper Setup

- **Grant Requested Permissions:** Without permissions for `webRequest` and active tab access, uBO Scope cannot monitor connections correctly.
- **Avoid Conflicts:** uBO Scope is designed to run alongside other content blockers but ensure your browser’s extension limit or security settings do not block it.
- **Browser Updates:** Keep the browser and extension updated for security and compatibility.
- **Regularly Check Popup Data:** Use the popup to review network connections and confirm the extension tracks your browsing sessions accurately.
