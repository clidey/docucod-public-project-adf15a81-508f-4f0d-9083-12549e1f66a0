# What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to reveal, count, and help you understand all attempted and successful network connections that web pages make to third-party remote servers within each browser tab. Unlike typical content blockers, which only report what they block, uBO Scope provides unbiased visibility into *all* remote server connections initiated by the browser, regardless of any other content blocking or filtering in place.

This transparency empowers you to monitor how many and which third-party domains your browser communicates with as you navigate the web, offering valuable insights into your privacy exposure and network activity.

## Why Use uBO Scope?

Modern websites often load resources from a variety of third-party servers — including advertising networks, content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics providers, and more. Understanding these connections is crucial for users who value privacy, want to verify the effectiveness of content blockers, or maintain filter lists.

uBO Scope’s primary purpose is to count and display the distinct third-party remote servers connected to by each tab, without filtering or bias. It does this by leveraging the browser’s `webRequest` API to capture detailed network request outcomes such as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked connections.

**Key Value Points:**

- **Unbiased Measurement:** Reports connections regardless of content blocker activity.
- **Real-Time Tab Focus:** Data is tab-specific, giving you focused insights.
- **Distinct Domain Counting:** The toolbar icon badge shows the unique third-party domains connected to per tab — a lower count implies fewer external connections, often translating to better privacy.
- **Myth-Busting:** Helps debunk common misconceptions on how block counts relate to privacy or blocker quality.
- **Useful for Filter Lists:** Filter maintainers can use uBO Scope to analyze connection patterns and effectiveness.

## How uBO Scope Works at a Glance

- It listens to all network requests made by the browser using `webRequest` listeners.
- Each tab maintains an internal session record tracking domains categorized as **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked**.
- The extension distinguishes between the main frame's domain and third-party domains, focusing on external servers.
- Results are aggregated per tab, and the number of unique allowed third-party domains is displayed as a badge count on the toolbar icon.
- The popup interface provides a detailed breakdown of domains connected to, classified by outcome.

## Understanding the Terminology

- **Third-Party Remote Server:** Any domain different from the main page’s domain (including subdomains) that receives a network request.
- **Allowed:** Connections that succeeded without being blocked.
- **Blocked:** Connections prevented by content blockers or network failures.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections where the blocking attempt is hidden or obfuscated, often to prevent webpage detection of blocking.
- **Badge Count:** Reflects distinct allowed third-party domains per tab.

---

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Identify and reduce exposure to unnecessary third-party connections.
- **Content Blocker Evaluators:** Compare actual network connections allowed by different blockers.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Analyze which third-party domains are most active or problematic.
- **Curious Users:** Gain transparency on how websites interact with external servers.

## Seeing uBO Scope in Action

After installing uBO Scope, you can explore its interface by clicking the toolbar icon. The popup lists the domains connected to by the active tab, grouped by their outcome:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains to which connections succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with hidden blocking attempts.
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests were explicitly blocked or failed.

The badge on the toolbar icon shows the count of unique allowed third-party domains, giving you a quick privacy health indicator at a glance.

## Best Practices for Using uBO Scope

- Regularly monitor the badge count while browsing to become aware of changes in third-party connections.
- Use the detailed popup to investigate unexpected or unknown domains.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with your content blocker settings to fine-tune privacy protections.
- Remember that not all third-party connections are malicious; CDNs and essential services contribute to user experience.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- If the badge count does not update, ensure you have granted the necessary permissions when installing the extension.
- Network requests made outside the browser’s `webRequest` API scope will not appear.
- A lower badge count generally indicates fewer third-party connections — you should aim for minimal unnecessary domains.
