# What is uBO Scope?

Discover what uBO Scope is, why it matters, and how it empowers you to see every third-party server your browser connects to — transparently and regardless of content blocker or DNS filtering.

---

## Introduction

uBO Scope is a simple yet powerful browser extension designed to reveal **all remote connections** your browser attempts or successfully makes when loading webpages.

Traditional content blockers or DNS filters often obscure or silently block these connections, leaving you uncertain about exactly which third-party servers your browser interacts with. uBO Scope cuts through this obfuscation.

It provides an accurate, real-time count and listing of **distinct third-party remote servers** contacted by webpages you visit — offering you honest insight into your actual privacy exposure.

<u>Why does this matter?</u>

Many privacy and security-conscious users want to know the true extent of third-party tracking or resource loading happening behind the scenes. uBO Scope gives you a trustworthy window into that, independent of what other blockers report or hide.

---

## Purpose and Value

- **Transparent Monitoring:** uBO Scope listens to all network requests your browser initiates, including those blocked or stealthily blocked by other protections, provided the browser reports them via its `webRequest` API.

- **Accurate Badge Count:** The toolbar icon shows the number of distinct third-party domains that were allowed to connect — not just block counts or total requests — helping you assess true exposure.

- **Myth Busting:** It debunks common misconceptions such as:
  - Higher block counts do not necessarily mean better blocking.
  - Ad blocker test pages often provide unrealistic assessments.

- **Usefulness for Maintainers:** Filter list maintainers and advanced users can leverage uBO Scope to verify the actual domains contacted on devices where standard debugging tools are unavailable.

## How uBO Scope Works

uBO Scope operates by monitoring network requests through the browser's `webRequest` API:

- It tracks **every** remote server connection attempt, whether it was allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked (e.g., redirected or blocked invisibly).

- It categorizes results into three buckets:
  - **Allowed (Not Blocked):** Domains where connections succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains blocked stealthily by content blockers.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed or were explicitly blocked.

- The extension aggregates unique domains per tab and updates a compact popup UI and the toolbar badge with counts and domain details.

---

## What You Gain

By using uBO Scope, you will:

- See a **real and precise count** of unique third-party connections your browser makes on any given page.

- Understand the distinction between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains to better interpret privacy exposure.

- Get unbiased insight unaffected by content blocker tricks, DNS filtering, or network-layer obfuscations.

- Validate your current content blocking setup and identify unexpected third-party requests.

---

## Using the Extension

- After installation, click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup dashboard.

- The dashboard displays your current tab's main hostname and lists domains connected under the categories:
  - **Not Blocked** (green) — allowed connections
  - **Stealth-Blocked** (yellow) — requests blocked invisibly
  - **Blocked** (red) — requests that failed or were blocked

- The total count of **distinct connected domains** is prominently shown.

- This visual breakdown helps you quickly assess privacy exposure at a glance.

---

## Practical Scenario

Imagine visiting your favorite news website. Traditional blockers might report many blocked connections, but uBO Scope reveals the exact **number of distinct third-party servers** actually contacted — giving you precise, actionable information about your browsing footprint.

For instance, if you see 5 distinct third-party domains under "Not Blocked," you know your browser contacted those servers despite any blockers, emphasizing areas you might want to review or block.
