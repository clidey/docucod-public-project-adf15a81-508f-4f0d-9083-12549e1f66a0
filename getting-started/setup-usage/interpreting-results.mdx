# Understanding the Badge & Popup

Unlock the full transparency power of uBO Scope by understanding the toolbar badge you see and the detailed popup panel that reveals all the domains connecting to each webpage you visit. This guide will help you quickly interpret what the badge number means, how to read the categorized domain lists inside the popup, and what the terms 'allowed', 'blocked', and 'stealth' represent.

---

## 1. Overview of the Toolbar Badge

The toolbar badge is the first glance insight uBO Scope offers. It displays a **number** representing the count of distinct third-party remote servers your browser successfully connected to on the current active tab.

### What Does the Badge Number Mean?
- It **counts distinct third-party domains** that your browser loaded resources or made connections to, excluding the main first-party domain.
- A **lower number is better**, indicating fewer third-party connections and potentially less tracking or resource loading.
- The badge updates dynamically as the page loads and as network requests resolve.

### Third-Party Servers Explained
- These are domains different from the main website you are visiting.
- Common third parties include CDNs, analytics, ad networks, or social media widgets.
- Not all third parties are bad; some are essential for site functionality.

### How the Badge Updates
- It counts only those connections that were **allowed** (successful).
- Connection attempts that were **blocked** or **stealth-blocked** do not increase this count.

<Check>
Check the badge after loading a page with multiple external resources (e.g., news or social media sites) to see how many third-party servers are actively connected.

## 2. Exploring the Popup Panel

Clicking on the uBO Scope toolbar icon opens the popup panel, which presents a detailed breakdown of domains connected per category for the current tab.

### Popup Layout and Sections

- **Header**: Shows the current page's hostname and main domain.
- **Summary**: Displays the total number of distinct connected third-party domains.
- **Three Main Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains for which network requests were successfully completed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked (Stealth)**: Requests that were silently blocked (often to avoid detection or site breakage).
  - **Blocked**: Requests for domains explicitly blocked by content blocking.

#### Example Sections:

| Section          | Meaning                                            | Visual Cue                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked      | Domains you connected to successfully              | Green highlight on header and badge   |
| Stealth-Blocked  | Connections silently blocked by the blocker        | Red highlight, often hidden from sites|
| Blocked          | Explicitly blocked domains and requests             | Red highlight, clearly marked          |

### Reading Domain Rows
Each domain listed has:
- Its name (decoded via Punycode to human-readable if internationalized).
- A count badge showing how many requests were made or attempted to that domain.

The domains are sorted and grouped per section for quick scanning.

<Info>
Zones with no domains will be hidden automatically for clarity.

## 3. Definitions of Connection Outcomes

Understanding the distinctions between the three outcomes is crucial to interpreting the popup data correctly.

### Allowed (Not Blocked)
- These are **network connections that completed successfully**.
- The domains here are those where your browser was allowed to fetch resources without interference.
- The badge number represents the count of these allowed domains.

### Blocked
- These refer to network requests that were **explicitly blocked** by either your content blocker or other browser blocking mechanisms.
- The domains here were attempted but denied access.
- The popup reveals this data so you can assess what was prevented.

### Stealth-Blocked
- This identifies requests that were **silently blocked or redirected** to prevent detection by websites.
- Stealth blocking helps maintain site functionality while hiding block activity.
- These domains were never visible to the webpage because blocking was transparent.

<Tip>
Stealth blocking is a sophisticated feature that avoids breaking webpages and prevents sites from detecting ad-blocking. Seeing domains here implies your content blocker is active, but quietly.
</Tip>

## 4. How to Use These Insights

### Diagnosing Privacy and Performance
- A **high allowed count** means many third-party connections are active, which could imply tracking or slower page loads.
- **Blocked and stealth-blocked lists** show what the blocker prevented, helping you understand filter effectiveness.

### Real-World Scenario
1. Visit your favorite news site.
2. See the badge showing "12" — this means 12 distinct third-party domains were connected.
3. Click the badge to open the popup.
4. Review the "Not Blocked" section to identify legit third parties like CDN providers.
5. Check "Blocked" and "Stealth" sections to see trackers or ads your blocker stopped.

### Best Practices
- Use the badge to monitor sites with suspiciously high third-party counts.
- Use the popup to verify if blocking behaves as expected.
- Don’t always equate more blocked domains with better privacy—context matters.

## 5. Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- **Tip:** After navigation, wait a few seconds for the badge and popup details to update fully, as network requests finalize.
- **Tip:** Soft refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R) can reload network entries if the data seems outdated.
- **Pitfall:** The badge only reflects successful third-party connections, so a "0" does not mean no blocking occurred.
- **Pitfall:** Some network activity outside browser webRequest (e.g., some extensions or system processes) will not be reported.

## 6. Troubleshooting Quick Checks

If the badge or popup shows no data or inconsistent results:

- Verify uBO Scope extension permissions are granted.
- Make sure you are on a page that initiates third-party network requests.
- Reload the page or switch tabs.
- Check browser compatibility and update to a supported version (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Badge count never updates or is empty">
- Confirm you're on an active tab with network activity.
- Reload the page.
- Confirm extension permissions and that browser API calls are not blocked.
- Restart the browser if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup shows no domains or 'NO DATA'">
- Wait a few seconds after clicking the badge for data to load.
- Reload the page and try again.
- Check for browser console errors related to uBO Scope.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Summary

Understanding the toolbar badge as your immediate indicator of third-party domain connections and reading the categorized domains in the popup empowers you to gain clear, actionable insights into your browser’s network activity and blocker effectiveness. This knowledge equips you with better control over privacy and resource management.
