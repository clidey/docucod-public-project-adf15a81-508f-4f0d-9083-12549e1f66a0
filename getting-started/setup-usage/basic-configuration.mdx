# Initial Setup & Permissions

Welcome to your first interaction with uBO Scope. This guide walks you through what to expect during the initial setup phase, explains the permissions requested by the extension, and clarifies how uBO Scope safely interacts with your browser while honoring your privacy.

By understanding these early steps and configuration choices, you’ll gain confidence in how uBO Scope monitors network connections effectively without compromising your security or privacy.

---

## 1. What Happens on First Use?

When you install and launch uBO Scope for the first time, the extension immediately:

- Requests the necessary permissions from your browser to monitor network requests.
- Sets up internal data structures for tracking connection outcomes.
- Loads essential components, such as the public suffix list, which helps it identify third-party domains accurately.

<u>These operations happen quietly and securely in the background, designed to give you instant transparency on remote connections your browser makes.</u>

### Key Initial Permissions Requested

uBO Scope requires three main permissions to function properly:

| Permission  | Why It’s Needed                                        |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `activeTab` | To read and reflect the currently active browser tab. |
| `storage`   | To save session data, such as connection histories.   |
| `webRequest`| To observe and categorize all network requests in real-time. |

You will be prompted by your browser to grant these permissions at installation.

<Note>
These permissions do **not** allow the extension to modify or block network requests. uBO Scope is purely observational.
</Note>

## 2. What Permissions Mean for Your Privacy

uBO Scope is designed with your privacy central to its operation:

- **No data is sent outside your browser by default.** It only monitors connections your browser attempts or completes.
- It carefully segregates connection outcomes (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked) per tab without exposing your browsing details elsewhere.
- The extension uses browser APIs in compliance with your security settings and respects your data storage, using local and session storage only for transient data.

By limiting permissions to what is strictly necessary, uBO Scope minimizes its footprint and risk.

<Tip>
Review the permissions before installing to ensure you are comfortable. The minimal permission set reflects the extension's focused purpose.

## 3. Initial Configuration Options

While uBO Scope requires no mandatory user configuration to start, some initial choices influence how it behaves:

### a. Connection Scope

- uBO Scope requests host permissions on all HTTP and HTTPS URLs (`http://*/*` and `https://*/*`), and also WebSocket protocols (`ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*` on browsers supporting them) to observe all relevant network traffic.
- This broad scope is essential for capturing an accurate picture of remote server connections.

### b. Browser Compatibility Adjustments

- On **Chromium-based browsers**, uBO Scope runs as a service worker background script.
- On **Firefox**, similar permissions are requested with additional explicit version requirements.
- On **Safari**, stricter minimum version requirements apply, but fundamental permissions remain consistent.

These platform adaptations are automatic and transparent to you, ensuring consistent functionality across browsers.

### c. Data Storage

- Session data is stored temporarily to monitor active tabs' connection activity.
- Public suffix list data (used for domain parsing) is cached to speed up processing.

No additional user setup is required for these.

## 4. How uBO Scope Interacts with Your Browser Safely

uBO Scope integrates tightly but non-intrusively with your browser:

- It listens only to network request events reported by the browser's `webRequest` API.
- It never modifies network requests or browser behavior.
- Data is managed in-memory or local/session storage without external communication.

This is confirmed by its manifest permissions and observed behavior:

```json
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://*/*",
    "http://*/*",
    "wss://*/*",
    "ws://*/*"
  ]
}
```

This transparency ensures you maintain full control over your browsing privacy while gaining deep insight into connection details.

## 5. What to Expect After Initial Setup

After granting permissions and finishing installation:

- The toolbar icon for uBO Scope will appear in your browser.
- The badge on the icon will start displaying real-time counts of distinct third-party domains your browser connects to.
- Clicking the icon opens a popup presenting detailed lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains for the current tab.

These features work seamlessly without any further configuration.

---

## 6. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Grant permissions promptly during installation** for an uninterrupted first experience.
- **Restart your browser if you do not see the toolbar icon** after installation.
- **Understand that the badge count measures distinct allowed third-party domains, not block counts.**
- **Refer to related documentation** for interpreting badge results and troubleshooting setup issues.

<Warning>
Avoid installing multiple privacy or network monitoring extensions doing similar observations simultaneously, as this may cause conflicting behavior or inaccurate reporting.
</Warning>

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Permission & Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="The Extension Icon Does Not Appear After Installation">
Verify your browser’s extension toolbar settings allow uBO Scope to be visible. Try restarting the browser or reinstalling the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Requests Are Blocked or Cancelled">
You need to accept the permission prompts for the extension to function. If accidentally declined, remove and reinstall the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The Badge Does Not Show Counts Immediately">
Real-time connection monitoring starts after you browse web pages. Try visiting a few websites to generate connection data.
