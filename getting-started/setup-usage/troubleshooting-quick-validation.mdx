# Troubleshooting & Quick Validation Steps

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve common issues when using uBO Scope, such as missing badge counts, empty popup data, or unexpected permissions prompts. Follow the steps below to validate your setup and ensure you are receiving accurate network connection insights.

---

## 1. Checking for the Toolbar Badge

The toolbar icon badge displays the number of distinct third-party domains connected by the active tab. If the badge is missing or not updating:

- **Verify Extension Installation**
  1. Confirm that the uBO Scope extension is installed in your browser.
  2. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's extension or add-ons bar.

- **Verify Browser Compatibility and Version**
  - Chromium-based browsers require version 122 or above.
  - Firefox requires version 128 or above.
  - Safari requires version 18.5 or above.

- **Reload the Browser or Extension**
  - Try restarting your browser.
  - Disable, then re-enable the extension.

- **Validate Permissions**
  - Ensure the extension has access to:
    - "activeTab" permission to monitor the current tab.
    - "webRequest" permission to observe network events.
    - "storage" permission to save session data.

<Tip>
If the badge remains missing, open the extension's details page or permissions settings to confirm all required permissions are granted.
</Tip>

## 2. No Data or Empty Popup Panel

If, upon clicking the toolbar icon, the popup shows 'NO DATA' or no domains listed:

- **Verify Active Tab Has Network Activity**
  - Open a website that actively loads third-party resources (e.g., news sites, social media, or popular web apps).
  - Refresh the page to generate fresh network requests.

- **Check Browser Restrictions**
  - Some corporate or privacy-focused browsers restrict the `webRequest` API.
  - Make sure no other extension or browser setting blocks network request monitoring.

- **Confirm Extension is Running Correctly**
  - Look for errors in the browser's extension console (use web developer tools).
  - Sometimes, service workers in Manifest V3 extensions may be evicted; ensure extension updates occur without issues.

- **Clear Cached Session Data**
  - Persistent corrupted session data may cause display issues.
  - Go to the extension storage settings and clear data or reset the extension.

- **Update Browser and Extension**
  - Make sure both your browser and uBO Scope are up-to-date.

## 3. Unexpected Permissions or Access Prompts

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to operate:

- **`activeTab`**: Grants temporary access to the current tab.
- **`webRequest`**: Enables the extension to listen for network requests.
- **`storage`**: Allows saving of processed data.

If prompted unexpectedly:

- Confirm the source is legitimate and that you installed uBO Scope from official marketplaces.
- Avoid sideloading or installing from untrusted sources.

<Tip>
Always install uBO Scope from official browser stores:
- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
</Tip>

## 4. Quick Validation Steps

Follow this workflow to ensure uBO Scope is properly reporting:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Confirm Extension Presence">
    Open your browser's extensions management page and ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Toolbar Badge">
    Navigate to any website with active third-party content (e.g., https://news.ycombinator.com).
    Look for a numeric badge on the uBO Scope icon indicating recently observed distinct third-party connections.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Popup Data">
    Click the uBO Scope icon. The popup panel should display the main site domain and lists of 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' domains.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refresh and Re-test">
    Reload the active website and confirm the badge updates and popup content changes accordingly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clear Extension Storage">
    If issues persist, clear extension storage via browser developer tools or the extension settings and retry.
  </Step>
</Steps>
