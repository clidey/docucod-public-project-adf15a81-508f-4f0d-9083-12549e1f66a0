# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide addresses frequent setup hurdles encountered with uBO Scope, such as missing toolbar icons, failure to display domain data, or unexpected browser permission requests. Follow these clear, direct solutions to resolve issues quickly and ensure smooth early use of the extension.

---

## 1. Toolbar Icon Not Visible

The toolbar icon serves as your gateway to uBO Scope’s real-time network connection insights. If it's missing, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Verify Installation
- Open your browser's extensions page:
  - **Chrome/Edge:** `chrome://extensions/`
  - **Firefox:** `about:addons`
  - **Safari:** Safari Preferences > Extensions

- Confirm that uBO Scope is installed and enabled.

### Step 2: Pin or Show the Icon
- In browsers with toolbar pinning (e.g., Chrome, Firefox), ensure the uBO Scope icon is pinned or made visible.
- In Safari, verify the extension is enabled and the toolbar is configured to show extension icons.

### Step 3: Browser Compatibility and Version
- Confirm your browser version supports uBO Scope: 
  - Chrome 122 or later
  - Firefox 128 or later
  - Safari 18.5 or later
- Older versions may not show the icon correctly.

### Step 4: Restart Your Browser
- Sometimes, a simple restart is required to display the toolbar icon after installation.

<Tip>
Always update your browser to the latest version to avoid compatibility issues with uBO Scope.
</Tip>

## 2. No Domain Data Shown in Popup

If the popup window indicates ‘NO DATA’ or shows no domains connected, it suggests the extension isn't capturing network requests correctly.

### Step 1: Check Permissions
- uBO Scope requires permissions for `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and WebSocket schemes (where applicable).
- Confirm the extension has granted these permissions:
  - Reinstalling or updating the extension will prompt for appropriate permissions.

### Step 2: Ensure Web Request API Support
- The extension depends on the browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor requests.
- Some restrictive browser modes or privacy settings might limit this API.

### Step 3: Refresh or Navigate to a New Page
- Open a new tab or refresh the page to trigger new network connections that uBO Scope can record.

### Step 4: Verify Content Blockers
- Other active content blockers or security extensions may interfere by blocking the network requests before uBO Scope can observe them.
- Temporarily disable other extensions to test if domain data appears.

### Step 5: Debug with the Popup UI
- Open the popup by clicking the toolbar icon.
- Observe if the badge count updates with distinct third-party connections.

<Tip>
A zero badge count or no visible domains often means no third-party connections detected, which is normal on certain pages or if heavy blocking is active.
</Tip>

## 3. Unexpected Browser Permission Prompts

When installing or updating uBO Scope, your browser might prompt you for permissions related to network monitoring.

### Why Are These Permissions Required?
- uBO Scope requires access to observe all network traffic initiated by webpages to provide accurate connection data.
- This includes permissions for host access (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`) and the `webRequest` API.

### What to Do When Prompted
- Always review the permission requests carefully.
- Approve permissions to enable functionality.

### If Permissions Are Denied
- The extension will still install but will not function properly.
- Re-enable permissions manually through your browser’s extension management page.

<Tip>
uBO Scope does not modify, block, or interfere with your traffic; it only reports connection attempts made by webpages.
</Tip>

## 4. Extension Appears Inactive or Not Collecting Data

If uBO Scope seems inactive or the badge count never updates, take these corrective actions:

### Step 1: Confirm the Extension Is Enabled
- Verify the extension toggle is on in your browser’s extension management page.

### Step 2: Reload the Browser or Extension
- Sometimes reloading the browser or toggling the extension off and on again resets its internal tracking.

### Step 3: Clear Browser Session Data
- Browsers cache session data which may sometimes cause inconsistencies.
- Clear extension-related data or reset your browser’s session storage.

### Step 4: Inspect for Errors
- Open your browser’s extension or developer console for error logs.
- Errors in `background.js` or `popup.js` may indicate permission or compatibility issues.

<Tip>
Logs and errors are often the fastest clues to diagnosing issues; developer tools can reveal blocked or failed script executions.
</Tip>

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Avoid Private Browsing Modes:** Some browsers restrict extension APIs in incognito or private modes unless explicitly allowed.

- **Check for Conflicting Extensions:** Running multiple network-monitoring or content-blocking extensions simultaneously can cause conflicts.

- **Keep uBO Scope Updated:** Updates may fix bugs or adapt to browser API changes.

- **Verify Browser Settings:** Strict privacy or security settings can restrict extensions from accessing network requests.
