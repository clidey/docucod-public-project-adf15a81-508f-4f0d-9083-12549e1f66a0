# Validating Your Installation

Ensuring that uBO Scope is working correctly right after installation is crucial to start benefiting from clear insights into your browser's network activity. This guide walks you through simple, immediate validation steps to confirm the extension is active, visible, and gathering data properly.

---

## 1. Confirm the Extension is Enabled and Present

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

- Once installed, look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's extension toolbar. It uses the uBO Scope logo.
- Depending on your browser, this icon may appear next to the address bar, or in the extensions overflow menu.

### Step 2: Check That the Extension is Enabled

- On Chrome or Chromium browsers, go to `chrome://extensions/`, and verify that uBO Scope is listed and enabled.
- On Firefox, visit `about:addons`, locate uBO Scope, and ensure it's enabled.
- On Safari, check Safari Extensions preferences under the `Extensions` tab.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the icon immediately, it might be hidden by your browser’s UI or disabled. Follow your browser’s instructions to manage extensions visibility.
</Tip>

## 2. Observe the Real-Time Badge Count

### Step 1: Open a New Tab and Visit Popular Websites

- To trigger network activity, open several tabs with commonly visited websites (e.g., news sites, search engines).
- Observe the uBO Scope icon badge count — this number represents the count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the active tab.

### Step 2: Interpret the Badge Count

- A numerical badge (e.g., 4, 7) means the extension is actively monitoring network connections.
- No badge (blank) indicates either no third-party connections detected or the extension is not working properly.

<Note>
The badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party domains for which connections have been made, not the number of requests or blocked items.
</Note>

## 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup UI

### Step 1: Click the Toolbar Icon

- Click on the uBO Scope icon to open its popup interface.

### Step 2: Verify Tab Network Data Displays

- The popup will show details related to the active tab:
  - The hostname of the tab’s main URL at the top.
  - The total domains connected summary.
  - Categorized lists of domains under **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** sections.

### Step 3: Confirm Domains Are Reported

- You should see atleast one or multiple domains listed in the **not blocked** section for active tabs visiting typical websites.
- Empty or "NO DATA" states mean no network connections have been recorded yet or the extension failed to capture network events.

<Tip>
Refreshing the current tab or opening new tabs on different sites can help generate data if the popup shows no connections.
</Tip>

## 4. How uBO Scope Validates Its Functionality

- The extension listens to network events for main and sub-resource requests via the browser’s `webRequest` API.
- It aggregates connections by domain, distinguishing them as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- The badge and popup reflect this data, offering immediate visual feedback on network transparency.

<Info>
This validation includes observing badge count updates live and confirming domain summaries in the popup, connecting user trust with visual product verification.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues when Validating Installation">
<Accordion title="No Toolbar Icon Visible">
- Ensure the extension is enabled and not hidden.
- Pin the extension to your toolbar if the browser supports it.
- Restart the browser if the icon fails to appear after installation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Never Appears or Stays Blank">
- Confirm you have visited websites generating network traffic.
- Some privacy settings or browser modes might restrict network event reporting.
- Verify the browser supports the `webRequest` API and the extension has appropriate permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists">
- Refresh the current webpage to trigger new network requests.
- Wait a few seconds; the extension processes data asynchronously.
- Check if other content blockers interfere or if the browser restricts event access.
- See the "Troubleshooting Common Issues" guide for detailed problem resolution.
