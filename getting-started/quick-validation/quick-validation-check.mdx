# Quick Validation Steps for uBO Scope

Welcome to your quick guide for verifying that uBO Scope is correctly installed and actively monitoring network connections in your browser. These simple, actionable steps will help you immediately check the extension's functionality by interacting with its popup and observing dynamic badge updates as you browse.

---

## 1. Open uBO Scope's Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- The popup will open showing the current active tab's hostname and connection summary.

### What to expect:
- The popup's header displays the domain of the active tab.
- The "domains connected" count indicates how many distinct third-party domains have been contacted on this tab.
- Three sections list domains categorized as **allowed** (not blocked), **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

<Tip>
If the popup displays 'NO DATA' or empty lists, ensure you have navigated to a webpage with live network activity.
</Tip>

## 2. Observe the Toolbar Badge

- Look at the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar.
- The badge number reflects the count of distinct allowed third-party domains connected by the active tab.

### How this helps:
- A zero or blank badge means no third-party connections detected yet.
- As you browse different websites, the badge updates dynamically.
- The badge lets you see at a glance the number of unique third-party domains contacted.

<Tip>
A lower badge number is preferable, signifying fewer third-party connections.
</Tip>

## 3. Validate Badge Updates by Browsing

- Visit a few different websites with clear web connections (e.g., news sites, social media).
- After each page loads, click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
- Confirm the badge number changes according to distinct third-party connections observed.
- Confirm the popup reflects domain lists updated accordingly.

### For example:
- On a clean website, the badge might show '1' or '2'.
- On a site with more ad or content providers, the number will be higher.
- The popup will list specific domains and counts for allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Quick Checks

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
  <Accordion title="Popup shows NO DATA or blank">
    If you see 'NO DATA' in the popup:
    - Refresh the current tab and try opening the popup again.
    - Ensure the page has network activity by browsing external resources.
    - Check that uBO Scope has the required permissions (see installation docs).
    - Verify your browser supports and enables usage of the webRequest API.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Badge number does not update">
    - Navigate to a different site and wait a few seconds.
    - Confirm uBO Scope is enabled in your browser extensions.
    - Reload the page to trigger new network requests.
    - If no updates, restart the browser and try again.
    - Consult the 'Troubleshooting Setup Issues' guide if problems persist.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unexpected high badge count">
    - Some websites legitimately connect to many third-party domains (e.g., content delivery networks).
    - Check the popup lists to review which domains are counted.
    - This behavior can be normal; compare with other websites to confirm.
  </Accordion>
