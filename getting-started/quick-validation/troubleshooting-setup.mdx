# Troubleshooting Setup Issues

This guide helps you resolve common problems encountered during the initial setup of uBO Scope, including missing toolbar badges, failure to display domain connection statistics, or the popup panel not opening. Follow these practical steps to quickly identify and fix issues related to installation missteps, permissions, and browser compatibility.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation

To start troubleshooting, ensure uBO Scope is properly installed in your browser:

- **Chrome / Chromium:**
  - Verify installation from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
  - Confirm the extension icon appears in the toolbar.
- **Firefox:**
  - Confirm installation via [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
  - Check the toolbar for the uBO Scope icon.
- **Safari:**
  - Verify Safari 18.5 or later is in use.
  - Confirm the extension is enabled in Safari's preferences (Extensions tab).

<Tip>
If the extension icon is not visible after installing, try restarting the browser and re-checking the toolbar or extensions page.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Check Browser Version and Compatibility

uBO Scope requires minimum browser versions with specific capabilities:

- **Chrome / Chromium:** Version 122 or higher
- **Firefox:** Version 128 or higher
- **Safari:** Version 18.5 or higher

Older versions may not support the necessary `webRequest` APIs or manifest v3 features used by uBO Scope.

<Tip>
Update your browser to the latest stable release to ensure full compatibility.
</Tip>

## 3. Confirm Required Permissions Are Granted

uBO Scope needs several essential permissions to function correctly:

- Access to `webRequest` for monitoring network connections.
- `activeTab` permission to access details of the active browser tab.
- Host permissions for URLs including `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` (plus WebSocket variants on Chromium and Firefox).

### How to Verify / Resolve Permissions:

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
2. When prompted on first launch, accept the requested permissions.
3. If permissions are denied or the popup fails to load, remove and reinstall the extension.
4. On Chromium-based browsers, verify host permissions in the Extensions settings page.

<Warning>
Permissions denied or improperly granted are the leading cause of missing toolbar badges and popup malfunctions.
</Warning>

## 4. Toolbar Badge Not Showing or Always Zero

If the badge count does not appear or remains zero:

- Ensure you have active network activity on a webpage with third-party connections.
- Refresh the active tab and then check if the badge updates.
- Confirm that no other extension or system-level blocker is interfering with network request reporting.

### Troubleshooting Steps:

- Temporarily disable other content blockers or privacy extensions and reload the page.
- Confirm that you are browsing sites that actually connect to third-party servers.
- On Firefox or Chromium, check extension permissions via browser's extensions page.

---

## 5. Popup Panel Does Not Open or Shows No Data

If clicking the extension icon does not open the popup or the popup shows "NO DATA":

- Refresh the current tab and try reopening the popup.
- Ensure the extension is enabled and permissions are accepted.
- Clear your browser cache, or restart the browser to reset transient state.

### Additional Checks:

- Confirm that uBO Scope’s background service or script is running (in Chromium, manifest shows a service worker).
- Check browser developer tools console for errors related to uBO Scope.

---

## 6. Common Installation and Setup Pitfalls

- **Installing from unofficial sources:** Always use official browser stores or Safari’s extensions gallery.
- **Multiple content blockers interference:** uBO Scope is designed to coexist, but some blockers or privacy tools may prevent webRequest events from firing.
- **Missing host permissions:** Double-check that the extension has permissions for the full range of URLs used.

---

## 7. Clearing and Resetting Extension Data

To clear potentially corrupted session data affecting badge and popup display:

1. Go to your browser’s extension storage settings (in developer mode or about:debugging).
2. Remove or reset extension storage related to uBO Scope.
3. Reload the extension and browser.

<Tip>
This step helps recover from stuck states where network request info is outdated.
</Tip>
