# Validating Your Installation

Ensuring uBO Scope is correctly installed and operational is your gateway to gaining transparent visibility into the third-party network requests your browser makes. This guide leads you step-by-step through verifying that the extension actively captures network connections, reflecting accurate data on the toolbar badge and within the popup interface.

---

## 1. Understanding What to Validate

Before diving into verification, it helps to understand what uBO Scope reports:

- **Toolbar Badge Count**: Displays the number of distinct third-party domains your current browser tab has connected to without blocking.
- **Popup Interface**: Categorizes domains by three outcomes:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains from which resources were successfully loaded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains whose requests were silently blocked (such as redirects).
  - **Blocked**: Domains whose network requests were explicitly blocked or failed.

Your goal is to confirm that these indicators reflect actual network activity when browsing.

## 2. Step-by-Step Validation Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Sample Webpage">
Navigate to a typical website prone to loading external resources, such as a news site or online retailer. These sites commonly make requests to third-party content delivery networks (CDNs), ads, and analytics services, providing a practical test bed.

> Tip: Choose a site known to load multiple third-party domains to see diverse results in the popup.
</Step>

<Step title="Check the Toolbar Badge">
Look at the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. The badge number indicates how many unique third-party domains your open tab connected to without blocking. 

- A non-zero count confirms the extension is capturing network activity.
- A zero or empty badge suggests no allowed third-party connections were detected.

> Warning: The badge shows only allowed third-party domains, not total requests.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the Popup Interface">
Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup panel. This interface displays:

- **Tab Hostname**: The current page’s hostname and base domain prominently displayed at the top.
- **Domains Connected Summary**: The total number of distinct domains with allowed connections.
- **Outcome Sections**:
  - 'Not Blocked' lists domains that successfully had resources loaded.
  - 'Stealth-Blocked' lists domains where requests were redirected or silently blocked.
  - 'Blocked' lists domains with explicitly blocked or failed network requests.

> Check that these lists populate with domains reflecting your browsing activity.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpreting Domains Listed">
In the popup, you will see domain names alongside how many times resources were requested from them.

- Domains reflect distinct third-party content providers.
- The distinction between allowed, stealth, and blocked outcomes clarifies what requests passed, failed, or were silently diverted.

> Tip: Domains are displayed using human-readable Unicode, including internationalized domain names.
</Step>

<Step title="Cross-Verify with Network Activity">
Open your browser's Developer Tools (usually with F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) and go to the Network tab.

- Reload the page.
- Observe third-party requests and their statuses.
- Verify that domains shown as "Not Blocked" in uBO Scope correspond with successful network requests.
- Ensure domains in "Blocked" or "Stealth-Blocked" sections match failed or redirected requests.

This cross-check confirms uBO Scope’s accuracy.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Practical Examples

### Example 1: Valid Output
- You visit example-news.com.
- Toolbar badge shows '5', indicating 5 distinct third-party domains loaded.
- Popup’s 'Not Blocked' section lists `cdn.example.com`, `analytics-provider.net`, `fonts.gstatic.com`.
- 'Blocked' section is empty if no blocking occurred.

### Example 2: Blocking Scenario
- You visit shopping-site.com.
- Toolbar badge shows '3'.
- Popup's 'Not Blocked' lists 3 domains.
- 'Blocked' lists ad-serving domains like `ads.biddingplatform.com`.

This means uBO Scope is correctly discriminating allowed versus blocked domains.

## 4. Troubleshooting Validation

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="The Toolbar Badge Shows No Number or Stays Empty">
- Confirm that uBO Scope is enabled and the page you are testing has active network requests.
- Make sure you granted all necessary permissions on installation.
- Try reloading the page.
- If still empty, ensure you're visiting a site that actually loads third-party content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Blank">
- This might mean the extension is not receiving tab data.
- Close and reopen the popup after reloading the tab.
- Restart your browser to ensure the extension's background service is active.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Domains Listed Don't Match Expected Network Requests">
- Check if any other content blockers may interfere with network logging.
- Ensure sites using HTTPS match 'https://' host permissions in the extension manifest.
- Validate that you are looking at the correct tab in the popup.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. What Success Looks Like

- Toolbar badge updates dynamically to reflect the count of allowed third-party domains.
- Popup displays the current tab's hostname with the base domain clearly.
- Domain lists in 'Not Blocked', 'Stealth-Blocked', and 'Blocked' reflect real-time network outcomes based on your browsing.
- You can identify distinct third-party networks connecting alongside your browsing activity.

Successfully validating confirms your installation works as intended and you are ready to start monitoring.

## 6. Next Steps

- Explore the [Navigating the Popup UI](https://docs.example.com/guides/getting-started/navigating-the-popup) guide for deeper understanding of interface features.
- Review [Interpreting the Toolbar Badge Count](https://docs.example.com/guides/core-workflows/interpreting-badge-counts) to comprehend badge implications.
- Consult [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/making-first-use/troubleshooting-install) if validations fail.

Keep an eye on the counts during your browsing sessions to maximize awareness of your network exposure.
