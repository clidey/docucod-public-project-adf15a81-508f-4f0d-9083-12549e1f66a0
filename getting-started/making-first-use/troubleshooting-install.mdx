# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

When setting up uBO Scope, you might encounter some common problems that can prevent the extension from functioning as expected. This guide covers frequent issues such as missing icons, permissions not granted, badge counts not updating, or the popup failing to display data. Follow these step-by-step instructions to quickly restore full functionality and regain confidence in your setup.

---

## 1. Toolbar Icon Missing or Not Displayed

### Symptoms
- No uBO Scope icon appears in your browser’s toolbar after installation.
- Unable to find or click the extension to open the popup.

### Causes & Solutions

- **Extension not pinned to the toolbar**
  1. Click on your browser's extensions menu (puzzle icon).
  2. Locate 'uBO Scope' from the list.
  3. Pin or enable the icon by clicking its pin button.

- **Browser version or permissions issue**
  Verify your browser meets minimum requirements:
  - Chromium-based browsers: version 122.0 or higher.
  - Firefox: version 128.0 or higher.
  - Safari: version 18.5 or higher.

- **Reinstall the extension**
  If icon remains missing:
  1. Uninstall the extension.
  2. Restart your browser.
  3. Reinstall uBO Scope from the official store:
      - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
      - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

### Verification
After pinning or reinstalling, the icon with the uBO Scope logo (depicted by 16x16 to 128x128 px images) should appear in your toolbar.

<Check>
Make sure the icon shows up as expected and is clickable to open the popup.
</Check>

## 2. Permissions Not Granted or Restricted

### Symptoms
- The extension popup shows 'NO DATA' or does not update badge counts.
- Errors in the extension console about missing permissions.

### Causes & Solutions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to function correctly:

- **Check Permissions After Installation**
  1. Go to the browser’s extension settings page.
  2. Locate 'uBO Scope' and verify it has permissions for:
     - `activeTab` — to monitor the current tab.
     - `storage` — to save session data.
     - `webRequest` — to listen to network traffic.
     - `host_permissions` including `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` (plus websocket URLs on Chromium and Firefox).
  
- **Grant Permissions**
  If any are missing, enable or allow them explicitly.

- **Browser Security Settings or Extensions Conflicts**
  Some privacy/security add-ons or browser settings might block these permissions.
  - Temporarily disable other extensions that modify network requests.
  - Check if your browser or OS firewall blocks extension network access.

- **Safari Specific Checks**
  Safari enforces a strict minimum version (18.5). Ensure your system and browser comply.

### Verification
- Reload the browser and open the extension popup.
- You should no longer see 'NO DATA'. Instead, active tab data should populate.

<Check>
Inspect extensions permissions and ensure uBO Scope is authorized fully.
</Check>

## 3. Badge Count Does Not Update or Shows Incorrect Numbers

### Symptoms
- Badge remains blank or shows zero despite network activity.
- Badge number does not reflect actual third-party connections.

### Causes & Solutions

- **Network Request Monitoring Limitations**
  uBO Scope counts unique third-party domains contacted by network requests captured through browser `webRequest` API.

- **Ensure Extension Is Enabled and Active**
  1. Confirm extension is not disabled.
  2. Confirm permissions are granted (see above).
  3. Visit websites known to trigger third-party connections (e.g., news, e-commerce sites).

- **Wait for Data Processing**
  The badge updates after network requests are processed; it may take a few seconds.

- **Browser or Extension Conflicts**
  Disable other extensions that intercept or block requests that may interfere with uBO Scope's data collection.

- **Refresh Tabs**
  Reload or open new tabs to trigger fresh network activities.

### Verification
- After visiting sites with third-party connections, the badge is expected to show a positive number indicating the count of distinct domains.

<Note>
A lower number means fewer third-party connections, which is expected on privacy-friendly sites.
</Note>

## 4. Popup Does Not Show Data or Remains in Loading State

### Symptoms
- Popup window shows 'NO DATA' or no domain list.
- Spinner or loading state persists indefinitely.

### Causes & Solutions

- **Extension Worker Not Fully Initialized**
  uBO Scope relies on background scripts/service workers to collect and provide data.
  - Reload the extension or restart the browser.

- **Tab Data Not Available**
  If you open the popup on a new blank tab or special pages, data may not be available.
  - Open the popup on a normal webpage HTTPS or HTTP tab.

- **Corrupted Session Data**
  Sometimes stored session data may corrupt and cause the popup to fail.
  - Clear local browser storage for uBO Scope:
    1. Navigate to the browser’s extension storage settings.
    2. Clear data or reset storage used by uBO Scope.
    3. Reload browser and revisit sites.

### Verification
- After fixes, open the popup on active tabs with network requests.
- The hostname, domain summary, and categorized domains (not blocked, stealth-blocked, blocked) should show.

## 5. Additional Diagnostic & Recovery Steps

- **Use Browser Developer Tools**
  - Open console for the extension's popup and background/service worker scripts.
  - Look for error messages or warnings.

- **Check for Manifest Version Compatibility**
  - Extension uses Manifest Version 3; ensure browser supports MV3.

- **Update Browser to Latest Version**
  - Some APIs and features require latest browser compatibility.

- **Reinstall Extension Completely**
  As a last resort, remove and reinstall uBO Scope.

## 6. Tips for Smooth Setup

- Always pin the extension icon immediately after installation for easy access.
- Grant all requested permissions upfront to avoid functionality issues.
- After installation, open several normal web pages to stimulate network requests and badge updates.
- Use uBO Scope in regular browsing contexts; avoid opening popup in internal or non-web pages.

## FAQ: Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Encountered Problems">
<Accordion title="Why is the badge showing zero even on busy websites?">
The badge counts distinct third-party domains reported by webRequest API. If your browser or another extension blocks or hides these requests, the count may remain zero. Also, it only counts domains that successfully connected or tried to connect, not all requests.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My popup shows 'NO DATA' but the icon is visible">
This happens if uBO Scope has not received data for the active tab. Switch to a regular webpage tab, reload it, then open the popup to force data retrieval.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The extension icon disappears after some time">
Some browsers will hide inactive extensions automatically. Pin uBO Scope to your toolbar or check the extensions menu to keep it visible.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I don't see the extension in my browser store">
Ensure your browser meets minimum version requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+). Unsupported versions might not list the extension.
</Accordion>
