# Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

Encountering problems when installing or running uBO Scope for the first time is rare but can happen due to browser settings, permissions, or network constraints. This guide walks you through the most frequent issues users face during initial setup and provides practical solutions to get you fully operational quickly.

---

## 1. Extension Icon Is Missing or Not Visible

If you have installed uBO Scope but cannot see its icon in the browser toolbar, follow these steps:

- **Check Browser Toolbar Overflow:**
  - Some browsers hide extension icons behind an overflow menu (puzzle piece icon or arrow). Click the overflow menu and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.
- **Enable the Extension:**
  - Navigate to your browser's extension management page:
    - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
    - Firefox: `about:addons`
    - Safari: Preferences > Extensions
  - Confirm uBO Scope is enabled.
- **Check for Installation Errors:**
  - On the extensions page, look for any error messages or warnings related to uBO Scope.
- **Restart Your Browser:**
  - Sometimes a simple restart restores the icon.

<Note>
If the icon is still missing after these checks, try reinstalling the extension from the official store.
</Note>


## 2. Extension Does Not Show Any Network Data

After installing uBO Scope, opening the popup and seeing "NO DATA" or no domains listed usually indicates an issue with permissions or the extension's ability to monitor network requests.

Follow these troubleshooting steps:

- **Check Required Permissions:**
  - uBO Scope requires permissions to track active tabs and web requests. Ensure you have granted these during the installation or in your browser's extension settings.
- **Verify Browser Compatibility and Version:**
  - Ensure your browser version meets the minimum requirements:
    - Chrome: 122.0 or newer
    - Firefox: 128.0 or newer
    - Safari: 18.5 or newer
- **Confirm the Extension Is Active on the Current Tab:**
  - uBO Scope works per tab. If you open a new tab (like `about:` or settings pages), it may show no data.
  - Visit a standard HTTP or HTTPS website and then open the extension popup.
- **Disable Conflicting Extensions:**
  - Some privacy or security extensions might block uBO Scope's ability to monitor network requests.
  - Temporarily disable other extensions to isolate conflicts.
- **Reload the Tab:**
  - Reload the website tab after installing uBO Scope to trigger network monitoring.

<Warning>
Network requests made outside the browser's `webRequest` API scope cannot be monitored by uBO Scope. For instance, requests made by native applications or some special browser tabs won’t show any connections.
</Warning>

## 3. Badge Count Is Not Updating

The extension badge count on the toolbar icon should reflect the number of third-party remote servers connected on the current tab.

If this count does not update:

- **Check Tab Activity:**
  - The badge updates only for the active tab in the current browser window.
- **Reload the Active Tab:**
  - The badge updates on network activity; refreshing the page triggers this.
- **Verify Extension State:**
  - Make sure the extension is still enabled and has required permissions.
- **Clear Browser Cache and Data:**
  - Sometimes stale cache may interfere with proper function.

## 4. Extension Not Installing or Missing from Store

If you cannot find uBO Scope in your browser’s extension store or encounter installation failures:

- **Confirm Browser Requirements:**
  - The extension supports recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari only.
  - Older browsers or alternative browsers may not support uBO Scope.
- **Use Official Sources:**
  - Only install the extension from the browser’s official add-on or extension stores:
    - Chrome Web Store: [uBO Scope on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
    - Firefox Add-ons: [uBO Scope on Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- **Manual Installation:**
  - For Linux users or advanced scenarios, manual building and loading from source is possible. See the [Installing uBO Scope guide](/getting-started/setup-installation/installation-instructions) for details.

## 5. Extension Shows Incomplete or Unexpected Connection Data

Sometimes users report seeing fewer or more domains than expected.

- **Understanding Metrics:**
  - The badge count is the distinct number of unique third-party domains contacted, not the total requests.
  - Some domains might be shown under "stealth-blocked" or "blocked" categories depending on filtering outcomes.
- **Content Blocker Interference:**
  - uBO Scope works alongside other content blockers but reports raw requests as seen by the browser’s networking API.
  - Some content blockers silently redirect or proxy requests, which uBO Scope treats as "stealth" events.
- **Network Request Visibility Limitations:**
  - Requests outside the browser context or those made by other apps are not captured.
