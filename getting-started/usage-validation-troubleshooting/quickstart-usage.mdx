# Quickstart: See uBO Scope in Action

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide leads you through a swift, satisfying first experience by helping you open a website and observe how uBO Scope’s popup reveals all network connections initiated by that page. We’ll walk you through the key elements of the popup interface, explain what the badge counts mean, and highlight what information to focus on during your first exploration.

---

## 1. Open a Website and Activate uBO Scope

The power of uBO Scope comes alive as you browse the web. To get started:

1. **Open your preferred browser where uBO Scope is installed and active** (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
2. Navigate to any website you want to inspect — for example, https://example.com.
3. Once the page loads, **click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon** (it looks like the extension’s logo).

<Tip>
Clicking the icon opens uBO Scope’s popup that provides real-time insight into all the distinct network connections the page attempted or successfully made. This includes connections blocked or allowed by content blockers and even stealth-blocked requests.
</Tip>

## 2. Understand the Popup Interface

When the popup opens, here’s what you’ll see:

### 2.1 Current Website Identification

- At the top, uBO Scope displays the **current page’s hostname and domain**.
- The hostname typically includes all subdomains and the domain (e.g., `news.example.com`).
- The domain is the core base domain (e.g., `example.com`).

### 2.2 Domain Connection Summary

- Below the hostname, the **summary section shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected to by this page**.
- This count corresponds exactly to the badge number on the toolbar icon.
- A **lower count indicates fewer third-party server connections**, which often correlates to a more privacy-friendly page.

### 2.3 Connection Outcome Sections

The popup divides observed domains into three outcome categories, each showing a list of domains and the number of requests made:

| Section           | What It Shows                                    |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**   | Domains the page successfully connected to.      |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains where network requests were redirected stealthily, typically to prevent detection. |
| **Blocked**       | Domains with network requests that failed or were blocked.|

Each domain entry displays the domain name and a count of how many requests were observed.

<Tip>
Hovering over or looking carefully at these lists helps you analyze third-party exposure and verify how content blockers or stealth blocking affect your browsing.
</Tip>

## 3. What the Badge Count Means

- uBO Scope’s toolbar badge number **reports the count of distinct third-party remote server domains contacted for the active tab’s page**.
- Only unique domain names are counted, ignoring how many individual requests each client makes.
- This is your quick visual indicator of how many different third parties are connected.

<Note>
A domain on the "Not Blocked" list is by definition included in the badge count. Domains in "Blocked" or "Stealth-Blocked" lists do not count towards the badge since the connection either failed or was prevented stealthily.
</Note>

## 4. Running Your First Test: Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through a real scenario:

1. Open your browser and go to https://news.example.com (replace with any site you like).
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
3. Observe the following:
   - The hostname and domain at the top reflect the site.
   - The summary shows a number like "10" domains connected.
   - The "not blocked" section lists domains such as `cdn.example.com`, `analytics.thirdparty.net`.
   - The "blocked" section may be empty if no requests failed, or list domains if requests were blocked.
   - The "stealth-blocked" section shows domains where stealth blocking is detected.

<Tip>
Focus on the "not blocked" list to understand your real exposure to third-party connections when visiting that page.
</Tip>

## 5. Tips and Best Practices

- **Regularly check multiple websites** to compare how many third-party domains are connected.
- Use the popup **to evaluate the effectiveness of your content blockers**, noting that a lower distinct domain count is generally better.
- Remember, **not all third-party domains are malicious or intrusive**; many are legitimate CDNs or essential resources.
- If you see unusual or unexpected third-party domains, consider investigating further or adjusting your filters.

<Warning>
If the badge count is empty or the popup shows "NO DATA", ensure the site was fully loaded and that uBO Scope is enabled with the right permissions. See troubleshooting guides if this issue persists.
</Warning>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Popup shows no data or remains empty:**
  - Reload the active website to refresh network data.
  - Confirm that uBO Scope is enabled and allowed to run on the site.
  - Check for browser compatibility and version requirements.

- **Badge count doesn’t update:**
  - Try switching tabs or reloading the current tab.
  - Ensure no other extensions are interfering with webRequest API.

- **Confusion over stealth-blocked domains:**
  - These are connections that were redirected or blocked in a way that avoids detection by the webpage.
  - They do not add to the badge count but indicate blocking activity.
