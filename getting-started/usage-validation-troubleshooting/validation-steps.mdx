# Validating uBO Scope Is Working

This guide provides a simple, practical checklist to confirm that uBO Scope is correctly installed and actively reporting network connections in your browser. You will learn how to verify that uBO Scope is capturing data properly and identify signs of a successful setup.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation and Activation

Before validating uBO Scope’s functionality, ensure it is fully installed and running inside your browser.

### Steps:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon** in your browser's toolbar or extension area.
2. If not visible, check your extension management page to ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
3. Click the icon to open the popup interface and verify it loads without errors.

<Check>
If the popup is accessible and displays a "NO DATA" message or domain data, the extension is installed and running.
</Check>

---

## 2. Open a Webpage to Generate Network Activity

uBO Scope monitors active network connections initiated by tabs. To see meaningful data, visit typical websites that are known to make multiple network requests.

### Suggested Test Websites:

- https://www.wikipedia.org
- https://www.amazon.com
- https://www.bbc.com
- https://www.nytimes.com
- https://www.youtube.com

### Steps:

1. Open a new tab and navigate to one of the sites above.
2. Allow the page to fully load, including images, scripts, and ads.

<Info>
Choose popular sites with a variety of third-party content for a richer set of network requests.

## 3. Access the uBO Scope Popup to View Reported Connections

After visiting a website, use uBO Scope’s popup interface to inspect network connection data.

### Steps:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. Observe the popup for the following:
   - The hostname and domain of the active tab displayed prominently.
   - A count of the unique connected domains.
   - Three distinct sections showing domains under these categories:
     - **not blocked**: Network connections allowed by uBO Scope.
     - **stealth-blocked**: Connections that are redirected or modified stealthily.
     - **blocked**: Connections that were actively blocked.

### Expected Results:

- The tab's domain and hostname are shown in the popup title area.
- The domain count is a non-zero number reflecting active connections.
- Domains list populates under at least one of the three categories.

<Check>
If these indicators appear, uBO Scope is correctly reporting traffic.
</Check>

---

## 4. Interpret the Results for Confirmation

Understanding the popup data helps confirm valid operation:

- A non-zero count of connected domains means uBO Scope is receiving network event data.
- Domains under **not blocked** indicate allowed connections.
- The presence of any **stealth-blocked** or **blocked** domains shows uBO Scope is catching modified or blocked connections.

### Tips:

- If the popup shows "NO DATA" or zero connected domains after browsing active sites, verify permissions and browser compatibility.
- The badge count on the extension icon should reflect the count of allowed domains and update in real-time.

## 5. Common Validation Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

If validation fails, the following issues are common:

### Issue: Extension Icon Missing or Inactive
- Make sure uBO Scope is enabled in your browser’s extension settings.
- Restart the browser if necessary.

### Issue: No Domain Data or "NO DATA" Shown
- Confirm that the visited site triggers network requests.
- Verify browser version compatibility (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Check that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (see Installation guide).

### Issue: Badge Count Not Updating
- Switch tabs away and return to refresh.
- Reload the extension or browser.

<Accordion title="Troubleshooting Tips Example">
- Ensure the browser is not blocking extension background scripts.
- Disable conflicting extensions that may block webRequest APIs.
- For Safari, strict_min_version must be met and extension enabled in preferences.
</Accordion>
