# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide helps you quickly resolve frequent problems that may arise after installing or activating the uBO Scope extension. If you notice the badge missing, the popup not updating, or the extension not reporting connections, follow the steps below to get uBO Scope tracking network requests effectively without delay.

---

## 1. Badge Not Showing or Not Updating

The toolbar badge is your primary visual indicator of uBO Scope’s activity, displaying the count of distinct third-party domains connected per tab.

### Troubleshooting Steps

- **Confirm Extension Is Installed and Enabled**
  1. Open your browser's extensions or add-ons page.
  2. Verify that 'uBO Scope' is listed and enabled.
  
- **Pin the Extension Icon (Chrome/Edge/Firefox)**
  Pinning ensures the extension’s icon and badge are visible in the toolbar.

  - *Chrome*: Click the puzzle-piece icon, then click the pin icon next to uBO Scope.
  - *Firefox*: The icon should automatically appear; if not, check toolbar customization.

- **Reload the Active Tab**
  Sometimes the badge won't update until the page is reloaded.

- **Check Permissions**
  uBO Scope requires `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` permissions. Confirm permissions:
  
  - Go to extension details.
  - Review granted permissions.

- **Restart the Browser**
  A browser restart may resolve internal state sync issues.

### What to Expect

Once working, the badge number updates dynamically, reflecting the count of distinct third-party domains allowed on the active tab.

## 2. Popup Panel Does Not Load or Shows 'NO DATA'

The popup panel must connect to the extension’s background scripts to display live connection data.

### Troubleshooting Steps

- **Ensure Active Tab is Selected**
  Open the popup on an active, loaded browser tab.

- **Reload the Tab**
  The extension begins tracking on tab load or reload.

- **Wait a Moment**
  The popup relies on background data processed asynchronously; initial delay may occur.

- **Check Console Logs for Errors**
  - Open popup (click icon).
  - Right-click and select 'Inspect' or 'Inspect Popup'.
  - Look for any error messages related to loading or messaging.

- **Disable Conflicting Extensions**
  Other extensions that heavily modify network requests or block extensions may interfere.

- **Update the Browser and Extension**
  Using the latest stable versions eliminates compatibility issues.

## 3. Extension Not Reporting Connections or Showing Zero Counts

If uBO Scope reports zero or stale network requests, it might be related to browser limitations or external blocking.

### Troubleshooting Steps

- **Browser Compatibility and Version**
  - Chromium-based browsers require version 122 or above.
  - Firefox requires version 128 or above.
  - Safari requires version 18.5 or above.

- **Check if `webRequest` API Is Being Blocked**
  uBO Scope listens to the browser’s `webRequest` API to capture connections.

  - Some privacy-focused browsers or configurations may limit this API.
  - VPNs or firewall software that filters network traffic may obscure network events.

- **Content Blocker Interference**
  Content blockers that hard-block requests via DNS or external filtering sometimes prevent the extension from seeing the request at the network API level.

- **Test with a Simple Page**
  Load a common website (e.g., https://example.com) and confirm if the badge updates.

- **Restart Extension Service Worker (Chromium)**
  Sometimes the background service worker may be unloaded or stalled.

  To restart:
  1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
  2. Enable 'Developer mode'.
  3. Click 'Service worker' link under uBO Scope and reload it.

- **Clear Extension Storage**
  Reset stored session data:

  ```javascript
  // In console of background service worker or via extension UI dev tools
  browser.storage.session.clear();
  browser.storage.local.clear();
  ```

  Then reload the browser tab.

## 4. Popup Not Updating After Navigation or Tab Switch

The popup reflects the currently active tab’s connections.

### Troubleshooting Steps

- **Close and Reopen the Popup**
  Popup only refreshes data on open.

- **Ensure Tab Has Finished Loading**
  For dynamic sites, initial connection data might not be available immediately.

- **Manually Refresh the Tab**
  Reload the page to trigger new network events.

## 5. Specific Browser Troubleshooting

### Chrome/Chromium

- Minimum version: 122.
- Service worker based background script may unload; use dev tools to check.

### Firefox

- Add-on ID `uBO-Scope@raymondhill.net` is required.
- Minimum version: 128.

### Safari

- Minimum version: 18.5.
- Extension requires full webRequest permission support.

## 6. Additional Tips and Best Practices

- Disable other extensions temporarily to isolate any conflicts.
- Confirm you are browsing sites with third-party content; some local or intranet sites may show fewer connections.
- Keep your browser and extensions up to date.
- Restart your system if all else fails to clear any lingering resource issues.
