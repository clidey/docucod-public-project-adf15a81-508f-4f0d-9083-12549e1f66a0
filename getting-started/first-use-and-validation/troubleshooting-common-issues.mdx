# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide helps you quickly diagnose and resolve the common problems encountered during the installation and initial setup of uBO Scope. By following these practical steps and tips, you’ll ensure the extension runs smoothly so you can accurately monitor your browser’s network connections.

---

## 1. Extension Icon Does Not Appear

If you install uBO Scope but cannot see the extension icon on your browser’s toolbar, try the following:

- **Verify Installation Success**
  - Go to your browser’s extensions page (`chrome://extensions/`, `about:addons`, or `safari://extensions`).
  - Confirm that uBO Scope is installed and enabled.

- **Pin the Extension (Chromium / Firefox)**
  - In the extensions popup, pin uBO Scope to the toolbar manually.

- **Browser Compatibility and Version**
  - Ensure your browser version meets minimum requirements:
    - Chromium ≥ 122.0
    - Firefox ≥ 128.0
    - Safari ≥ 18.5

- **Reload or Restart the Browser**
  - Sometimes a browser restart or disabling/enabling the extension resolves display issues.

<Warning>
If the extension is not listed, the installation failed or was blocked by browser policies. Please reinstall following the instructions in the [Installing uBO Scope](../../getting-started/installation-and-setup/installing-ubo-scope) guide.
</Warning>

## 2. Missing Permissions or Incomplete Activation

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network requests effectively. Common symptoms of missing permissions include:

- Empty or no data showing in the popup panel.
- The badge count remains zero even on network-active sites.

### How to Fix

- **Grant Required Permissions**
  - On some browsers, extensions request permissions at install or first run.
  - Go to the extension details page and verify that `webRequest` and `storage` permissions are granted.

- **Re-enable the Extension**
  - Toggle the extension off and on again to prompt permission requests.

- **Check for Conflicts**
  - Other extensions or strict browser policies may interfere. Temporarily disable conflicting extensions.

- **Update the Browser**
  - Older versions may silently fail to grant needed permissions.

- **Consult the First-Time Configuration Guide**
  - Follow detailed steps in [First-Time Configuration](../../getting-started/installation-and-setup/extension-configuration) to ensure proper setup.

---

## 3. No Requests or Data Showing for Active Tabs

If uBO Scope is installed and the icon shows, but the popup panel displays “NO DATA” or no domain connections are listed:

- **Wait a Few Seconds**
  - The extension collects data asynchronously. Allow a short delay after page load.

- **Check Web Request Filtering Support**
  - uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API.
  - Some browsers or page contexts might limit `webRequest` events.

- **Navigate or Reload the Page**
  - Sometimes simply reloading the tab triggers data collection.

- **Try Different Websites**
  - Test on multiple websites that are known to load external resources.

- **Browser Permissions for Extensions**
  - Ensure the extension has access to monitor the domains you are testing.

- **Review Browser Console for Errors**
  - Open developer tools on the extension’s popup or background page to spot errors.

---

## 4. Badge Count Is Incorrect or Unexpectedly High

The badge on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon displays the count of distinct third-party domains that were connected by the active tab.

- **Understand What the Badge Represents**
  - It counts distinct allowed third-party domains, not blocked domains.
  - A higher count means more third-party servers contacted.

- **Check for Background Activity**
  - Some pages trigger hidden network requests (e.g. ads, trackers, CDNs).

- **Clear Session Data by Restarting the Browser**
  - Residual data from previous sessions may affect count temporarily.

- **Verify Third-Party Connections**
  - Use browser developer tools’ Network tab to confirm external connections.

- **Consult the FAQ Entry**
  - See [Why is my badge count unexpectedly high?](../../faq/troubleshooting-optimization/why-is-my-badge-count-high) for more insights.

---

## 5. Extension Does Not Update Data After Navigation

If you notice that data does not appear to update when switching tabs or navigating:

- **Ensure Background Service Worker Is Running**
  - Some browsers may unload background workers.
  - Use browser extension debugging to verify the background script is active.

- **Reload the Extension**
  - Reload/refresh the extension from the extensions management page.

- **Check for Errors in the Background Log**
  - Errors in `background.js` can prevent proper updating.

- **Verify Session Data Storage**
  - Session persistence is critical. Make sure storage APIs are functioning (see `js/ext.js`).
