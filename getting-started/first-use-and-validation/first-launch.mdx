# First Launch & Basic Configuration

Welcome to your first step with uBO Scope. This guide walks you through activating the extension, understanding the permissions it requests, and exploring the core popup panel that reveals live insights about network connections from your active browser tab. By the end, you’ll confidently interpret the badge counter on the toolbar icon and navigate the popup panel to see what remote servers your browser is interacting with.

---

## 1. Activating uBO Scope

The activation of uBO Scope is straightforward but varies slightly depending on your browser.

### Step-by-Step Activation

1. **Install the Extension**
   - Ensure you have installed uBO Scope from your browser’s official extension store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-Ons, Safari Extensions).

2. **Locate the Extension Icon**
   - After installation, look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
   - The icon uses the uBO Scope logo and displays a badge counter once you begin browsing.

3. **Grant Permissions When Prompted**
   - Upon first use, your browser will request permissions.
   - Common permissions include:
     - `activeTab`: To access the URL and details of the active tab.
     - `storage`: To save session data.
     - `webRequest`: To monitor network requests your browser makes.
   - *Accept these permissions to enable uBO Scope to function fully.*

<Tip>
Granting these permissions is essential; without `webRequest` or `activeTab`, the extension cannot monitor or report network connections.
</Tip>

## 2. Opening and Understanding the Popup Panel

The popup panel is your primary window into uBO Scope’s data. It shows domains your active tab has connected to, broken down by categories.

### How to Open

- Click the uBO Scope icon on your toolbar.
- The extension will open a popup window displaying network data for the currently active tab.

### Popup Panel Overview

The panel is structured as follows:

- **Hostname Display:** The top header shows the hostname of your active tab (in Unicode).
- **Domain Summary:** Below the header, the total count of distinct connected domains is displayed.
- **Connection Categories:** 
  - `Not Blocked`: Domains the tab connected to successfully.
  - `Stealth-Blocked`: Domains where connections were redirected or altered stealthily.
  - `Blocked`: Domains where connections were blocked or failed.

Each section lists domains with the number of connections observed.

<Info>
Domains are shown in their Unicode form for clarity if they include internationalized characters.
</Info>

<Tip>
If the panel shows “NO DATA” or counts remain at zero, reload your active tab and open the popup again to refresh connection data.
</Tip>

## 3. Understanding the Badge Counter

The badge on the toolbar icon shows a numeric count representing **the number of distinct third-party remote domains** your active tab has connected to successfully. This helps you quickly assess the network footprint:

- **Lower counts** typically mean fewer third-party connections, indicating potentially better privacy.
- **Higher counts** suggest more unique connections to remote servers.

This count excludes first-party hosts and focuses only on third-party domains.

<Warning>
Avoid interpreting the badge count as a direct measure of blocking effectiveness; it reports allowed third-party connections only.
</Warning>

- **Switch Tabs:** Open the popup on different tabs to compare connection profiles.
- **Observe the Badge:** Watch how the badge number changes as you browse.

## 6. Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions on First Launch">
<Accordion title="Why does the extension ask for webRequest permission?">
This permission allows uBO Scope to monitor all network requests your browser initiates, which is critical for accurately reporting remote server connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if the popup shows 'NO DATA'?">
Either no network requests have been captured for the tab yet, or permissions were not granted. Try reloading the page or reinstalling the extension with proper permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope interfere with content blocking?">
No, uBO Scope passively observes network activity and does not block or modify traffic itself.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
