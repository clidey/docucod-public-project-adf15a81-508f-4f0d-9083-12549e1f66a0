# Using the Extension for the First Time

Welcome to your first interaction with **uBO Scope**. This guide will walk you through how to open the extension's popup, what you will see on initial launch, and how to interpret the real-time connection summary it provides as you browse the web.

---

## 1. Accessing the uBO Scope Popup

After installing and configuring uBO Scope, the primary way you interact with it is through its browser toolbar icon.

### Steps to Open the Popup

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon** on your browser’s extension toolbar. It displays a simple badge with a number indicating third-party domain connections.
2. **Click on the icon** to open the popup panel.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the icon, ensure the extension is enabled and visible in your browser’s toolbar or extensions menu.
</Tip>

## 2. What to Expect on First Launch

### Initial Popup Layout
Upon opening the popup for the first time, you will see:

- A **heading** displaying the domain and hostname of the currently active tab.
- A **summary** section showing the total number of distinct connected domains.
- Three categorized sections listing domains based on connection outcomes:
  - **Not blocked** (allowed connections)
  - **Stealth-blocked** (connections blocked in a stealthy manner)
  - **Blocked** (explicitly blocked connections)

If no data is immediately available for the tab, the popup will show 'NO DATA' in place of the hostname.

### How Connection Summaries Are Updated
- The displayed connection information dynamically updates as you browse and as network requests are detected.
- The number on the extension's badge and the popup content reflect live data for the active tab.

---

## 3. Understanding the Summary and Domain Lists

### The Summary Section
Shows the **total count of distinct connected domains** for the active tab. This reflects unique third-party connections recognized by uBO Scope.

### The Domain Categories Explained
- **Not blocked:** Domains for which connections succeeded without interference.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where connections were blocked without obvious error signs—often to avoid webpage breakage or detection.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections failed explicitly due to blocking rules.

Each domain listed includes a count indicating how many connections were observed.

<Tip>
Focus on the total count of connected domains and not on block counts; a lower number is generally better and indicates fewer third-party connections.
</Tip>

## 4. Live Interaction Flow

When you open the popup for the active tab, the extension:

1. Queries the background script for tracking data related to the tab's current network activity.
2. Parses this data to classify domains into the three outcome groups.
3. Displays a clear, alphabetical list of domains under each category along with connection counts.
4. Updates this display dynamically in response to ongoing page activity and navigation.

This allows you to see at a glance the network behavior of the webpage you are currently viewing.

---

## 5. Practical Tips for First Use

- **Refresh the active tab** after launching uBO Scope to see a fresh connection summary.
- **Switch tabs and open the popup** to observe the connection landscape for different sites.
- **Watch the badge count** on the extension icon; it gives immediate feedback on the number of distinct connected domains.
- Use this data to evaluate the network activity and privacy implications of the websites you visit.

## 6. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Display Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' Continuously">

- Verify extension permissions and that uBO Scope is running.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Data Doesn’t Update When Navigating Tabs or Pages">

## 7. Next Steps

After successfully viewing your first summary:

- Explore [Interpreting the Badge Count and What It Means](https://docs.example.com/guides/interpreting-results/reading-badge) to deepen your understanding of connection patterns.
- Try reading [What Are Allowed, Stealth, and Blocked Domains?](https://docs.example.com/guides/interpreting-results/popup-domain-categories) for clarity on connection outcomes.
- Visit the [Initial Configuration and Permissions](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/installation-and-setup/initial-configuration) page if the popup doesn’t show expected data.

By mastering the popup interface, you unlock the core benefit: transparent insight into the remote server connections your browser makes.
