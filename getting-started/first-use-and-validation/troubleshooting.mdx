# Troubleshooting Common Issues with uBO Scope

If uBO Scope isn’t functioning as expected, this guide provides a practical troubleshooting workflow to quickly identify and resolve the most common issues. Whether you encounter incorrect badge counts, missing data in the popup UI, or other browser-specific quirks, follow these steps to regain full insight into your browser’s third-party connections.

---

## 1. Verify Extension Installation and Permissions

Before diving deeper, confirm that uBO Scope is correctly installed and has the necessary permissions:

- **Check Installation**:
  - Ensure uBO Scope is listed among your browser’s installed extensions.
  - Confirm the extension’s icon appears in your browser toolbar.

- **Check Required Permissions**: uBO Scope requires the following permissions to work:
  - `webRequest`
  - `storage`
  - `activeTab`
  
  Depending on your browser, permissions are granted during installation; make sure you accepted all prompts.

- **Browser Compatibility**:
  - uBO Scope supports the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
  - For Chrome, version 122 or newer is required.
  - Firefox requires version 128 or newer.
  - Safari requires version 18.5 or newer.

<Tip>
If you recently updated your browser, restart it completely to ensure extensions load with updated permissions.
</Tip>

## 2. Check the Toolbar Badge Count

The toolbar badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains from which your browser has successfully fetched resources during the current tab session.

- **Possible Badge Issues:**
  - Badge count is zero or does not update.
  - Badge shows an unexpectedly high or low number.

- **Actions:**
  1. Reload the active tab to trigger connection data collection.
  2. Open the uBO Scope popup and verify that network connection data is displayed.
  3. Make sure you have allowed content and the browser is actively loading resources.

- **Note:**
  - The badge does not count blocked or stealth-blocked domains.
  - Low badge counts are generally desirable—higher counts indicate more third-party connections.

## 3. Troubleshooting Common Popup UI Issues

If the popup UI shows "NO DATA" or appears empty:

- **Session Data Issues:** uBO Scope tracks connection data per tab session.

  - Try closing and reopening the tab.
  - Reload the page to restart data collection.

- **Check for Conflicting Extensions:** Other privacy or content blockers might interfere with network request reporting.

  - Temporarily disable other extensions and check if uBO Scope data populates.

- **Verify Host Permissions:**

  - Some browsers require explicit host permission for `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` URLs.
  - Make sure uBO Scope has these permissions enabled.

<Tip>
Use the browser’s extension management page to review and adjust permissions if needed.
</Tip>

## 4. Browser-Specific Considerations

### Chrome

- Minimum required version is Chrome 122.
- Some network requests outside `webRequest` API visibility (e.g., service workers) will not be reported.
- The extension runs as a service worker, which may be unloaded; data persists in session storage.

### Firefox

- Requires version 128 or newer.
- Similar to Chrome, some network activities outside `webRequest` API might not appear.
- Confirm that the extension ID is correct and not blocked by browser policies.

### Safari

- Requires Safari 18.5 or newer.
- Extension permissions and behavior might be more restrictive.
- Check Safari extension preferences to grant required permissions.

## 5. Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
| ------- | --------- | -------- |
| Badge count does not update or is empty | Extension lacks permissions or browser is blocking data access | Restart browser, verify permissions, reload the tab |
| Popup shows "NO DATA" for an active tab | Session data not collected or erased, no network requests observed | Reload the page, try on different websites, check for conflicting extensions |
| Unexpectedly high badge count | Real third-party connections increased, possibly due to whitelisted content | Review allowed domains, consider adjusting content blocker settings |
| No network information for encrypted sites | Some network layers are outside of `webRequest` API scope | Understand uBO Scope limitations; data is as reported by the browser API |

## 6. Resetting uBO Scope Data

If you suspect corrupted or stale session data:

1. Open your browser’s extension page.
2. Locate uBO Scope and choose to clear extension data or reinstall.
3. Alternatively, restart your browser to clear temporary session data.

## 7. Additional Diagnostic Steps

- **Try Different Websites:** Some sites generate more third-party requests; testing on multiple sites helps verify functionality.
- **Check the Browser Console:** For advanced users, open the browser developer console to look for errors related to uBO Scope.
- **Inspect uBO Scope Logs:** If comfortable, use browser extension debugging tools to inspect background scripts and messages.

## 8. Getting Help

If issues persist:

- **Refer to the Official GitHub Repository:**
