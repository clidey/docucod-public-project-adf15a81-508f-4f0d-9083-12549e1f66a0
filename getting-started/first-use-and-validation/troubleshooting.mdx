# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This page helps you quickly identify and resolve frequent problems encountered while using uBO Scope. Whether your extension failed to install properly, the badge count is missing, or the popup fails to display network data, you will find clear, actionable solutions here. We also provide essential advice for checking permissions and reloading the extension to get it working again.

## 1. Installation Failures

Installation issues are commonly caused by browser version incompatibility, permission restrictions, or corrupt installs. Follow these steps to fix installation failures:

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Verify Browser Compatibility**
   - Ensure you are using a supported browser and version:
     - **Firefox:** Minimum version 128.0
     - **Chrome/Chromium:** Minimum version 122.0
     - **Safari:** Minimum version 18.5
   - Older browsers will not support uBO Scope.

2. **Install From Official Sources**
   - Always install uBO Scope from official stores:
     - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
     - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
     - Safari extensions via App Store or authorized channels

3. **Check Extension Permissions During Installation**
   - uBO Scope requires `webRequest` permissions to monitor network connections.
   - If permissions are denied, the extension cannot operate properly.

4. **Reload or Reinstall Extension**
   - If installation appears successful but the extension is not working, try removing it and reinstalling.
   - Reloading the browser or restarting it can also help clear transient issues.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- If the browser blocks installation due to security settings, adjust them to allow extensions from the official source.
- Check your internet connection during installation.


## 2. Missing or Empty Badge Count

The badge count on the toolbar icon shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected by the active tab. If it is missing or shows no data, follow these steps:

### Steps to Fix

1. **Confirm the Extension is Enabled and Active**
   - Open your browser’s extensions page.
   - Verify uBO Scope is enabled, not disabled or in error state.

2. **Verify Active Tab Has Network Activity**
   - The badge will only show data if the active tab initiated network requests.
   - Try navigating to a popular website (e.g., https://www.wikipedia.org) to generate network traffic.

3. **Reload the Active Tab**
   - Sometimes tab data can be stale or lost after long browser sessions.
   - Reload the page and watch for badge updates.

4. **Check Browser Permissions**
   - Ensure the extension has permissions to monitor network requests (`webRequest`).
   - In some browsers, permissions can be revoked post-installation; restore them if needed.

### Common Pitfalls

- The badge will not display for tabs without network requests (about:blank, internal pages).
- Content blockers or other extensions interfering with network monitoring can affect badge accuracy.


## 3. Popup Panel Not Displaying Network Data

If clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon opens the popup but shows 'NO DATA' or empty domains lists, take the following actions:

### Step-by-Step Resolution

1. **Ensure the Active Tab is Loaded and Has Network Requests**
   - uBO Scope gathers data per tab; the popup shows data only for the active tab.
   - Try visiting a site that loads resources externally, then open the popup.

2. **Reload the Popup**
   - Close and reopen the popup to refresh content.
   - Sometimes the popup UI may fail to update if the extension's background processing is delayed.

3. **Reload the Active Tab and Extension**
   - Reload the current browser tab to force new network requests.
   - If still empty, disable and enable the extension again.

4. **Check for Console Errors**
   - Open the browser's developer tools (F12) and inspect the extension popup for errors.
   - Errors may indicate permission or script loading issues.

5. **Restart the Browser**
   - A full browser restart can clear extension service worker or background script glitches.

### Important Notes

- The popup depends on background data collected from the `webRequest` API; if your browser or environment restricts this API, data may not populate.
- In private/incognito mode, some browsers restrict data collection - check extension settings for private mode permissions.


## 4. Checking Permissions Manually

Incorrect or missing permissions are often the root cause of failures. You can confirm permissions through your browser's extension management interface:

### How to Verify

- Open the browser menu and go to the extensions page.
- Find uBO Scope and click on "Details" or equivalent.
- Verify **Permissions** include:
  - `webRequest`
  - `activeTab`
  - `storage`
- Ensure **Host Permissions** include: `http://*/*`, `https://*/*` (and `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` for Chromium).
- If any permission is missing, re-enable them via browser controls or reinstall the extension.


## 5. Reloading the Extension

When you suspect the extension’s background processes are unresponsive or stale, reloading uBO Scope can resolve many issues.

### How to Reload

1. **Using the Browser's Extensions Page:**
   - Navigate to the extensions manager.
   - Locate uBO Scope.
   - Toggle it off and then back on.
   - Or use the “Reload” button if available.

2. **Restart the Browser:**
   - Close all browser windows.
   - Restart the browser application.

3. **Manually Reload the Popup:**
   - Close and reopen the popup window (click toolbar icon).


## 6. Additional Tips and Best Practices

- Regularly update your browser and extensions to the latest versions to ensure compatibility.
- Use the extension alongside your content blocker but be aware that uBO Scope reports network activity irrespective of blocking results.
- If you continue to experience issues, check for conflicts with other extensions by disabling all others temporarily.
