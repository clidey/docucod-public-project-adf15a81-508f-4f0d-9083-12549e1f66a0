# Getting Results: Your First Run with uBO Scope

Welcome to your first interaction with uBO Scope’s popup dashboard! This guide walks you through how to open and understand the summary of third-party servers your current webpage contacts. You’ll learn how to interpret the badge on the toolbar icon, navigate the popup content, and decode what 'blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'not blocked' connections actually mean.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

To view the results of your current webpage’s network activity:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon on your browser’s toolbar.
2. The popup window will open, displaying the summary for the active tab.

<Check>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA', it means uBO Scope has not yet recorded any network activity for the current tab. Reload the page to allow uBO Scope to gather data.
</Check>

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The badge displayed directly on the uBO Scope toolbar icon indicates the number of distinct third-party remote domains with which your browser successfully connected while loading or interacting with the webpage.

- **The count only includes third-party domains.**
- **A lower count means fewer third-party connections — usually a positive indicator of limited external tracking or resource loading.**

---

## 3. Popup Summary Overview

The popup is divided into several clear sections that categorize third-party domains contacted:

### Domains Connected
- Displays the **total number of distinct third-party domains** detected for the current page.

### Outcome Categories
The domain details are broken down into three groups:

| Outcome       | Meaning                                                     | How It Appears                                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**  | Third-party connections allowed by your content blocker(s). These are network requests that succeeded without interference. | Shown under the “not blocked” section with domain names and request counts.
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Connections that were redirected or otherwise stealthily intercepted so the webpage likely doesn’t realize they were blocked. These requests may be silently redirected or altered to mask blocking. | Listed under the “stealth-blocked” section.
| **Blocked**      | Connections explicitly blocked and failed. These are network requests your content blocker or DNS filter prevented completely. | Visible under the “blocked” section.

Each domain displays alongside it a count badge indicating the number of requests made to that domain during the page load.

## 5. Tips for Interpretation

- **Not Blocked:** These domains are successfully contacted and typically include legitimate services like CDN providers or essential third-party resources necessary for the website to function correctly.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** These connections are blocked or redirected silently. Because these are hidden, some webpages may behave as if these requests succeeded. This helps maintain webpage functionality or evade detection by anti-blocking scripts.
- **Blocked:** Requests that completely failed to connect. This might include trackers, ad servers, or known malicious hosts that your content blocker has actively blocked.

<Warning>
A high number under "not blocked" means many third-party connections were allowed. Consider reviewing your content blocker’s settings if you want more aggressive filtering.
</Warning>

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **Empty or no data shown:** Reload the webpage to allow uBO Scope to collect fresh data.
- **Badge count doesn’t update:** Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and has the required permissions. See the installation and troubleshooting pages if persistent issues occur.
- **Domains missing or appear incorrect:** uBO Scope uses a public suffix list to group related hosts into domains accurately, ensuring reliable distinction between domains.

## 7. Next Steps

- After getting familiar with your first results, explore the [Configuring for Your Environment](../basic-configuration) page to tailor uBO Scope’s behavior.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](../troubleshooting-installation) guide if any issues arise.
- For detailed interpretation of block counts and stealth blocking, see [Interpreting Blocked and Stealth-Blocked Domains](../../core-workflows/interpreting-blocked-stealth-counts) guide.
