# Your First Run

Welcome to your first interaction with uBO Scope! This guide walks you through opening the extension, interpreting the popup interface, and understanding the key data displayed during your initial usage.

---

## 1. Activating uBO Scope

uBO Scope is a browser extension that reveals which third-party remote servers your current webpage connects to during loading and usage.

### Step-by-step to open uBO Scope:

1. **Open your preferred supported browser:** Chromium (version 122+), Firefox (128+), or Safari (18.5+).
2. **Navigate to any website** of your choice. This can be your favorite news site, blog, or any page that loads external resources.
3. **Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.** It is a colorful badge icon displaying the number of distinct third-party connections detected.
4. **Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.** This action opens a popup window presenting detailed connection information for the active tab.

<Tip>
If the extension icon is not immediately visible, you may need to pin it to your browser toolbar via your browser’s extensions menu.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface

Once opened, the uBO Scope popup provides a concise yet insightful summary of network connections involving the active webpage.

### Key elements you will see:

- **Tab Hostname Header:** At the top, the popup displays the hostname of the current browser tab.
- **Domains Connected:** A summary count showing the number of distinct third-party domains the page connected to.
- **Outcome Sections:** Three distinct sections categorize domains based on network request results:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains successfully connected without blocking.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were redirected stealthily.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were prevented entirely.

Each outcome section lists domains and includes a count badge showing the number of requests associated with that domain.

### Visual example of the popup layout:

```text
+------------------------------------+
| [current-tab-hostname]             |
| domains connected: [number]        |
|                                    |
| not blocked                       |
|  - domain1.com (count)             |
|  - domain2.net (count)             |
|                                    |
| stealth-blocked                   |
|  - stealth-domain.com (count)      |
|                                    |
| blocked                          |
|  - blocked-domain.org (count)      |
+------------------------------------+
```

## 3. What the Badge Count Means

The badge number on the toolbar icon represents the count of **distinct third-party domains** for which network requests were successful (not blocked). 

- A **lower count** generally indicates fewer third-party connections, which may reflect cleaner, less tracked browsing.
- Note that the badge updates dynamically as you browse different webpages.

<Note>
The badge count corresponds strictly to distinct domains, **not** the number of total requests. Multiple requests to the same domain count as one.
</Note>

## 4. Interpreting Domain Outcome Categories

Understanding the three categories of domain outcomes will help you grasp how uBO Scope presents your browsing data.

| Outcome Type      | Meaning                                                                                      | User Value                                                                                   |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked (Allowed) | Domains that allowed network connections; resources loaded successfully.                  | Identifies third-party servers your browser legitimately communicates with during browsing. |
| Stealth-Blocked    | Domains where requests were silently redirected or interfered with (e.g., invisible blocking). | Highlights domains the browser attempted to access but which were modified stealthily.        |
| Blocked           | Domains where network requests were outright blocked or failed to connect.                  | Shows third-party servers prevented from loading resources, usually by content blockers.     |

<Tip>
For your first run, focus on the "Not Blocked" section to understand what third-party domains your browser contacts normally.
</Tip>

## 5. Expected Behavior on Your First Run

- When you open uBO Scope on a freshly loaded webpage, you will see the hostname of that page at the top.
- The count of domains connected will reflect third-party servers involved while loading the page.
- You may notice some domains in the "Not Blocked" and some in "Blocked" or "Stealth-Blocked," depending on your browser’s content blocking and extensions.
- If no data appears (showing "NO DATA"), it may be because the tab has not initiated connections yet or the session data has not loaded fully.

<Warning>
If the popup appears empty or with stale data:
- Try refreshing the browser tab.
- Ensure uBO Scope has necessary permissions and is enabled.
- See the "Badge and Popup Troubleshooting" page for detailed resolution steps.
</Warning>

## 6. Practical Tips for Your First Run

- Visit websites with varying degrees of content and look at how different third-party domains appear.
- Compare the domain counts and outcome categories with your expectations or other privacy tools you use.
- Keep in mind that some legitimate CDNs and service domains are normally present in the "Not Blocked" list.

## 7. Next Steps

- After familiarizing yourself with the popup UI, proceed to the [Validating Functionality](https://yourdocs.example.com/getting-started/first-use-and-validation/quick-validation) guide to ensure uBO Scope works correctly.
- Explore the [Understanding Connection and Domain Counts](https://yourdocs.example.com/guides/core-workflows/understanding-domain-counts) guide for deeper insights into results interpretation.

## 8. Troubleshooting Your First Run

If you encounter issues while opening or using the popup:

- **Popup shows NO DATA:** This can happen if the tab has no recorded network connections yet. Reload the page and try again.
- **Badge count not updating:** Reload the page, or try disabling then re-enabling uBO Scope.
- **Popup doesn't open or crashes:** Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements and the extension is fully installed.

## 9. Reference to Source Code and Resources

- The popup interface is defined in `popup.html`, showing the structure of domain counts and outcome sections.
- Dynamic content and data handling is managed by `js/popup.js` which queries background session data.
- The toolbar icon badge count reflects the number of distinct allowed domains per tab.
