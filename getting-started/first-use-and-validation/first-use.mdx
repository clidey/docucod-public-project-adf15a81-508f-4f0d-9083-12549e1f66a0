# Your First Session: Checking Connections

Open uBO Scope's popup UI to analyze and interpret the network connections your browser makes related to the active tab. This guide will walk you through how to access connection details, understand the badge count indicator, and distinguish between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked third-party domains.

---

## 1. Opening uBO Scope's Popup Interface

1. Click on the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup displays aggregated connection data scoped to the currently active browser tab.
3. If the extension has not yet captured data for the active tab, you will see a message indicating "NO DATA".

<Check>
Make sure you are on a web page where third-party connections are expected. Some new tabs or blank pages won't generate meaningful data.
</Check>

---

## 2. Understanding the Badge Count on the Toolbar Icon

- The toolbar badge shows the number of **distinct third-party domains** your browser connected to successfully and that were **not blocked.**
- This count updates in real time as your browser loads resources on the active tab.
- A lower badge count is generally better from a privacy perspective, indicating fewer allowed third-party connections.

<Tip>
Do not confuse this badge count with the total number of blocked connections or total requests. It specifically represents unique allowed third-party domains.
</Tip>

## 3. Popup UI Overview & Sections

Upon opening the popup, you will see the following key sections related to your active tab:

### Tab Hostname Display
- Shows the hostname of the main page you are on.
- The domain portion is highlighted separately from the subdomain for clarity.

### Summary Section
- Indicates the total count of distinct third-party domains connected.

### Connection Outcomes
Three separate sections list domains according to their connection status:

| Section        | Description                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked** | Domains from which connections were allowed and succeeded. |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains detected as stealth-blocked (redirected or hidden blocking behaviors). |
| **Blocked**    | Domains for which connection attempts were blocked (network errors or explicit blocking). |

Each section lists domains with the number of connection attempts (count) recorded during your active tab session.

---

## 4. How to Interpret Domain Statuses

### Not Blocked (Allowed)
- These domains represent third-party resources your browser loaded successfully.
- Examples include content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics servers, ad servers allowed through your filters, or legitimate third-party services.
- The count next to each domain shows how many requests were made to it.

### Stealth-Blocked
- Domains that were blocked in a more subtle or redirection-based manner.
- These connections may be redirected or made invisible by content blockers or browser behaviors.
- Useful for advanced users or filter maintainers to understand blocking strategies beyond simple block counts.

### Blocked
- Domains where connection attempts failed explicitly due to blocking.
- These show the domains content blockers or network policies prevented your browser from accessing.

<Note>
Stealth blocking is a type of blocking detected by uBO Scope through network request behaviors and is not the same as a simple blocked request seen in browser developer tools.
</Note>

## 5. Step-by-Step Walkthrough: Viewing Your First Connections

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Any Web Page">
Open a website in your browser tab where third-party requests are expected, for example, a news site or an e-commerce store.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the extension icon in your toolbar to open the popup UI.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Badge Count and Hostname">
Check the badge count on the icon. It shows the number of third-party domains allowed on this tab.
Look at the hostname displayed in the popup to confirm it matches your current page.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Connection Sections">
Review the three domain lists (not blocked, stealth-blocked, blocked) and note which third parties were contacted.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Counts">
Try to understand the volume of requests per domain, helping identify dominant third-party services on the page.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Practical Tips for First Use

- **Reload the page** after opening the popup for a fresh session of connection data.
- Use private/incognito windows to test without cached data.
- Compare badge counts with and without other content blockers enabled to understand their impact.
- Pay close attention to stealth-blocked domains if you suspect hidden connections.

<Warning>
The popup only shows data for the active tab. To inspect another tab, switch to it and open the popup again.
</Warning>

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### No Data Displayed
- Ensure you are on a webpage that initiates network requests.
- Verify the browser permissions and that the extension is enabled.

### Badge Count Not Updating
- Reload the current tab to refresh connection tracking.
- Check for extension conflicts or browser settings blocking the webRequest API.

### Suspiciously Low or High Counts
- Understand that some third-party domains may be shared or nested as subdomains.
- Variations in content blocking rules or DNS-based blocking will impact counts.

<Tip>
Refer to the "Essential Concepts & Terminology" page to better understand connection classifications.
