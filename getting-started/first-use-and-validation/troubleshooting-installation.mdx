# Troubleshooting Installation & Setup

This guide helps you quickly resolve common hurdles encountered when installing and setting up uBO Scope. Whether your popup shows no data, the toolbar badge icon isn’t updating, or you face permission issues, this page provides practical ways to identify issues and get uBO Scope fully operational.

---

## 1. Verifying Installation Completeness

Ensure the extension installed correctly and has all required permissions to function fully.

### Steps to Confirm:

1. **Confirm Extension Presence:**
   - Check your browser's extension/add-ons page for uBO Scope.
   - Verify the presence of the uBO Scope icon in your toolbar.

2. **Check Permissions Granted:**
   - uBO Scope requires the following permissions to monitor network requests:
     - `activeTab`
     - `storage`
     - `webRequest`
   - In your browser's extension details, ensure these permissions are enabled.

3. **Supported Browsers & Versions:**
   - Verify your browser version meets the minimum requirements:
     - Chromium-based browsers: Chrome 122+
     - Firefox: 128+
     - Safari: 18.5+
   - Older versions may lack necessary APIs like `webRequest` or session storage.

<Tip>
If you're running on an unsupported or outdated browser version, update it to the latest stable release before proceeding.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding No Data in Popup or Badge Not Updating

If you click the uBO Scope icon and see “NO DATA” or the badge count never updates, follow these checks.

### Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Reload the Webpage:**
   - uBO Scope collects data as you browse.
   - Load or reload an active webpage so that uBO Scope can capture network requests.

2. **Wait for Initialization:**
   - Initial extension setup can take a moment as it loads data and processes the public suffix list.
   - Wait at least 5 seconds before opening the popup after browser start or extension reload.

3. **Check Private Mode Restrictions:**
   - Some browsers restrict background activities in private/incognito mode.
   - Test uBO Scope in a normal browsing window.

4. **Verify Background Script Active:**
   - For Chromium, ensure the service worker (`background.js`) is active.
   - For Firefox and Safari, ensure background scripts/modules are loading without error.

5. **Inspect Browser Console for Errors:**
   - Open the browser extension console (e.g., `chrome://extensions/` → details → “Service Worker” console for Chromium).
   - Look for errors related to `webRequest`, storage, or manifest permissions.

6. **Whitelist Domains in Content Blockers:**
   - If you run other blockers, ensure uBO Scope is not blocked or sandboxed.

<Tip>
Try opening sites with extensive third-party content (e.g., news or social media) to trigger network requests that uBO Scope can detect.
</Tip>

## 3. Fixing Permissions & Storage Failures

uBO Scope relies on `storage` and `webRequest` permissions; failures here will undermine data collection.

### How to Repair:

1. **Reinstall the Extension:**
   - Remove and reinstall uBO Scope from the official browser extension store.
   - This ensures manifest permissions and scripts reload correctly.

2. **Clear Extension Storage:**
   - Corrupted storage can cause session data failures.
   - Clear local or session storage via your browser’s developer tools or:
     - Go to browser extension settings → Storage → Clear data.

3. **Disable Conflicting Extensions:**
   - Temporarily disable other extensions especially those with network intercepting capabilities.
   - Retest uBO Scope to isolate if conflicts cause failures.

4. **Browser Restart:**
   - Restart your browser completely after making permission or storage changes.

<Warning>
Do not manually alter internal extension files; use official reinstall or browser tools to manage extension data.
</Warning>

## 4. Badge Count Not Reflecting Live Connections

The toolbar badge should indicate a count of distinct third-party remote servers connected by the active tab. If this does not update:

### Checklist:

1. **Active Tab Verification:**
   - Ensure you are viewing the currently active and focused tab when observing the badge.

2. **Reload the Tab:**
   - Network requests are logged per tab; refresh the tab to restart data collection.

3. **Background Script Health:**
   - A failing or unloaded background service worker can prevent badge updates.
   - Check for errors in service worker console.

4. **Browser Policies & Restrictions:**
   - Some browser security policies or privacy modes limit API availability.
   - Verify uBO Scope is allowed in your browser's privacy/security settings.

<Note>
Badge counts depend on capturing network events. If network requests are blocked before reaching the browser (e.g., system firewall), counts may be lower or missing.
</Note>

## 6. Best Practices for Reliable Setup

- Use uBO Scope in standard browsing windows instead of private/incognito modes.
- Avoid excessive extension conflicts by selectively enabling critical tools.
- Regularly reload tabs and occasionally restart your browser to refresh extension context.
- Ensure stable internet connection, as network fluctuations can affect request logging.

# Appendix: Quick Troubleshooting Command (Advanced Users)

For users familiar with developer tools, this command in the extension's background console checks if the session data is correctly loaded:

```javascript
(async () => {
    const data = await browser.storage.session.get('sessionData');
    console.log('Session Data:', data);
})();
```

Successful output with network tracking details confirms internal data storage is functional. If empty or undefined, the extension is not collecting data properly.
