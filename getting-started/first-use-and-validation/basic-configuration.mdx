# Configuring for Your Environment

Discover how uBO Scope integrates seamlessly with your browsing experience from the very first use. This guide walks you through the minimal initial settings, necessary permissions, and how the extension operates transparently without complicated configuration.

---

## 1. Initial Setup & Permissions

uBO Scope is designed to work silently in the background with minimal user intervention. However, due to browser security models, the extension requires explicit permissions to monitor network requests.

### What You Need to Allow

- **Permissions Granted on Installation:**
  - Access to the current active tab (`activeTab`)
  - Storage permission for saving session data (`storage`)
  - Access to webRequest API to observe network traffic (`webRequest`)

These permissions are requested automatically during the extension install process in supported browsers (Chromium, Firefox, Safari).

<Check>
Confirm during installation or first run that you accept the permissions prompt from your browser. Without these, uBO Scope cannot monitor connections.
</Check>

### Host Permissions

uBO Scope requests access to all HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket URLs (“`http://*/*`”, “`https://*/*`”, “`ws://*/*`”, “`wss://*/*`”) to comprehensively track remote connection attempts.


## 2. How uBO Scope Integrates Passively

uBO Scope uses the browser’s native `webRequest` API listeners behind the scenes to monitor all network requests related to the webpages you visit.

- The extension **does not alter or block** any requests.
- It detects and records requests that are **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked** by any other content blocker.
- This process is completely transparent and requires **no user configuration**.

The extension collects this data on a per-tab basis, updating the browser toolbar icon badge dynamically to reflect the number of distinct third-party servers contacted.

<Note>
The badge number represents unique third-party remote servers contacted, not the number of blocked requests.
</Note>

## 3. No Complex Preferences Needed

Unlike other extensions that require manual settings or configuration files, uBO Scope is designed to “just work.” Once installed and permissions are granted:

- You do not need to open any settings page.
- No filters or whitelist edits are required.
- The extension immediately begins reporting on active tabs.


## 4. Confirming Your Environment is Ready

After installation:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Version and Compatibility">
Ensure your browser is supported and meets minimum version requirements:
- Chromium-based browsers: Chrome 122+
- Firefox: 128+
- Safari: 18.5+

See [Supported Browsers & System Requirements](/getting-started/introduction-and-installation/system-requirements) for details.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Extension Installation">
Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It should appear ready with no error badges.
</Step>
<Step title="Visit a Website">
Open any typical website to generate network traffic.
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the toolbar icon to view the popup dashboard summarizing third-party connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe Badge Count">
Confirm the icon badge shows the count of distinct third-party servers.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If your browser blocks any permissions or network monitoring features, uBO Scope may not be able to report accurate connection data. Ensure permissions remain enabled.
</Tip>

## 5. Best Practices

- **Keep the extension enabled and updated.** Though updates are rare, staying current ensures compatibility.
- **Understand the badge counts:** A lower badge number signals fewer third-party connections, which usually indicates better privacy.
- **Use in conjunction with content blockers:** uBO Scope complements blockers by revealing network activity without interfering.
- **Restart Browser on Updates:** After installing or updating, restarting your browser ensures permission and background process initialization.

## 6. Troubleshooting Early Configuration

<AccordionGroup title="Common First-Use Questions and Issues">
<Accordion title="I don’t see any data or badge count after installation">
- Confirm the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions page.
- Refresh the current tabs or open new browsing windows to generate fresh network events.
- Ensure you have granted all permissions during installation.
- Verify your browser version meets the minimum requirements.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Browser asks for additional permissions after update">
- Grant the requested permissions promptly; these are required for the extension to function properly.
- If unsure, review permission details in the browser's extension settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="My badge count seems unexpectedly high or low">
- Remember, badge counts represent the number of unique third-party domains connected to.
- The count is unaffected by whether the connections were allowed or blocked by other extensions.
- See guides for interpreting the badge and connection details.
