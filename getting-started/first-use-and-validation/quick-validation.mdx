# Validating Functionality

Ensure that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browser’s network requests by following this straightforward validation guide. You’ll confirm that the toolbar badge updates correctly, and that the popup interface reflects allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains accurately as you browse.

---

## 1. Confirm uBO Scope is Running

Before verifying functionality, make sure uBO Scope is installed and active in your browser:

- Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- If the icon is missing, refer to the [Installing uBO Scope](../installation-and-setup/installing-ubo-scope) guide.
- Confirm the extension has necessary permissions granted (activeTab, storage, webRequest).

<Tip>
Pin the uBO Scope extension in your toolbar for easy access and visibility.
</Tip>

## 2. Verify the Toolbar Badge Behavior

The badge number on the uBO Scope icon represents the count of distinct allowed third-party domains connected to by the current active tab.

- Open a new browser tab and navigate to a website known to have multiple third-party connections (e.g., a news site or web portal).
- Watch the badge as the page loads:
  - It should update dynamically, showing a numeric count for allowed domains.
  - When no allowed connections exist, the badge will be blank.

<Warning>
If the badge does not appear or update:
- Check if your browser blocks extension badges or if the extension has been disabled.
- Enable the extension and reload the page.
</Warning>

## 3. Examine the Popup Interface

The popup interface provides detailed visibility into the network connections grouped by outcome:

- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
- Note the following sections:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains for which network requests succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains intercepted during redirects that are not visible to the page.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where network requests failed due to errors or active blocking.
- Each section lists domains involved and an associated request count.

### Practical Steps:

1. Open the popup on a tab where you saw a badge count.
2. Inspect the **Not Blocked** section for familiar third-party domains (e.g., ad servers, analytics).
3. Check for any entries under **Blocked** or **Stealth-Blocked** if you use content blockers or DNS filters.

<Tip>
Hover over or click domains to familiarize yourself with connected sites, aiding in privacy awareness and troubleshooting.
</Tip>

## 4. Validate Behavior with Other Blockers

uBO Scope is designed to work independently and alongside other content blockers (like uBlock Origin) or DNS-based filters.

1. Enable your preferred content blocker.
2. Refresh the tested website.
3. Observe uBO Scope’s popup:
   - Domains the other blocker blocks will appear under **Blocked** or **Stealth-Blocked**.
   - Allowed domains will appear under **Not Blocked**.

This confirms uBO Scope’s unbiased monitoring, revealing true connection outcomes regardless of other tools.

<Note>
If domains expected to be blocked still show as allowed, verify that your content blocker is active and rules are properly configured.
</Note>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue                                   | Resolution                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Badge does not update after page loads  | Reload the page. Check browser and extension permissions. Restart the browser if needed.        |
| No domains listed in popup              | Switch to an active tab with web activity. Clear browsing data. Reinstall the extension if needed. |
| Unexpected allowed domains despite blockers | Confirm other blockers are enabled and active. Check for conflicts or exceptions in blocker settings. |
| Extension popup remains blank or unresponsive | Disable and re-enable the extension. Check browser console for errors if familiar with dev tools. |

## 6. Understanding the Technical Verification

Behind the scenes, uBO Scope uses the browser’s webRequest API to monitor requests:

- Allowed requests are tracked and grouped by hostname and domain.
- Redirects triggering stealth blocking are flagged separately.
- Errors or active blocking trigger blocked classification.

Users don’t need to dive into this, but this transparent approach ensures accurate and up-to-date connection information.
