# Quick Validation Steps

This guide provides simple, actionable checks to verify that uBO Scope is active in your browser and effectively monitoring network connections as designed. You'll learn how to confirm uBO Scope's popup output updates when web pages load, ensuring the extension is functioning correctly.

---

## 1. Confirm uBO Scope is Installed and Enabled

Before proceeding with validation, verify that uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your browser:

1. Locate the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar. It typically uses the `uBO Scope` logo.
2. If the icon is missing:
   - Check your browser's extensions/add-ons page to ensure uBO Scope is installed.
   - Confirm the extension is enabled (not disabled or in a blocked state).

<Tip>
If you recently installed uBO Scope, you may need to restart the browser or refresh the active tabs for it to initialize properly.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup and Observe Initial State

To check if uBO Scope is actively monitoring connections:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar.
2. Observe the popup content:
   - The header at the top displays the current tab's hostname.
   - The domain connection summary (`domains connected: ?`) should update soon.
   - Sections below represent the categorized results:
     - **not blocked** (allowed connections)
     - **stealth-blocked**
     - **blocked**

3. Initially, `NO DATA` or question marks `?` may display if no network activity has been recorded for the current tab.

<Info>
The popup uses live data updated from the browser's network request events, so shortly after opening, the information will start populating as data is received.
</Info>

---

## 3. Load or Refresh a Web Page and Watch Popup Update

uBO Scope tracks remote server connections as they happen. To validate this:

1. While the popup is open, navigate to any website or refresh the current page.
2. Watch the popup content change dynamically as network requests complete.
3. Observe:
   - The header updates to show the tab's current hostname.
   - The domain count summary increases from `?` to a number reflecting distinct third-party domains.
   - Domains populate under the **not blocked** (allowed) section, indicating successful connection observation.
   - The **blocked** and **stealth-blocked** sections may populate based on your browser environment and blocking rules.

<Tip>
Choose sites with known third-party content (e.g., news sites or popular platforms) to observe more connections and validate richer output.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Understand Popup Sections and Domain Counts

The popup categorizes remote connections detected during your browsing session for the active tab:

- **not blocked**: Domains where connections were allowed.
- **stealth-blocked**: Domains where requests redirected stealthily without direct blocking.
- **blocked**: Domains where requests were explicitly blocked.

Each section lists domain names and a count badge indicating how many times connections occurred.

<Info>
The key metric uBO Scope highlights is the number of distinct allowed third-party domains shown also as a badge on the extension icon for the active tab.
</Info>

---

## 5. Validate Badge Count Matches Popup Data

1. After network activity is recorded, observe the uBO Scope extension icon badge.
2. The badge number indicates the count of distinct allowed third-party domains loaded for the current tab.
3. This count should generally match the number of domains listed in the **not blocked** section of the popup.

<Warning>
If the badge number is missing or not updating, double-check browser permissions and ensure the extension has required host access (full HTTP and WebSocket URL patterns).
</Warning>

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Quick Checks

If validation steps above fail:

- **No badge and empty popup:**
  - Confirm that uBO Scope has permission to monitor active tabs.
  - Verify host permissions include the current site's URLs.
  - Reload the tab or restart the browser.

- **Popup stuck on NO DATA:**
  - Check for conflicting extensions that may interfere with webRequest events.
  - Test on a different website or a private browsing session.

- **Missing network entries for WebSocket sites:**
  - uBO Scope requires permissions for `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*` (in Firefox and Chromium). Check extension manifest permissions if you experience missing WS data.

<Note>
For deeper troubleshooting, refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../troubleshooting-and-support) guide.

## 7. Summary and Next Steps

Once you've confirmed the popup displays domain connections and the badge updates accordingly, uBO Scope is monitoring your browser's network requests successfully.

Next, explore:

- [Configuring uBO Scope After Installation](../configuring-extension) to customize monitoring or permissions.
- [Your First Successful Run](../first-successful-run) for detailed guidance on interpreting the data.
- [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../troubleshooting-and-support) to solve common problems.

## Appendix: Popup UI Overview

The popup (`popup.html`) is structured with the following key elements:

- Header (`#tabHostname`): Displays the current tab's hostname or `NO DATA`.
- Domain summary (`#summary`): Shows total distinct connected domains.
- Three outcome sections grouped by connection outcome:
  - `not blocked`
  - `stealth-blocked`
  - `blocked`
- Each section lists domains with the count of connections.

As you browse, this popup updates in real time, reflecting the behavior and status of network requests made by the active tab.
