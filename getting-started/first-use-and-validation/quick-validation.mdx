# Quick Validation Steps for uBO Scope

Ensure your uBO Scope extension is correctly monitoring network requests and reporting remote server connections with this straightforward validation guide. These checks will help you confirm the extension’s proper installation, operational status, and data presentation.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation and Activation

1. Verify uBO Scope is installed in your browser (Chrome v122+, Firefox v128+, or Safari v18.5+).
2. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. The icon should match the distinctive logo images provided by the extension.
3. Ensure the extension is enabled and not disabled by your browser or other extension managers.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the icon, check your browser’s extensions management page and pin the extension to the toolbar for easier access.
</Tip>

## 2. Understand the Badge Count

- The number displayed over the uBO Scope toolbar icon indicates the number of **distinct third-party remote servers** your current tab has connected to.
- A lower count generally indicates fewer third-party connections, which is often preferable for privacy.

<Info>
Remember: The badge count reflects distinct domains contacted, not the number of blocked or allowed requests. This helps you understand actual distinct endpoints your browser communicates with.

## 3. Open the Extension Popup and Review the Summary

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup window.
2. At the top, observe the **hostname** and **domain** of the active tab being analyzed.
3. Review the **summary section** that reports the total number of connected domains for this tab.
4. Explore the three categorized sections detailing connection outcomes:
   - **Not Blocked:** Domains with successful connections.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were stealthily redirected or suppressed.
   - **Blocked:** Domains with failed or blocked requests.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Hostname & Domain">
Confirm the URL domain matches your active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Domain Counts">
See the total number of connected domains in the summary.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domains by Outcome">
Scroll through allowed, stealth, and blocked domain lists.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Domains are presented in their Unicode form for readability, including internationalized domains.
</Tip>

## 4. Validate Real-World Network Activity

1. Browse to a common website (e.g., your favorite news site or search engine).
2. Observe the badge count incrementing to represent third-party connections made during page load.
3. Open the popup to see detailed domains and their connection counts.
4. Reload the tab and verify changes in domain counts or additions to the allowed/blocked lists.

<Warning>
If no data appears despite network activity, ensure uBO Scope has appropriate permissions enabled and your browser supports the required `webRequest` API.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Interpretation of Results

- **Not Blocked domains** are third-party servers your browser connected to successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked domains** are requests your browser or content blockers redirected or filtered quietly.
- **Blocked domains** indicate failed or explicitly blocked network requests.

This separation helps you assess which servers your browser talks to, which are blocked silently, and which connections failed outright.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Validation Issues">
<Accordion title="No Badge Count or Popup Data">
- Ensure your browser version meets the minimum requirement (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Verify uBO Scope permissions, especially `webRequest` and host access.
- Check that other extensions or browser settings are not blocking uBO Scope’s permissions.
- Restart the browser after installation to initialize the background service worker.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Incorrect or Missing Domain Names in Popup">
- uBO Scope decodes international domain names; if domains don’t display correctly, confirm you’re using a modern browser.
- Refresh the tab or close and reopen the popup to reload data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update During Navigation">
- Sometimes dynamic page loads or SPA navigation may delay updates.
- Manually reload the tab to force uBO Scope to refresh connection counts.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
