# Configuring uBO Scope After Installation

After installing uBO Scope, you’re ready to customize and optimize your experience. This guide walks you through the available settings and permissions you might need to adjust to make the most of this lightweight extension that reveals third-party network connections.

---

## 1. Understanding uBO Scope’s Configuration Scope

uBO Scope is designed to operate with minimal user configuration. It primarily runs silently in the background, monitoring network requests through your browser’s `webRequest` API. Because it’s built for transparency and simplicity, there are no complex settings or filters to manage.

### What Can You Configure?

- **Permissions**: Ensuring the extension has the necessary permissions to monitor the network properly.
- **Host Access**: Confirming that uBO Scope can examine traffic across all desired websites.
- **Popup Interface Behavior**: Access and review the extension’s popup panel showing categorized third-party connections.

### What You Cannot Configure

- The extension does **not** provide user control over blocking or modifying requests—it only reports.
- No custom filters or ad-blocking rules are configurable, as this is outside uBO Scope’s scope.

## 2. Confirming Required Permissions

To function fully, uBO Scope requests specific permissions upon installation. Confirm these to avoid gaps in monitoring.

### Required Permissions:

- **webRequest**: Enables monitoring of network activities.
- **storage**: Saves session data and preferences.
- **activeTab**: Accesses the currently active tab to get relevant context.
- **Host Permissions**: Allows listening to requests on all HTTP(S) and WebSocket URLs.

### Verifying Permissions by Browser

1. **Google Chrome and Chromium-based Browsers:**
    - Visit `chrome://extensions/`.
    - Locate 'uBO Scope'.
    - Click 'Details' and ensure listed permissions match the above.

2. **Mozilla Firefox:**
    - Go to `about:addons`.
    - Find uBO Scope and click on it.
    - Check permissions under the extension's options.

3. **Safari:**
    - Open Safari Preferences → Extensions.
    - Select uBO Scope and verify permissions.

<Tip>
If permissions are incomplete, uninstall and reinstall the extension, ensuring you grant all requested access during the process.
</Tip>

## 3. Managing Host Access Settings

By default, uBO Scope requests host access for all sites (`http`, `https`, `ws`, `wss`). This universal access is required to monitor network requests across all browsing activity.

### Steps to Verify and Adjust Host Access

1. Open your browser’s extension management page.
2. Find uBO Scope and click on “Details” or equivalent.
3. Look for the "Site access" or "Host access" section.
4. Confirm it is set to "On all sites" or the equivalent setting that gives it full network access.

<Tip>
Restricted host access (e.g., "On click" only) will limit uBO Scope’s visibility, causing incomplete data reporting and badge counts.
</Tip>

## 4. Accessing and Using the Popup Interface

The popup panel shows detailed counts and categorizations for third-party domains connected to by the current web page.

### How to Open the Popup

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
- The popup displays:
  - The main site’s hostname.
  - Count of distinct domains connected that were **allowed** (not blocked).
  - Lists broken out by request outcome:
    - **Not Blocked**
    - **Stealth-Blocked** (requests that were stealthily redirected or hidden)
    - **Blocked**

### What You Can Learn from It

- How many distinct third-party domains are contacted by a page.
- Which third-parties are blocked or allowed, providing insight into your content blocking effectiveness.

<Tip>
If you see "NO DATA" displayed or counts remain empty, this often means the extension lacks permission or the page has made no network requests yet.
</Tip>

## 5. Simple Troubleshooting and Best Practices

### Common Issues

- **No badge count or popup data:**
  - Confirm extension permissions, especially webRequest and host access.
  - Try refreshing the webpage to capture network requests.
  - Make sure you are on a supported browser version.

- **Empty or stale popup data:**
  - Popups update in real time but might need a page reload.
  - Restart your browser if data doesn’t appear after granting permissions.

### Best Practice Tips

- Use uBO Scope along with your content blocker to better understand third-party connections.
- Regularly check the popup after loading new web pages to monitor connections.
- Remember that a lower badge count typically indicates fewer third-party connections, which usually aligns with stronger privacy.

<Warning>
No configuration options allow you to manually reset data; closing browser tabs refreshes the session data.
</Warning>

## 7. Summary

uBO Scope requires minimal setup beyond granting full host and network monitoring permissions. The value lies in its effortless monitoring of distinct third-party network connections and the clear popup interface that presents real-time feedback. Proper permission configuration ensures accurate badge counts and domain reports, empowering you to deepen your understanding of web privacy and content blocker efficacy.
