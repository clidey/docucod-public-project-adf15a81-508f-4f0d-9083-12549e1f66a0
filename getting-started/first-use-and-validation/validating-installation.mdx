# Validate Your Installation

Ensure that uBO Scope is correctly installed and is actively monitoring your browser’s network connections. This guide walks you through the key indicators that confirm the extension is working as expected, including observing the toolbar badge, opening the popup interface, and interpreting domain connection summaries.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Presence and Toolbar Behavior

uBO Scope integrates tightly with your browser’s UI to provide immediate visual feedback.

### Steps:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope Icon:**
   - After installation, find the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. It uses a distinct badge icon with the label “uBO Scope.”

2. **Observe the Toolbar Badge Count:**
   - Visit any website.
   - The toolbar icon badge number indicates the **count of distinct third-party remote servers** that have established connections while loading the page.
   - A numeric badge means the extension is actively monitoring; an empty or missing badge suggests no third-party connections detected or that the extension is inactive.

3. **Expected Visual Behavior:**
   - If you visit a site with third-party content, the badge will display a number (e.g., 3, 7).
   - On a minimal or isolated site without third-party connections, the badge will clear.

<Tip>
A badge count of zero or empty is actually a good sign, indicating fewer third-party connections.
</Tip>

## 2. Open and Explore the Popup Interface

The extension’s popup provides detailed, real-time summaries of network connection outcomes related to the current tab.

### How to Open the Popup:

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- The popup panel will appear, showing connection data for the active tab.

### What You'll See in the Popup:

- **Hostname Display:** The top header shows the main domain of the active tab.
- **Domains Connected Summary:** A count of all connected domains during the session.
- **Outcome Sections:** Three categories, each showing domains grouped by network request outcomes:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which network requests were successfully allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where redirects or stealth blocking occurred.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where network requests were explicitly blocked or errored.

Each section lists domains with how many times requests were observed.

### Steps to Verify Popup Data:

1. Ensure you are on a webpage (e.g., https://www.example.com) with active network requests.
2. Open the uBO Scope popup.
3. Verify the hostname at the top matches your current site.
4. Look for domain counts in each category; there should be some activity if the site loads third-party resources.

<Note>
The popup updates dynamically as you load different tabs or pages, reflecting the connections for the active tab only.
</Note>

## 3. Understand the Immediate Domain Connection Summaries

uBO Scope categorizes network requests by outcome, helping you quickly understand the network activity of web pages.

| Outcome       | Description                                             |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked   | Domains to which third-party requests connected successfully. These represent allowed connections.
| Stealth-Blocked | Domains where redirects occurred or subtle blocking took place without outright failures.
| Blocked       | Domains for which network requests failed, were blocked, or errored out.

### How to Interpret:

- A **lower number of 'Not Blocked' domains** generally means better privacy as fewer third-party connections were established.
- The **Stealth-Blocked** category highlights requests that may have been redirected or filtered silently.
- The **Blocked** domains indicate network requests explicitly blocked — helpful for debugging filter lists or content blockers.

<Tip>
Use these immediate summaries to assess how well your content blockers or privacy settings are working on any given site.
</Tip>

## 4. Verify on Multiple Websites

To ensure consistent and correct operation:

1. Visit a variety of familiar websites.
2. Observe the badge count and popup domains.
3. On privacy-focused or minimal sites, you should see fewer allowed connections.
4. On content-heavy or ad-supported sites, expect higher numbers.
5. Confirm the extension updates appropriately as you switch tabs or navigate.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues When Validating uBO Scope Installation">
<Accordion title="No Toolbar Icon or Badge Visible">
- Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions manager.
- Pin the extension icon in your toolbar if hidden.
- Restart the browser if icons fail to appear after installation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Always Empty or Zero">
- Visit a website with known third-party connections (e.g., https://news.ycombinator.com).
- Confirm that your browser supports the `webRequest` API fully and that no privacy settings disable extension network monitoring.
- Other content blockers or privacy tools may interfere with network visibility.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Sections">
- Sometimes the first page load may not register requests immediately; reload the page.
- Check that scripting and extension permissions are allowed.
- Verify you are clicking the icon on the active tab.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup Fails to Open or Respond">
- Update your browser to a supported version (minimum Chrome 122, Firefox 128, or Safari 18.5).
- Disable other extensions briefly to rule out conflicts.
- Restart the browser to reset extension processes.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
