# Quick Validation Steps for uBO Scope

Verify that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browser's network connections by reviewing its toolbar badge count and exploring the popup interface on various websites. This ensures the extension accurately reports remote third-party servers, displaying their count and categorization correctly.

---

## 1. Check the Toolbar Icon Badge

- After installing uBO Scope and browsing a website, look at the extension's icon on your browser toolbar.
- The **badge number** on the icon shows the count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the current tab.
- A displayed number greater than zero means uBO Scope is detecting connections and monitoring network activity.

<Check>
The badge count reflects **third-party connections** only, not first-party domains.
Lower numbers typically indicate fewer external resources are contacted.
</Check>

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- You will see sections for different categories of network connections:
  - **Allowed**: Third-party servers successfully connected.
  - **Blocked**: Connections explicitly blocked by other content blockers.
  - **Stealth**: Connections prevented or hidden using stealth techniques.

- Each section lists domains contacted, along with counts of requests.

<Info>
If a section is empty, it will not show, simplifying the interface.

## 3. Visit Multiple Websites for Comprehensive Validation

- To validate functionality across contexts, browse several types of sites (news, media, e-commerce).
- Verify that the badge count updates dynamically for each site and the popup shows third-party domains relevant to those sites.
  This confirms uBO Scope accurately tracks remote connections in varied scenarios.

## 4. Confirm Third-party Domains are Properly Categorized

- The popup displays domains grouped under the categories above.
- Domains should correctly correspond with their known status:
  - Legitimate CDNs or analytics servers often appear in **Allowed**.
  - Known ad/tracker servers might appear in **Blocked** or **Stealth** (if hiding attempts).

- If domain groups and counts reflect your browsing experience, uBO Scope is functioning as intended.

## 5. Understand the Significance of Domains and Counts

- The extension counts distinct domains, not every connection it makes.
- This allows you to see the breadth of remote connections without cluttering details.

<Note>
A high badge count signifies many third-party servers contacted – often increasing privacy risk.
A low count suggests fewer unnecessary or potentially invasive external requests.
</Note>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<Tip>
If the badge remains zero after browsing sites known to contact third parties:
- Ensure the extension is enabled and has the required permissions.
- Reload the page or try browsing a different website.
- Check for conflicting extensions that might block uBO Scope's data collection.
- Confirm you are using a supported browser version (Chromium ≥122, Firefox ≥128, Safari ≥18.5).
</Tip>

## 7. Best Practices for Effective Use

- Regularly check the badge and popup to monitor changes in third-party connections.
- Use insights from uBO Scope to assess your browser's privacy exposure.
- Combine with trusted content blockers for enhanced control.
