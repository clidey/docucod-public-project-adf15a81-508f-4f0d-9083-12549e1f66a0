# Validating Your Installation

Quickly confirm that uBO Scope is tracking network connections effectively by navigating to familiar sites and inspecting real network connection counts and statuses within the extension popup.

---

## 1. Overview

Once you have installed uBO Scope, you want to ensure it is operating correctly — capturing and reporting network activity as intended. This page guides you through validating your installation by checking real network connection data on websites you trust.

Remember: uBO Scope reveals all remote server connections initiated by webpages in your browser, regardless of any content blockers or DNS filters active.

---

## 2. How to Validate Your Installation

Follow these actionable steps to verify uBO Scope is correctly tracking and reporting:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope popup">
- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- The popup window should open immediately, displaying connection data for the active tab.
- If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or remains blank even on websites you visit, see troubleshooting below.
</Step>
<Step title="Navigate to a familiar website">
- Visit a website you know well that loads multiple third-party resources, such as a news site, popular blog, or social media.
- Wait for the page to fully load.
- The uBO Scope popup badge (toolbar icon) should update with a numerical count representing distinct third-party domains your browser connected to.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect the popup details">
- In the popup, check the sections showing ‘not blocked’, ‘stealth-blocked’, and ‘blocked’ domains.
- These lists display the third-party domains and hostnames categorized by network request outcomes.
- The domain count in the summary section should match the badge count on the toolbar icon.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm connection outcomes make sense">
- Verify that legitimate third-party services (e.g., CDNs, analytics, ad servers if allowed) are listed under ‘not blocked’.
- Known trackers or domains expected to be blocked or stealth-blocked by your content blocker should appear accordingly.
- Understanding these groupings helps confirm uBO Scope is detecting and categorizing requests correctly.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Success Criteria

Your installation is working correctly if:

- The uBO Scope icon badge updates dynamically with a count reflecting current tab’s third-party connections.
- The popup displays domain lists grouped into ‘not blocked’, ‘stealth-blocked’, and ‘blocked’ with accurate counts.
- Navigating between tabs updates the popup to show connections specific to each tab’s content.

If these conditions are met, uBO Scope is successfully monitoring network activity.

## 4. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

Use the following tips to solve issues that may arise when validating:

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation Validation">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or 'NO DATA' Message">
- Make sure the extension is enabled and updated.
- Refresh the webpage or open a new tab with a different site.
- Confirm uBO Scope has necessary permissions (see installation and system requirements documentation).
- Verify your browser version meets minimum support requirements.
- Sometimes the extension’s background process may need a restart or the browser may need restarting.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Remains Zero Despite Activity">
- Check that the website you visit actually loads third-party resources.
- Some websites use only first-party resources, resulting in low or zero counts.
- Disable other extensions temporarily to rule out conflicts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains Not Categorizing as Expected">
- Remember uBO Scope bases categorization on network request outcomes reported by the browser.
- Differences in content blocker behavior can affect classification.
- For detailed understanding, refer to the Core Concepts and Terminology page on network request outcomes and stealth blocking.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension Does Not Appear in Toolbar">
- Make sure you have completed the installation steps correctly for your browser.
- Check browser extension settings to ensure uBO Scope is visible.
- Consult the Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues guide for detailed resolution steps.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Tips for Effective Validation

- Use websites known to have multiple third-party connections for a meaningful count.
- Try browsing both new pages and tabs opened from bookmarks or direct URL entry.
- Open the popup immediately after page loads to see real-time connection status.
- Refresh pages after extension installation to trigger fresh network activity.
