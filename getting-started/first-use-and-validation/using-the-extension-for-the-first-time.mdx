# Your First Successful Run with uBO Scope

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with uBO Scope. This guide will take you step-by-step through launching the extension on an active webpage, interpreting the popup panel data, and understanding the domain connection badge and status indicators you see in your browser's toolbar.

---

## 1. Launching uBO Scope on a Webpage

uBO Scope automatically monitors network connections when you visit webpages. To view its insights:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a webpage">
Navigate to any website of your choice in your default browser where uBO Scope is installed and activated.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon">
Locate the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar (usually next to the address bar). Click it to open the popup panel.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the popup loading">
The popup will initialize and display network connection data related to the active tab. If you see 'NO DATA' or a loading state, wait a moment and refresh the webpage to trigger connection monitoring.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the popup remains empty or shows no domains, make sure you have visited a page with network activity and that uBO Scope is enabled (see the installation and configuration guides).
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Panel

The popup interface provides a categorized report of network connections made by the page you're viewing.

### Components of the Popup Panel:

- **Tab Hostname Display**: Shows the domain and subdomain of the current tab. If your tab’s hostname differs from its domain, both parts are presented separately to clarify the exact origin.
- **Domains Connected Summary**: Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains your page connected to.
- **Connection Outcome Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains where connections succeeded without interference.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections marked as redirected or invisibly altered by stealth blocking mechanisms.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where connections were actively blocked or failed.

Each section lists domains with the count of network requests observed.

<Callout title="Popup Panel Overview">
```plaintext
-------------------------------------
| tabHostname (split subdomain & domain)
|
| domains connected: <number>
|
| Not Blocked (allowed domains)
|  domain1.com         [count]
|  domain2.net         [count]
|
| Stealth-Blocked
|  domain3.org         [count]
|
| Blocked
|  domain4.io          [count]
-------------------------------------
```
</Callout>

## 3. Reading the Domain Connection Badge

The badge on the extension’s toolbar icon dynamically shows the count of distinct third-party domains for which connections were *allowed* by the extension. Remember:

- **Lower badge count means fewer allowed third-party connections, which is usually better for privacy.**
- The badge does **not** count blocked domains; blocked connections are reported only inside the popup panel.

This count updates automatically as you navigate between tabs or refresh pages.

<Note>
If the badge is empty or missing, this means zero allowed third-party remote servers were detected for the active tab.
</Note>

## 4. Status Indicators and Their Meaning

Each domain in the popup is categorized by its connection outcome:

| Status         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Not Blocked** | The page successfully connected to these third-party domains without blocking. |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Connections that were redirected or otherwise silently blocked, providing a separate report to highlight stealthy content blocking behavior. |
| **Blocked**     | Connections that were outright blocked or failed to connect, often due to content blocker or network policies. |

### Practical Example

You visit a news website:

- The extension badge shows **5**, meaning 5 unique third-party domains successfully connected.
- Inside the popup, under **Not Blocked**, you see domains like `cdn.example.com` with counts indicating how many requests were made.
- **Stealth-Blocked** might report domains if certain network requests were redirected or invisibly altered.
- **Blocked** lists domains that were prevented from connecting, possibly to track or serve ads.

## 5. What to Expect After Your First Run

- The popup panel will show data in real-time as you browse, reflecting network activity per active tab.
- The badge number updates upon page load completion or heavy network activity.
- Refreshing or switching to a different tab refreshes data.

<Check>
Ensure you have enabled all necessary extension permissions and are browsing pages with network activity for meaningful data.
</Check>

## 6. Tips & Best Practices

- **Open multiple tabs to compare connection profiles across sites.**
- **Use the badge count coupled with popup details to identify unexpected third-party connections.**
- **Reload pages to reset and update the popup if data seems outdated or missing.**
- **Consult the "What is uBO Scope?" and "Overall System Architecture" pages for a deeper understanding of the data flow and interpretations.**

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Early Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting your first run">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or is Empty">
- Confirm you visited an active webpage with outgoing network requests.
- Reload the page and open the popup again.
- Verify uBO Scope is enabled and has proper permissions per your browser’s extension settings.
- Check the browser’s developer console for errors in the extension.
- See the Troubleshooting guide for specific fixes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Number Does Not Appear or Update">
- Switch to a different tab to check if the badge updates.
- Refresh the current tab to force data refresh.
- Confirm permissions such as "webRequest" and "activeTab" are granted.
- Verify you are using supported browser versions (Chrome ≥122.0, Firefox ≥128.0, Safari ≥18.5).
