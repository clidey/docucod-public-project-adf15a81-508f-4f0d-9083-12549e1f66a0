# Your First Successful Run

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide takes you step-by-step through your very first interaction with the extension—from opening the popup to interpreting the key connection metrics it provides. You'll quickly gain practical insights into how your browser interacts with web servers as you browse.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

After successfully installing uBO Scope, the extension icon should appear in your browser toolbar, typically next to the address bar.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to a Webpage">
Open any website in the active browser tab where uBO Scope is installed. For example, visit https://example.com.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon">
Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup panel. This displays network connection data gathered for the currently active tab.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
If you do not see the extension icon, verify installation and ensure it is enabled as described in the Installation Instructions.
</Check>

## 2. Activating and Understanding the uBO Scope Popup

The popup window provides a concise report of third-party network connections made by the webpage.

### Key Sections of the Popup:

- **Domain Header:** Shows the current page's hostname and its main domain.

- **Summary:** Displays the count of distinct third-party domains connected without being blocked.

- **Three Outcome Categories:**
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains that the browser successfully connected to.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were redirected stealthily.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed due to blocking or errors.

Each category lists domains alongside how many requests succeeded, were redirected, or failed.

### How Domains and Server Counts Are Measured

- uBO Scope counts **distinct third-party domains** connected during your browsing session, not just raw block counts.
- This measurement accurately reflects actual network connections rather than just filtering actions.

<Note>
Seeing a lower "domains connected" count is desirable, indicating fewer third-party connections.
</Note>

## 3. Practical Example: Browsing and Instant Feedback

Let's explore a typical browsing example to see uBO Scope in action:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Popular News Website">
Navigate to https://news.ycombinator.com or any content-rich site.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Toolbar Badge">
The extension icon will display a small numeric badge showing the count of distinct allowed third-party domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the extension icon. The popup will show the hostname and domain for the current site at the top.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Connection Outcomes">
- Check the list under "not blocked" to see legitimate third-party services the page connected with.
- Look at "stealth-blocked" and "blocked" domains to understand which requests were blocked or stealthily redirected, revealing privacy defenses.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
These counts update as you browse new pages or refresh. Quick feedback helps you verify whether content blockers and privacy protections are effective.

## 4. Interpreting Domain and Server Connection Counts

To master uBO Scope, understand how domain counts translate to network activity:

- The **badge count** reflects the number of unique allowed third-party domains receiving connections for the active tab.
- The **popup listing** breaks down all known request outcomes by category (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).
- Domains with high request counts might be common CDNs or analytics services.

### Why This Matters

- Many web pages connect to multiple third-party services; uBO Scope helps you see exactly which and how many.
- This insight empowers privacy-conscious users to identify unexpected or excessive third-party connections.

<Warning>
Remember that not all third-party domains are harmful; many provide essential resources such as fonts or CDNs.
</Warning>

## 5. Troubleshooting Your First Run

If you encounter issues where the popup shows "NO DATA" or unexpected results:

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="No Data in Popup">
1. Make sure you have navigated to a valid webpage (not a blank tab).
2. Verify the extension has required permissions (host access & webRequest).
3. Reload the tab and open the popup again.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
1. The badge updates after the page finishes loading network requests; wait a few seconds.
2. Restart the browser to refresh extension services.
3. Confirm your content blocker is active and compatible.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unexpected High Domain Count">
1. Some websites rely on multiple third-party services.
2. Cross-check with your content blocker settings.
3. Review domains listed under "not blocked" in the popup to identify domains.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

If issues persist, consult the "Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues" guide.
