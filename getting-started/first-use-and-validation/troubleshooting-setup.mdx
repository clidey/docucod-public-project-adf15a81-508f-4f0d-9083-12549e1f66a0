# Troubleshooting Installation & Setup

Ensuring a smooth installation and initial use of uBO Scope requires attention to common issues that users encounter. This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve browser-specific problems, permission conflicts, or unexpected behaviors in the user interface, so you can start benefiting from comprehensive network connection visibility without delays.

---

## 1. Common Installation Issues Across Browsers

### 1.1 Extension Not Appearing After Installation

- **Cause:** Browser may require a restart or manual enablement of the extension.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Restart your browser fully.
  2. Check your browser's extension/add-ons page to ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
  3. Verify that the extension icon appears near the address bar.

<Tip>
If you installed uBO Scope recently but the icon does not appear, try pinning the extension manually in your browser toolbar for quick access.
</Tip>

### 1.2 Toolbar Badge Not Updating

- **Cause:** Permissions may not be granted, or the extension has not yet processed network requests.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Confirm uBO Scope has all required permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).
  2. Visit or reload a webpage that loads multiple network resources.
  3. Wait a few seconds after page load for the badge count to update.

<Warning>
If you use strict privacy settings or content blockers, verify they don’t interfere with uBO Scope’s ability to access webRequest events.
</Warning>

### 1.3 Popup Interface Shows 'NO DATA' or No Connections

- **Cause:** The current tab has not yet triggered any network requests visible to uBO Scope, or permission conflicts.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Reload the active tab to trigger network activity.
  2. Disable conflicting extensions temporarily to isolate interference.
  3. Test with common websites known to connect to multiple third-party domains (e.g., news or social media sites).

## 2. Browser-Specific Troubleshooting

### 2.1 Chromium-Based Browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)

### 2.2 Firefox

- **Minimum Version Requirement:** Firefox 128 or later.

- Ensure that `webRequest` permissions are accepted during installation.

### 2.3 Safari

- **Minimum Version Requirement:** Safari 18.5 or later.

## 3. Missing or Denied Permissions

uBO Scope relies on specific browser permissions to monitor network requests accurately.

### 3.1 Verifying Permissions

- Visit your browser extension settings page.
- Confirm the following permissions are granted:
  - **activeTab**: Allows interaction with the active browser tab.
  - **storage**: Enables saving of session recording data.
  - **webRequest**: Crucial for tracking network request outcomes.
  - **host permissions:** Access to URLs matching `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and WebSocket schemes (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) where applicable.

<Tip>
If prompted for additional permissions after installation, accept them to enable full functionality.
</Tip>

### 3.2 Troubleshooting Permission Issues

- Reinstall or update uBO Scope to the latest version to ensure permission requests work correctly.
- Restart the browser after granting permissions.
