# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

When starting with uBO Scope, new users may encounter issues related to installation, permissions, or extension visibility. This guide addresses the most common setup problems, provides clear resolution steps, and points you to additional support resources to help get uBO Scope running smoothly.

---

## 1. uBO Scope Not Appearing in Browser Toolbar

### Cause
- The extension might not be installed correctly, or the browser is hiding the extension icon.
- Browser restrictions or missing permissions can prevent the extension from being visible.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Verify installation:**
    - Confirm the extension is installed. Go to your browser’s extension/add-ons page:
      - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
      - Firefox: `about:addons`
      - Safari: `Safari > Preferences > Extensions`
    - Look for "uBO Scope" or "uBlock Origin Scope" in the list.

2. **Enable the extension:**
    - Make sure the extension is enabled (toggle on).

3. **Show extension icon:**
    - In Chrome, click the puzzle piece icon and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.
    - In Firefox, ensure toolbar customization does not hide the extension.

4. **Reload or restart browser:**
    - Sometimes a simple browser restart is needed after install.

<Tip>
If the extension icon remains missing, ensure you are running a supported browser version (see [Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/introduction-and-installation/prerequisites-and-system-requirements) for details).
</Tip>

## 2. Permissions Not Granted Fully

### Cause
- uBO Scope requires access to host permissions for network visibility. If permissions are restricted or denied, it cannot monitor connections fully.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Check permissions granted:**
    - Access your browser’s extension permissions management:
      - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`, click "Details" for uBO Scope
      - Firefox: `about:addons`, locate uBO Scope, then "Permissions"
      - Safari: `Safari > Preferences > Extensions`

2. **Confirm host access:**
    - The extension needs broad host permissions matching the manifest, e.g., access to `http://*/*` and `https://*/*`.
    - If restricted, set host access to "on all sites" or equivalent.

3. **Reinstall if needed:**
    - If permission prompts were dismissed during install, uninstall and reinstall the extension. Confirm access when prompted.

4. **Post-install configuration:**
    - Follow the guidance in [Configuring uBO Scope After Installation](/getting-started/first-use-and-validation/configuring-extension) to verify permissions.

<Warning>
Do not disable or restrict host permissions if you want complete network request visibility. Partial permissions will lead to incomplete or inaccurate reports.
</Warning>

## 3. Badge Count Not Updating or Showing Incorrect Numbers

### Cause
- Extension might not be monitoring the current tab due to lack of permissions, browser compatibility issues, or intermittent failures.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and permissions are granted as above.**
2. **Verify the tab is active and loaded after installation:**
    - The badge updates per tab and requires the active tab to send network data.

3. **Reload the tab or open a new tab:**
    - Network connection counts are updated as you browse new pages.

4. **Browser compatibility:**
    - Confirm you are using the minimum supported versions:
      - Chrome 122 or higher
      - Firefox 128 or higher
      - Safari 18.5 or higher

5. **Restart the browser:**
    - Sometimes service workers or background scripts may need a restart.

6. **Check for conflicts:**
    - Disable other extensions that might interfere with network monitoring.

## 4. Extension Fails to Monitor HTTPS or WebSocket Connections

### Cause
- Missing permissions for WebSocket URLs can lead to incomplete monitoring.

### Details
- For Chrome and Firefox, the manifest includes permissions for WebSocket (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
- Safari’s manifest currently does not include WebSocket hosts.

### Resolution
- On Firefox and Chrome, double-check that host permissions include WebSocket URLs.
- On Safari, WebSocket monitoring may be limited due to manifest restrictions.

## 5. Extension Crashes or Shows No Data on Popup

### Cause
- Background scripts may have failed.
- Session data could be corrupted.
- Browser service worker evictions can delay startup.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Reload the browser or extension:**
    - Close all browser windows and re-open.
    - Alternatively, disable and re-enable the extension.

2. **Clear session data:**
    - Clearing browser extension data/storage may resolve corrupt states. Refer to your browser’s instructions for clearing extension storage.

3. **Check console for errors:**
    - Open your browser developer console on background page/service worker or extension popup to identify errors.

4. **Report issues:**
    - If the problem persists, submit issue details with logs to the uBO Scope GitHub repository: [https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/issues](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/issues)
