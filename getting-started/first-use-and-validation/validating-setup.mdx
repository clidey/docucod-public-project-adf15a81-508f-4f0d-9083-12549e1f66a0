# Validating Your Setup

Ensure that uBO Scope is correctly monitoring your browsing connections with this straightforward validation guide. By following these steps, you'll gain confidence that the extension is tracking network requests accurately and displaying them through the popup UI as intended.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Activation and Badge Visibility

The first sign that uBO Scope is working is the appearance of its icon in your browser's toolbar.

- **Locate the uBO Scope icon** (usually labeled 'uBO Scope' or displaying its logo).
- **Observe the badge count on the icon** — this number represents the count of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections detected for the active tab.

### What You Should See:
- The icon should be visible and responsive.
- The badge should display a numeric count if there are tracked connections for the current tab; otherwise, it will be empty.

<Tip>
If the icon or badge isn't visible, verify that the extension is enabled in your browser's extension list.
</Tip>

## 2. Open the Popup UI and Review Connection Summary

The popup panel of uBO Scope provides a detailed overview of domains connected from the active tab, categorized by connection outcome.

### Steps to Access and Review:
1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar to open the popup panel.
2. At the top, note the hostname of the active tab displayed as a header.
3. Check the section labeled **domains connected:** — it should show a number representing the total distinct domains observed.
4. Review the three outcome categories shown:
   - **not blocked**: Domains for which connections were successful.
   - **stealth-blocked**: Domains where connections were stealthily blocked.
   - **blocked**: Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.

### What to Expect:
- The hostname matches the active tab’s domain.
- Domains are listed with their respective counts, reflecting how many requests were made.
- Clear separation between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

<Note>
Domains only appear under a category if there were corresponding connection attempts. Empty categories won’t be displayed.
</Note>

## 3. Verify Badge Count Corresponds to Popup Data

The badge on the toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains connected during the current tab session.

### How to Validate:
- Count the domains listed under the **not blocked** section in the popup.
- Confirm the number matches the badge count on the icon.

<Warning>
If the badge count differs from the popup domain count, try refreshing the page or reloading the extension.
</Warning>

## 4. Test With Different Websites

To be sure uBO Scope is functioning comprehensively, test it across various tabs and websites.

### Procedure:
1. Open different websites known to connect to multiple third-party domains (e.g., news sites, social media, blog platforms).
2. Observe the badge count and popup domain lists update accordingly.
3. In network-intensive sites, you should see more domains listed with differing categories.

<Tip>
To spot stealth-blocked or blocked domains, pick sites with aggressive content blockers enabled or network anomalies.
</Tip>

## 5. Understanding Domain Counts and Indicators

- **Badge number**: Reflects the count of unique allowed third-party domains connected from the current tab.
- **Domain rows**: Each row shows a single domain and the number of connection attempts.
- **Color-coded categories**: Green background (allowed), red background (blocked or stealth-blocked).

This transparent breakdown helps you interpret exactly what connections are happening.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues and Remedies">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- Ensure the extension has the necessary permissions.
- Refresh or reload the tab.
- Restart the browser if the issue persists.
- Check browser’s extension settings to confirm uBO Scope is enabled.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or 'NO DATA'">
- This indicates no network request data is available for the active tab.
- Try loading a different page.
- Verify that the page you are viewing makes network connections.
- Disable conflicting extensions temporarily.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mismatch Between Badge and Domains in Popup">
- Permissions or browser limitations may affect synchronous data.
- Close and reopen the popup for a refresh.
- Clear browser cache and restart.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Additional Tips for Confidence

- Use the extension on pages with active content (e.g., video streaming, news, social sites) to see rich connection data.
- Revisit the badge and popup frequently as you switch tabs to confirm per-tab tracking.
- Understand that a lower badge count indicates fewer distinct third-party connections — a privacy plus.

## 8. What to Do Next

Once you confirm uBO Scope is working as intended:

- Proceed to explore the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../first-use-and-validation/troubleshooting) guide for advanced tips.
- Learn how to interpret and use the detailed popup insights in the [Understanding the Popup Panel](../../guides/getting-started/understanding-popup) documentation.
- Deepen your understanding of connection categorizations in the [Core Concepts](../../overview/architecture-concepts/core-concepts) page.
