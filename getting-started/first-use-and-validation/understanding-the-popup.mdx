# Understanding the Popup Interface

The uBO Scope popup interface is your gateway to real-time transparency about all remote server connections initiated by the active browser tab. This guided overview walks you through how connection data is visually categorized, how to interpret each status, and how to decode the badge count to gain meaningful privacy insights.

---

## 1. Overview of the Popup Interface

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup displays a summary of network connections detected from the currently active tab, categorized into three outcome groups:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Connections permitted by your content blockers or network settings.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were redirected or blocked stealthily—these may not visibly appear blocked but are effectively intercepted.
- **Blocked:** Connections that were explicitly blocked and prevented from succeeding.

### Popup Layout

The popup consists of these key sections:

- **Header:** Displays the domain(s) from which the tab is loading resources, including subdomain prefixes for clarity.
- **Summary:** Shows the total count of distinct connected domains, which matches the toolbar badge count.
- **Outcome Sections:** Three collapsible sections labeled "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked," containing lists of domain names and counts representing connection attempts.

Each domain entry shows the domain name alongside a small badge with the number of network requests associated with that domain.

## 2. Categorization of Connection Data

uBO Scope monitors all network requests through browser APIs and records the outcome per domain observed on a tab-by-tab basis. Understanding these categories is critical to accurately interpreting the data.

### Not Blocked (Allowed)
- Represents domains with successful network requests.
- These are third-party servers your browser successfully connected to.
- The count in the summary and badge reflects unique allowed domains.

### Stealth-Blocked
- Contains domains involved in redirects or subtle blocking techniques.
- These connections may have been redirected or prevented without explicit error messages, so they aren't "blocked" visibly but are intercepted.
- Often used by content blockers to avoid breaking webpage functionality or being detected.

### Blocked
- Lists domains where connections failed due to explicit blocking rules or errors.
- Includes failed network calls or those blocked by extension or DNS filtering.

## 3. Interpreting the Toolbar Badge Count

The badge number on the uBO Scope toolbar icon shows the count of **distinct third-party domains with allowed connections** for the active tab. It is a key privacy indicator:

- **Lower badge count:** Indicates fewer third-party domains were contacted, suggesting less exposure.
- **Higher badge count:** Indicates more third-party connections, increasing privacy risk.

<Tip>
Always correlate the badge count with the popup data to understand which domains are connected and why.

## 4. Step-by-Step: Using the Popup Interface

Follow these practical steps to explore your tab's connection data using the popup interface:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon while having the target tab active.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Header">
Note the domain displayed at the top. This identifies the main page domain and any subdomains.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Summary Section">
View the total number of connected domains. This number matches the toolbar badge and counts only domains for allowed connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Allowed Domains">
Expand the 'not blocked' section to see domains from which resources are successfully loaded.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Stealth-Blocked and Blocked Domains">
Open the 'stealth-blocked' and 'blocked' sections to identify domains where requests were redirected or blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Domain Counts">
Look at the badge next to each domain to see how many requests were recorded. Domains with higher counts may have more impact on privacy.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Use the Popup Regularly:** Frequent checks after loading new sites or refreshing pages will help you keep an accurate understanding of your connected domains.
- **Consider Stealth Blocking Carefully:** Domains showing in stealth-blocked might represent subtle privacy protections employed by content blockers.
- **Validate Against Known Content:** Some domains are commonly accessed (e.g., major CDNs) and not inherently privacy-risky.
- **Combine with Badge Count Interpretation:** The popup and badge together give the full picture—badge shows allowed domains count, popup shows detailed domain status.

<Note>
The popup updates asynchronously as network requests complete and are processed. If data seems missing immediately after page load, wait a moment and reopen the popup.
</Note>

## 6. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Popup Shows 'NO DATA'
- This indicates no network data is currently available for the active tab.
- Possible causes:
  - The tab is new and has not made any network requests yet.
  - The extension failed to capture data for this tab.

<Tip>Try refreshing the page or closing and reopening the popup.
If problem persists, verify the extension is enabled and has necessary permissions.</Tip>

### Missing or Inaccurate Badge Count
- Badge count may lag behind actual connection data due to delayed processing.
- Restarting the browser or disabling/re-enabling the extension can help.

### Domains without Counts
- Although uncommon, counts may sometimes appear missing due to rendering delays.
- Reload the popup or browser window to refresh the data.

## 7. Summary

The uBO Scope popup UI provides a clear, categorized view of all third-party remote server connections from the active tab. By understanding the meaning behind "allowed," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" domains, and by correlating this with the badge count shown on the browser toolbar, users gain actionable privacy insights into their browsing behavior. Regularly using the popup alongside the badge indicator empowers users, privacy advocates, and filter list maintainers to assess exposure and control.
