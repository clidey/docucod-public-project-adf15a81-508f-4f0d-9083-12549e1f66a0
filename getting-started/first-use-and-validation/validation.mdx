# Quick Validation Guide

Run through these straightforward steps to confirm that uBO Scope is effectively monitoring your browser's network requests. This guide helps you verify that the extension tracks connections correctly, irrespective of content blockers or DNS configurations in use. By performing these quick sanity checks, you'll understand what counts and indicators to expect on first use.

---

## 1. Verify Installation and Activation

Before validating connection data, ensure uBO Scope is installed and active in your browser:

1. Check the toolbar icon shows the uBO Scope logo.
2. The browser extension permissions (activeTab, webRequest, storage) must be granted.
3. Confirm the badge count is initially empty or zero before navigating.

<Check>
If the extension icon or badge does not appear, revisit the installation steps in the [Installing uBO Scope](https://docs.uBoScope.io/getting-started/installation-and-setup/installation) guide.
</Check>

---

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup UI

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup window displays network connection summaries for the current active tab.
3. If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or remains empty, refresh the active tab to trigger capture.

The popup categorizes domains into three outcomes:
- **Not blocked** (allowed connections)
- **Stealth-blocked** (requests intercepted silently)
- **Blocked** (requests prevented from completing)

---

## 3. Perform Basic Browsing to Generate Data

To test uBO Scope's monitoring, navigate to a familiar, content-rich website such as your preferred news site or a popular social media platform.

1. Load the website in the active tab.
2. Wait a few seconds for network requests to register.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to view the connections recorded.

You should see:
- A **badge count** on the toolbar reflecting the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- The popup UI listing domains categorized by their connection outcome.

---

## 4. Interpret the Toolbar Badge Count

The badge count represents the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser contacted in the current tab session. Lower counts generally indicate fewer third-party resources loaded.

<Tip>
Expect the badge to show zero or a small number if visiting minimal or privacy-focused pages. Higher counts indicate more third-party connections, typical of ad-heavy or media-rich sites.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Validate the Network Request Categories

Within the popup, ensure that the three categories reflect expected results:

- **Not blocked:** Legitimate third-party domains that your browser loaded resources from.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests uBO Scope recognizes as silently blocked by your content blocker or DNS.
- **Blocked:** Requests that were outright blocked with errors.

You should see at least some domains listed under "not blocked". If any content blocker is active, "stealth-blocked" and "blocked" sections will typically hold entries.

---

## 6. Confirm that Counts Change on Navigation

To verify session handling and dynamic updates:

1. Navigate to a different website in the same tab.
2. Observe that the badge count updates accordingly.
3. Open the popup again to see the new list of domains.
4. The extension resets previous data to only reflect the current page's connections.

<Warning>
If the badge count or popup data does not update after navigation, verify that your browser allows uBO Scope to access the active tab or that no conflicting extensions block its operation.
</Warning>

---

## 7. Basic Troubleshooting

If validation indicates issues, try these quick fixes:

- Reload the browser or restart the extension.
- Disable other extensions that might interfere with webRequest API access.
- Ensure your browser is updated to a version that supports the required permissions (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+).
- Confirm uBO Scope has the necessary permissions and has not been disabled or blocked.

For detailed troubleshooting, refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](https://docs.uBoScope.io/getting-started/first-use-and-validation/troubleshooting) page.

---

## 8. What to Expect on First Use

- The badge count will show a numeric value equal to the distinct third-party domains contacted by your browser on that tab.
- The popup UI sorts domains in their respective outcome categories with counts reflecting the number of requests per domain.
- Not all third-party connections are undesirable; many are for content delivery or legitimate services.

<Note>
uBO Scope reports connections regardless of which content blocker or DNS-based filtering you use. It relies on browser-reported network activity visible through the webRequest API.
</Note>

## 9. Next Steps

Once you've confirmed uBO Scope is accurately monitoring your network activity:

- Explore [Your First Session: Checking Connections](https://docs.uBoScope.io/getting-started/first-use-and-validation/first-use) for an in-depth walkthrough of using the extension's UI.
- Review the [Core Concepts & Terminology](https://docs.uBoScope.io/overview/architecture-core-concepts/core-concepts-terminology) to familiarize yourself with key terms and how to interpret data.
- Dive into the [Initial Configuration](https://docs.uBoScope.io/getting-started/installation-and-setup/first-configuration) guide to adjust settings if needed.
