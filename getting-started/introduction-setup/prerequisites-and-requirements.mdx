# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Before you install and use uBO Scope, this guide helps you confirm your environment meets all necessary requirements and explains the permissions the extension needs. Ensuring compliance with these prerequisites guarantees a smooth installation and reliable operation, letting you immediately benefit from the transparency that uBO Scope provides on remote network connections.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope supports the latest browser platforms with these minimum versions:

- **Google Chrome (Chromium-based browsers)**
  - Minimum Version: 122.0 or higher
  - Installation from Chrome Web Store
- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum Version: Firefox 128.0 or higher
  - Installation from Firefox Add-ons Store
- **Safari**
  - Minimum Version: Safari 18.5 or higher
  - Installation via Safari Extensions Gallery or App Store


> These version requirements ensure compatibility with Manifest V3 extensions and access to necessary browser APIs such as `webRequest`.


## 2. Platform-Specific Considerations

While uBO Scope is designed to work across multiple browsers, there are subtle platform specifics:

- **Chromium-based Browsers:** Uses a service worker background script
- **Firefox:** Uses a module-type background script and requires explicit host permissions
- **Safari:** Requires Safari 18.5+ due to Manifest V3 compliance


Make sure you have the recommended browser versions installed; older versions may lead to incomplete functionality or installation failure.

## 3. Permissions Required

uBO Scope requests the following permissions during installation. These are essential for its core operation:

- `activeTab` — To access and interact with the currently active browser tab
- `storage` — For saving session data and public suffix list caches locally
- `webRequest` — Critical to monitoring network requests and reporting connection outcomes
- Host permissions for URLs matching:
  - `http://*/*`
  - `https://*/*`
  - For Chromium and Firefox, also WebSocket protocols:
    - `ws://*/*`
    - `wss://*/*`


<Tip>
Permissions are limited strictly to what is necessary for uBO Scope to observe network traffic transparently and securely. No data is transmitted to external servers, ensuring privacy.
</Tip>

## 4. System Requirements

There are no specific hardware requirements beyond running one of the supported browsers at the specified versions. However, to ensure best performance:

- Your device should run a modern operating system compatible with your browser.
- Stable internet connectivity for installation and normal browsing.

## 5. Installation Prerequisites

Before installing uBO Scope:

1. Confirm that your browser meets or exceeds the stated minimum version.
2. Ensure you have access to the appropriate extension store depending on your browser.
3. Confirm that your browser’s security settings allow installation of extensions with required permissions.


## 6. Network Requirements

uBO Scope functions by listening to network events directly in your browser;

- **Firewall Considerations:** No special firewall rules need to be set, but ensure your browser can make HTTP/S and WebSocket connections normally for uBO Scope to monitor.
- **Offline Use:** uBO Scope’s installation and updates require internet connectivity; after installation, it operates locally without external network dependencies.


## 7. Common Pitfalls & Tips

- Installing on unsupported browser versions will fail or cause errors.
- Missing required permissions will limit uBO Scope’s ability to capture network information.
- Some WebSocket connections may be restricted or not visible depending on browser implementations.


<Warning>
If you experience installation failures, check that your browser version satisfies the minimum requirement and that extension permissions are granted fully.
</Warning>

## 8. Verification After Installation

Once uBO Scope is installed:

- Ensure the extension icon appears in your browser toolbar.
- Click the icon to open the uBO Scope popup and verify that it displays network connection data.
- Check that the badge count on the toolbar icon updates as you browse.


<Check>
If no data appears or badge counts do not update, review troubleshooting [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/first-steps-validation/troubleshooting).
</Check>
