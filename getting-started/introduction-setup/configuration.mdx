# Initial Configuration

Welcome to uBO Scope! This page guides you through what happens right after installation — explaining the zero-configuration experience, permissions you might encounter, and the key UI elements you’ll see immediately, including the badge count and toolbar icon.

## 1. Zero-Configuration Setup

uBO Scope is designed to work instantly once installed. There is no complex setup or manual configuration required to start getting valuable insights into your browser's network connections.

### What You Get Out of the Box

- Automatic monitoring of all network requests from your browser tabs
- Real-time badge count indicating the number of distinct connected domains per tab
- Categorization of connections into “Not Blocked,” “Stealth-Blocked,” and “Blocked” in the popup UI

### Key Details

- The extension runs silently in the background, tracking connection attempts without user intervention.
- You don’t need to provide any credentials or link accounts.
- You won’t see configuration screens initially unless permissions requests are triggered.

## 2. Permissions Prompts

Upon installation, your browser will prompt you to grant certain permissions necessary for uBO Scope to operate effectively:

| Permission     | Purpose                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active Tab** | Access details about the active tab to monitor network requests per tab context.
| **Storage**    | Save session data and settings locally in your browser.
| **WebRequest** | Listen to network requests and detect remote connections in real time.
| **Host Permissions** | Access to web requests made to any HTTP or HTTPS domain to observe connections globally across all tabs.

### Platform Differences

- On **Chrome** and **Firefox**, permissions appear as pop-ups during installation.
- On **Safari**, the extension requests similar permissions but may differ slightly due to Safari’s extension architecture.

<Warning>
If you reject any permission prompt, uBO Scope might not function correctly. It’s crucial to allow all requested permissions for full monitoring and accurate badge counts.
</Warning>

## 3. Initial User Interface Elements

Once installed and permissions are granted, the following UI elements appear in your browser:

### Toolbar Icon

- The uBO Scope icon appears in your browser’s toolbar.
- Clicking this icon opens the popup interface to view connection details.

### Badge Count

- The badge is a small number overlay on the toolbar icon.
- It reflects the count of distinct third-party domains connected from the active tab.
- The badge updates dynamically as you navigate pages or new connections occur.

#### Interpreting the Badge

- **Higher numbers mean more external connections were made by the active page.**
- This is a direct indicator of your privacy exposure to third-party servers.

### Popup Interface

- Accessible by clicking the toolbar icon.
- Displays three categorized sections:
  - **Not Blocked:** Connections that succeeded without interference.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections redirected or modified stealthily.
  - **Blocked:** Connections that failed due to blocking or errors.
- Each section shows connected domains and connection counts for easy analysis.

<Note>
The initial state of the popup may show “NO DATA” or question marks if no network activity has been recorded yet. Loading takes a moment after installation.
</Note>

## 4. What to Expect Immediately After Installation

Follow these simple steps to validate your setup and see uBO Scope in action:

<Steps>
<Step title="Visit a website">
Navigate to any website. uBO Scope will begin tracking all network connections made by that tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Look at the badge count">
Observe the number on the toolbar icon badge. This number represents distinct connected domains — indicating how many external servers the page communicates with.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the popup interface">
Click the toolbar icon to open the popup and explore connected domains categorized by their outcome (allowed, stealth, blocked).
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Best Practices

- Keep your browser and uBO Scope updated to ensure accurate network monitoring and badge reporting.
- Do not disable storage permissions, as configurations and session data rely on it.
- Remember that a zero-config experience means no manual user setup is required, but browsing different sites will show varying badge counts reflecting real network traffic.

## 6. Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Initial Configuration Pitfalls">
<Accordion title="No badge count appearing after installation">
Verify that permissions were correctly granted during installation. Without permissions, uBO Scope cannot monitor network activity. Reload the page to trigger monitoring.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup shows NO DATA or question marks">
It may take a few seconds after page load for uBO Scope to collect and display data. Reload the page and ensure network activity is present.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected permission requests after install">
These are standard and necessary for the extension's operation. Avoid denying permissions to maintain full functionality.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Troubleshooting Initial Configuration

If uBO Scope does not behave as expected:

- Check browser extension permissions in settings.
- Restart your browser after installation.
- Clear browser cache to avoid stale data interference.
- Ensure no conflicting extensions block uBO Scope's access.
