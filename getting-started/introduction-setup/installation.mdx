## 3. Alternative & Manual Installation Methods

If you prefer or require a manual installation, such as for development, testing, or if the store versions are not accessible, follow the corresponding method for your browser.

### Chrome / Chromium — Manual Load

1. Download the source code from the [uBO Scope GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
2. Extract the package to a convenient folder.
3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. Enable **Developer mode** in the upper right.
5. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extracted folder with the extension files.
6. Confirm that the extension appears in your extension list with no errors.

### Firefox — Manual Load

1. Clone or download the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
2. Extract the files.
3. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
4. Click **Load Temporary Add-on...**.
5. Select the `manifest.json` file inside the extension directory.
6. The extension will load temporarily until Firefox is restarted.

### Safari — Development Mode (Manual Packaging)

Due to Apple's restrictions, installing an extension manually involves packaging and signing through Xcode.

1. Download the source code.
2. Open the Safari Web Extensions project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the extension to install it locally.
4. For distribution, you must sign and package the extension per Apple's guidelines.

<Tip>
Manual installation methods are intended for advanced users or developers. For everyday use, always prefer installing from official extension stores to ensure security and automatic updates.

## 4. Verifying Your Installation

After installation, confirm uBO Scope is active and ready:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon (a magnifying glass over the uBO logo) adjacent to your browser’s address bar or toolbar.
2. Click the icon to open the popup and check for any displayed data — it may show "NO DATA" initially if no websites have been monitored yet.
3. Visit a website with known third-party content, then click the icon again to see live connection data and a badge count indicating distinct third-party domains connected.

If the extension icon is missing or inactive, revisit the installation steps or consult the troubleshooting guide.
