# What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a straightforward yet powerful browser extension designed to give you complete transparency about the connections your web pages attempt or successfully make to remote servers. Unlike typical content blockers that only show partial information or block counts, uBO Scope reveals every single network connection attempt regardless of your currently installed content blocker.

This clarity allows you to see the full picture of your network activity and understand the true level of exposure your browser has to third-party servers.

## Why uBO Scope Exists

The core purpose of uBO Scope is to expose all network connections initiated by the webpages you visit. This includes connections that were allowed, stealthily blocked, or fully blocked by content blockers or other means.

Most content blockers focus on blocking or reporting blocked connections without providing full transparency about all network requests. uBO Scope fills that gap by:

- Counting the distinct third-party domains contacted.
- Categorizing requests into “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked.”
- Operating independently of content blockers, reporting based on the browser’s network API.

By doing so, uBO Scope helps you gain real insight into your privacy exposure and how effective your blockers really are.

## What uBO Scope Measures

- **All attempted or successful network connections to remote servers** associated with a webpage.
- **Third-party remote servers** distinct count, shown as a badge on the extension icon.
- Breakdown of connection outcomes:
  - **Not Blocked:** Connections that proceeded without interference.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections silently prevented, often to avoid webpage breakage or detection.
  - **Blocked:** Connections actively blocked by filters or errors.

This approach ensures you see a realistic and comprehensive overview of your browsing exposure.

## Understanding the Badge Count

The badge number on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon reflects the count of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to during your current tab session. This number is your key privacy indicator:

- **Lower count means less exposure to potentially tracking or unwanted third parties.**
- **Higher count means more external connections were established or attempted.**

This count is **not** a block count but a measure of actual distinct connected domains, which makes it a reliable and straightforward privacy metric.

## Debunking Common Misconceptions

uBO Scope helps clarify several myths widespread in the ad-blocking and privacy communities:

### Myth 1: "A higher block count means better protection."

- This is false. A high block count could mean more blocking attempts, but it may also correlate with more allowed connections to distinct third parties. uBO Scope focuses on what connections actually occurred, which is a clearer measure of exposure.

### Myth 2: "Ad blocker test pages provide accurate block reports."

- Many ‘ad blocker test’ webpages use contrived network requests that don’t reflect real-world usage, or detect blockers by their patterns rather than real network outcomes.
- uBO Scope counts and categorizes actual network connections reported by the browser, giving you practical, real-world data.

## Who Needs uBO Scope?

- **Privacy-conscious users** wanting honest insights into the connections their browser makes.
- **Filter list maintainers** who need to verify that their blocking rules are effective in the wild.
- Anyone wanting to measure and compare the effectiveness of different content blockers or blocking strategies.

## How uBO Scope Works — At a Glance

- Monitors browser network requests via the `webRequest` API.
- Collects domain-level information independently from content blockers.
- Tracks and categorizes every outgoing request per browser tab.
- Updates the extension icon badge live with the number of distinct third-party connections.
- Provides a detailed popup UI listing all domains contacted, categorized by outcome.

## Real-World Benefits for Users

Using uBO Scope, you can:

- See exactly which external servers your current tab connects to, regardless of blocking rules.
- Assess your real privacy exposure without needing deep technical skills.
- Identify unexpected or redundant third-party connections.
- Validate claims made by other content blockers or privacy tools using concrete data.
