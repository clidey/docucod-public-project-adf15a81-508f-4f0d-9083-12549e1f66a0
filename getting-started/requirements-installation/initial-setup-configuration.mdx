# Initial Setup & Configuration

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through the essential initial steps to open the extension for the first time, verify that it’s configured correctly, and get ready to start monitoring your browser’s third-party network connections effectively.

## 1. Understanding the Role of Initial Setup

When you launch uBO Scope for the first time, it requires no complicated configuration. The extension is designed to work immediately upon installation, leveraging browser APIs to monitor network events transparently while respecting browser permissions. This page ensures you confirm the necessary permissions are granted, understand any setup prompts, and know the state of your monitoring.

## 2. Permissions & Browser Requirements

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to access network request data:

- **Active Tab**: To interact with the current webpage context.
- **Storage Access**: To save session data and public suffix lists.
- **webRequest API**: To listen to all network requests made by your browser.

### Supported Browsers

- Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome 122+)
- Mozilla Firefox 128+
- Safari 18.5+

These minimum versions are essential for uBO Scope to utilize the modern WebExtension APIs effectively.

<Tip>
If you experience any issues with data not appearing, please check that your browser version meets these requirements.
</Tip>

## 3. Opening uBO Scope for the First Time

Follow these steps to confirm everything is set up properly:

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Icon">
After installation, find the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It usually looks like a small badge displaying a number.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Icon to Open the Popup">
Clicking the icon opens the popup panel, which displays the summary and detailed status of third-party connections for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify the Display">
Initially, if no data is yet collected, the popup will display 'NO DATA'. This is normal immediately after installation or after a browser restart.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload the Active Tab">
Refresh the webpage in the active tab to start generating network connection information that uBO Scope can capture.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe Data Update">
After the reload, reopen the popup — it should now show:

- The domain of the current webpage.
- Counts of 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' third-party domains.
- A domain count badge on the toolbar icon.

</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. No Manual Configuration Required

uBO Scope automatically initializes by downloading and loading the public suffix list, which helps in accurately grouping domains. This process happens silently and only once per browsing session.

<Info>
No manual user action is required to fetch or update this list — it is managed internally for you.
</Info>

The extension also maintains session data locally to preserve monitoring state across tabs during your browsing session.

## 5. Best Practices to Ensure Accurate Monitoring

- Always keep your browser updated to the minimum required version or later.
- Refresh tabs to start a fresh monitoring session when necessary.
- Disable conflicting extensions that may interfere with webRequest listeners.

## 6. What to Expect After Setup

Once correctly set up, uBO Scope will:

- Show real-time counts of distinct third-party domains your browser connects to.
- Classify connections into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked, allowing you to assess your browsing privacy.
- Maintain persistent session data until the browser or extension is restarted.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Initial Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Initial Setup Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' After Reload">
- Make sure the tab you are monitoring is fully reloaded.
- Check that uBO Scope has the `webRequest` permission enabled in your browser’s extension settings.
- Confirm your browser version is supported.
- Restart your browser to refresh extension state.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Appear">
- Verify that badge display is enabled by your browser (some browsers allow hiding extension badges).
- Confirm network requests are not blocked by a firewall or restrictive network policy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extension Does Not Respond or Shows Errors">
- Disable and re-enable uBO Scope.
- Check your browser’s extension console for error messages.
- Reinstall the extension from the official store or GitHub release.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
