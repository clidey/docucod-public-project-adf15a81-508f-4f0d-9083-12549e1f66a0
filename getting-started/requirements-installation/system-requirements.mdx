# System Requirements for uBO Scope

Ensure that your browsing environment meets the minimum requirements outlined here to guarantee a smooth and effective experience with uBO Scope. This page covers supported browsers, their required minimum versions, platform compatibility, and any key dependencies before installing the extension.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a lightweight browser extension and supports the major browsers listed below. Each browser has a strict minimum version requirement due to reliance on modern browser APIs such as `webRequest` and Manifest V3 compatibility.

| Browser    | Minimum Supported Version | Notes                                 |
|------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Google Chrome or Chromium-based Browsers | 122.0                    | Required minimum Chrome version is 122.0 or newer. |
| Mozilla Firefox (Desktop)             | 128.0                    | Firefox version 128.0 or greater on desktop platforms. |
| Mozilla Firefox (Android)            | 128.0                    | Android version aligns with desktop Firefox 128.0 minimum. |
| Apple Safari                        | 18.5                     | Safari 18.5 or newer required due to extension API support. |


### Details
- **Chromium**: The extension requires Manifest V3 support and usage of a background service worker, which became broadly available in Chrome 122+. 
- **Firefox**: The extension requires the latest API features present starting Firefox 128, including Android variant parity.
- **Safari**: Requires Safari version 18.5+ to support the modern extension APIs as specified in `platform/safari/manifest.json`.

<Tip>
Using an unsupported browser version will prevent the extension from installing or functioning correctly. Always update your browser to the latest stable release before installing uBO Scope.
</Tip>

## 2. Platform Compatibility

uBO Scope is a browser extension and runs on any desktop or mobile platform supported by the compatible browsers with the required versions. 

- **Desktop Platforms**: Windows, macOS, and Linux through supported browsers.
- **Mobile Platforms**: Firefox for Android is supported; Chrome mobile versions supporting Manifest V3 may be able to run the extension but are not officially specified.

<Warning>
Due to browser API limitations, uBO Scope will not function in browsers or platforms that do not support Manifest V3 or the `webRequest` API, such as some legacy or niche browsers.
</Warning>

## 3. Dependencies and Permissions

Because uBO Scope is a browser extension, it relies on browser-provided APIs and permissions which must be granted upon installation:

- **Permissions Required:**
  - `activeTab` — To access the currently active tab's information.
  - `storage` — To save and retrieve session data.
  - `webRequest` — To monitor network requests for reporting.

- **Host Permissions:** The extension needs permission to access all URLs matching `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` for network request observation. Firefox and Chromium also require websocket permissions.

<Note>
These permissions are declared in each platform's manifest file (`manifest.json`). The permissions enable uBO Scope to detect and report on network connections made by webpages in real time.
</Note>

## 4. Network and Connectivity Considerations

- The extension observes network requests using browser APIs across HTTP(s) and WebSocket protocols.
- Network request monitoring depends entirely on the browser's `webRequest` API; requests outside the browser's scope will not be reported.

<Tip>
Make sure your browser is allowed to access the internet freely and is not restricted by firewall rules on the `webRequest` API.
</Tip>

## 5. Verifying Your Environment

Before attempting to install uBO Scope:

1. **Check Browser Version:**
   - Open your browser's ``About`` or ``Help > About`` menu to verify your current version.

2. **Verify Permissions:** 
   - Ensure your browser supports installing extensions with Manifest V3 and that the extension store is accessible.

3. **Confirm Connectivity:**
   - Verify that your internet connection is active.

If these conditions are met, then your system is ready to install and run uBO Scope smoothly.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope fails to install">
If installation is blocked or unavailable, confirm that your browser version matches the minimum requirements:
- Update your browser to the latest version
- Ensure installation from the official browser store
- Restart the browser and try again
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network requests are not being recorded">
uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API. If you see no activity:
- Confirm relevant permissions were granted during installation
- Ensure no other extensions block `webRequest` API usage
- Check for restrictive browser or OS network security settings
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extension icon badge not displaying counts">
Badge counts reflect distinct third-party domains connected per tab.
- Ensure you have opened a webpage after extension installation
- The badge updates asynchronously with a slight delay
- Close and reopen tabs to refresh data
</Accordion>

## Code Snippet: How Minimum Versions Are Defined in Manifests

Here is an example from the Chromium manifest specifying the minimum Chrome version:

```json
{
  "minimum_chrome_version": "122.0",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "uBlock Origin Scope",
  "version": "1.0.1"
}
```

For Firefox, the minimum version is set as:

```json
"browser_specific_settings": {
    "gecko": {
        "id": "uBO-Scope@raymondhill.net",
        "strict_min_version": "128.0"
    },
    "gecko_android": {
        "strict_min_version": "128.0"
    }
}
```

And for Safari:

```json
"browser_specific_settings": {
    "safari": {
        "strict_min_version": "18.5"
    }
}
```

These manifest settings enforce the installation requirements at the browser level.

## Summary

Meeting these system requirements ensures the extension installs without error and runs as intended, giving you accurate real-time insight into network connections established by your browser tabs. Keep your environment updated and compatible for the best experience with uBO Scope.
