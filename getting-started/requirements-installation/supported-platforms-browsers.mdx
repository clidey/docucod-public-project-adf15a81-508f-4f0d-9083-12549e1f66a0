# Supported Browsers & System Requirements

Ensure your environment is compatible with uBO Scope for a smooth installation experience and reliable operation. This guide details the supported browsers, platform-specific requirements, and necessary permissions, helping you verify compatibility before installing.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with major browsers using the WebExtensions API. The following browsers and minimum versions are supported:

| Browser   | Minimum Version | Notes                              |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Chrome    | 122+            | Minimum Chrome version 122 needed |
| Firefox   | 128+            | Firefox 128 and above             |
| Safari    | 18.5+           | Safari 18.5 or later              |


<Info>
These versions ensure compatibility with Manifest V3 extensions and dependable access to `webRequest` APIs required by uBO Scope.

## 2. Platform Compatibility

uBO Scope supports desktop environments where the aforementioned browsers run. It operates fully on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

For mobile browsers like Firefox for Android, the extension may work depending on the WebExtensions support, but official support status varies and should be checked per browser.

## 3. Installation Prerequisites

Before installing uBO Scope, verify the following requirements:

### 3.1 Browser Permissions

uBO Scope requires these permissions to function correctly:

- **activeTab:** To access data on the currently active browser tab.
- **storage:** For saving session and configuration data.
- **webRequest:** Crucial to monitor all network requests.
- **host permissions:** Access to URLs with schemes `http`, `https`, `ws`, and `wss` across all domains (*).

These permissions enable uBO Scope to accurately report connection outcomes without interference.

### 3.2 WebRequest API Access

To reliably track network requests, your browser must allow extensions to use the `webRequest` API, specifically for request and response events. Not all browsers or versions expose these APIs fully, which may limit uBO Scope's functionality.

### 3.3 Storage Capabilities

Persistent and session storage in the browser must be accessible and enabled, allowing uBO Scope to save its session data and the public suffix list it uses to determine domain relationships.

### 3.4 Network Connectivity

While uBO Scope itself does not require inbound connections, it fetches resources such as the public suffix list upon initial runs. Ensure the browser environment allows outbound HTTP(s) requests to fetch these assets.

## 4. Understanding Manifest Differences between Browsers

uBO Scope uses distinct manifest configurations tailored to target browsers, while maintaining feature parity.

| Feature                | Chrome (Chromium)        | Firefox                   | Safari                   |
|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Manifest Version       | 3                       | 3                         | 3                        |
| Background Script      | `service_worker` module  | `scripts` with module type| `scripts` with module type|
| Minimum Browser Version| 122+                    | 128+                      | 18.5+                    |
| Host Permissions       | Broad: http, https, ws  | Same                      | Limited to http, https   |
| Permissions            | activeTab, storage, webRequest | Same                  | Same                     |

<Note>
Safari currently limits host permissions to HTTP and HTTPS schemes only, excluding WebSocket URLs. This might affect the visibility of certain WebSocket connections in that browser.
</Note>

## 5. System Requirements

### 5.1 Hardware and OS

uBO Scope relies primarily on browser compatibility; there are no specialized hardware demands outside what is required by your browser.

- Modern desktop or laptop computer supporting Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, or popular Linux distributions.
- At least 2GB of system RAM recommended for smooth browser operation.

### 5.2 Software

- Supported browsers as listed in Section 1, installed and updated to respective minimum versions.
- Network connectivity to allow extension asset fetching.

## 6. Verification Steps Before Installing

Follow these steps to ensure your environment is ready:

1. **Check your browser version:** Open your browser's About or Settings page and confirm the version meets or exceeds the minimum required.
2. **Verify extension permissions:** Prepare to grant or allow the necessary extension permissions during installation.
3. **Confirm storage availability:** Make sure your browser's extension settings or policies don't restrict storage access.
4. **Check network access:** Confirm there is no firewall or proxy blocking your browser's outgoing HTTPS requests.

## 7. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Compatibility Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Extension Fails to Install or Activate">
- Verify your browser version meets the minimum requirement.
- Ensure that your browser is updated and supports Manifest V3 extensions.
- Check if any enterprise or security policies block installation of extensions using `webRequest` permission.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Not Fully Granted">
- On installation or first use, grant requested permissions explicitly.
- If permission dialogs don't appear, check browser extension settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Data Shown in Popup Panel">
- Confirm `webRequest` API availability.
- Check firewall or privacy settings interfering with browser extension network monitoring.
- Reload the extension or browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Limited WebSocket Visibility on Safari">
- Safari currently restricts host permissions to traditional HTTP(S) schemes.
- Expect some WebSocket connections to not be reported.
- Consider testing on Firefox or Chrome for full visibility.
