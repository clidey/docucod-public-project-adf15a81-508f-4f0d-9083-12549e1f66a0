## 4. Advanced: Manual Installation from Source (Linux Environment)

For developers or advanced users who wish to build and package the extension locally, here are summarized steps:

### Build the extension package

Run the provided shell script matching your target platform from the project’s tools directory:

- For Chromium-based browsers:

```bash
./tools/make-chromium.sh <version_optional>
```

- For Firefox:

```bash
./tools/make-firefox.sh <version_optional>
```

Replace `<version_optional>` with a version string if you want to override the manifest version.

This process:

- Copies all necessary assets, source files, and manifest for the platform
- Packs them into a ZIP (Chromium) or XPI (Firefox) file inside the `build/` directory

### Load unpacked extension (for Chromium and Firefox)

1. Open the browser’s extensions page:
   - Chrome: `chrome://extensions`
   - Firefox: `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (Chrome) or click **Load Temporary Add-on** (Firefox).
3. Select the unpacked directory created inside `build/uBO-Scope.<platform>`.
4. The extension will load temporarily until you restart your browser.

<Warning>
Temporary loading is for development or testing only; users should install from official stores for stability and automatic updates.
</Warning>

## 5. Verifying Your Installation

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- The icon should show a badge count after you start browsing sites — this number indicates distinct third-party server connections.
- Click the icon to open the popup panel showing details about connected domains.

If the icon or badge does not appear, refer to the Troubleshooting section in the documentation.
