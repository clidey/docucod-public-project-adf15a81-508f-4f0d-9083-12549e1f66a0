# What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to **reveal every remote server connection a webpage attempts or successfully makes**, independent of the content blockers you may be using. It provides a clear and real-time view of all network connections in an easy-to-understand format, empowering you to monitor your browser's network activity with transparency and precision.

---

## Why Use uBO Scope?

Imagine visiting a website and wondering exactly which third-party servers your browser communicates with behind the scenes. Content blockers sometimes obscure this, or you might doubt their effectiveness. uBO Scope shines a light on the actual network connections by intercepting and reporting requests made by webpages, whether they're allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked (e.g., silently redirected or concealed).

This insight helps you:

- Understand the **true extent of third-party connections** on the websites you visit.
- **Validate the effectiveness of your content blockers** by seeing what they allow or block.
- **Debunk common myths** around ad blocker reliability and test pages.
- Support **filter list maintainers** by providing accurate, real-world connection data.

---

## Key Value Proposition

uBO Scope breaks through the complexity and opacity of network requests to show you:

- The **number of distinct third-party remote servers** your browser interacts with per open tab.
- Real-time categorization of these connections into three outcome types:
  - **Allowed:** Connections that went through successfully.
  - **Blocked:** Connections actively prevented from completing.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Connections that were redirected or hidden from the webpage.

By focusing on distinct remote servers rather than individual requests,
uBO Scope offers a high-level view that matters most for privacy and security awareness.

## How uBO Scope Works (At a Glance)

Without getting into implementation details, here's what uBO Scope does:

- It uses the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network activity related to webpages.
- Each network request is observed and categorized by its outcome.
- Data is collected **per browser tab**, allowing you to see connection details specific to the current page.
- A **toolbar badge** displays the count of distinct allowed third-party domains.
- A **popup interface** provides detailed domain listings, showing which connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

This is all done **without interfering with your existing content blockers**; uBO Scope acts as a silent observer.

---

## Understanding the Badge and Popup

- **Toolbar Badge:** Shows the number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections on the active tab. A lower count indicates fewer third-party connections, often desirable for privacy.

- **Popup Window:** Upon clicking the toolbar icon, the popup reveals three categorized lists of domains:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains to which connections were allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with connections silently redirected or blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were actively prevented.

<u>Example:</u> When browsing a site, if you see ‘10’ on the badge, and the popup lists these 10 allowed domains, you know exactly where your browser connected successfully.

---

## Practical Benefits

- See **real-time network connection results** on any webpage.
- Gain **confidence** about your content blocking setup through transparent reporting.
- **Avoid misleading tests:** uBO Scope highlights that 'ad blocker test' webpages do not reliably measure blocking effectiveness.
- Help **filter list maintainers** by understanding actual network behaviors.

---

## Important Notes

- The badge count reflects **unique third-party domains with allowed connections**. It's not a block count.
- The extension tracks only requests reported via the browser's `webRequest` API; it cannot observe external or out-of-band network activity.
- Stealth blocking may sometimes appear when connections are redirected or blocked quietly by other mechanisms.

## More About uBO Scope

The extension is authored by Raymond Hill—the creator of uBlock Origin—and is built to offer an honest, unobtrusive way to audit your browser's network activity immediately. It is designed to be simple, reliable, and low-overhead, with focus on actionable data rather than overwhelming technical details.

Visit [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) for the latest release, source code, and additional resources.

## Example Scenario

### You visit example.com and want to see all third-party domains connecting behind the scenes:

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
2. The popup shows “domains connected: 5”.
3. Under 'Not Blocked', you see the list of allowed domains like cdn.example.net and analytics.partner.com.
4. 'Blocked' might list domains you have filtered out; 'Stealth-Blocked' lists any silently redirecting domains.
5. Use this insight to decide if your privacy settings need adjustment or to understand how partially blocking content might still allow connections.

---

## Troubleshooting

If you see no data:

- Ensure you have uBO Scope installed and enabled for your current browser.
- Check that your browser supports the `webRequest` API and that permissions are granted.
- Verify you visit sites with active network requests.
- Review [Troubleshooting Installation and Startup](../../getting-started/troubleshooting-support/common-issues) if issues persist.
