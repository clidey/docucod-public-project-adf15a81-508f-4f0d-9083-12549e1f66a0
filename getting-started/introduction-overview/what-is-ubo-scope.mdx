# What is uBO Scope?

## Introduction

uBO Scope is a specialized browser extension designed to reveal **all attempted and successful remote server connections** initiated from your browser on any webpage you visit. It provides a transparent, accurate view of third-party requests, independent of any content blockers you may be running.

Unlike conventional content blockers that focus only on blocking unwanted requests, uBO Scope’s mission is to **expose every remote connection** your browser tries to make — whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked — delivering unparalleled network visibility essential for privacy-conscious users, developers, and filter list maintainers.

## Why Use uBO Scope?

- **Full Network Transparency:** See every remote server your browser connects to, beyond what content blockers show.
- **Privacy Insight:** Understand how many third-party servers are contacted by visited pages.
- **Content Blocker Complement:** Works alongside tools like uBlock Origin or AdGuard without interference.
- **Accurate Reporting:** Counts distinct third-party domains based on reliable browser network APIs.

## How uBO Scope Works

At its core, uBO Scope listens to your browser’s `webRequest` API. This API provides details about network requests made while loading webpages.

- The extension captures all network requests initiated by web pages.
- It tracks the outcome of each request as either **allowed**, **stealth-blocked** (redirected but not truly allowed), or **blocked**.
- It aggregates these results to present the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted.
- The toolbar badge displays the count of unique third-party domains your browser actually connected to, reflecting real network activity.

This functionality is unaffected by any content blocker or DNS filtering operating independently. uBO Scope relies solely on the browser’s own network event reporting.

## Differentiators: What Sets uBO Scope Apart

### 1. Independent of Content Blockers

uBO Scope records network events as reported by your browser, making it impervious to falsified block counts or filtered statistics presented by content blockers.

### 2. Full Transparency of Third-party Connections

Most content blockers only show what is blocked but don’t give a clear picture of *all* remote connections. uBO Scope reveals everything, helping you identify unexpected third-party servers.

### 3. Reliable Badge and Popup Reporting

The small number shown on the toolbar badge accurately counts unique third-party remote servers for that active tab. The popup panel details connections divided into:

- **Not blocked**: Connections allowed by the browser
- **Stealth-blocked**: Redirected or intercepted requests
- **Blocked**: Requests prevented from completing

### 4. Myth Busting Content Blocker Metrics

uBO Scope helps debunk common myths, such as:

- Higher block counts do not necessarily mean better blocking.
- Popular “ad blocker test” web pages often provide misleading results.

By providing raw connection data, uBO Scope allows informed privacy decisions.

## Real-World Use Case

Imagine visiting a news website with many embedded ads and trackers. Your content blocker may block some ads, but uBO Scope shows the exact count and identity of every third-party server your browser attempted to connect to—helping you gauge the true exposure.

## Key Concepts

- **Third-party remote server:** Any domain contacted by a webpage that is different from the main site you are visiting.
- **Allowed connections:** Requests that completed successfully.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that were redirected or intercepted stealthily.
- **Blocked:** Requests prevented by content blockers or network errors.

## Badge and Popup Panel Summary

- The **toolbar badge** shows the distinct count of third-party domains.
- Clicking the badge opens the **popup panel** with detailed domain counts categorized by connection outcome.

This immediate feedback helps users quickly understand the network footprint of their browsing.

## Limitations

- uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API. Network activity not reported by this API, such as in some sandboxed or native apps, will not be visible.
- It shows connection attempts during the lifespan of a tab; closing tabs clears session data.

## Installation & Next Steps

To start using uBO Scope:

1. Install uBO Scope from your browser's official extension/add-on store (available for Chromium, Firefox, and Safari).
2. Explore the toolbar badge to see real-time counts of third-party connections.
3. Click the badge to open the popup panel for detailed domain information.

## Summary

uBO Scope delivers a **transparent, comprehensive view** into your browser’s remote network connections across all visited websites. It empowers users to see beyond component metrics, revealing the true landscape of third-party activity and aiding in privacy and filter list decisions.
