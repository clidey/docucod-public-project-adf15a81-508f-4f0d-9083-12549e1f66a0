# Who Should Use This Extension?

uBO Scope is tailored to provide transparent visibility into your browser’s network connections. This page helps you understand if uBO Scope fits your needs, whether you are a privacy-conscious individual, a maintainer of filter lists, or a user curious about how websites interact with remote servers.

---

## Primary User Profiles

### 1. Privacy-Conscious Individuals

If your goal is to understand and control who your browser connects to on the web, uBO Scope is invaluable. It reveals every attempted and successful connection to third-party remote servers independent of any content blocker you use. This transparency allows you to:

- Identify unexpected or undesired third-party connections.
- Assess the effectiveness of your content blockers by viewing what actually reaches your browser.
- Gain insights into resource loading to better control your browsing experience.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers and Content Blocker Developers

Maintaining reliable and accurate filter lists requires deep visibility into web traffic and blocking behavior. uBO Scope:

- Provides raw data on network requests as reported by your browser.
- Helps verify whether your filters block intended third-party domains or if stealth blocking is in effect.
- Supports discovery of new third-party domains to add to filtering rules.
- Assists in validating the real-world impact of filter changes across browsers and platforms.

### 3. Curious Users and Web Transparency Advocates

Whether you want to learn about web tracking, content delivery, or website infrastructure, this extension offers:

- A clear view of domains your browser contacts when loading a webpage.
- Differentiation between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.
- A tool to debunk myths around 'block counts' and unreliable ad blocker tests.

## How uBO Scope Helps Debunk Common Myths

uBO Scope is designed to shine light on misconceptions in the content blocking landscape:

- **Myth: Higher block count means better blocking.**

  uBO Scope shows that a higher block count can mean more allowed connections across many domains, possibly indicating weaker overall blocking.

- **Myth: Ad blocker test sites provide reliable block results.**

  Many such sites use fabricated network requests and cannot detect stealth blocking, making the test results unreliable.

By presenting actual network connection data, uBO Scope empowers users and maintainers to make informed assessments.

---

## Typical Use Scenarios

- **Scenario: You suspect your current content blocker is letting too many third parties through.**

  Install uBO Scope and watch the badge count and popup panel as you browse to see the true number and status of third-party connections.

- **Scenario: You maintain filter lists and want to validate the impact of recent updates.**

  Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to verify actual requests and adjust filter rules accordingly.

- **Scenario: You want an unbiased, independent network view that is not affected by content blockers or DNS blocking.**

  uBO Scope reports all browser-reported requests, regardless of content blocker stealth tactics or DNS-level blocks.

## Getting Started Quickly

To experience the value of uBO Scope, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install uBO Scope** from your browser’s official extension store for Chromium, Firefox, or Safari.
2. **Browse as usual.** Notice the badge count indicating distinct third-party servers contacted.
3. **Click the uBO Scope icon** to open the popup panel that breaks down connections into 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'.
4. Use this information to better understand your browsing privacy and refine content blocking setups.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope as a complement, not a replacement, to content blockers.
- Remember the badge count represents unique third-party servers, not total blocked requests.
- Regularly check popups for stealth-blocked connections that might bypass your blocker invisibly.
- Trusted CDNs will usually appear under 'not blocked' — a normal and expected outcome.

## Common Pitfalls

- Expect some third parties due to CDN usage and legitimate resources.
- Do not rely on ad blocker test pages to evaluate your overall network exposure.
- Ensure your browser supports the `webRequest` API fully for complete data collection.
