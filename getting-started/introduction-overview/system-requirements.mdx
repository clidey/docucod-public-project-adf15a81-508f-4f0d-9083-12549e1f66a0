# Supported Browsers & System Requirements

Understanding which browsers and platforms support uBO Scope is essential before installation to ensure smooth setup and operation. This guide details compatibility, minimum requirements, and notable limitations so you can prepare your environment accordingly.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to work as a lightweight, companion extension for major modern browsers, focusing on reliable network request monitoring. Supported browsers include:

- **Chromium-based Browsers** (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, etc.)
- **Mozilla Firefox** (including Firefox for Android)
- **Apple Safari** (modern versions with WebExtensions API support)


## 2. Version & Platform Requirements

Each browser platform may have specific minimum version levels or feature requirements for uBO Scope to function properly.

<AccordionGroup title="Minimum Version Requirements by Browser">
<Accordion title="Chromium-based Browsers">
- Minimum Chrome version: **122.0** (or equivalent Chromium version).

  This is required because the extension uses Manifest V3 features and updated WebRequest API capabilities.

  <Tip>
  If you are using an older Chromium-based browser, uBO Scope will not run correctly. Please update to the latest stable version.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mozilla Firefox">
- Minimum Firefox version: **128.0** (also applies to Firefox for Android).

  uBO Scope depends on Manifest V3 support and certain WebRequest API behavior introduced in recent Firefox versions.

  <Warning>
  Firefox versions earlier than 128 will not support the extension and may cause errors or failure to load.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Apple Safari">
- Minimum Safari version: **18.5** or later.

  Safari’s support for WebExtensions and requisite APIs is relatively new and more limited, so the extension requires the latest stable Safari release.

  <Info>
  Safari support also requires macOS or iOS versions that include Safari 18.5 or above.
  </Info>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 3. System Requirements

While uBO Scope is a lightweight extension, the following system conditions must be met:

- **Operating System**
  - Windows, macOS, Linux for desktop browsers
  - Android for Firefox Android browser
  - iOS/macOS for Safari
- **Memory & Disk**
  - No explicit extensions memory or disk needs beyond typical modern browser usage.
- **Network Connectivity**
  - Requires internet access to load remote suffix lists and potentially fetch extension updates.

## 4. Permissions & Browser Settings

uBO Scope requires explicit permissions to function:

- **Permissions Requested:**
  - `activeTab`: To monitor the active tab network requests.
  - `storage`: For saving session data related to network requests.
  - `webRequest`: To intercept and analyze all network requests launched by webpages.
- **Host Permissions:**
  - Access to network requests across HTTP and HTTPS schemes (and WebSocket protocols in Firefox and Chromium).

<Note>
Ensure your browser instance allows these permissions and doesn't restrict extensions from accessing network data. Some corporate or restricted browsers might block these.
</Note>

## 5. Limitations and Considerations

- **API Coverage:**
  - The extension relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API. If network requests occur outside this API's scope (e.g., certain DNS-level blocking or other native filtering methods), those requests won’t be visible.

- **Platform Differences:**
  - Firefox and Chromium support `wss://` and `ws://` URLs for WebSocket monitoring; Safari currently supports limited URL schemes, so visibility may vary.

- **Manifest V3:**
  - uBO Scope uses Manifest V3 features, so it is incompatible with browsers lacking full MV3 support.

## 6. How This Fits In Your Setup

Before installing, verify your browser version and platform compliance with the above requirements. This ensures:

- Accurate capture of remote connection attempts
- Proper badge updates with connection counts
- Full functionality of popup and reporting UI

If your platform or browser version is below the required thresholds, update the browser or consider an alternative supported platform.

## 7. Quick Compatibility Checklist

## 8. Where to Get the Extension

Based on your browser, install from the official stores to ensure compatibility and secure delivery:

- **Chromium-based Browsers**: [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- **Firefox**: [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- **Safari**: Installation via Safari Extensions Gallery or manual sideload (refer to Safari installation guide)


## 9. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Compatibility Issues">
<Accordion title="Extension Fails to Install or Load">
- Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements.
- Update your browser to the most recent stable release.
- Disable conflicting extension managers or security software that block extensions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Behavior or No Badge Count Updates">
- Ensure `webRequest` permission is granted.
- Verify the browser allows extensions to access web request APIs (some privacy modes restrict it).
- Confirm browser does not impose network restrictions (corporate VPN, firewall).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Safari Specific Limitations">
- Safari’s manifest and API support is more limited. Check Safari version.
- Review Safari extension installation steps to avoid silent failures.
