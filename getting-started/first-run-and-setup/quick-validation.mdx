# Validating Successful Setup

Ensuring that uBO Scope is working correctly right after installation is crucial to gain confidence in your browsing privacy insights. This guide provides clear, actionable steps to quickly validate your setup by checking visual indicators and confirming accurate domain activity reporting.

---

## 1. Verify Badge Counter Updates in the Browser Toolbar

The uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar displays a badge indicating the number of distinct remote third-party domains currently connected by the active webpage.

### Steps:
1. Open any active tab with a loaded webpage (e.g., https://example.com).
2. Look at the toolbar icon for uBO Scope.
3. Observe the badge number — it should show a positive integer representing third-party domains or be empty if none are detected.

### What to Expect:
- The badge updates dynamically as network requests happen.
- A **lower badge count** is typically better, reflecting fewer external connections.
- If the badge remains empty or does not change, this may indicate the extension is not active or not properly monitoring network requests.

<Tip>
If you don't see the badge or the icon itself, ensure the extension is enabled and visible in your browser's toolbar. Refer to the 'Activating and Locating the Extension' guide for instructions.
</Tip>

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup to Review Real-Time Domain Activity

Clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon opens the popup interface that summarizes domain connection activity for the current tab.

### Steps:
1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
2. Inspect the popup layout:
   - The header shows information about the current page’s hostname and its main domain.
   - The **domains connected** summary displays the total count of distinct domains detected.
   - Three outcome sections list domains by their classification:
     - **Not blocked:** domains for which connections were successful.
     - **Stealth-blocked:** domains whose requests were redirected or silently blocked.
     - **Blocked:** domains for which requests were blocked with errors.
3. Verify that data populates dynamically and that domains and counts appear in these sections.

### What to Expect:
- A populated popup displaying a current real-time snapshot of network connections.
- Domains listed with counts indicating how many times a domain was contacted.
- The number in the "domains connected" summary matches the count on the badge.

<Note>
The popup uses Unicode domain names and normalizes Punycode as appropriate for easier reading.

## 3. Confirm Network Connections Are Being Reported

If you are on a webpage with typical network activity (ads, trackers, CDNs, or analytics), some third-party domains should appear in the popup and update as the page loads or while interacting with it.

### Steps:
1. Open a webpage known to load external resources (e.g., news sites or popular portals).
2. Watch the popup while browsing or refreshing:
   - New domains should appear in the allowed, stealth, or blocked sections.
   - Counts should increment reflecting repeated requests.
3. The badge should also update correspondingly.

### What to Expect:
- Dynamic updating of domain lists corresponding to the page's background network activity.
- Distinct domain counts that make sense given the third-party resources the page commonly loads.

<Tip>
If your page has minimal or no external resources, try testing on a more complex website to see meaningful data.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues">
<Accordion title="No Badge or Popup Data Appears">
- Confirm the extension is enabled in your browser's extension settings.
- Ensure uBO Scope has the required permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).
- Reload the webpage or restart the browser to reset the extension state.
- Verify you installed uBO Scope from the official store or verified source.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update Correctly">
- Some websites may not generate external connections immediately; try interacting with the page or refreshing.
- Clear browser cache and reload the page.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions that may interfere with network monitoring.
- Refer to the Troubleshooting Setup Issues documentation for deeper analysis.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Sections">
- Ensure you have an active tab selected with a valid webpage loaded.
- If popup remains empty, try reopening the popup or refreshing the tab.
- Validate network activity by visiting websites that make known third-party requests.
- See the First Use: Viewing Domain Activity guide for usage tips.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Next Steps After Successful Validation

Once you see the badge update and the popup display domains with counts, your uBO Scope setup is confirmed working.

- Start exploring how allowed, stealth, and blocked domains differ per site.
- Use the detailed guides to learn how to interpret badge counts and popup indicators for privacy insights.
- For any issues, consult Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues or contact support.
