# Activating and Locating the Extension

This guide helps you find and activate the **uBO-Scope** browser extension icon after installation, ensuring it is enabled and ready to use. By following these steps, you’ll confirm that the extension is installed correctly and prominently accessible in your browser interface.

---

## 1. Find the uBO-Scope Icon in Your Browser Toolbar

After you have installed uBO-Scope, you should see its icon in your browser’s toolbar or extensions area. The icon serves as the primary interface to view domain activity summaries.

- The icon uses the distinctive uBO-Scope logo, appearing in four supported sizes depending on your browser and screen resolution: 16×16, 32×32, 64×64, and 128×128 pixels.
- Hovering over the icon will display the tooltip ‘uBO Scope’, confirming you have the right extension.

### Locating the Icon by Browser:

- **Chrome (Chromium-based browsers):**
  - Look in the upper-right corner of the browser window, near the address bar.
  - If the icon is hidden, click the puzzle piece icon to open the extensions menu, then pin uBO-Scope to the toolbar for quick access.

- **Firefox:**
  - The icon should appear to the right of the address bar.
  - If not visible, open the hamburger menu (three horizontal lines), select ‘More Tools’ > ‘Customize Toolbar’, then drag the uBO-Scope icon to the toolbar.

- **Safari:**
  - The icon is located on the right side of the Safari toolbar.
  - If missing, go to ‘Safari’ > ‘Settings’ (or ‘Preferences’) > ‘Extensions’ tab and make sure uBO-Scope is enabled.

<Check>
Make sure your browser meets the minimum supported version requirements listed in the [System Requirements](../install-and-requirements/system-requirements) to ensure the extension functions properly.
</Check>

## 2. Activate the Extension if Required

Some browsers disable extensions by default after installation or on browser restart. Follow these steps to activate uBO-Scope:

### Step-by-Step Activation:

1. Open your browser’s extension management page:
   - **Chrome:** `chrome://extensions/`
   - **Firefox:** `about:addons`
   - **Safari:** `Safari` > `Settings` > `Extensions`

2. Locate **uBO Scope** in the list.
3. Toggle the switch to the **On** position if it is off.
4. For Safari, ensure you select the checkbox for uBO Scope to activate it.

<Tip>
If prompted, allow any requested permissions such as access to active tabs, storage, and webRequest to enable full functionality.
</Tip>

## 3. Confirm the Extension is Enabled and Working

Once activated, confirm that uBO-Scope is enabled and ready:

- The icon should be visible in the toolbar; this confirms the extension is loaded.
- Visit any website and click the uBO-Scope icon to open its popup panel.
- You should see the popup interface displaying domain connection activity — including the counts grouped by “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked.”

If the popup loads without error and shows domain data, the extension is functioning correctly.

<Note>
The extension relies on underlying browser APIs, including `webRequest`, to report network connection outcomes on webpages you visit. Ensure your browser version supports these APIs (see [System Requirements](../install-and-requirements/system-requirements)).
</Note>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Icon Visibility and Activation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Extension Activation and Icon Visibility">
<Accordion title="Icon Not Visible After Installation">

- Some browsers group extensions behind an ‘Extensions’ icon — look inside and pin uBO-Scope to your toolbar.
- Restart your browser to solidify the installation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unable to Activate Extension or Extension is Disabled">
- Ensure your browser version meets minimum requirements (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Disable other conflicting extensions temporarily to test if something blocks uBO-Scope activation.
- For Safari, confirm you granted full extension permissions in System Preferences > Security & Privacy, if prompted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Interface Fails to Load or Shows 'NO DATA'">
- Make sure you’re visiting a webpage with active network requests.
- Refresh the page after installing the extension.
- Verify that you have granted the extension permission to access active tabs.
- Try reloading or reinstalling the extension.

## About the uBO-Scope Icon and Popup

The extension's icon acts as your primary interface trigger. Clicking it opens the popup (from `popup.html`) which provides:

- A hostname summary of the current active tab.
- Counts and lists of domains categorized as:
  - **Not blocked:** Allowed connections seen.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Redirected or stealthily blocked connections.
  - **Blocked:** Connections that were blocked.

This popup is dynamically updated as you browse, reflecting network activity transparently.

<Tip>
If you want to keep uBO-Scope handy, remember to pin the icon in browsers like Chrome to avoid hiding it behind menus.
</Tip>

## Security and Privacy Considerations

uBO-Scope requests permissions such as `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` because it needs to monitor and analyze web requests effectively. This data stays local to your browser and is not transmitted to any external servers.

Always download uBO-Scope from official browser extension stores or from the official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) to avoid tampered versions.

<Check>
Review permissions carefully when installing and activating the extension to ensure you agree with the access granted.
