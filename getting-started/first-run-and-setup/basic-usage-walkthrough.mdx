# First Use: Viewing Domain Activity

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with uBO Scope. This guide walks you through opening the extension's popup, understanding the badge counter on the toolbar icon, and interpreting domain connection data related to the website you are currently browsing. By following these steps, you will get immediate, actionable insight into the network connections your browser is making — a crucial step towards mastering your online privacy.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Icon

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It uses the uBO logo and can appear in different sizes depending on your browser (Chromium, Firefox, or Safari).
- If you do not see it, ensure the extension is installed and enabled (see the Installation and Activation guides).

### Step 2: Click the Icon to Open the Popup

- Clicking the icon reveals a popup interface summarizing connection data related to your current active tab.

<Tip>
Opening the popup refreshes the information for the active tab, ensuring you see the latest network request data.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Badge Counter

The badge counter is the small number displayed on or near the extension icon in your toolbar.

- **What it represents:**
  - The number shows the count of distinct third-party domains your current tab has connected to -- specifically, domains from which network requests succeeded.
  - Fewer domains generally indicate better privacy as fewer third-party connections are established.

- **When it updates:**
  - The badge count updates dynamically during navigation as your browser fetches resources.
  - If the count is empty (no number), it means no third-party domains have been allowed.

<Note>
The badge counter counts only allowed domains, not blocked or stealth-blocked ones. This helps focus your attention on actual connections made.
</Note>

## 3. Interpreting Domain Connection Data in the Popup

The popup divides domain connection information into three distinct sections for your convenience:

### Section Overview

| Section           | Meaning                                   | What You See                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**   | Domains where network requests succeeded  | List of domains and request counts |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains where requests were stealthily blocked (redirected or replaced silently) | Domains and counts without full visibility |
| **Blocked**       | Domains where requests were explicitly blocked | Domains and counts representing outright blocks |

### Step 1: View the Tab Hostname and Domain

- At the top of the popup, the tab’s full hostname and main domain are shown.
- This helps you identify which site’s network connections you are viewing.

### Step 2: Examine Domains in Each Section

- **Domains and counts**:
  - Domains are listed with the number of distinct requests made to each.
  - Counts help identify the most active third-party services.

- **Domain display formatting:**
  - Domains that include Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) are converted to their readable Unicode form.

### Step 3: Assess Privacy Exposure

- Use the domain counts to gauge the level of third-party exposure for the current website.
  - A high number in **Not Blocked** implies many third-party connections.
  - **Stealth-Blocked** can indicate hidden redirects or altered requests.
  - **Blocked** shows the domains your content blocker has successfully intervened against.

### Step 4: Recognize "No Data" States

- If the popup reads "NO DATA," it means no connection data is available for your current tab yet.
- This might happen if the page just loaded or if network data hasn't been captured.

<Tip>
Refresh the tab or wait a moment, then reopen the popup to see updated data.
</Tip>

## 4. Practical Example Walkthrough

Imagine you open the popup on example.com:

- The badge shows “5,” meaning connections succeeded to 5 unique third-party domains.
- The popup lists these under **Not Blocked** with counts next to each—for example, `cdn.example.net (12)`, `analytics.example.org (3)`.
- The **Stealth-Blocked** section might show `tracker.special.net (1)`, indicating a stealthy block.
- The **Blocked** section shows domains like `ads.badsite.com (4)`, which were explicitly blocked by your content blocker.

This immediate summary helps you understand third-party exposure at a glance.

## 5. Tips & Best Practices

- **Check after page load:** Network connections populate as pages and scripts load; open the popup after the page has fully loaded.
- **Use badge count as a privacy indicator:** Lower badge counts generally mean fewer third-party connections; use this metric while browsing to select privacy-conscious sites.
- **Note that stealth blocking is invisible externally:** Stealth-blocked domains are harder to detect on the web but are made transparent via this extension.
- **Understand domain grouping:** The extension groups domains by their base public suffix domain to avoid partial or misleading information.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common First-Use Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup and Badge Issues">
  <Accordion title="Popup shows NO DATA or empty lists">
    To resolve:
    - Ensure you are on a valid web page (not a blank tab or browser page).
    - Wait a few seconds after page load for the extension to capture data.
    - Refresh the page and reopen the popup.
    - Verify the extension is enabled and has appropriate permissions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Badge count never updates or stays blank">
    Check the following:
    - Is network monitoring enabled in your browser?
    - Are any other content blockers interfering with uBO Scope?
    - Review browser console logs for errors.
    - Restart the browser or reload the extension.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Domain counts seem too high or unexpected">
    - Remember the count reflects distinct third-party domains connected—not total requests.
    - Some legitimate services such as CDN providers may appear frequently.
    - Review the list to identify which third parties dominate your connections.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Next Steps

- After mastering the popup and badge insights, explore how to analyze **allowed, stealth, and blocked domains** in depth.
- Learn to interpret raw domain data to make informed decisions about filter list customization.
- Visit the [Analyzing Allowed, Stealth, and Blocked Domains guide](../core-workflows/analyzing-allowed-stealth-blocked) to deepen your skills.
