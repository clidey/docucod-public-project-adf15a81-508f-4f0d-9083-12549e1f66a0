# What is uBO Scope?

## Introduction

uBO Scope is a powerful browser extension designed to give you direct, transparent insight into all network connections initiated by your browser to remote servers — whether those connections are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked by your content blockers. Unlike typical content blockers that only report counts of blocked connections, uBO Scope reveals **every distinct third-party server** your browser tries to contact, fostering informed privacy decisions and clear understanding.

By displaying these network connection attempts in real-time and independently of existing blockers, uBO Scope enables you to truly see what your browser is doing under the hood, enhancing your awareness beyond what typical block counters or ad blocker test pages can offer.

## Why Use uBO Scope?

### Understand Your Browser's Network Activity

When visiting a webpage, your browser makes numerous requests to different servers, including third-party domains such as ad servers, content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics providers, and sometimes trackers.

uBO Scope reports these connections regardless of whether a content blocker allowed or blocked them, giving you an honest look at the actual network activity associated with the page.

### Gain Transparency Beyond Block Counters

Badge counts on traditional blockers usually represent the number of requests blocked, which can be misleading:
- A higher block count doesn't necessarily mean better blocking.
- Sometimes fewer blocks indicate fewer third-party connections overall.

uBO Scope’s badge, however, reports the **number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted** — a metric reflecting how many unique domains your browser successfully fetched or tried to fetch resources from.

### Debunk Common Ad Blocker Myths

Many users rely on third-party "ad blocker test" webpages as benchmarks, but these tests often produce inaccurate impressions because:
- They use artificial network requests.
- They don't reflect real-world browsing.
- They cannot detect stealthy blocking methods.

uBO Scope equips you with real-world data on actual network traffic, bypassing these unreliable tests.

## How uBO Scope Works

- The extension uses browser APIs (`webRequest` listeners) to intercept and log network request events such as redirects, successful completions, and errors.
- It processes these events to categorize domains into three groups:
  - **Allowed:** Domains your browser successfully connected to.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains blocked in ways that don't surface as errors but are hidden.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts resulted in errors.
- The summary appears in a popup UI when you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, and the toolbar badge shows the count of distinct allowed third-party domains.

uBO Scope is designed to work independently of your other content blockers and can measure connections even under DNS-based blocking or other methods, as long as the browser exposes network events.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine you visit a news website:
- uBO Scope detects multiple attempts by the site’s page to connect to various third-party ad servers, analytics, and CDN providers.
- Your existing ad blocker might block some of these requests but not others.
- uBO Scope will show you exactly which distinct domains were contacted, which were blocked outright, or stealthily blocked.

This clarity helps you make decisions about your privacy tools or filter lists and understand your browsing exposure in practical terms.

## Key Distinctions of uBO Scope

| Feature                          | Traditional Blockers                       | uBO Scope                                 |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Reports actual network requests  | Often counts blocked requests only         | Reports all connection attempts, allowed and blocked |
| Badge shows                     | Number of blocked requests                  | Number of distinct third-party domains connected |
| Handles stealth blocking         | May not reveal stealthy blocking            | Detects stealth block events and reports separately |
| Ad blocker test reliability      | May be misleading                          | Provides real-world browsing data           |

## Practical Tips

- A lower badge count in uBO Scope indicates fewer third-party remote servers reached, which generally means better privacy.
- Presence of stealth-blocked domains reveals subtle blocking by your content blocker.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your primary content blocker for comprehensive insight.
- Remember not all third parties are bad — CDNs and essential services count too.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't over-interpret the number of blocked requests without considering distinct domains.
- Avoid relying on ad blocker test pages for blocker effectiveness measurement.
- Understand that not seeing something in uBO Scope might mean the browser did not emit a network event (e.g., requests outside webRequest API scope).

---

## Summary

uBO Scope is your window into the full spectrum of network connections your browser attempts during browsing. It reveals all distinct third-party connections independently of your content blockers, offering transparency, debunking myths, and empowering you with actionable privacy insights.

By installing uBO Scope, you enhance your ability to monitor and assess the real impact of privacy tools and understand your actual browsing footprint.

<Info>
The badge count you see on the toolbar icon shows **distinct third-party domains that were contacted successfully**; a lower count typically reflects better privacy protection.
</Info>

<Warning>
uBO Scope relies on browser network event APIs and may not capture network requests made outside these APIs, such as certain private network requests or VPN-tunneled traffic.
</Warning>
