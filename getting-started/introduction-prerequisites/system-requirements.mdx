# System Requirements for uBO Scope

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to transparently report all remote server connections your browser makes, regardless of content blocking. To ensure proper operation, it is important to meet the platform and browser requirements, as well as understand some key prerequisites unique to uBO Scope's usage of browser APIs.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms & Browsers

uBO Scope is compatible with the following major browser platforms, each requiring specific minimum versions and permissions due to its reliance on the `webRequest` API:

- **Chromium-based browsers:**
  - Minimum Chrome version: **122.0**
  - Supported browsers include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers adhering to the extension platform.

- **Mozilla Firefox:**
  - Minimum Firefox version: **128.0**
  - Firefox for desktop and Android are supported.

- **Apple Safari:**
  - Minimum Safari version: **18.5**
  - Support is limited to recent macOS and iOS versions supporting Safari Web Extensions.

<u>Note:</u> These platforms support the necessary permissions and APIs for uBO Scope to monitor network requests effectively.

---

## 2. Browser Permissions Needed

uBO Scope requires explicit permissions granted at install time to monitor network activity:

- Access to web pages across all HTTP/S and WebSocket schemes.
- Usage of the following permissions:
  - `webRequest` — To listen to network request statuses.
  - `activeTab` — To access the currently active tab for contextual information.
  - `storage` — To persist session data and cached information.

These permissions are declared in the browser-specific manifest files and prompt the user during installation.

---

## 3. Required APIs and Features

- **`webRequest` API Access:** This is critical as uBO Scope uses it to detect all network requests, including attempts, redirects, successes, and failures.
- **Session Storage:** Utilized to cache the Public Suffix List and tab-specific data for fast, reliable operation.
- **Service Worker / Background Script:** 
  - Chromium uses a service worker (`background.js` as service_worker).
  - Firefox and Safari use a background module/script.

<u>Important:</u> Browsers that restrict or do not fully support the `webRequest` API will limit uBO Scope’s effectiveness.

---

## 4. System Requirements & Environment

While uBO Scope is lightweight and designed primarily as a browser extension, your environment should meet these general guidelines:

- **Operating System:** Compatible with any OS supporting the required browser and extensions architecture.
- **Browser Version:** As stated above, ensure you use the minimum supported versions.
- **Network Connectivity:** No special network ports are required; uBO Scope listens to browser events passively.

<u>Tip:</u> Keep your browser updated to benefit from the latest security and API support.

## 5. Platform-Specific Notes

### Chromium
- Requires minimum version 122.
- Background script runs as a service worker, ensuring lightweight continuous monitoring.
- Permissions cover HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket schemes (`https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, `ws://*/*`).

### Firefox
- Requires minimum version 128.
- Supports WebSocket schema permissions explicitly.
- Background script runs as an ES module background script.

### Safari
- Requires minimum version 18.5, supports Safari Web Extensions.
- Background script as a module.
- Limited permission support compared to Chromium and Firefox, but sufficient for uBO Scope’s operation.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Installing on unsupported or outdated browser versions will cause uBO Scope to fail or provide incomplete data.
- Denying requested permissions during install will prevent uBO Scope from monitoring network connections.
- Using browsers or configurations that restrict WebExtension APIs or limit background script lifetimes may impair functionality.

<Warning>
If the browser does not fully support the `webRequest` API, network requests made outside the trackable scope cannot be reported by uBO Scope.
</Warning>

---

## 7. Verification of Requirements

### Checking Browser Version

1. Open your browser's About page:
   - Chrome/Edge: `chrome://settings/help`
   - Firefox: `about:support`
   - Safari: `Safari > About Safari`
2. Confirm version meets the minimum requirement.

### Confirming Extension Permissions

- During installation, ensure that uBO Scope requests permissions for network request monitoring.
- Post-install, check extension settings to verify permissions are granted.

---

## 8. Additional Resources

- Refer to the [Installation & Setup](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope#installation) guide for step-by-step installer instructions.
- Learn more about the extension's interaction with network events in [Integrations & Compatibility](../overview/core-concepts-and-architecture/integration-and-compatibility).
- Understand the significance of browser API support in [Core Concepts & Terminology](../overview/core-concepts-and-architecture/fundamental-concepts).

---

## Summary
Meeting the browser and platform system requirements is essential for installing and running uBO Scope effectively. Ensure your browser is up-to-date and allows the necessary extension permissions, particularly the `webRequest` API, for comprehensive monitoring of browser network connections.

If you run into issues, verify that your environment matches these documented prerequisites.
