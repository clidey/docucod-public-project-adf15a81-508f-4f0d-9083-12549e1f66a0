# System Requirements for uBO Scope

Understanding the system requirements for uBO Scope is crucial to ensure smooth installation and reliable operation. This guide outlines the browser compatibility, platform limitations, and necessary permissions to monitor network connections effectively.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is carefully designed to function across the three major browser ecosystems, leveraging manifest-based packaging for consistent behavior:

- **Chromium-based Browsers**
  - Minimum version: **Chrome 122.0** or later
  - Includes Chrome, Edge (Chromium), Brave, and others using Chromium engine

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum version: **Firefox 128.0** or later
  - Supports desktop and Firefox for Android matching minimum version

- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum version: **Safari 18.5** or later
  - Supports macOS and iOS Safari browsers


<Tip>
Always verify that your browser is updated to at least the minimum version above to ensure full compatibility and to benefit from all uBO Scope features.
</Tip>

## 2. Platform and System Considerations

- **Platform Limitations**
  - uBO Scope functions on desktop platforms supporting the listed browser versions.
  - Some advanced monitoring features may be limited or unavailable on mobile platforms due to OS or browser restrictions.

- **Permissions and System Settings**
  - The extension requires certain permissions (detailed below) to access network request data for accurate monitoring.
  - No additional system-level permissions or root access are necessary.

## 3. Required Browser Permissions

To fully capture network activity, uBO Scope requests the following browser permissions:

- `webRequest`
  - Allows the extension to observe network requests made by webpages.
  - Essential for tracking attempted and completed connections to remote servers.

- `activeTab`
  - Grants access to details of the currently active tab.

- `storage`
  - Enables storing session data and extension settings persistently or temporarily.

- **Host Permissions**
  - The extension monitors web requests over HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and Secure WebSocket where supported.
  - Permissions include matching URL patterns such as `https://*/*` and `http://*/*`.


<Note>
Availability of host permissions may slightly vary between browsers; for example, Safari currently supports only HTTP and HTTPS schemes, excluding WebSocket.
</Note>

## 4. Network Monitoring Limitations

- uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API to detect network requests.
- Any network requests occurring outside this API's scope (e.g., DNS-level blocking, or requests blocked before reaching the browser's network stack) will not be reported.
- Browsers that do not expose comprehensive `webRequest` events or restrict this API will limit uBO Scope's visibility.

<Warning>
If you run other privacy tools that block or modify network requests at a level invisible to `webRequest`, uBO Scope cannot detect those changes directly.
</Warning>

## 5. Summary Table of Browser Compatibility and Permissions

| Browser      | Minimum Version | Permissions Required           | Supported URL Schemes         |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Chromium     | 122.0+          | `webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage` | HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS          |
| Firefox      | 128.0+          | `webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage` | HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS          |
| Safari       | 18.5+           | `webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage` | HTTP, HTTPS only (no WS/ WSS) |

## 6. Best Practices and Tips

- Ensure your browser is updated beyond the minimum version for the best experience.
- Verify that you have granted the necessary extension permissions during installation or on first launch.
- Use the extension alongside other content blockers without expecting interference; uBO Scope operates independently.
- Expect that some network requests may not be visible if they are blocked or hidden outside browser APIs.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Platform Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Network Monitoring Issues">
<Accordion title="Extension Not Detecting Any Network Requests">
- Verify that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions in your browser's extension settings.
- Check that the browser version meets the minimum requirement.
- Confirm that other extensions or settings are not interfering with browser APIs.
- Restart the browser to reinitialize extension components.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Request Count Seems Lower Than Expected">
- Understand that network requests blocked before reaching the browser network stack (e.g., at DNS or OS level) are not reported.
- Some WebSocket traffic may be unavailable, especially in Safari.
- Check for browser updates or known API limitations affecting monitoring.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Badge Count Appears on Toolbar">
- Ensure the extension is enabled and allowed to run on the active site.
- Confirm you have active tabs with network activity being captured.
- Consult the popup UI documentation for guidance on interpreting empty states.
