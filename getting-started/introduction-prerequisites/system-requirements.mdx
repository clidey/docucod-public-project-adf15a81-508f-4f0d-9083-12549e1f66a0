# Supported Browsers & System Requirements

Ensure you are using a compatible environment before installing uBO Scope. This page clarifies the supported browsers, minimum version requirements, and necessary permissions for seamless operation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is a cross-browser extension designed to work on the major modern browsers using Manifest Version 3 (MV3) extension standard:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and others)
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Apple Safari**

Each platform has slightly different requirements and permission scopes detailed below.

---

## 2. Browser & Platform Requirements

### Chromium (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, etc.)

- Minimum Chrome version: **122.0**
- Extension uses a JavaScript service worker for background tasks.
- Permissions required: `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`
- Host permissions granted for all HTTP(S) and WS(S) URLs to monitor network requests:
  - `https://*/*`
  - `http://*/*`
  - `wss://*/*`
  - `ws://*/*`

### Mozilla Firefox

- Minimum Firefox version: **128.0**
- Background scripts run as ES modules.
- Permissions required identical to Chromium.
- Host permissions include HTTP(S) and WS(S) URLs similarly.
- Extension ID: `uBO-Scope@raymondhill.net`

### Safari

- Minimum Safari version: **18.5**
- Background scripts run as ES modules.
- Permissions required: `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`
- Host permissions limited to HTTP(S) URLs only (no WebSocket URLs).

---

## 3. Permission Overview & Necessity

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to effectively monitor and report network connections from browser tabs:

- **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to interact with the current tab to fetch relevant network data.
- **`storage`**: Used to persist session data such as recorded network connection outcomes and public suffix lists.
- **`webRequest`**: Core permission that enables the extension to listen to and capture details about all network requests (allowed, blocked, or error/redirect).

**Host Permissions:**
- Required to monitor network requests across all websites and WebSocket connections.
- For Safari, limited to `http` and `https` URLs; WebSockets are unsupported due to browser restrictions.

---

## 4. System Requirements & Compatibility Notes

- Use uBO Scope only on browsers fully compatible with Manifest Version 3.
- Browsers must support the `webRequest` API for extensions.
- WebSocket monitoring is limited to Chromium and Firefox platforms.
- Disable any conflicting extensions that interfere with `webRequest` listeners or modify tab network contexts.

> <Note>The extension is designed to be lightweight and should have minimal impact on system resources.</Note>

## 5. Verification of Compatibility Before Installation

To verify if your browser meets the requirements:

1. Check your browser version:
   - **Chrome/Edge/Brave/Opera:** Open the browser’s About page (`chrome://settings/help`) to confirm the version number.
   - **Firefox:** Visit `about:support` to view the version.
   - **Safari:** Use `Safari > About Safari` from the menu.

2. Ensure that extension APIs are enabled and not restricted by corporate policies or security tools.

3. Confirm WebSocket monitoring compatibility:
   - For Chromium and Firefox, no special action needed.
   - For Safari, be aware that WebSocket connections will not be monitored.

## 7. Best Practices & Troubleshooting Tips

- Always update your browser to the latest stable release to guarantee the best compatibility.
- Upon installation, verify extension permissions are granted fully by visiting your browser’s extensions or add-ons settings page.
- If WebSocket requests are not reported on Safari, check platform limitations and consider using Chromium or Firefox for full monitoring.
- Some strict browsing modes or security settings may impede the extension's functionality; test in a clean profile or standard user context.

## 10. Getting Help

For questions or issues regarding system compatibility:

- Visit the GitHub repository at [https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope)
- Report compatibility issues or open tickets for your specific browser platform.
- Check browser extension stores for latest version updates and release notes.

<Tip>
Ensuring your browser meets these system requirements guarantees that uBO Scope can fully monitor all network connection events, including WebSocket connections when supported, and maintain accurate badge counts for your active tabs.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Safari’s current extension API limits the ability to monitor WebSocket connections. For comprehensive network monitoring, prefer Chromium or Firefox platforms.
</Warning>

<Check>
Confirm permissions after installation by visiting your browser’s extension management page and verifying that uBO Scope has access to "Read and change all your data on websites you visit".
