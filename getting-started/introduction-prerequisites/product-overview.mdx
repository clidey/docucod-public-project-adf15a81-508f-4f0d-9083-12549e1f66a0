# What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a powerful, cross-browser extension designed to give you transparent insight into all remote server connections your browser attempts while loading any web page. Whether those requests are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked by your content blockers, uBO Scope reveals every remote connection attempt regardless of which content blocker is active. This comprehensive visibility helps you understand what resources your browser is fetching, assess your content blockers’ effectiveness, and improve your overall privacy awareness.

## Introduction to uBO Scope

uBO Scope acts as a network connection advisor visible right in your browser toolbar. Unlike typical ad blockers that simply block or allow requests without reporting all activity, uBO Scope uses the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor **all** network requests initiated by webpages. It records details about each request’s outcome, categorizing connections into three groups:

- **Allowed:** Requests that successfully reached remote servers.
- **Blocked:** Requests that were blocked before reaching remote servers.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that were redirected or manipulated to prevent detection or loading.

These distinctions give you an accurate and unbiased view of actual third-party server contacts by every page you visit.

---

## Who Benefits from uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is invaluable for several types of users:

- **Privacy-conscious individuals:** Gain real-time insights into every third-party connection your browser makes, helping you identify unexpected data leaks or trackers.
- **Filter list maintainers:** Get precise, actionable data on which servers are contacted across sites and evaluate how different lists perform.
- **Technical users and developers:** Troubleshoot resource loading issues, validate content blocker effectiveness, and confirm that blocking policies behave as intended.

In every case, uBO Scope sheds light on the unseen network activity behind the scenes of the web.

---

## Typical Use Cases

- **Monitoring third-party connections:** Identify how many distinct third-party domains web pages connect to — fewer is often better for privacy.
- **Assessing content blocker performance:** Determine whether your blocker allows unwanted connections by comparing allowed vs. blocked counts.
- **Debunking misconceptions:** Learn why a higher block count badge doesn’t necessarily mean better blocking, but rather that fewer distinct remote servers are contacted.
- **Filter list validation:** Use the extension’s detailed reports to refine and maintain filter lists by understanding true network behavior.

---

## Key Value Proposition

The core value of uBO Scope lies in its impartial, comprehensive reporting of all remote server connection attempts, independent of which content blocker (or none) is active. It does not interfere with blocking but complements your privacy tools by:

- **Exposing stealth blocking:** Reveal redirects or manipulations that some blockers use silently.
- **Counting distinct remote servers:** Badge counts reflect unique domains contacted, so you can quickly assess your exposure footprint.
- **Supporting multiple browsers:** Works uniformly across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari, leveraging each browser's native capabilities.

This level of insight is crucial for users who want trustworthy data rather than approximations or misleading block counts.

## Understanding uBO Scope's Workflow

When you visit a webpage, uBO Scope:

1. Listens to every network request through the browser’s `webRequest` API.
2. Categorizes requests based on their final outcome (allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked).
3. Aggregates data per tab to track distinct domains contacted.
4. Updates the toolbar badge with the count of unique allowed third-party domains.
5. Provides a popup UI breakdown showing lists of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.

This transparent, tab-centric reporting helps you visualize and investigate your browsing activity with precision.

## Important Notes and Myths Debunked

- **Toolbar badge meaning:** The number displayed is the count of distinct third-party remote servers successfully contacted — not the total number of blocked requests. Lower badge counts generally indicate better privacy.

- **Block count is deceptive:** A higher block count (reported by some blockers) does not necessarily mean better blocking. It may correlate to more third-party servers contacted, indicating less effective blocking.

- **Beware of 'ad blocker test' webpages:** Such test pages generate artificial network requests that don’t reflect real-world browsing and often fail to fairly evaluate stealth or sophisticated blocking.

uBO Scope provides real-world grounded data, avoiding these pitfalls to deliver honest visibility.

## How uBO Scope Works with Other Tools

uBO Scope coexists seamlessly with extensions like uBlock Origin and DNS-based blockers. Because it monitors network activity at the browser API level, it reports the outcomes as your current blockers enforce them.

- It shows which requests your blocker allowed versus blocked.
- It highlights stealth blocking that might be invisible to webpages or other tools.

By adding uBO Scope to your privacy toolkit, you get an independent vantage point into your browser’s network behavior.

## Example: Visualizing uBO Scope Data

When visiting a website, uBO Scope's toolbar icon badge updates with the number of distinct third-party remote domains contacted without being blocked. Clicking the icon opens a popup with three sections:

- **Not Blocked:** Lists domains successfully connected.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Shows domains where requests were silently redirected or prevented.
- **Blocked:** Shows domains where requests were fully blocked.

This clear breakdown maps the network activity in a user-friendly view.

<Tip>
For the most accurate data, ensure your browser permits uBO Scope to listen to `webRequest` events and that no other extensions interfere with network request reporting.
</Tip>

<Warning>
uBO Scope relies on the browser's network event APIs. Connections initiated outside of these (for example, direct DNS queries or OS-level requests) are **not** captured.
</Warning>

## FAQ

**Q: Does uBO Scope block connections?**

A: No. uBO Scope observes and reports connection attempts but does not block or modify network traffic itself.

**Q: Can I trust the badge count?**

A: Yes. It represents the count of distinct third-party domains that your browser contacted and were allowed by your active blocking tools.

**Q: Which browsers are supported?**

A: uBO Scope supports Chromium-based browsers, Firefox (version 128.0+), and Safari (version 18.5+).

**Q: Will uBO Scope slow down my browsing?**

A: No. It uses efficient browser APIs to monitor requests asynchronously without impacting performance.
