# Prerequisites & Supported Browsers

Before installing and using **uBO Scope**, ensure your system and browser meet the necessary requirements. This page outlines the supported browsers, minimum versions, platform compatibility, and basic system needs to help you avoid common installation or runtime issues.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers & Minimum Versions

**uBO Scope** is designed to work as a browser extension across the leading browser platforms using WebExtensions APIs and `webRequest` event listeners. Below are the officially supported browsers and their minimum required versions:

| Browser Platform | Minimum Version                   | Notes                                              |
|------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Chromium**     | 122.0 and above                  | Includes Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers |
| **Firefox**      | 128.0 and above                  | Desktop and Android supported                       |
| **Safari**       | 18.5 and above                   | Requires macOS or iOS supporting Safari 18.5+      |



### Important Notes:
- Minimum version requirements ensure proper support for Manifest v3 and the `webRequest` API features that uBO Scope relies on.
- Browsers below these versions will either not permit installation or will experience limited or broken functionality.


## 2. Platform Compatibility

- **Operating Systems:**
  - Windows, macOS, Linux (via Chromium and Firefox)
  - Android (Firefox)
  - iOS and iPadOS (Safari)

- **Browser Architecture:**
  - Extensions use Manifest v3 standards with either service workers or background scripts depending on the browser.

- **Permissions:** The extension requires permissions such as `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` explicitly declared in each browser's manifest to function.


## 3. System-Level Requirements

While uBO Scope is lightweight and does not demand extensive system resources, certain conditions help ensure smooth operation:

- **Network Access:**
  - Access to the internet is required for fetching the Public Suffix List initially.
  - The extension must be able to monitor all HTTP(s) and WebSocket traffic for accurate connection reporting.

- **Browser Settings:**
  - The browser must allow extensions with `webRequest` access.
  - Some browsers or privacy settings may restrict extension permissions â€” verify these if network data appears incomplete.

- **Storage:**
  - The extension uses session-level storage for runtime data and local storage for cached data like the Public Suffix List.


## 4. Summary: What You Need Before Installing

1. A supported browser at or above the minimum version listed.
2. An operating system compatible with your browser choice.
3. Network connectivity to initially load required data files.
4. Permission to install extensions and grant the declared `webRequest` and storage rights.


## 5. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Compatibility Questions">
<Accordion title="I have the correct browser, but the extension won't install. What do I do?">
Ensure your browser version is properly updated by checking its About page. If you use an unofficial Chromium-based variant or an older Firefox ESR version, upgrade or switch to an officially supported browser release.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The extension installs, but I see no badge count or data.">
Check that the extension has the necessary permissions under your browser's extension or privacy settings. Some security or network monitoring tools may interfere with `webRequest` events. Also verify your network connectivity and that no conflicting extensions block web requests from being reported.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is uBO Scope compatible with mobile browsers?">
Official support exists for Firefox on Android. Safari on iOS/iPadOS versions 18.5+ also support it through the App Extensions model. Other mobile browsers may not fully support required APIs.
