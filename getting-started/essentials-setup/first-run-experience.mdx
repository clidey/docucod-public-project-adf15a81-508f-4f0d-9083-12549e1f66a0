# First Run & Quick Tour

Welcome to **uBO Scope**! This guide helps you understand what to expect immediately after activating the extension in your browser. You'll learn how to identify the extension's toolbar icon, interpret the badge count it displays, open its popup interface, and understand the instant feedback provided about active network connections. This quick tour connects the user interface with the core value uBO Scope offers—transparent visibility into the remote servers your browser connects with.

---

## 1. Locating the Toolbar Icon

After installation, look for the **uBO Scope** icon in your browser's toolbar:

- The icon uses the **uBO Scope logo** displayed in multiple sizes (16x16 up to 128x128 px depending on browser resolution).
- By default, it shows the tooltip titled **'uBO Scope'** when you hover over the icon.

> In Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers, the icon appears alongside other extension icons in your browser's main toolbar area.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the icon immediately, check your browser’s extension menu or toolbar customization settings to pin uBO Scope for quick access.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Badge Count

The numeric badge on the toolbar icon represents the **number of distinct third-party remote servers your current browser tab has connected to.**

- A **lower badge count is better,** indicating fewer remote third-party connections.
- This count reflects **unique domains** contacted and excludes repeated connections to the same domain.

<Info>
The badge count dynamically updates as web pages load and network connections are made or blocked.
</Info>

### What the Badge Count Means:

| Badge Count | Meaning |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Empty or No Badge | No third-party connections detected yet for the active tab.
| Number (e.g., 0, 1, 5, 10+) | Number of unique third-party domains connected to by the active tab.

<Warning>
Note that **not all third-party connections are harmful or unwanted.** Legitimate services like content delivery networks (CDNs) may be included in this count.
</Warning>

## 3. Opening the Extension Popup

To explore detailed connection information:

1. **Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.**
2. The extension popup will appear showing the current tab’s network connection summary.

### Popup Interface Overview:

- The **header** displays the hostname and domain of the active browser tab.
- A **summary section** presents the total count of connected domains.
- Detailed sections categorize domains into:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Connections that were allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections hidden by stealth blocking.
  - **Blocked**: Connections explicitly blocked.

### Visual Example:

```plaintext
[Hostname]                      

Domains connected: 5

Allowed (not blocked):
 - example-cdn.com (3)
 - legitimate-analytics.net (1)

Stealth-blocked:
 - tracker-hidden.com (2)

Blocked:
 - adserver.com (4)
```

Each domain entry also includes a badge count showing how many times connections to that domain were made.

<Tip>
If the popup shows `NO DATA`, this indicates no network information is available for the current tab yet—try reloading the page.
</Tip>

## 4. Immediate Feedback on Active Network Connections

uBO Scope uses browser **webRequest** listeners to monitor network requests as they happen, regardless of other blocking layers like DNS-level filters or other content blockers.

- The popup instantly reflects active network connections and their outcomes per tab.
- Badge counts update in real-time as connections are made or blocked.
- Domains are resolved accurately using the **Public Suffix List** to group subdomains under their effective registered domains.

<Note>
This means you always see an accurate, content-agnostic view of real network activity for each webpage, enabling precise privacy auditing.
</Note>

## 5. Practical First Steps

Follow this workflow to get started:

<Steps>
<Step title="Install uBO Scope in your browser">
Install the extension from your browser's official store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari Extensions Gallery).
</Step>
<Step title="Locate the toolbar icon">
Identify the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
</Step>
<Step title="Open a website tab">
Navigate to any webpage you want to analyze.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the badge number">

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- Use the badge count as a **privacy indicator**: fewer third-party connections usually imply a cleaner browsing experience.
- Remember that some third-party connections are essential for site functionality.
- Refresh the tab or reopen the popup if you see 'NO DATA' to trigger fresh data collection.
- Combine uBO Scope with content blockers for effective network monitoring.
