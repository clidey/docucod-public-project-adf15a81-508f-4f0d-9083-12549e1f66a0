- **Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge): version **122 or higher**
- **Mozilla Firefox**: version **128 or higher**
- **Safari**: version **18.5 or higher**

If you are running an older version, update your browser first to avoid installation or functionality issues.

## 2. Installation Methods by Browser

uBO Scope is distributed through official web stores or add-on repositories for each major browser:

### Chromium Browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)

1. Open your Chromium browser.
2. Navigate to the official uBO Scope listing on the Chrome Web Store:

   [uBO Scope on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)

3. Click the **Add to Chrome** button.
4. Confirm the installation in the popup dialog.
5. After installation, the uBO Scope icon will appear in your browser toolbar.

<Note>
Always install extensions from the official Chrome Web Store link above to ensure authenticity and security.
</Note>

### Firefox

1. Open Firefox.
2. Access the official uBO Scope add-on page:

   [uBO Scope on Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

3. Click **Add to Firefox**.
4. Confirm any permission requests and installation prompts.
5. The uBO Scope icon will become visible near the address bar upon successful installation.

<Warning>
Do not download uBO Scope add-ons hosted on third-party sites; use only the official Mozilla Add-ons site.
</Warning>

### Safari

1. Ensure you are running Safari version 18.5 or higher on macOS.
2. Visit the official uBO Scope GitHub repository or trusted Safari Extensions gallery if available.

<u>Note:</u> Currently, uBO Scope is packaged for Safari using the manifest file `platform/safari/manifest.json` indicating compatibility with Safari 18.5+.

3. Installation steps for Safari require manual loading or use of the packaged `.safariextz` if provided by the developer.

### General Manual Installation (Advanced User)

For users compiling from source or loading unpacked extensions manually:

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git`
- Use provided build scripts to assemble the extension for your browser:
  - Chromium: See `tools/make-package.sh chromium`
  - Firefox: Use `tools/make-firefox.sh` to create `.xpi`
  - Safari: Package using the manifest in `platform/safari/manifest.json`

Refer to the scripts and source for exact parameters and commands.

## 3. Verifying Installation

After installation completes, verify that uBO Scope is active and ready to monitor network connections:

### Check for Toolbar Icon

- The uBO Scope icon, a shield emblem with a count badge, appears in your browser’s toolbar.
- This icon dynamically displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the active tab.

<Check>
If you don't see the icon:
- Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions or add-ons manager.
- Add it manually to the toolbar if your browser supports icon customization.
</Check>

### Quick Functional Check

1. Open any popular website.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open its popup interface.
3. Confirm the popup displays connection counts with categories: "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked".

### Confirm Extension Version

- Right-click the uBO Scope icon and select **Manage extensions** or navigate to the extensions/add-ons page.
- Locate uBO Scope and verify the version (should be **1.0.1** or higher).

## 4. Important Visual Cues from the README

The [README file](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/README.md) reinforces installation procedures and important notes:

- It highlights that the extension's badge number is the distinct count of third-party remote domains contacted — a privacy measurement metric.
- It states compatibility details across browsers and lists official install URLs.
- It includes images showing how to identify the extension in browser stores clearly as 'uBO Scope'.

Refer back to the README anytime for official updates and clarifications.

## 5. Browser-Specific Notes

### Chromium

- Requires minimum Chrome version 122.
- Uses a service worker background script to track network calls.
- Permissions granted upon installation include `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` to allow full network visibility.

### Firefox

- Minimum version 128 is required.
- Upholds equivalent permissions in its manifest.

### Safari

- Uses background scripts as modules.
- Requires manual installation or developer provisioning in Safari's extension preferences unless the extension is published in the Safari Extensions Gallery.

<Info>
Installation processes vary by browser security policies regarding extensions. Always follow your browser’s prompts and official guidance.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

If you encounter difficulties:

- **Extension does not appear in toolbar:** Verify it is enabled and allowed in your browser. Pin the extension icon to the toolbar if hidden.

- **Installation fails or is blocked:** Ensure your browser version meets minimum requirements and that you’re installing from official channels only.

- **Permission request warnings:** uBO Scope requires webRequest and storage permissions to function correctly. Confirm these requests to proceed.

- **Safari-specific issues:** You may need to trust unsigned extensions in Safari's Developer menu or use the `.safariextz` package if manually installing.
