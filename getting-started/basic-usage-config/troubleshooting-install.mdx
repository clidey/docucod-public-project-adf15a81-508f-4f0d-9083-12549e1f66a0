# Troubleshooting & Frequently Asked Questions

## 1. Common Issues and How to Fix Them

### 1.1 Toolbar Icon is Missing

If you do not see the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar after installation:

1. **Check Extension Installation:** Verify the extension is installed and enabled in your browser's extension manager.
2. **Browser Compatibility:** Ensure your browser version meets the minimum requirement:
   - Chromium-based browsers: version 122.0 or higher
   - Firefox: version 128.0 or higher
   - Safari: version 18.5 or higher
3. **Toolbar Customization:** Some browsers allow hiding extension icons. Use your browser’s customize toolbar options to add the uBO Scope icon manually.

<Note>
If your browser is below these versions, the extension may not function correctly or fail to appear.
</Note>

### 1.2 Popup Does Not Open or Is Unresponsive

If clicking the toolbar icon does not open the popup or the popup appears blank:

1. **Reload the Extension:** Disable and re-enable the extension from the extension manager.
2. **Restart the Browser:** Close and reopen the browser to reset background processes.
3. **Disable Conflicting Extensions:** Temporarily disable other extensions that might interfere, especially other content blockers.
4. **Clear Extension Data:**
   - Go to your browser's extension settings.
   - Find uBO Scope and clear its stored data or site data.

<Warning>
Popups rely on browser APIs (`webRequest`, `storage`). If permission is denied or corrupted data exists, the popup may fail to load.
</Warning>

### 1.3 Permission Errors or Unexpected Behavior

uBO Scope requires these permissions to fully operate:

- `webRequest` to monitor network requests.
- `storage` to save session data.
- `activeTab` for interactions with the current tab.

If you see permission errors:

- Confirm the extension has all required permissions enabled.
- Review browser security settings that may restrict extension capabilities.
- Check for enterprise policies or parental controls that might limit permissions.

## 2. Compatibility Questions

### 2.1 Can uBO Scope Work Alongside Other Content Blockers?

Yes. uBO Scope is designed to observe network requests independently of content blockers, reporting connection outcomes regardless of blocking. It uses the browser's `webRequest` API to track all remote server connections, so it functions alongside other blockers without interference.

<Info>
The badge count on the toolbar icon reflects distinct third-party domains connected, not the number of blocks, providing an unbiased measurement.
</Info>

### 2.2 Will uBO Scope Detect Connections Blocked by DNS or Other External Mechanisms?

uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API. It reports network requests as long as they reach the browser’s networking stack, even if blocked by DNS or other mechanisms outside the browser extension environment.

<Note>
Requests not visible via the `webRequest` API, such as those from external applications or VPNs, are not reported.
</Note>

## 4. Additional FAQs

### Q: Why Does the Badge Number Change Frequently?
The badge number indicates the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected per tab. It reflects real-time activity. Browser tabs or page reloads can change the count as new connections are made or blocked.

### Q: Why Are Some Connections Marked 'Stealth-Blocked'?
Stealth-blocked connections are those intercepted and redirected internally by the browser or the extension without full failure. They are counted separately to provide detailed insight into network request outcomes.

### Q: Does uBO Scope Affect Browser Performance?
No. uBO Scope monitors network requests via the browser's native API and is optimized to minimize impact on performance.

### Q: How Do I Report Bugs or Request Features?
Please visit the [uBO-Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) for issue reporting and contributions.

## 5. Troubleshooting Tips

- **Extension Not Working Immediately:** Allow a few seconds after page load for data aggregation.
- **No Data on Popup for Some Pages:** Some pages may not generate third-party requests detectable by the extension.
- **Toolbar Badge Shows No Number:** This means no third-party connections were detected.
- **Icon Appears Disabled:** Check permission changes or extension updates that might require re-authorization.

If problems persist despite troubleshooting, restarting your browser or reinstalling is recommended.
