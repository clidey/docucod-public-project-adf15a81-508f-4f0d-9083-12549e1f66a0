# Launching and Using uBO Scope

Discover how to start uBO Scope in your browser, interact with its popup interface, and understand the real-time badge counts that indicate third-party network activity. This guide will walk you through launching the extension, interpreting its feedback, and making sense of the connection data it reveals.

---

## 1. Opening uBO Scope in Your Browser

uBO Scope integrates seamlessly as a browser extension available for Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari. Once installed, you can launch it easily for any active browser tab.

### Steps to Access uBO Scope:

1. **Locate the Toolbar Icon:**
    - Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It appears as a small badge with a number or no number.

2. **Click the Icon to Open the Popup:**
    - Clicking the icon opens uBO Scope's popup UI, which displays detailed information about remote server connections made by the currently active tab.

3. **Switch to a Different Tab:**
    - To see connection data for other pages, switch tabs and open the popup again. uBO Scope tracks network requests on a per-tab basis.

<Tip>
If you do not see the uBO Scope icon, ensure the extension is installed and enabled. For installation guidance, refer to the 'Installing uBO Scope' documentation.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Badge Count

The uBO Scope toolbar icon shows a badge with a number representing **the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the current tab**. This count reflects network requests that were either successful or attempted.

### Key Points About the Badge Count:

- **Lower Badge Count Is Better:** It indicates fewer unique third-party connections and a smaller exposure surface.
- **Not All Third-Parties Are Malicious:** Some third-party connections are legitimate, such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).
- **Counts Unique Domains, Not Requests:** Multiple requests to the same remote server count as one toward the badge.

<Info>
This count excludes first-party domains (the site you are visiting) and focuses on distinct external remote servers.
</Info>

## 3. Exploring the Popup Interface

When opened, the uBO Scope popup displays a categorized summary of all remote server connections made by the active tab, segmented into:

- **Not Blocked:** Connections allowed by the browser or content blockers.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections where blocking was implicit or happened without overt notifications.
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked.

### Using the Popup

1. **View Tab Hostname:** At the top, you will see the hostname of the current tab, helping you confirm which page's connections you are examining.

2. **Domain Lists:** Each category lists third-party domains contacted, with counts of how many requests correspond to each domain.

3. **Summary Count:** A total count of distinct domains connected is shown for quick assessment.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Hostname">
Check the displayed tab hostname to confirm the data applies to the page you want.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze Connection Categories">
Inspect the lists under Not Blocked, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked to understand the network request outcomes.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Counts to Prioritize">
Focus on domains with higher request counts for deeper privacy or security inspection.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The extension actively gathers data in real-time. If the popup shows no data for a busy page, refresh the page or give the extension a moment to update.
</Note>

## 4. Real-Time Connection Monitoring Workflow

uBO Scope continuously listens to your browser’s network activities per tab using the `webRequest` API, capturing all attempts and outcomes of remote connections. This includes:

- Successful connections
- Redirects
- Failures or blocked requests

The toolbar icon’s badge count and popup data update dynamically as you browse.

<Info>
This monitoring works independently of any content blockers you may have installed, giving an accurate picture of what actually connects to which servers.
</Info>

## 5. Interpreting the Badge Count and Popup Data: Practical Tips

- Use the badge count as a **privacy health indicator:** A rising count may indicate the page is loading resources from multiple external servers.
- Check the 'Not Blocked' list to see which third-party servers successfully connected.
- Consult the 'Blocked' and 'Stealth-Blocked' lists to verify your content blockers' effectiveness.
- Recognize that a **high block count badge on typical content blockers does not necessarily equate to better blocking**; often, blockers with fewer distinct third-party connections offer tighter control.

<Tip>
Combine uBO Scope with your content blocker to analyze if your filter lists are effectively reducing distinct third-party connections.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting and Tips">
<Accordion title="The uBO Scope icon is missing or not responsive">
- Make sure the extension is installed properly from the official source for your browser (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari Extensions).
- Restart your browser to refresh the extension.
- Verify the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions page.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count does not update as expected">
- The extension updates network data with a short delay; refreshing the page or waiting a few seconds helps.
- Some network requests may not be observable if the browser blocks them before `webRequest` can report them.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup shows no data or 'NO DATA' message">
- The active tab may not have network activity.
- Switch tabs or reload the page.
- Ensure your browser version supports the `webRequest` API fully.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
