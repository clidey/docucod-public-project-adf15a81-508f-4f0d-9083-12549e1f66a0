# Configuring Core Settings

After you've installed uBO Scope, configuring its core settings ensures the extension operates effectively for your browsing environment. This guide walks you through understanding the default setup, verifying permissions, and customizing behavior to align with your privacy and performance preferences.

---

## 1. Understanding Default Configuration

Upon installation, uBO Scope is pre-configured to automatically monitor network connections without requiring manual setup. Key points about this default configuration include:

- **Automatic Network Monitoring:** The extension uses the browser's `webRequest` API to listen to network requests in real time.
- **Permission-Driven Operation:** Only with the correct permissions granted during installation can uBO Scope function properly.
- **Data Storage:** Connection data for each browser tab is stored temporarily using the browser's storage APIs to provide real-time badge counts and popup panel insights.

The default settings are designed to maximize privacy visibility while maintaining a lightweight and unobtrusive user experience.

<Check>
Ensure you have installed uBO Scope on a supported browser version (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+). Incorrect versions might block essential permissions.
</Check>

## 2. Verifying Required Permissions

For uBO Scope to deliver accurate and comprehensive network connection info, certain browser permissions are mandatory:

- **`webRequest` Permission:** Enables monitoring of network requests initiated by webpages.
- **`activeTab` Permission:** Allows detection and data collection for the current active tab.
- **`storage` Permission:** Enables storing session data and public suffix lists persistently.

### How to Check Permissions

1. Open your browser’s extension management page:
   - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
   - Firefox: `about:addons`
   - Safari: Preferences > Extensions

2. Locate uBO Scope in the list.
3. Confirm that the permissions include at least the above three.

### Troubleshooting Permissions

If any permissions are missing or denied:

- **Reinstall the Extension:** Sometimes a fresh install will prompt correct permission granting.
- **Manually Grant Permissions:** Some browsers allow modification via the extension details page.
- **Check Browser Settings:** Ensure no browser policy or security software is blocking extension permissions.

<Tip>
Missing or restricted permissions will cause incomplete network data, inaccurate badge counts, or failure to update the popup panel.
</Tip>

## 3. Configuring Basic Extension Behavior

While uBO Scope is largely designed for immediate use, a few optional adjustments help tailor its operation:

### 3.1 Clearing Data on Tab Close

By default, uBO Scope clears stored session data for a tab once it closes, maintaining privacy and managing storage resources efficiently.

> This behavior is automatic and does not require user intervention.

### 3.2 Adjusting Data Storage Scope

Currently, uBO Scope stores monitoring data per tab session, meaning each tab maintains its own connection records independently. This setup ensures clarity in network exposure per webpage.

### 3.3 Managing Public Suffix List Refresh

uBO Scope uses a cached copy of the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to determine domains from hostnames accurately. Upon installation, it loads and caches this list automatically.

- The list is refreshed only if missing or outdated.
- This ensures ongoing accuracy without impacting browser performance.

<Note>
No manual update steps are required; the extension handles refreshing seamlessly in the background.
</Note>

## 4. Tips for Customizing to Your Browsing Patterns

### Monitor High Privacy Risk Sites Closely
If you suspect certain websites expose numerous third-party connections, use uBO Scope’s popup panel to dive deeper into allowed, stealth-blocked, and fully-blocked domains.

### Combine with Your Preferred Content Blocker
uBO Scope complements other content blockers by revealing the real third-party connections regardless of which blocker is active, facilitating tuning and verification.

### Use Badge Count as a Quick Privacy Indicator
The numerical badge on the toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains. A lower number indicates reduced third-party exposure.

### Reload Tabs After Changing Content Blockers
Since uBO Scope monitors live network requests, any modification in content blocker settings requires a tab reload to see updated results.

## 5. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall: Missing Data in Popup
If you open the popup panel and see "NO DATA" or empty domain lists:

- Check if the tab has finished loading and issuing network requests.
- Confirm permissions are intact.
- Reload the tab to prompt fresh monitoring.

### Pitfall: Badge Not Updating
The badge may lag if there are excessive requests in short bursts.

- Wait up to a few seconds for updates.
- Check for browser performance issues that might delay background scripts.

### Pitfall: Unexpected High Counts
Sometimes legitimate sites load resources from numerous domains (e.g., CDNs).

- Review the popup panel’s detailed breakdown before assuming risk.
- Filter lists may affect which connections are blocked or allowed.

## 6. Verifying Your Configuration

After verifying permissions and understanding default behaviors:

1. Open a new browser tab.
2. Navigate to a popular website.
3. Monitor the badge count on uBO Scope’s icon.
4. Click the icon to open the popup panel and review connection details.
5. If the badge and popup correctly reflect distinct connections, your core settings are properly configured.
