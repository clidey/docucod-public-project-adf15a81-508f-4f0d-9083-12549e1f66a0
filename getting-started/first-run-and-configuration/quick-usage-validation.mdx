# Performing a Quick Validation

Verify that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browser's network activity with these simple, practical steps. This guide will walk you through checking the toolbar badge count, interpreting domain connection summaries, and confirming the extension displays expected data when browsing.

---

## 1. Understanding What to Expect

Before running your first check, keep in mind uBO Scope's primary goal: to report the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connects to. A lower badge count means fewer unique third-party connections — generally indicating better privacy.

- The toolbar icon badge reflects the count of unique *allowed* domains contacted by the active tab.
- The popup panel breaks down domains into three categories:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains the browser connected to without hindrance.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains with stealthy interception of requests (e.g., redirects).
  - **Blocked**: Domains where connections were actively blocked.

<u>Note:</u> The extension updates this information in near real-time as you navigate web pages.

## 2. Step-by-Step Validation Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup Panel">
Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. Click the icon to open the popup panel where domain connection summaries are displayed.

- The popup opens as a small panel overlay.
- The top header shows the hostname related to the active tab.
- Below that, you'll find counts and lists of domains under the allowed, stealth, and blocked categories.
</Step>

<Step title="Check the Toolbar Badge Count">
Look at the badge number on the uBO Scope icon.

- This number indicates how many unique third-party domains have connected on the current active tab.
- If the badge is empty, either no connections have been recorded yet, or the page is still loading.
- As you browse or reload the page, the count typically updates dynamically.

<Tip>
A high number here could indicate many third-party connections; a lower, or zero, count usually means fewer remote servers contacted.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Typical Websites to Generate Data">
Visit common websites you use daily to generate network activity.

- Each loaded website triggers uBO Scope to record and update connections.
- After the page fully loads, open the popup panel again to review the domains and counts.

<Warning>
Avoid special “ad blocker test” pages as they may generate artificial or misleading network requests.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Review Domain Summaries in the Popup Panel">
Inspect the three domain lists displayed:

- **Not Blocked**: These are domains your browser successfully connected to.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: These may represent network redirects or silently intercepted requests.
- **Blocked**: These are domains uBO Scope detected as deliberately blocked.

Each domain entry includes a count badge showing how many connections were made or intercepted.

<Tip>
Focus on third-party domains relevant to your privacy preferences; common CDN domains typically appear here and are expected.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Popup Data Matches Badge Count">
Ensure the total number of unique domains shown is consistent with the badge count.

- The summary at the top of the popup reflects the total unique connected domains.
- Both badge and summary should align unless there is no active tab or the page hasn’t finished loading.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Practical Tips for Better Validation

- **Reload a Page**: After installing or enabling uBO Scope, reload a website to generate fresh network data.
- **Try Multiple Sites**: Test across diverse websites to verify that uBO Scope monitors network requests consistently.
- **Understand Third Parties**: Not all third parties are malicious; content delivery networks (CDNs) like `cdn.example.com` generally appear and are safe.
- **Wait a Moment**: The extension batches network requests before updating counts, so allow a few seconds for the badge and panel to reflect changes.

## 4. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

<Accordion title="Empty or No Data Displayed in Popup">
Possible causes:
- The active tab has no network requests yet.
- The extension is not fully initialized.
- Browser permissions or settings prevent `webRequest` API from reporting.

Solutions:
- Refresh the active tab and reopen the popup.
- Check that uBO Scope is enabled and has necessary permissions.
- Ensure your browser version supports the extension.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating as Expected">
Possible causes:
- The extension’s background process was suspended temporarily.
- Network filtering is performed at a level not visible to the browser’s `webRequest` API.

Solutions:
- Switch tabs or reload pages to reactivate the extension.
- Confirm that your browser and content blockers are compatible with uBO Scope’s monitoring.
</Accordion>

## 5. Next Steps After Validation

Once you've confirmed uBO Scope is active and monitoring:

- Explore the [Popup Panel and Badge Explained](/overview/feature-overview-usage/popover-and-badge) page for detailed interpretation of the UI.
- Start using uBO Scope to analyze your browsing habits, third-party exposure, and refine your content blocking preferences.
- Consult troubleshooting guides if anomalies appear during usage.

## 6. Summary

Performing a quick validation ensures uBO Scope reliably tracks network requests and displays actionable data about third-party connections.

You validate by:
- Opening the popup and reading the badge count.
- Navigating to various sites to generate network connections.
- Interpreting domain summaries shown.
- Confirming consistency between badge and popup summary.

<Tip>
Remember: uBO Scope’s purpose is to give a transparent view of your browser’s third-party network connections, empowering you with privacy insights.
