# Launching uBO Scope

Welcome to your first experience with **uBO Scope**. This guide walks you through how to access uBO Scope after installation, open its popup interface, and understand the key elements displayed on the dashboard. You'll learn what to expect when you launch the extension for the first time and how to interpret the initial data shown.

## 1. Accessing uBO Scope After Installation

Once you have installed uBO Scope from your browser's official extension or add-on store (refer to the [Install uBO Scope](/getting-started/installation-basics/extension-installation) page for step-by-step installation), follow these instructions to launch the extension:

### Step-by-Step

1. **Locate the Extension Icon:**
   - Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It typically appears as a shield or similar privacy-related logo.
   - If the icon is not visible immediately, click the extensions menu (usually a puzzle-piece icon) and pin uBO Scope for easy access.

2. **Click the Icon to Open the Popup Panel:**
   - Clicking the icon opens the uBO Scope popup panel right beneath it.
   - This popup is your real-time dashboard for monitoring third-party connections made by the active browser tab.

### Verification

After opening the popup:
- You should see the hostname of the current active tab near the top.
- Below, there will be a summary area and sections showing domains categorized by connection outcomes.

<Tip>
If the popup displays "NO DATA" or is blank, try refreshing the current web page to allow uBO Scope to gather connection data for that tab.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface

The popup panel is designed to give you a clear and immediate view of all outgoing connections originating from the webpage you are currently viewing.

### Key Sections Explained

- **Hostname Display:**
  - At the very top, you’ll see the hostname and domain of the active tab.
  - Example: For the URL `https://example.com/page`, it shows `example.com` plus any subdomain parts.

- **Summary Section:**
  - Displays the total count of distinct third-party domains the page connected to under the label "domains connected".
  - This number reflects all outgoing connections that were _not_ blocked.

- **Connection Outcome Sections:**
  uBO Scope categorizes connections into three groups, each shown in its own section:

  1. **Not Blocked:**
     - Lists domains where connections succeeded.
     - These are third-party servers contacted by the page that were allowed through.

  2. **Stealth-Blocked:**
     - Lists domains for connections that were intercepted and stealthily redirected or blocked.
     - This often includes requests prevented by content blocking that tries to be less obvious to websites.

  3. **Blocked:**
     - Lists domains where connection attempts were outright blocked and failed.
     - These usually tie directly to active content blocking rules that prevented the request.

- **Domain and Count Rows:**
  - Within each section, domains are listed alongside a count showing how many times connections were made to these domains during the page load.

### Visual Behavior

- The interface updates dynamically as you browse and switch tabs.
- The badge on the browser toolbar also reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains, giving you continuous awareness even without opening the popup.

<Info>
The popup panel uses real-time data pulled from the browser's network requests, ensuring that the information you see accurately represents current page activity.

## 3. First Launch Tips

To get the best initial experience:

- **Open a fresh webpage or refresh the current tab** after installing to trigger the collection of connection data.
- **Click the uBO Scope icon often** as you browse to monitor how different websites connect to third-party servers.
- **Observe the badge count on the toolbar icon**—a lower count signifies fewer distinct third-party connections, which typically means better privacy protection.

<Check>
Make sure you have granted the required permissions during installation, such as `webRequest` and `activeTab`, for uBO Scope to operate correctly.
</Check>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common First-Launch Issues

- **Popup shows no data or does not update:**
  - Refresh the tab and reopen the popup.
  - Check that the extension is enabled and not disabled or restricted by your browser.
  - Verify permissions are correctly granted (see [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](/getting-started/setup-support/troubleshooting-setup)).

- **Badge does not appear on the toolbar icon:**
  - Ensure your browser allows displaying badges for extensions.
  - Confirm uBO Scope has been installed from the official store and updated to the latest version.

- **Extension icon missing:**
  - Pin the extension icon from the extensions menu.
  - Restart your browser if the icon does not appear after installation.

<Tip>
If issues persist, consult the setup troubleshooting guide or the community at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope
