# Quick Validation Checklist

Ensure your uBO Scope installation is functioning correctly with this straightforward checklist. Validate that the extension detects remote server connections, updates badge counts accurately, and reflects real-time changes during your browsing sessions.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation

1. **Locate uBO Scope Icon**
   - After installation, verify that the uBO Scope icon appears in your browser's toolbar.
   - The icon displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted on the current tab.

2. **Enable Permissions**
   - Make sure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions: activeTab, storage, and webRequest.
   - Without these, it cannot monitor network requests or update counts.

<Tip>
If the icon is missing or does not respond, revisit the installation steps or review browser extension settings to ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
</Tip>

## 2. Validate Initial Data Capture

1. **Open uBO Scope Popup**
   - Click the toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
   - The popup displays the current tab's hostname and the summarized domains.

2. **Check Badge Count and Domain List**
   - The badge count on the toolbar icon should show a number representing distinct third-party domains.
   - Inside the popup, domains are sorted into three sections:
     - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains that loaded resources successfully.
     - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where requests were stealthily blocked.
     - **Blocked**: Domains where requests were explicitly blocked or failed.

3. **Interact with Web Pages**
   - Browse to a variety of websites to trigger network requests.
   - Confirm the badge count updates with the number of unique domains contacted.
   - Verify the popup's domain lists update in real time.

<Note>
A zero or missing badge count means no third-party remote servers have been detected on the active tab.
</Note>

## 3. Real-Time Update Verification

1. **Open Multiple Tabs**
   - Switch between tabs with different websites.
   - Confirm that each tab's badge count shows values specific to that tab’s network activity.

2. **Refresh Tabs**
   - Reload pages and observe the badge count and popup data updating promptly.

3. **Close Tabs**
   - Close tabs and check that associated data and badge counts are cleared promptly.

<Tip>
uBO Scope maintains per-tab session data to provide accurate and isolated monitoring.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Fixes">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Appearing or Not Updating">
- Ensure browser version meets minimum requirements, especially for browsers like Safari.
- Verify extension permissions are granted.
- Reload the browser or reinstall the extension.
- Check that content blockers don’t restrict uBO Scope’s access to webRequest API.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists">
- Confirm the active tab contains network requests.
- Navigate to a different website and try again.
- Check for browser console errors related to uBO Scope.
- Restart the browser to reset extension state.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpectedly High or Low Counts">
- Understand the badge counts reflect distinct third-party remote servers contacted.
- Higher counts may indicate more third-party content or less aggressive blocking.
- Lower counts typically mean fewer third parties contacted, which can be desirable.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Summary and Next Steps

- **Success Indicators**:
  - Toolbar icon displays dynamic badge counts matching active tab activity.
  - Popup panel lists domains correctly categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
  - Data updates immediately upon navigation, reloads, and tab switches.

- **Next Steps**:
  - Review the [Launching and Using uBO Scope]( /getting-started/first-run-and-configuration/launching-ubo-scope) page to deepen understanding of the UI and workflows.
  - Explore detailed interpretation guides under the Guides tab, particularly [Understanding the Badge and Popup Data]( /guides/interpreting-results/badge-meanings).
  - Consult troubleshooting documentation if you encounter persistent issues: [Troubleshooting Installation & First-Run Issues]( /getting-started/troubleshooting/common-installation-issues).

## Appendix: Example Walkthrough Scenario

1. **Install uBO Scope** from your browser's official extension marketplace.
2. **Open a Website** such as `https://example.com`.
3. **Observe the Badge** on the uBO Scope icon, which should show a number (e.g., `3`).
4. **Click the Icon** to open the popup.
5. **Check the Lists:**
   - The 'not blocked' section lists domains from which content was successfully fetched.
   - The 'stealth-blocked' section may be empty or list domains where stealth blocking was detected.
   - The 'blocked' section lists domains where requests failed or were blocked.
6. **Switch to Another Tab** and verify a different badge count.
7. **Refresh the Page** to see dynamic updates.

This hands-on flow conclusively confirms installation, permission granting, real-time monitoring, and UI function.
