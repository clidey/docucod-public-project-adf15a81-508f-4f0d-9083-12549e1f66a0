# Quick Validation & Troubleshooting

Ensure your uBO Scope extension is functioning correctly with this guide. It walks you through validating the extension’s operation on real webpages, highlights common issues you might encounter after installation, and provides clear solutions—all aimed at empowering you to confirm that uBO Scope is accurately reporting network activity.

---

## 1. Validating uBO Scope on a Webpage

Follow these steps to confirm uBO Scope is measuring network requests as expected:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Supported Browser">
Use one of the supported browsers where uBO Scope is installed: Chromium (version 122.0+), Firefox (version 128.0+), or Safari (version 18.5+).
</Step>
<Step title="Navigate to a Real-World Website">
Go to any commonly used website (e.g., https://www.wikipedia.org).

<u>Why here?</u> These sites have typical third-party connections, making them ideal for real-world validation.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon (displaying the uBO Scope logo). This action opens the extension popup, where you'll see connection details.


- The popup shows the current tab's hostname and domain.
- It categorizes connections into **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** third-party domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Summary & Domains">
- The summary displays the number of distinct connected third-party domains.
- The connections are grouped:
  - **Not blocked**: third-party servers your browser successfully connected to.
  - **Stealth-blocked**: connections blocked silently by other content blockers.
  - **Blocked**: connections blocked and reported directly.


Observe that these numbers update dynamically as the page loads.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Toolbar Badge">
Look at the badge count on the uBO Scope icon. It indicates the number of distinct third-party domains connected on the active tab.


A smaller badge count indicates fewer third-party connections; this is typically desirable for privacy.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
If the popup and badge update in real-time with third-party connection data, uBO Scope is operational.
If you see "NO DATA" or an empty summary, refer to the troubleshooting section below.
</Check>

## 2. Common Issues and How to Resolve Them

### Issue: No Data Displayed in the Popup

- **Cause**: Extension may not have initialized correctly.

- **Resolution:**
  1. Refresh the webpage to trigger reloading of network request data.
  2. Ensure the tab you are viewing is active and properly loaded.
  3. Confirm that you have not disabled the extension on this site or in your browser.
  4. If problem persists, restart the browser to reload the extension's background service.

### Issue: Badge Count Shows Zero or Incorrect Count

- **Cause**: Permissions or host access might be restricted.

- **Resolution:**
  1. Verify uBO Scope permissions in your browser’s extensions settings. It must have permissions for `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
  2. Ensure the browser is at or above the minimum version required:
     - Chromium-based browsers: 122.0+
     - Firefox: 128.0+
     - Safari: 18.5+
  3. Confirm your browser is not blocking extension access to network requests.

### Issue: No Badge Appears on the Toolbar Icon

- **Cause**: The icon may be hidden.

- **Resolution:**
  1. Make sure uBO Scope’s icon is visible in the browser toolbar.
  2. Pin the extension icon via your browser’s extension management UI.
  3. Refresh the page to update the badge.

### Issue: Popup Loads but Lists No Domains

- **Cause**: The webpage may not have active third-party network connections.

- **Resolution:**
  1. Test on other popular websites known to load external resources.
  2. Confirm that other content blockers are not preventing network connection data from reaching uBO Scope.

### General Troubleshooting Tips

- **Restart the Browser:** Sometimes stale states affect extension behavior.
- **Reinstall uBO Scope:** Remove and reinstall from the official browser extension store.
- **Check for Conflicting Extensions:** Other extensions may interfere with webRequest APIs.
- **Verify Network Conditions:** Private browsing or restrictive network environments may affect data reporting.

<Warning>
If network requests are made outside the scope of the browser's webRequest API (rare), uBO Scope cannot report them.
</Warning>

## 3. Best Practices for Early Success

- Use websites with known third-party connections to verify functionality.
- Combine observations from the uBO Scope badge count and popup report for comprehensive understanding.
- Keep your browser updated for the best compatibility.
- Avoid relying solely on synthetic test sites that create artificial network requests; prefer real-world scenarios.

---

## 4. Understanding Your Validation Outcome

- A **low badge count** with meaningful domain lists in the popup indicates your content blockers are effectively limiting third-party connections.
- Seeing **blocked and stealth-blocked** domains confirms uBO Scope detects and categorizes network filtering properly.

## 5. Next Steps

- If validation succeeds, proceed to explore the [Understanding the Toolbar Badge](../understanding-the-badge) documentation to interpret badge counts effectively.
- For installation help or reinstalling, visit the [Installing uBO Scope](../../installation-and-prerequisites/installing-ubo-scope) guide.
- If you want to deepen your insight into the data shown, see [Interpreting Third-Party Connection Data](../../../guides/analyzing-network-activity/interpreting-results).

## 6. Troubleshooting Summary

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting Questions">
<Accordion title="Why does the popup show 'NO DATA'?">
Make sure you've refreshed the page after installing uBO Scope. If the problem persists after refreshing, restart your browser. The extension waits until it gathers some network data before displaying.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The badge shows 0 but the page loads content normally. Is this a problem?">
This may happen if the extension lacks permissions or the browser version is below minimum requirements. Verify permissions and browser version. Also, confirm that no other blockers are preventing uBO Scope from observing network data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The popup loads, but domain counts don't update during navigation."
>
Ensure you're viewing an active tab and that uBO Scope is enabled for that tab. Reloading the page usually triggers fresh data collection.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I see conflicting data between uBO Scope and other blockers. What should I trust?">
uBO Scope counts distinct third-party connections regardless of blocks, providing a more transparent network footprint view. High block counts in other tools do not necessarily mean better blocking efficacy.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Validation is a powerful first step in gaining confidence in your content blocking strategy. Use uBO Scope regularly to monitor third-party connections and understand your privacy landscape better.
</Tip>
