# Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The toolbar badge in uBO Scope is your real-time privacy dashboard, providing an immediate, insightful count of distinct third-party remote servers your current webpage has connected to. This count is the heart of what uBO Scope measures: the network footprint of third-party connections across the web page you're browsing.

---

## 1. What the Badge Represents

- **Distinct third-party servers:** The number displayed reflects how many unique third-party domains your browser has contacted while loading the active tab.
- **Focus on third-party domains:** First-party connections (to the main site you visit) are excluded, highlighting the external web of requests.
- **Connection outcomes considered:** The badge counts only those third-party servers that successfully established a connection or were allowed, regardless of other request statuses.

### Why This Matters

The badge count is a measure of your exposure footprint on the current website. A **lower number is better**, indicating fewer external servers your browsing session involves. Many privacy-conscious users aim to keep third-party connections to a minimum.


## 2. How the Badge Works Behind the Scenes (User-Centric View)

When you navigate to a website, uBO Scope listens to the browser’s network events and:

- Records all network requests initiated by the page.
- Classifies requests by their **outcome** (allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked).
- Extracts the domain of each third-party host.
- Maintains a collection of unique domains contacted.
- Updates the badge count dynamically as the page loads and loads additional content or resources.

This means whenever you switch tabs or reload a page, the badge updates to reflect the latest count of distinct third-party domains connected.

## 3. Interpreting the Badge Number

| Badge Number Meaning                    | What to Expect / Do                                    |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **0 or Blank**                        | No third-party connections detected. Ideal scenario. |
| **Low number (1-5)**                   | Minimal external connections. Good privacy hygiene.  |
| **Medium number (6-20)**               | Moderate third-party connections, possibly typical for content-rich pages or large sites. Review if concerned. |
| **High number (20+)**                  | Many external connections. You may consider additional blocking or reevaluate site trustworthiness. |

## 4. Practical Examples

- **Visiting a news website:** You might see a badge of 10 or more, reflecting ads, trackers, CDNs, and social widgets.
- **Accessing a simple blog or documentation site:** Often, you will see a badge between 0 and 3, showing minimal third-party requests.
- **Browsing privacy-friendly sites:** Badge usually remains low, indicating limited tracking or advertising.

### What Badge Changes Tell You

- An increasing badge number while navigating through a site usually shows additional third-party resources are loading.
- A sudden drop (or zero) might indicate blocking mechanisms are effectively preventing those connections.

## 5. Common Questions & Guidance

### Why does my block count not show on the badge?

The badge count reflects the **number of unique third-party domains connected**, not the count of blocked requests. Even if a request is blocked, it may not create a new third-party connection.

### Is a higher badge number always bad?

Not necessarily. Some third-party domains are essential (e.g., content delivery networks). Understand that **not all third parties are malicious or tracking**. The badge provides visibility so you can make informed decisions.

### Can I see details behind the badge number?

Yes — clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon opens a popup listing the domains grouped by their connection outcome:

- **Allowed** — connections permitted and observed
- **Stealth-blocked** — connections prevented silently
- **Blocked** — connections actively blocked with error outcomes

This detailed view helps you understand the sources contributing to the badge count.

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- Use the badge for a quick **privacy health check** of the current site.
- Combine badge insights with the popup panel for full network visibility.
- Regularly compare badge counts as you visit sites to recognize patterns or changes.
- Remember that **fewer third-party connections** generally improve privacy and security.

## 7. Troubleshooting Badge Issues

If the badge does not update or behaves unexpectedly:

- Ensure uBO Scope is correctly installed and enabled in your browser.
- Reload the tab or switch tabs to refresh the badge.
- Verify your browser version meets the minimum requirements (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Disable conflicting extensions temporarily to rule out interference.
- Consult the [Quick Validation & Troubleshooting](../quick-validation-troubleshooting) guide for detailed steps.
