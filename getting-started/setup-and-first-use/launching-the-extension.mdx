# Launching and Accessing uBO Scope

This guide helps you quickly locate, open, and understand the initial display of the uBO Scope browser extension popup. After installation, you want to verify that uBO Scope is correctly active and immediately gain insights into the network connections of the current webpage.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

uBO Scope integrates into your browser toolbar as an icon. Follow these steps to access its interface:

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Icon in Your Browser Toolbar">
The extension icon uses the uBO Scope logo. It typically appears near the address bar or among your other extensions.

- **Chrome/Chromium-based browsers:** Look for the icon beside the address bar or in the “Extensions” puzzle piece menu.
- **Firefox:** The icon is in the toolbar; you may also find it in the overflow panel if not pinned.
- **Safari:** The icon appears in the toolbar once enabled.

If the icon is not visible, check your browser’s extension management page to ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
</Step>

<Step title="Click the uBO Scope Icon">
Click the icon once to open the uBO Scope popup window.

> This popup provides a snapshot of all network connections associated with the active tab.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Initial Display

When you open the popup, uBO Scope immediately presents an organized view of third-party domains connecting to the current webpage.

### Main Components You Will See

- **Page Hostname (Header Section):** Shows the domain of the current webpage you’re visiting.

- **Domains Connected Summary:** Displays the number of distinct third-party domains connected.

- **Outcome Sections:** Three clear categories list the domains based on network request outcomes:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains allowed to connect.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains whose connections were stealth-blocked (blocks that are hidden from detection by the webpage).
  - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked.

### How Domains and Counts Are Presented

- Each domain is shown with its count representing how many requests involved it.
- Domain names are displayed in user-friendly Unicode to clarify internationalized domain names.

### Visual Indicators

- The popup uses simple headings and lists for clarity.
- If your browser window is narrow, the popup layout adapts to fit the viewport.

## 3. What Happens Behind the Scenes?

The extension analyzes the network requests of the current active tab and categorizes them before displaying the results:

1. **Hostname Identification:** It detects the active tab's hostname and domain.
2. **Classification:** Requests are split into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories.
3. **Counting Distinct Domains:** Counts how many unique third-party domains fall into each category.
4. **Rendering:** Displays these details in the popup asynchronously to minimize delay.

---

## 4. Practical Tips

- **Refresh the Popup:** The data displayed corresponds to the current tab’s network activity. Reload the tab or revisit the popup after navigating to see fresh data.

- **Interpreting Counts:** Remember, a lower number of connected third-party domains typically indicates better privacy protection.

- **Popup Visibility:** If you see 'NO DATA' or empty lists, ensure you’re on a loaded page that makes network requests and that uBO Scope is enabled.

- **Unicode Domains:** Sometimes domains appear in encoded form; uBO Scope shows the decoded, readable version for clarity.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Display">
<Accordion title="The Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists">
- Ensure you have navigated to a website that actively loads external resources.
- Verify uBO Scope is enabled and permissions are granted.
- Refresh the browser tab and reopen the popup.
- Check that no other extensions interfere with network requests.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup Does Not Open When Clicking the Icon">
- Confirm that the extension installation succeeded.
- Restart your browser to reload extensions.
- Check extension management settings to verify uBO Scope is enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Domain Counts or Names Appear Incorrectly">
- Some pages use dynamically generated or transient domains; counts may fluctuate.
- Internationalized domain names are shown in Unicode for readability.
- If unexpected domains appear, cross-check with your content blocker and DNS settings.
</Accordion>

## 6. Next Steps After Launching uBO Scope

After confidently accessing and interpreting the popup, consider exploring:

- [Understanding the Toolbar Badge](/getting-started/setup-and-first-use/understanding-the-badge) to learn how the badge complements the popup information.
- [Analyzing Network Activity Guides](/guides/analyzing-network-activity/interpreting-results) to deepen your insight into third-party connections.
- [Installation and Setup Guides](/getting-started/installation-and-prerequisites/installing-ubo-scope) if you need to revisit installation steps.

## Additional Information

uBO Scope runs in all supported browsers with a consistent popup experience. The popup is implemented as `popup.html` and powered by `popup.js`, which fetches and presents real-time data for the active tab.

You can view the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/tree/main) to understand the implementation details or contribute.
