# First Use: Validating Extension Functionality

Welcome to the first operational validation of **uBO Scope**! This guide helps you test the extension immediately after installation by showing how to interpret the toolbar badge and the popup content to confirm that uBO Scope is actively monitoring network connections.

---

## 1. Understanding the Purpose of This Validation

uBO Scope is designed to reveal all network connections a webpage makes with remote servers, categorizing them as **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked**. Your first step after installation is to verify it is working as intended — meaning it can observe and report connection attempts in real time.

The extension reflects this information through:

- **Toolbar badge count**: Number of distinct third-party domains connected to.
- **Popup panel**: Detailed categorization of domains contacted.

This validation ensures uBO Scope is correctly tracking networking activity within your browser tab.

---

## 2. Confirming uBO Scope Is Monitoring Connections

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

- After installation, look for the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar.
- The icon looks like a shield with the uBO Scope logo.

### Step 2: Observe the Toolbar Badge

- The badge number shows the **count of distinct third-party domains** your current tab connected to.
- An empty or zero badge means no connections detected.

> <Tip>
> The badge count **only includes third-party domains** — those different from the page's own domain.
> </Tip>

### Step 3: Open the Popup Panel

- Click the toolbar icon to open the popup.
- The popup displays detailed connection information for the active tab:
  - **Domains connected:** Total number of domains connected, matching the badge count.
  - **Not blocked:** Domains with successful network connections.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where connections were redirected or stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.

The popup gives domain names alongside connection counts.

## 3. Testing With Real Browsing Activity

### Step 1: Open a Well-Known Website

- Navigate to a popular website with typical third-party content, such as a news site or an online store.

### Step 2: Watch for Badge Updates

- Observe the badge number increment as the page loads and connections are made.
- Wait a few seconds to allow all requests to finish.

### Step 3: Inspect the Popup Details

- Open the popup again to confirm domains shown match known third parties such as content delivery networks (CDNs) or analytic services.

### Step 4: Verify Domain Categories

- **Allowed**: Domains from which content loaded normally.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Connections that were redirected or invisibly blocked.
- **Blocked**: Explicitly blocked domains.

This validation demonstrates uBO Scope's visibility into real-world connection outcomes.

## 4. Interpreting Typical Scenarios

| Scenario                          | Expected Behavior                                              | How To Confirm                                                   |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| No third-party activity          | Badge shows no number (empty)                                 | Popup shows 'domains connected: 0'; no domains in lists         |
| Site with typical third-parties  | Badge increments with connection count                        | Popup lists connected domains under 'not blocked' and others    |
| Content blocking enabled elsewhere| Stealth-blocked or blocked domains appear in popup, badge reduced| Popup shows domains under 'stealth-blocked' or 'blocked' lists  |

> <Note>
> Badge count reflects **distinct domains**, not total network requests.
> Reduce clutter by focusing on third-party domains your browser contacts.
> </Note>

---

## 5. What the Toolbar Badge Means

- The badge number reports the count of distinct **allowed** remote third-party domains.
- A **lower** badge count indicates **fewer third-party connections**, which generally means better privacy.
- The badge does **not** count blocked connections.

> <Tip>
> If the badge count increases compared to a previous visit, it may mean the website or your filters are allowing more third-party content.
> </Tip>

## 6. Quick Troubleshooting Tips

| Issue                          | Possible Cause                                         | Solution                                                      |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Badge shows zero on all sites | Extension might not have the necessary permissions    | Ensure uBO Scope permissions are enabled for all URLs          |
| Popup remains empty or shows NO DATA | Network requests not detected or session data not recorded | Refresh the tab; ensure network requests are not bypassing extension; restart browser if issue persists |
| Badge count doesn't update    | Network listener inactive or browser restrictions     | Confirm extension is enabled and not disabled by browser policies |

If issues persist, see the troubleshooting documentation page for detailed help.

## 7. Summary

After installation, validating uBO Scope involves:

1. Checking for the toolbar icon and badge count.
2. Opening the popup to observe domains with connection outcomes.
3. Visiting a typical site to see badge updates and domain reports.
4. Understanding the meaning of counts and domain categories.

Successful validation confirms uBO Scope is monitoring your browser's remote server connections accurately, empowering you with clear insight into third-party network activity for better privacy awareness.

<Check>
Ensure you have uBO Scope installed and enabled. Use the toolbar icon badge and popup as your immediate tools to confirm monitoring functionality.
</Check>

<Info>
Remember, uBO Scope observes network requests made through your browser’s standard webRequest API and reflects real-world third-party connections regardless of other content blockers.
