# Troubleshooting Installation & Setup

This guide addresses common setup issues encountered with uBO Scope, including missing UI elements, permission prompts, and inaccurate badge counts. It provides practical, step-by-step resolutions to help you diagnose and fix problems preventing the extension from activating or displaying expected information.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation and Activation

Before diving into deeper troubleshooting, verify that uBO Scope is properly installed and activated in your browser.

### Steps to Verify:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon:**
   - In Chromium and Firefox: Check the browser toolbar for the uBO Scope icon (default icon looks like a shield).
   - In Safari: Confirm the extension is enabled via Safari > Settings > Extensions.

2. **Check permissions and prompts:**
   - Upon first install, the browser may request permissions to access websites and web requests. Ensure you accept these to enable full functionality.

3. **Reload your browser or restart it**
   - Sometimes the extension activates only after a restart.

4. **Open the popup UI:**
   - Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup panel. If the popup does not open or is blank, the extension might not be running correctly.

## 2. Troubleshoot Missing UI Elements or Popup Issues

If the popup panel shows no data or fails to display expected connection counts and domains:

### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Ensure a page is loaded in an active tab:**
   - uBO Scope shows data only for the active tab. Open a web page with network activity.

2. **Reload the active tab:**
   - The extension collects network events per page load. Reloading the page triggers monitoring anew.

3. **Check for conflicting extensions or browser settings:**
   - Some browser settings or extensions may block webRequest or interfere with the extension’s operation.

4. **Verify extension background script is running:**
   - In Chromium, navigate to ‘chrome://extensions/’ and check uBO Scope’s service worker status.
   - In Firefox, check about:addons > Debug and see the background script status.

5. **Clear browser cache and storage related to the extension:**
   - Go to browser settings and clear cache or stored data which may cause stale data display.

6. **Close and reopen the popup:**
   - Sometimes UI glitches clear after re-opening.

## 3. Addressing Permission Prompts or Denied Access

uBO Scope requires certain permissions to monitor network requests accurately. Missing or denied permissions lead to incomplete or no data.

### How to Ensure Permissions are Granted:

1. **Review extension permissions:**
   - Check the permissions list (e.g., activeTab, webRequest, storage) within your browser’s extension management UI.
   - Ensure host permissions allow access to the sites you are browsing.

2. **Grant permission when prompted:**
   - Some browsers prompt for site access dynamically. Confirm these when they appear.

3. **Manually enable permissions:**
   - In Chromium, click ‘Details’ on uBO Scope extension and toggle site access to ‘On all sites’. 
   - In Firefox and Safari, adjust permissions similarly, often found under extension details.

4. **Reinstall if permissions seem locked or corrupted:**
   - Uninstall and reinstall the extension and approve permissions during setup.

## 4. Fix Inaccurate or Missing Badge Counts

The badge count on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct third-party domains contacted on the active tab. If this count is zero or incorrect:

### Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Reload the current webpage:**
   - Badge updates happen on page load; refreshing page triggers recalculations.

2. **Verify network activity:**
   - Some pages have few or no third-party connections; test on a site known to load multiple third-party resources.

3. **Check if the extension is blocked or disabled on the site:**
   - Browser site-specific settings sometimes block extensions.

4. **Check for race conditions:**
   - Badge updates are applied asynchronously; wait a few seconds after loading a page.

5. **Verify browser compatibility and version:**
   - Ensure your browser version meets minimum requirements (Chromium 122.0+, Firefox 128.0+, Safari 18.5+).

## 5. Advanced Diagnostic Steps

If problems persist after applying the above fixes, try these deeper diagnosis actions:

### Check the Browser Console for Errors:

- Open Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) and switch to the Console tab.
- Look for errors related to uBO Scope or extension scripts.
- Common errors include permission denial, script loading failures, or unexpected exceptions.

### Verify Background Script Operation:

- In Chromium, go to `chrome://extensions/`, click on “Service Worker” link under uBO Scope to inspect logs.
- In Firefox, use `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` to inspect extension background pages.

### Clear Extension Storage Manually:

You can reset stored session data which might be corrupt:

```javascript
// Open the browser console and run:

browser.storage.local.clear().then(() => {
    console.log('uBO Scope storage cleared.');
});
```

*Note*: This requires some comfort with browser developer tools.

### Disable Conflicting Extensions Temporarily:

- Try disabling other privacy or network monitoring extensions that may overlap.

### Reinstall the Extension:

- Remove uBO Scope completely and install it fresh from the official store.
