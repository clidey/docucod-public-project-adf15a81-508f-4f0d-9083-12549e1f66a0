# Quick Validation Checklist for uBO Scope

Ensure uBO Scope is running correctly by following this concise checklist. Within minutes of installation, you can confirm the extension is active, the popup interface is displaying live connection data, and the badge count reflects the current network activity in your browser tab.

---

## 1. Confirm uBO Scope is Installed and Active

- Look for the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser’s extension bar.
- The icon should display the uBO Scope logo (a stylized shield).
- Hover over the icon to verify the tooltip reads "uBO Scope".

<Tip>
If the icon is not visible, check your browser’s extension management page to confirm uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
</Tip>

## 2. Validate Toolbar Badge Count Reflects Network Activity

- Open a new browser tab and visit a commonly used website (such as https://example.com).
- Observe the badge on the uBO Scope icon: it should show a number representing distinct third-party remote servers connected by that tab.
- A number greater than zero indicates active network requests are being monitored.

<Note>
A badge with no number or blank means no third-party connections detected for the active tab.
</Note>

## 3. Open and Inspect the Popup Interface

1. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
2. Verify the header shows the domain of the active tab. For example, if you opened https://example.com, the header should display "example.com" or its Unicode equivalent.
3. Below the header, check the "domains connected" count; it must match or be close to the badge count.
4. Review the three connection categories listed:
   - **Not blocked:** Domains from which resources loaded successfully.
   - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains with requests redirected or stealth blocked by content blockers.
   - **Blocked:** Domains actively blocked from connecting.
5. Each list shows domain names alongside a count of connection attempts.

<Tip>
Domains are displayed in Unicode format for easy reading, even if punycode was originally used.
</Tip>

## 4. Verify Dynamic Updates After Navigations

- Navigate to a different web page in the same tab.
- Reopen the popup and ensure the domain and counts refresh to reflect the new page’s third-party connections.

<Warning>
If the popup does not update on navigation, refresh the page or close and reopen the tab to reset monitoring.
</Warning>

## 5. Additional Checks and Troubleshooting

- **If Badge Count Remains Empty or Static:**
  - Confirm uBO Scope has the required permissions to monitor web requests.
  - Verify you have navigated to an HTTP or HTTPS site (some protocols may not be tracked).

- **If Popup Shows "NO DATA":**
  - Reload the tab and reopen the popup.
  - Check browser console for errors related to uBO Scope.

- **If Counts Seem Excessively High:**
  - Review known third-party domains to identify legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs).
  - Compare with results on well-known clean sites for context.
