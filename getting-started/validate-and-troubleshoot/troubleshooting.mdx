# Troubleshooting Installation & Common Issues

This guide helps you swiftly identify and resolve frequent problems encountered during the first-time setup and use of **uBO Scope**. Whether you notice missing icons, permission prompts, an empty popup, or a badge count that doesn’t update, this page provides clear, actionable troubleshooting steps tailored to your browser environment.

## 1. Toolbar Icon and Badge Not Visible

The uBO Scope extension’s icon and badge are essential for monitoring third-party connections per tab. If these are missing or not updating, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Confirm Installation
- Verify that uBO Scope is installed from the official source:
  - **Chrome/Chromium:** Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
  - **Firefox:** Install from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
  - **Safari:** Requires Safari 18.5 or newer. Confirm from official Safari Extensions store.

### Step 2: Check Browser Compatibility and Version
- Minimum browser versions are required for proper operation (e.g., Safari 18.5+, Firefox 128.0+, Chromium 122.0+).
- Updating your browser may resolve icon problems.

### Step 3: Ensure Extension is Enabled
- Go to your browser’s extension management page.
- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled and not disabled or removed.

### Step 4: Verify Toolbar Visibility
- Some browsers hide extensions by default:
  - In Chrome, click the puzzle piece icon and pin uBO Scope.
  - In Firefox, customize your toolbar to show the icon.
  - In Safari, check the Safari Extensions preferences.

### Step 5: Restart Browser
- Fully close and reopen your browser to ensure extension background scripts load correctly.

<Warning>
Disabling other extensions temporarily can rule out conflicts causing icon disappearance.
</Warning>

## 2. Permission Prompts and Network Request Access

uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor network requests across websites:

### Understanding Permissions
- Permissions requested:
  - `activeTab`: Access information of the active browser tab.
  - `storage`: Store and retrieve data locally.
  - `webRequest`: Monitor network requests (key to uBO Scope functionality).
- Host permissions cover HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket protocols.

### Granting Permissions
- Confirm you granted these permissions when installing.
- If you missed a prompt or unintentionally denied permission:
  - Chrome/Chromium: Re-enable permissions in the extension details.
  - Firefox: Manage permissions on about:addons.
  - Safari: Manage preferences under Safari Extensions.

<Note>
Without webRequest permission, uBO Scope cannot track network connections, resulting in empty data and badge non-updates.
</Note>

## 3. Popup Window Shows 'NO DATA' or No Domains

When you click the uBO Scope icon, the popup should display a summary of domains connected by the active tab. If this section shows 'NO DATA' or remains empty:

### Step 1: Confirm Active Tab Has Loaded
- uBO Scope gathers network data only for the currently active tab.
- Ensure you have navigated to a website (not a browser internal page).

### Step 2: Wait for Data Refresh
- The extension batches network data and updates asynchronously.
- Reload the webpage to trigger network events afresh.

### Step 3: Reload the Extension
- Navigate to your browser’s extension page and reload uBO Scope.
- This resets the extension and clears stale data.

### Step 4: Check for Browser Restrictions
- Private or incognito mode may restrict data access depending on browser settings.
- Allow uBO Scope to operate in incognito/private windows if needed.

### Step 5: Verify That Network Monitoring Is Supported
- uBO Scope relies on the `webRequest` API.
- Some browsers or configurations block this API from extensions.

<Info>
In Safari, strict minimum version 18.5 is critical for the extension’s background service to function.
</Info>

## 4. Badge Count Not Updating or Showing Zero

The badge shows the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected by the current tab. If it stays at zero despite browsing:

### Step 1: Reload Webpage
- Refresh the active tab to regenerate network connections.

### Step 2: Verify No Conflicting Content Blockers
- Some privacy extensions may interfere or block network events.
- Consider temporarily disabling other content blockers to test.

### Step 3: Confirm Background Service is Running
- The badge updates only when the background service is active and processes requests.
- Restart your browser if necessary.

### Step 4: Check Network Conditions
- Ensure your internet connection is active and the webpage loads resources.

<Warning>
Private browsing or certain browser security policies may prevent the extension from detecting network requests.
</Warning>

## 5. Browser-Specific Troubleshooting Tips

### Chrome / Chromium
- Ensure minimum Chrome version 122.0+.
- The extension uses a service worker; browser must not throttle or disable service workers.
- Clear cached data or disable extensions with similar webRequest permissions.

### Firefox
- Minimum Firefox 128.0 required.
- Verify the extension’s ID matches `uBO-Scope@raymondhill.net`.
- Check that the extension is allowed in private browsing if needed.

### Safari
- Requires Safari 18.5 or later.
- Safari extensions behave differently; ensure the extension background script (module type) is enabled.
- If icons are missing, verify extension settings in Safari's Extensions preferences.

## 6. Additional Tips & Best Practices

- **Refresh often:** Network requests may only be recorded after page reload.
- **Use the latest version:** Keeping uBO Scope current maximizes compatibility.
- **Inspect popup details:** The popup lists allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains, providing clues on what the extension sees.
- **Permissions matter:** Without host and webRequest permissions, data won’t display.
