# First Launch and Basic Configuration

Welcome to **uBO Scope**! This guide will walk you through what to expect the very first time you open the extension, how to access its main interface, and how to understand its core panel. Importantly, **no special configuration is necessary** to start benefiting from uBO Scope’s powerful network connection insights immediately.

## 1. Opening uBO Scope for the First Time

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to reveal all remote server connections your browser makes during web browsing. To get started:

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Extension Icon">
Find the uBO Scope icon in your browser's extension toolbar. It typically displays the uBO Scope logo.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Icon to Open the Popup Panel">
Clicking the icon opens the uBO Scope popup, presenting the summarized network connections related to the active tab.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If you do not see the extension icon, make sure the extension is installed and enabled in your browser. Refer to the installation documentation for help.
</Note>

## 2. Permissions Review

On the first launch, your browser might prompt you to review or grant permissions.

- **Required permissions** include access to active tabs, storage, and webRequest APIs.
- These permissions enable uBO Scope to monitor network requests and display connection outcomes accurately.

<Warning>
Denying required permissions will limit uBO Scope's functionality. Ensure you allow these permissions for full visibility.
</Warning>

## 3. Exploring the Core Popup Panel

Once opened, the popup panel gives you a real-time, tab-specific overview of connections grouped into three categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains your browser successfully connected to.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains for which connections were intentionally hidden.
- **Blocked:** Domains where network requests were blocked.

### Popup Panel Layout

The popup contains:

- The active tab's hostname shown at the top prominently.
- A summary showing the count of distinct domains connected.
- Separate sections listing domains for each outcome category, each with the connection count.

### How Data is Displayed

- Domains are displayed in Unicode to enhance readability, even for internationalized domain names.
- Counts reflect how many times a domain was involved in network connections.

## 4. Immediate Value and User Expectations

You do not need to configure anything to start using uBO Scope:

- The extension automatically listens to network requests made by the browser for your active tab.
- Real-time updates and data summaries appear instantly in the popup when you open it.

### Practical Tips

- Focus on the **not blocked** section to see what your browser allowed.
- The **blocked** and **stealth-blocked** lists help identify what content blockers or privacy features prevented.
- A low count in the badge number on the toolbar icon is generally better, indicating fewer third-party connections.
