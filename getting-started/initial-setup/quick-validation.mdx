# Validating Extension is Working

Ensure that uBO Scope is properly monitoring network requests in your browser to gain accurate real-time visibility into third-party connections. This guide walks you through simple steps to confirm the extension’s active monitoring status, interpret the toolbar badge, and explore the popup UI that summarizes allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

---

## 1. Confirm uBO Scope is Installed and Active

Before validating, verify that the extension is correctly installed and enabled in your browser:

- **Chrome/Chromium:** Go to `chrome://extensions` and ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
- **Firefox:** Open `about:addons` and confirm uBO Scope is enabled.
- **Safari:** Check Safari Extensions preferences and make sure uBO Scope is active.

<Tip>
If the extension is not showing or appears disabled, reinstall it from the official source for your browser.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Understand the Toolbar Badge Count

The toolbar icon displays a badge showing the count of distinct third-party remote servers your current browser tab has connected to or attempted to connect.

- **Badge Number Meaning:** This number represents the total unique third-party domains allowed (i.e., connections not blocked).
- **Lower Count is Better:** Fewer third-party connections imply stronger privacy protection.

### What the Badge Does NOT Show

- It does not count blocked or stealth-blocked domains.
- It does not reflect the raw number of requests but unique domains.

<Note>
The badge updates dynamically as you browse, reflecting distinct allowed third-party domains related to the active tab.
</Note>

## 3. Open the Popup User Interface (UI)

To access detailed connection summaries:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
2. The popup UI will appear showing:
   - The **current tab’s hostname** and domain.
   - The **number of third-party domains connected**.
   - Lists of domains grouped by request outcome:
     - **Not blocked (allowed)**
     - **Stealth-blocked** (connections redirected or hidden by blocking subtle methods)
     - **Blocked** (requests explicitly blocked by content blockers or network preventions)

### Interpreting the Popup Sections

| Section          | Description                                                                       |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked      | Domains from which resources were successfully fetched.                          |
| Stealth-Blocked  | Domains where requests were redirected or hidden — typically indicating stealth blocking techniques.
|
| Blocked          | Domains associated with failed requests due to blocking.
|
<Tip>
Domains are presented with counts representing how many times requests were made.
</Tip>

## 4. Verify Extension Activity for Open Tabs

uBO Scope collects data for each browser tab independently. To confirm it is active and monitoring:

- Switch to another tab and open the popup; observe that hostname and domains update accordingly.
- If browsing popular sites, expect the badge count to reflect third-party resources typically loaded.

<Warning>
If the badge remains empty or the popup shows "NO DATA" for all tabs, the extension might be inactive or lacking permissions.
Verify browser permissions and reload the extension.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Practical Validation Example

Try these steps:

1. Open a website known to contain several third-party resources (e.g., news websites).
2. Observe the badge count on the toolbar icon—this shows the number of unique allowed third-party domains.
3. Click the icon to open the popup UI.
4. Review the domains listed under "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked".
5. Reload the page and watch the badge update dynamically.

<Check>
A changing badge number and updated popup data confirm that uBO Scope is actively monitoring network requests.
</Check>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Steps">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- Check that the extension has necessary permissions enabled, especially network access permissions (webRequest).
- Reload the extension or browser.
- Ensure you are browsing http or https sites that trigger external network requests.
- Confirm no conflicting extensions are blocking or interfering with messaging.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup Displays NO DATA">
- The active tab might not have made network requests yet.
- Try navigating to a different website or refreshing the current tab.
- Check the extension is enabled in your browser’s management page.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extension Not Visible in Toolbar">
- Pin uBO Scope extension icon to the toolbar (browser-specific instructions).
- Confirm installation has been successful.
- Reinstall if necessary from official stores:
  - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Additional Tips

- **Extension Permissions**: uBO Scope requires access to observe network activity through browser APIs; denying permissions will disable data collection.
- **Browser Support**: Compatible with Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari (version restrictions apply).
- **Privacy Considerations**: The extension collects only domain-level connection data; no content or personal data is logged.

## 8. What’s Next?

After validating that uBO Scope is working:

- Explore the **"Using the Popup: Viewing and Interpreting Results"** guide to make the most of monitoring capabilities
- Review the **"Understanding Third-Party Connections and Badge Counts"** page to deepen your understanding of network connections
- Use uBO Scope to analyze content blocking effectiveness and identify stealth blocking patterns
