# Installation Guide for uBO Scope

Welcome to the uBO Scope Installation Guide. This document will lead you through the exact, step-by-step process to install uBO Scope on your preferred browser—Chromium, Firefox, or Safari. Whether you want the quickest setup via official browser extension stores or prefer manual installation, this guide ensures you’ll have uBO Scope up and running efficiently.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is compatible with the following browsers and minimum versions:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (including Google Chrome, Edge, Brave): version 122.0 or higher
- **Mozilla Firefox:** version 128.0 or higher
- **Apple Safari:** version 18.5 or higher

> Make sure your browser version meets these requirements to guarantee proper functionality.

## 2. Installation Methods

There are two main installation methods:

- **Official Add-ons Store Installation (Recommended)**: Safest and easiest way.
- **Manual Installation**: For users who prefer to build and install from source or side-load the extension.

### 2.1 Install from Official Browser Add-Ons Store

Use the direct links below to install uBO Scope from your browser’s official extension/add-ons store.

| Browser  | Installation Link                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Chromium | [Chrome Web Store - uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox  | [Firefox Add-ons - uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |

#### Steps to Install via Browser Store:

1. Click the appropriate link for your browser above.
2. Click **Add to [Browser]** or **Install**.
3. Confirm any permission prompts.
4. After installation, you should see the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.

<Tip>
Installing via the official add-ons store ensures you receive automatic updates and a verified extension.
</Tip>

### 2.2 Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

If you prefer or require installing from the source code manually, follow these instructions.

#### Prerequisites

- A Linux environment or compatible shell (Linux or WSL on Windows).
- Git and necessary build tools installed.
- Basic familiarity with browser extension side-loading.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
cd uBO-Scope
```

#### Step 2: Build the Extension Package for Your Browser

You must specify the target platform when running the build script.

- **For Chromium:**
  ```bash
  ./tools/make-package.sh chromium
  ```
  This creates the extension files in `build/uBO-Scope.chromium`.

- **For Firefox:**
  ```bash
  ./tools/make-package.sh firefox
  ```
  Creates files in `build/uBO-Scope.firefox`.

- **For Safari:**
  ```bash
  ./tools/make-package.sh safari
  ```
  Creates files in `build/uBO-Scope.safari`.

> You can optionally specify a version string as the second argument, e.g., `./tools/make-package.sh chromium 1.0.1`.

#### Step 3: Load the Extension into Your Browser

##### Chromium-based browsers:

1. Open `chrome://extensions/` or relevant extensions page.
2. Enable **Developer mode** (usually a toggle in the top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the generated folder, e.g., `build/uBO-Scope.chromium`.
4. uBO Scope will appear in your extensions list and its icon in the toolbar.

##### Firefox:

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Select the `manifest.json` file inside `build/uBO-Scope.firefox`.
4. The extension will load and show in the toolbar.

##### Safari:

Manual installation requires building an Xcode project using the Safari Web Extensions tools, that is beyond the scope of this guide at this time. For most users, install from the App Store or official Safari Extensions Gallery is recommended.

<Warning>
Manual installs are not automatically updated. Remember to update manually when new versions are released.
</Warning>

## 3. Verify Installation

After installation, ensure the extension is functioning properly by:

1. Confirming the uBO Scope icon appears in your browser toolbar.
2. Clicking the icon opens the popup showing domain connection data (initially it may show "NO DATA" until you navigate to a website).
3. Visit a few websites and check the badge count appears and increases according to network requests.

<Tip>
If the popup shows no data, reload the current tab after installation or visit a new website to allow uBO Scope to collect data.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Alternative: Installing from Prebuilt ZIP (Chromium Only)

For Chromium-based browsers, prebuilt ZIP packages can be created:

```bash
./tools/make-chromium.sh 1.0.1
```

- This creates a `uBO-Scope.chromium.zip` file in the `build/` directory.
- You can unzip this and load the folder via **Load unpacked** as described above.

---

## 5. Permissions & Security

uBO Scope requires the following permissions:

- `webRequest` for monitoring network requests.
- `storage` to save session data locally.
- `activeTab` to interact with the current tab.

These permissions are essential for uBO Scope to effectively report third-party connection outcomes.

<Note>
These permissions are requested during installation automatically and must be granted for full functionality.
</Note>
