# Installation on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari

This guide walks you through installing the uBO Scope extension on the three major supported browsers: **Chrome**, **Firefox**, and **Safari**. Each section provides direct links to the official extension stores and clear instructions on verifying that the installation was successful.

---

## Supported Browsers & Version Requirements

- **Google Chrome (Chromium-based browsers)**: Version 122.0 or higher
- **Mozilla Firefox**: Version 128.0 or higher
- **Apple Safari**: Version 18.5 or higher

Make sure your browser is updated to meet these minimum versions. Older versions may not support the necessary WebExtension APIs, particularly the `webRequest` API critical for uBO Scope’s functionality.

---

## 1. Installing on Google Chrome

### Step 1: Go to Chrome Web Store

Visit the uBO Scope extension page directly:

[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)

### Step 2: Add the Extension

- Click the blue **Add to Chrome** button.
- Confirm by clicking **Add extension** in the popup.

### Step 3: Wait for Installation

Chrome will download and install the extension; you will see the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.

### Step 4: Verify Installation

- Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.
- Scroll through to confirm **uBO Scope** is listed and enabled.
- Make sure the version matches or exceeds **1.0.1**.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- If you don’t see the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar, click the puzzle icon (Extensions) and pin uBO Scope for quick access.
- If installation fails, ensure your Chrome version is 122 or above.

<Note>
For Chrome, uBO Scope requires permissions including `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` to monitor network requests effectively.
</Note>

## 2. Installing on Mozilla Firefox

### Step 1: Visit Firefox Add-ons Marketplace

Go directly to the uBO Scope listing:

[https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

### Step 2: Install the Extension

- Click **+ Add to Firefox**.
- Confirm any prompts to grant permissions and allow installation.

### Step 3: Confirm Installation

- The uBO Scope icon appears on the toolbar.
- Navigate to `about:addons` and ensure uBO Scope is present and enabled.
- Version should be 1.0.1 or newer.

### Step 4: Pin the Extension (Optional but Recommended)

- Click the puzzle icon.
- Pin uBO Scope for easy access.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- If uBO Scope doesn’t appear or stops working after install, check Firefox version is 128 or above.
- Review addon permissions especially `webRequest` capability.

<Note>
Firefox version 128+ is critical as earlier versions lack certain manifest v3 APIs required by uBO Scope.
</Note>

## 3. Installing on Apple Safari

### Step 1: Open Safari Extensions Gallery

On macOS with Safari 18.5 or newer:

- Open Safari and select **Safari > Settings (Preferences) > Extensions**.
- Click **More Extensions** to open the Mac App Store.

### Step 2: Search for uBO Scope

- Use the search bar and type "uBO Scope".
- Select the extension.

### Step 3: Install the Extension

- Click **Install** to download and install uBO Scope.

### Step 4: Enable the Extension

- Go back to Safari > Settings > Extensions.
- Find uBO Scope and check the box to enable it.

### Step 5: Verify Installation

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in the Safari toolbar.
- Ensure the extension is enabled and the listed version is 1.0.1 or higher.

### Important Note

Safari’s extension system works differently and may require enabling WebExtension support manually in some macOS versions.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- If the extension does not appear, check macOS and Safari are updated to minimum version 18.5.
- Restart Safari after installation to ensure full activation.

<Warning>
Safari currently supports fewer WebExtension API features and only allows monitoring for HTTP(S) traffic, so some advanced network requests (like WebSocket monitoring) may have limitations.
</Warning>

## How to Confirm the Extension is Working

After installation on any browser:

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
2. The popup will display domains connected, categorizing them as "allowed", "stealth-blocked", or "blocked".
3. The badge count on the icon will show the count of distinct third-party remote servers.

If you see this data updating upon browsing, the extension is installed and functioning properly.

<Check>
If no data appears, try refreshing the active tab or restarting your browser.
</Check>
