# System Requirements & Supported Browsers

Ensure uBO Scope runs smoothly by verifying your system and browser compatibility before installation. This guide helps you confirm your setup meets all technical prerequisites and clarifies necessary permissions for network monitoring.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope works as a browser extension designed specifically for tracking third-party network connections across popular modern browsers using the WebExtensions API.

### Compatible Browsers and Minimum Versions

| Browser    | Minimum Version | Notes                              |
|------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Chromium   | 122.0           | Stable releases with MV3 support.|
| Firefox    | 128.0           | Gecko-based, requires Firefox 128+|
| Safari     | 18.5            | Safari Web Extensions with MV3.  |


<u>Note:</u> uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API capability. Browsers or versions without full support for this API **cannot** provide accurate data to the extension.


## 2. Supported Operating Systems

Since uBO Scope is a browser extension, supported operating systems mirror the respective browsers':

- **Windows, macOS, Linux** for Chromium and Firefox.
- **macOS and iOS/iPadOS (Safari 18.5 or later)** for Safari.

Because uBO Scope runs inside the browser, no direct installation at the OS level is needed.

## 3. Required Browser Permissions

To expose network connection information, uBO Scope requests the following permissions upon installation:

- `webRequest`: Allows the extension to monitor and evaluate network requests for classification.
- `storage`: Enables saving session data and settings securely.
- `activeTab`: Grants temporary access to the currently active tab to retrieve context and display data.


<u>Host Permissions:</u> The extension needs broad access to all HTTP and WebSocket URLs to comprehensively monitor network traffic.

```json
"host_permissions": [
  "https://*/*",
  "http://*/*",
  "wss://*/*",
  "ws://*/*"
]
```

Without these permissions, uBO Scope cannot detect or report on all outgoing third-party connections.

## 4. Feature & API Usage Compatibility

- uBO Scope uses the browser's `webRequest` API to observe network events (`onBeforeRedirect`, `onErrorOccurred`, `onResponseStarted`).
- This API must be fully supported and not restricted by the browser for accurate monitoring.

## 5. Verifying Compatibility

Follow these steps to verify your browser and system support uBO Scope:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Version">
- Open your browser.
- Navigate to the "About" page usually found in the Help menu.
- Confirm your version is at least the minimum listed above.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Extension Permissions">
- When installing uBO Scope, check that the requested permissions include `webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab`.
- If installing manually, review the manifest file.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Host Permissions">
- Validate that uBO Scope has access to monitor all web and WebSocket traffic (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, etc.).
</Step>
<Step title="Test Network Monitoring">
- After installation, open uBO Scopeâ€™s popup to ensure connections are being reported.
- If no data appears, re-check permissions or browser compatibility.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Platform-Specific Notes

### Chromium
- Must run version 122 or higher.
- Uses a service worker in the background for processing.

### Firefox
- Requires minimum Firefox 128.
- Uses background scripts with full module support.

### Safari
- Needs Safari 18.5 or later.
- Uses Safari's Web Extension model; host permissions exclude WebSocket streams (`wss://*/*` and `ws://*/*` are not listed).
- Ensure the browser allows the `webRequest` permission for monitoring.

## 7. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

<Tip>
If uBO Scope does not show data after installation:
- Confirm your browser matches or exceeds the minimum version.
- Check extension permissions are fully granted.
- Restart the browser after installation.
- Ensure no conflicting extensions are blocking access to the `webRequest` API.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Browsers that block or limit `webRequest` API functionality (e.g., some versions of mobile browsers or privacy-focused forks) will prevent uBO Scope from operating reliably.
</Warning>

## 8. Summary Manifest Permissions (Reference)

Below is a simplified example of the Chrome/Chromium manifest portion that reflects the key permissions and host access:

```json
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "webRequest"],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://*/*",
    "http://*/*",
    "wss://*/*",
    "ws://*/*"
  ]
}
```

Firefox and Safari have similar manifest configurations with adaptations to API usage.

<Check>
Make sure you have updated your browser to the latest stable version before installing uBO Scope.
</Check>

<Note>
The effectiveness of uBO Scope depends on your browser's `webRequest` API support; outdated or unsupported browsers will yield incomplete or no results.
