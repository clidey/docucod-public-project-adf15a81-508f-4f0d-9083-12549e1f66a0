# First Launch and Quick Validation

Welcome to your first experience with **uBO Scope**! This guide walks you through launching the extension right after installation, understanding the badge counter's meaning, and verifying that the extension correctly tracks connections to third-party remote servers. Follow the steps below to quickly validate that uBO Scope is working as intended and gain actionable insights from your browsing activity.

---

## 1. Launching uBO Scope for the First Time

You have just installed uBO Scope from your browser’s respective store. Now it’s time to activate it and see it in action.

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Icon">
Find the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser’s extension area. It appears as the extension’s logo (a colored shield icon) on the toolbar.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the uBO Scope Icon to Open the Popup">
Click the icon to open uBO Scope’s popup window, which shows a summary of network connections for the current tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Grant Any Requested Permissions">
If your browser asks for additional permissions (like access to the active tab or network requests), accept them to enable full functionality.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you don't see the icon, check your browser's extension menu or enable it through your browser's extensions settings.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Badge Counter

The badge displayed over the uBO Scope toolbar icon shows a **count of distinct third-party remote servers your current tab has connected to.**

- The number reflects the **unique domains of third-party servers** contacted by the webpage.
- A **lower number is better**, indicating fewer external connections.

### What the Badge Count Represents

- **Allowed Connections**: Connections successfully made to third-party domains.
- **Blocked or Stealth Connections**: Not reflected in the badge count.

<Info>
The badge count updates dynamically as you browse pages with network activity.
</Info>

### Why This Matters

This number helps you gauge the network footprint and potential privacy exposure of the webpage you’re viewing.

## 3. Validating Third-Party Connection Tracking

Follow this simple test to ensure uBO Scope is correctly detecting and tracking third-party connections.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Known Website">
Navigate to a popular website that loads content from multiple domains (e.g., news sites, retail sites).
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Badge Counter">
Look at the badge number on the uBO Scope icon, which indicates how many distinct third-party domains that page has connected to.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup UI">
Click the uBO Scope icon again to open the popup window.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Domain Sections">
Inside the popup, examine the three outcome sections:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains for which connections succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were stealthily redirected or blocked.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly blocked or failed.

You should see corresponding domain counts and domain names.
</Step>
<Step title="Refresh the Page">
Reload the webpage and watch the badge counter and popup update as more network requests resolve.
This confirms uBO Scope is actively monitoring network requests in real time.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Tips for Interpreting Results

- **High Badge Count on New Tabs:** Some pages, especially complex ones, naturally connect to many third-party services (e.g., analytics, CDN, ads).

- **Surprising Domains:** The popup shows specific domains behind the count, helping you identify any unexpected third parties.

- **Blocked vs Allowed:** uBO Scope focuses on what network requests actually succeeded, regardless of blocking done by other extensions or DNS-level filters.

- **Stealth-Blocked Domains:** These may represent requests redirected or silently blocked, giving you insight beyond typical blocker metrics.

<Note>
Not all third-party connections are undesirable; many are legitimate services like fonts or CDN providers necessary for page functionality.
</Note>

## 5. Ensuring Everything is Working Correctly

After following the steps above, confirm:

- The badge counter updates when you navigate to new sites.
- The popup UI lists domains categorized into "Not Blocked," "Stealth-Blocked," and "Blocked" sections.
- Domain counts correspond logically with your browsing activity.

### Troubleshooting Quick Checks

- If the badge never updates or the popup says "NO DATA," ensure the extension has the necessary permissions (especially `webRequest` and host permissions).
- Try refreshing the page or visiting a different website to generate network requests.
- Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

<Tip>
Refer to the [Basic Configuration and Permissions Guide](/getting-started/setup-and-troubleshooting/basic-configuration) for detailed permission setup.
