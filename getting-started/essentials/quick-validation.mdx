# Validate Your Installation

Ensure that uBO Scope is correctly installed and actively monitoring network connections by following these practical steps. This page walks you through verifying the extension’s badge counts, inspecting the popup UI’s connection summaries, and confirming real-time tracking of network activity during web browsing.

---

## 1. Confirm Badge Count on Toolbar Icon

The badge on the uBO Scope toolbar icon shows the count of **distinct third-party domains contacted** from the active tab.

1. Load any website in your browser (for example, `https://example.com`).
2. Look at the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
3. Confirm that a number appears on the badge indicating connected third-party domains.

> ✅ **Successful Indicator:** The badge displays a numeric count reflecting third-party domain connections.

> ⚠️ If the badge is blank or missing a count:
> - Verify that uBO Scope is enabled in your browser’s extension list.
> - Reload the page and watch for changes.
> - Ensure no browser or system-level restrictions block extension network access.


## 2. Inspect the Popup UI for Connection Summaries

The popup UI summarizes the third-party domains encountered on the current tab, grouped by connection outcome:
- **Not blocked (allowed)**
- **Stealth-blocked**
- **Blocked**

### Steps to Open and Use the Popup:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar to open the popup.
2. At the top, check the displayed hostname and domain — this indicates the webpage you are inspecting.
3. Review the **'domains connected'** count near the top; this matches the toolbar badge number.
4. Explore the three sections below:
   - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which the browser successfully loaded resources.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were blocked silently (not visible to the webpage).
   - **Blocked:** Domains whose network requests were explicitly blocked.
5. Each listed domain includes a count representing the number of observed requests.

> ✅ **Successful Indicator:**
> - The popup lists domains under appropriate categories.
> - Counts are shown next to each domain.
> - The summary count matches the badge on the toolbar.

> ⚠️ If no data appears or all sections show **NO DATA**:
> - Refresh the current webpage; network data accumulates upon page loads.
> - Confirm permissions granted to the extension (see Installation Guide).


## 3. Verify Real-Time Network Activity Tracking

To validate dynamic data collection:

1. With uBO Scope installed, open a new tab.
2. Visit multiple websites or reload pages.
3. After each page loads, open the uBO Scope popup to observe changing connection counts and domain lists.

This dynamic behavior confirms uBO Scope actively monitors traffic and updates connection summaries.

> ⚠️ Common Pitfall:
> - Navigating through cached pages or sites with limited third-party connections may show low or zero counts.
> - Try visiting more complex pages with rich external resources (news sites, media portals).


## 4. Troubleshooting Quick Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues & Fixes">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- Ensure the extension is enabled (`chrome://extensions` or equivalent).
- Reload the webpage fully to trigger new network events.
- Check for conflicting extensions that might interfere with network monitoring.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Domains or Data">
- Confirm you clicked the toolbar icon on a tab where a webpage is loaded.
- Refresh the tab to trigger network requests.
- Restart the browser if issues persist to reset extension state.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Badge or Popup Icon Visible">
- Verify installation is complete and compatible with your browser version.
- Consult the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/essentials/installation) for supported browsers.
- Check browser extension permissions settings.

## 5. Understanding the Connection Data

The badges and popup data reflect **distinct third-party domains** contacted during browsing — a crucial privacy metric:

- The counts inform you how many unique external services your browser talks to.
- Lower counts typically indicate less exposure to third-party trackers.
- The popup details support educated privacy decisions and more transparent network visibility.
