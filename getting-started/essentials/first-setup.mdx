# Initial Configuration & First Launch

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide will walk you through what to expect immediately after installation, outline the minimal (in fact, nearly zero) configuration required, and introduce you to the core user interface elements you'll see on your first launch. uBO Scope emphasizes simplicity and transparency: almost no setup is required to start seeing valuable insights about your browser's network connections.

---

## 1. Understanding uBO Scope's Zero-Config Design

uBO Scope is designed to work immediately upon installation without the need for any manual configuration. The extension activates automatically and begins monitoring your browser's network connections to third-party remote servers in real time. This zero-config approach ensures that you can start gaining insight into your network traffic instantly — no complex options, no configuration screens.

### What Happens Post-Installation?

- The extension automatically requests necessary permissions during installation, such as network access monitoring via the `webRequest` API.
- It immediately begins tracking connections made by your browser within permitted URL patterns.
- No additional activation steps are required.

<Tip>
If you have installed uBO Scope via an official browser store, permissions are handled during that process. Manual installs may require explicit granting of permissions.
</Tip>

## 2. Activating and Accessing uBO Scope

The extension activates automatically; there is no separate toggle or "enable" step.

### Step-by-Step: First Launch

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Icon">
After installation, look for the uBO Scope icon on your browser's toolbar. It should appear as a small shield or badge displaying a number (or blank if no data yet).
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup Interface">
Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup window. This popup is your dashboard to view real-time summaries of the connections your browser is making for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe Initial Data">
At first launch, if you visit any webpage, uBO Scope begins populating the popup with connection information automatically.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If the popup shows “NO DATA”, it means uBO Scope has not detected network connections for the current tab yet. Simply reload the tab or navigate to a new webpage to start collecting data.
</Note>

## 3. Core UI Elements on First Use

The popup interface is simple and focused on clarity. Here are the main elements you will see:

- **Hostname Header**: Shows the domain and subdomain of the current active tab's main frame.
- **Domain Count Summary**: A count of distinct third-party domains connected during the page load.
- **Connection Outcome Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains for which connections succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were stealthily blocked (hidden from page scripts).
  - **Blocked**: Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.
- **Domain Rows**: Each domain is listed with the count of connections observed.

### Example Visual:

```plaintext
[ example.subdomain ]  # Hostname Header

Domains connected: 5

Not Blocked
 - cdn.example.com (12)
 - analytics.partner.com (3)

Stealth-Blocked
 - tracker.ads.net (8)

Blocked
 - adserver.badsite.com (5)
```

The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of network requests made to each domain.

## 4. What to Expect: A Successful First Launch

A successful first launch means:

- The uBO Scope icon badge updates to show a numeric count of distinct connections made in the active tab.
- Opening the popup shows a populated list of domains grouped by connection outcome.
- The hostname of the active tab's main webpage displays prominently at the top.
- Data updates dynamically as you browse new sites or reload pages.

<Check>
A growing list of connected domains and changing badge counts as you navigate indicates healthy operation.

## 5. What You Do Not Need to Do

- No manual configuration of filtering or blocking rules is necessary in uBO Scope itself.
- No need to enter credentials or configure external data sources.
- The extension does not require interaction beyond clicking the icon to review data.

This design keeps your focus on transparency and understanding rather than maintenance.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Remains Blank or Stuck">
