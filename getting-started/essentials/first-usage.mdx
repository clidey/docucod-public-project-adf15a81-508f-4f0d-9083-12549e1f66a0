# Your First Look: Validating Installation

Welcome to your initial exploration of uBO Scope! After installing and configuring the extension, this guide walks you through confirming that uBO Scope is set up correctly and actively monitoring your browser’s network activity for the current tab.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Extension Popup

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon** in your browser toolbar. The icon looks like the uBO Scope logo in varying sizes (16 to 128 pixels).
2. **Click the icon** to open its popup window. This popup acts as your real-time dashboard, displaying live data for the currently active browser tab.

<Tip>
If you do not see the icon, ensure you have completed installation and pinned the extension to your toolbar following the steps in the "First-Time Configuration & Extension Access" guide.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup User Interface

When the popup opens, it displays information about network connections made by the current tab.

### Key Elements:

- **Tab Hostname Header:** Displays the hostname and, when applicable, the subdomain for the active tab.
- **Domains Connected Summary:** Shows the number of distinct remote domains successfully connected to from the active tab.
- **Outcome Sections:** There are three outcome categories shown, each with its own section and list:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains with connections allowed successfully.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains whose connections were redirected or stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Domains whose connections were outright blocked (errors).

Each domain listed shows:
- The domain name, displayed in Unicode to accommodate internationalized domains.
- A count badge indicating how many times that domain was connected to within the current page session.

<Info>
The data shown is live and tab-specific, updating as you navigate or interact with the page.
</Info>

## 3. Interpreting Connection Counts & Statuses

The main measure of your setup's success here is the presence of live connection data:

- **Domains Connected Count:** A numeric summary indicating how many unique domains your current tab connected to. This count corresponds directly to the toolbar badge count.

- **Allowed Domains:** If you see domains listed here, uBO Scope is actively reporting successful network requests.

- **Stealth and Blocked Domains:** These provide transparency on connections your browser attempted but were redirected stealthily or blocked entirely. Their presence confirms uBO Scope is correctly capturing varied network outcomes.

### What to Expect When Installation is Verified:

- The **hostname header** reflects your current active tab.
- The **domains connected count** is a number greater than zero (unless on a very simple page).
- Domains appear under the appropriate sections based on their connection outcome.

### Example Snapshot:

```text
Tab Hostname: example.com
Domains connected: 15

Not Blocked:
 - cdn.example.net (7)
 - analytics.example.org (3)

Stealth-Blocked:
 - tracker.example.com (2)

Blocked:
 - ads.example.io (5)
```

This indicates your extension is collecting real-time network data correctly.

## 4. Quick Step-by-Step Validation Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Tab Hostname">
Confirm the hostname displayed matches your active tab’s site.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Domains Connected">
Look for a numeric count in the summary section reflecting connected domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domain Lists">
See domains listed under ‘Not Blocked’, ‘Stealth-Blocked’, or ‘Blocked’ categories.
If these are populated, the extension is actively monitoring connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Counts">
Note the count badges beside each domain to understand connection frequencies.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting Tips

### No Data or 'NO DATA' Shown
- You might be on an internal browser page or a page without network connections.
- The extension may not have permissions or might be disabled on this tab – check your browser’s extension settings.
- Try navigating to a common website with network activity (e.g., https://www.example.com).

### Domains List is Empty but Count Shows
- This can happen momentarily while data loads; try closing and reopening the popup.

### Connection Counts are Not Updating
- Refresh the tab, then reopen the popup.
- Confirm the extension is enabled and has ‘activeTab’ and ‘webRequest’ permissions.

<Tip>
For detailed troubleshooting scenarios, consult the "Troubleshooting Common Issues" guide.
