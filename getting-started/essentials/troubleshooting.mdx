# Troubleshooting Common Issues

Ensuring a seamless experience with uBO Scope starts with addressing the most frequent issues users encounter during installation and use. This guide walks you through practical solutions for common problems — from missing icons, empty data displays, permission errors, to platform-specific quirks — empowering you to resolve basic setup challenges independently while directing more advanced troubleshooting to the right resources.

---

## 1. Missing or Invisible Toolbar Icon

### Problem
After installing uBO Scope, the extension's icon does not appear in your browser toolbar.

### Solution
1. **Pin the Extension Icon**  
   - In Chromium-based browsers, click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions) near the address bar.
   - Find "uBO Scope" in the list and click the pin icon to keep it visible.

2. **Verify Extension is Enabled**  
   - Open your browser's extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions` or `about:addons`).
   - Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and not disabled by the browser or another extension.

3. **Restart the Browser**  
   - Sometimes a simple restart resolves icon loading issues.

4. **Check Browser Version Compatibility**  
   - Refer to the [System Requirements & Prerequisites](https://your-docs/getting-started/essentials/prerequisites) to confirm your browser version meets the minimum standards (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

<Warning>
If you recently installed the extension and the icon is missing, avoid installing multiple versions simultaneously as they may conflict.
</Warning>

## 2. Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Empty Connection Lists

### Problem
The extension popup loads but displays "NO DATA" or no network connections under any category.

### Solution
1. **Activate uBO Scope on the Correct Tab**  
   - uBO Scope gathers connection data on a per-tab basis. Make sure you open the popup on the tab you want to analyze.

2. **Reload the Webpage**  
   - uBO Scope only captures data while a page loads. Refresh the page to allow the extension to record network requests.

3. **Verify Permissions and Host Access**  
   - The extension requires permissions to monitor all web traffic matching {`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`}.
   - Check your browser's extension settings to confirm permission is granted.

4. **Close and Reopen the Popup**  
   - Close the popup and open it again after page reload to refresh data.

5. **Check for Conflicting Extensions**  
   - Some privacy or ad-block extensions may interfere. Temporarily disable them to test if the problem persists.

<Note>
Connection data is not kept indefinitely; uBO Scope reports network activity during the current browsing session for the active tab.
</Note>

## 3. Permission Errors or Denied Access

### Problem
The extension shows errors related to lack of permissions or inability to monitor traffic.

### Solution
1. **Manually Allow Required Permissions**  
   - Go to your browser's extension settings.
   - For uBO Scope, ensure that permissions to "Read and change all your data on websites you visit" (Chromium) or equivalent are granted.

2. **Reload the Extension**  
   - Disable and enable uBO Scope again to prompt permission confirmation dialogs.

3. **Follow Browser-Specific Instructions:**  
   - Firefox might require "Permanent Storage" or additional trust settings for full operation.
   - Safari may limit network monitoring regardless of permission. See the [Installation Across Browsers](https://your-docs/getting-started/essentials/installation) page for Safari-specific notes.

4. **Update Your Browser**  
   - Permissions and APIs evolve. Keep your browser updated to the latest version.

## 4. Platform-Specific Behavior or Quirks

### Problem
Inconsistencies or specific limitations depending on your browser platform.

### Details and Guidance
- **Chromium** (Chrome, Edge, Brave):  
  - Fully supported with service worker background.
  - Network request monitoring is stable.

- **Firefox**:  
  - Uses `scripts` background model.
  - Ensure minimum version 128.0.

- **Safari**:  
  - Background service worker supported starting Safari 18.5.
  - Network monitoring may have stricter limitations.
  - Host permissions exclude WebSocket URLs (`ws://`, `wss://`).

### Tips
- Refer to the [Integration and Compatibility](https://your-docs/overview/architecture-overview/integration-and-compatibility) documentation.
- Consider browser quirks when interpreting connection data.

## 5. Extension Badge Count Confusion

### Problem
The badge count on the toolbar icon shows a number that seems unexpectedly high or low.

### Explanation and Guidance
- The badge count represents the number of *distinct* third-party remote domains with established connections on the active tab.
- A lower count implies fewer connections to third-party servers, which often aligns with better privacy.
- High block counts from content blockers do not necessarily equate to fewer third-party connections.
- For detailed understanding, refer to [Interpreting the Toolbar Badge Count](https://your-docs/guides/analyzing-network-activity/interpreting-badge-count).

---

## 6. Data Not Updating After Page Navigation or Reload

### Problem
After navigating to a new page or reloading, connection data in the popup appears stale or unchanged.

### Solution
1. **Close and Reopen Popup**  
   - Data refreshes when the popup reloads.

2. **Check Tab Focus**  
   - Verify the popup is opened on the active tab you wish to monitor.

3. **Wait for Page Load**  
   - Data collection depends on network requests during page load; allow the page to finish loading.

4. **Restart Browser If Necessary**

---

## 7. Unexpected Extension Crashes or Failures

### Problem
The extension seems to stop working or the popup won't open.

### Recovery Steps
1. **Restart the Browser**  
2. **Update the Extension**  
3. **Disable Other Extensions Temporarily**  
4. **Clear Browser Cache and Data**  
5. **Consult the GitHub Issues Page**  
   - Visit the official repo [uBO Scope GitHub](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/issues) for known issues.

<Info>
The extension is designed to be lightweight and stable; crashes are rare but can occur due to browser bugs or conflicts.
