# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This page provides quick, practical solutions to the most common installation and setup problems with uBO Scope. Whether you don't see the extension icon on your browser toolbar, the badge count doesn't update, or the popup fails to show any network data, this guide empowers you to independently resolve these issues and get your workflow back on track.

---

## 1. Extension Icon Not Showing in Toolbar

If you have installed uBO Scope but cannot see its icon in your browser's toolbar, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Verify Installation
- Open your browser's extension or add-on management page:
  - **Chromium-based browsers**: `chrome://extensions/`
  - **Firefox**: `about:addons`
  - **Safari**: `Preferences > Extensions`
- Confirm that uBO Scope is listed and enabled.

### Step 2: Pin the Extension
- Many browsers hide extensions from the toolbar by default.
- Locate the extensions icon (puzzle piece) on your toolbar.
- Click it, and find uBO Scope in the list.
- Click the pin or toggle option to show the icon on the toolbar.

### Step 3: Restart Browser
- Close and reopen your browser to refresh the interface.

<Tip>
If the extension is installed but still invisible, check if you are in Developer Mode and review any errors flagged for uBO Scope on the extensions page.
</Tip>

## 2. Badge Count Not Updating

The badge on the toolbar icon displays the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected for the active tab. If this number does not update or disappears unexpectedly:

### Step 1: Confirm Permissions
- uBO Scope requires permissions for `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`.
- Check in the extension management page that these permissions have not been revoked.

### Step 2: Verify Site Compatibility
- The extension works only when browsing web pages served over `http`, `https`, `ws`, or `wss` protocols.
- Pages like `file://` or internal browser tabs do not produce badge counts.

### Step 3: Refresh Page
- Reload the active tab to trigger new network requests.

### Step 4: Check for Browser Updates
- Outdated browsers may not fully support the `webRequest` API essential for uBO Scope's network monitoring.
- Update your browser to the latest stable version.

### Step 5: Disable Conflicting Extensions
- Some other extensions or strict privacy settings may block the `webRequest` API usage.
- Temporarily disable other extensions that might interfere and test badge updates.

<Warning>
If your browser blocks `webRequest` API access to extensions, uBO Scope cannot report network activity accurately.
</Warning>

## 3. Popup Not Displaying Network Data

When clicking the uBO Scope icon, the popup should show summary data about allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains connected by the current tab. If it is empty or only shows "NO DATA":

### Step 1: Ensure Page Has Loaded Network Requests
- The popup relies on the browser reporting network connections. If you open the popup immediately upon loading a new page, it may not have collected data yet.
- Wait a few moments and reload the popup.

### Step 2: Reload or Navigate to a Different Tab
- The active tab must have network activity.
- Try refreshing the page or switching to another tab with active browsing.

### Step 3: Check Browser Console for Errors
- Open your browser's developer console for extensions and look for any errors related to uBO Scope.
- This can provide hints about unexpected failures.

### Step 4: Confirm Network Requests Are Visible to uBO Scope
- Some browsers or configurations suppress network data.
- Check if your browser's privacy or security settings limit extensions from monitoring network activity.

<Tip>
Opening developer tools and watching network traffic can help you verify if requests are actually being made.
</Tip>

## 4. Extension Appears Installed but Inactive

If the icon is present but no counts or data appear:

### Step 1: Confirm You Are on a Supported Browser and Version
- Minimum versions:
  - Chromium: 122.0 or higher
  - Firefox: 128.0 or higher
  - Safari: 18.5 or higher
- Older versions lack required APIs for operation.

### Step 2: Reinstall the Extension
- Remove uBO Scope completely.
- Reinstall from official stores:
  - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- Restart your browser after installation.

### Step 3: Reset Browser Cache and Data
- Corrupted cache or storage can interfere.
- Clear browser cache and site data.

### Step 4: Ensure Browser Has Granted All Permissions to the Extension
- When prompted, accept all permission requests.

## 5. Common Actionable Tips to Succeed

- Always pin the extension icon for easy access.
- Visit websites with active external resources to see badge updates (e.g., news sites, social platforms).
- Remember the badge count reflects the number of **distinct third-party domains** connected during browsing - a lower number indicates better privacy.
- Do not rely on ad-blocker test pages as a benchmark; they produce artificial network requests.

## 6. Additional Troubleshooting Resources

- Refer to the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/essentials/installation) if installation itself fails.
- Use the [Initial Configuration & First Launch](/getting-started/essentials/first-setup) documentation for startup problems.
- The [Validate Your Installation](/getting-started/essentials/quick-validation) page walks you through confirming correct operation.
- For advanced troubleshooting, review the browser console logs related to uBO Scope and visit the project [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting FAQs">
<Accordion title="Why don't I see any badge number on the extension icon?">
If the badge is missing, it usually means no third-party remote servers have been detected for the active tab, or the extension could not access the webRequest API due to browser restrictions or permissions. Try refreshing the page, checking permissions, or restarting the browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What are stealth-blocked domains, and why don't they show up in the badge?">
Stealth-blocked domains indicate network requests redirected or handled in a way that hides them from detection but are tracked by uBO Scope internally. These domains appear in the popup but do not increase the badge count since the count reflects allowed domains only.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The popup shows 'NO DATA' even though I have browsing activity. What should I do?">
Wait a few seconds for the extension to process network requests. Reload the popup and ensure you're on a standard HTTP/HTTPS tab with active external connections. Try navigating to a popular website to generate network activity.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can other content blockers interfere with uBO Scope?">
Yes. Some content blockers or privacy tools interfere with the network request API, causing uBO Scope to lose visibility. Temporarily disabling conflicting extensions can help identify interference.
