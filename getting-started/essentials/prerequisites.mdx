# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Ensuring your environment meets the necessary criteria is vital for a smooth experience with **uBO Scope**. This guide details the supported browsers, operating systems, and permissions needed for uBO Scope to function properly, helping you avoid surprises before installation.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to integrate seamlessly with the three major browser platforms, each with specific requirements and capabilities:

| Browser   | Minimum Version                   | Special Notes                        |
|-----------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Chromium  | Version 122.0 or higher          | WebRequest API fully supported     |
| Firefox   | Version 128.0 or higher          | Includes Firefox Android support   |
| Safari    | Version 18.5 or higher           | WebRequest API supported with caveats |


### Notes:
- Browser versions below these minimums will not provide the necessary API support, which can result in incomplete or failed network reporting.
- The extension uses `webRequest` APIs extensively; browsers without sufficient support will limit uBO Scope's effectiveness.

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

uBO Scope runs on any operating system that supports the above browser versions. This includes:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux distributions
- Android (Firefox only for now)
- iOS/iPadOS (Safari only)

Ensure your OS is updated sufficiently to run the minimum supported browser versions listed above.

## 3. Required Permissions

During installation, uBO Scope will request permissions critical for its network monitoring functionality. Understanding these permissions upfront helps anticipate what access the extension needs:

| Permission   | Purpose                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `activeTab`  | Access details of the currently active browser tab to correlate network connections |
| `storage`    | Store session and configuration data persistently within browser storage |
| `webRequest` | Monitor, intercept, and report on network requests made by webpages     |

### Host Permissions

uBO Scope requires permission to monitor network activity from a broad range of sites, including:

- HTTP and HTTPS URLs (e.g., `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`)
- WebSocket connections (only on Firefox and Chromium, e.g., `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`)

This allows the extension to capture comprehensive connection data.

## 4. Browser Integration Details

- **Chromium:** Runs as a service worker background script (`background.service_worker`), granted full host and webRequest permissions including WebSocket support.

- **Firefox:** Uses a module background script with permissions similar to Chromium. WebSocket monitoring included.

- **Safari:** Runs a module background script but with limited host permissions (only HTTP/HTTPS, no WebSocket). Requires Safari 18.5 or newer to function correctly.

## 5. Permission & Compatibility Tips

<Tip>
Review and allow all permissions requested during installation to guarantee full monitoring capabilities. Incomplete permissions can lead to missing or inaccurate network data.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Using browsers or versions older than supported ranges may cause uBO Scope not to install or to malfunction silently. Always verify compatibility before installation.
</Warning>

<Info>
Some browsers restrict WebSocket monitoring by design (especially older Safari versions). Expect partial WebSocket reporting depending on your platform.
</Info>

## 6. Recommended Setup Summary

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose a Supported Browser">
Ensure you have Chromium (version 122+), Firefox (version 128+), or Safari (version 18.5+) installed.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Operating System and Browser Updates">
Update your OS and browser to the latest stable versions that meet minimum requirements.
</Step>
<Step title="Prepare for Permissions">
Be ready to grant activeTab, storage, webRequest permissions, and extensive host permissions during extension installation.
</Step>
<Step title="Install uBO Scope">
Install from your browser's official extension/add-on store for trusted and verified installation.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 7. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting System Requirements and Permissions">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
If the extension fails to install or does not activate properly, confirm your browser's version. Update it to meet the minimum version:

- Chromium ≥ 122
- Firefox ≥ 128
- Safari ≥ 18.5

Older versions do not support required APIs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Denied or Incomplete">
Check your browser's extension permissions. uBO Scope requires full permissions for activeTab, storage, webRequest, and broad host access. Denying these will limit functionality and render incomplete or no network data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Operating System Limitations">
On some mobile or restricted OS environments, browsers might limit network monitoring capabilities. For Firefox on Android and Safari on iOS, ensure you run the latest browsers and recognize that WebSocket monitoring may be limited.
