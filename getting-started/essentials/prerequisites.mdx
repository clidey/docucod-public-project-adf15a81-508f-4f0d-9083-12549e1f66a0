# Requirements & Supported Platforms

Ensuring your environment meets the necessary requirements is the first critical step to successfully run uBO Scope. This guide details the supported browsers, operating systems, and permissions the extension requires to operate effectively.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a lightweight browser extension compatible with the most common modern browsers that support the WebExtensions Manifest Version 3 specification.

- **Google Chrome and Chromium-based Browsers**
  - Minimum version: **122.0**
  - Manifest requires Chrome 122 or above
  - Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum version: **128.0** (or later)
  - Supports Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android
- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum version: **18.5** (or later)
  - Supports macOS and iOS

<Tip>
Always ensure your browser is updated to at least these minimum versions to avoid compatibility issues.
</Tip>

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

Because uBO Scope targets browsers that are cross-platform, support extends to:

- **Windows** (all major editions supported by the chosen browser)
- **macOS** (latest and recent previous versions)
- **Linux** (any distributions running a supported Chromium or Firefox version)
- **Android** (Firefox only for uBO Scope mobile support as of now)
- **iOS** (Safari extension support starting with recent iOS versions)


---

## 3. Extension Permissions and Host Access

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor and report network connections properly. These permissions are declared in the extension manifests per browser and are essential for functionality.

### Core Permissions Used

- **`activeTab`** — Allows the extension to interact with the currently active browser tab.
- **`storage`** — For saving session data such as connection details and settings.
- **`webRequest`** — Fundamental for intercepting and observing network requests to report on third-party connections.

### Host Permissions

uBO Scope needs broad access to effectively observe network requests, including all HTTP(S) and WebSocket traffic:

- `https://*/*`
- `http://*/*`
- `wss://*/*` (Chromium & Firefox only)
- `ws://*/*` (Chromium & Firefox only)

<Tip>
Due to browser API restrictions, some protocols like WebSocket (`ws://` and `wss://`) might not be supported on Safari.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Network and Privacy Considerations

- The extension relies on the browser's `webRequest` API, which means it can only observe network requests routed through this API.
- Requests made outside the scope of `webRequest` (such as some internal browser processes or extensions) cannot be captured.
- uBO Scope does not interfere with network traffic; it is purely observational.

<Warning>
Ensure your browser does not restrict access to the `webRequest` API for extensions, as this will prevent uBO Scope from functioning correctly.
</Warning>

## 5. Summary of Technical Requirements

| Requirement           | Details                                            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Browser version      | Chrome ≥ 122, Firefox ≥ 128, Safari ≥ 18.5          |
| Operating systems    | Windows, macOS, Linux, Android (Firefox), iOS (Safari) |
| Permissions          | activeTab, storage, webRequest                      |
| Host permissions     | Access to http, https, ws, wss URLs (subject to browser) |

## 6. Confirming Your Environment

Before installation, verify your system meets these requirements:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Your Browser Version">
Open your browser's About page (e.g., `chrome://settings/help` for Chrome) and confirm your version matches or exceeds the minimum required.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Extension Permissions">
Ensure your browser allows extensions access to requested permissions, particularly `webRequest` and host permissions.
</Step>
<Step title="Network Configuration">
Confirm no firewall, VPN, or security software is blocking or manipulating browser network access that might interfere with extension operation.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
These checks will help you avoid common pitfalls like permissions being blocked or the extension running on unsupported browser versions.
</Note>

## 7. Next Steps

Once you have confirmed your environment aligns with these requirements, you can proceed to the installation.

- See the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/essentials/installation) for detailed instructions to install uBO Scope in your browser.
- After installation, refer to [First-Time Configuration](/getting-started/first-steps/basic-configuration) to get uBO Scope ready for use.

## 8. Troubleshooting Environment Issues

If you encounter problems such as the extension failing to activate or not reporting any connections, consider:

- **Browser Version Too Low**: Upgrade to the supported version.
- **Permissions Denied**: Check browser extension permissions in settings.
- **Browser API Limitations**: Some browsers may have partial API support (e.g., Safari and WebSocket monitoring).
- **Conflicting Extensions**: Disable other network-monitoring or content-blocking extensions temporarily to isolate issues.
