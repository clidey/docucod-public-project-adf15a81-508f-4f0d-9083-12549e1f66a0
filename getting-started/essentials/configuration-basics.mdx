## 2. Granting Necessary Permissions

uBO Scope requires a minimal set of permissions to monitor network connections effectively and respect your privacy.

### What Permissions Does uBO Scope Need?

- **Access to Tab Data:** Needed to track and display per-tab network activity.
- **webRequest API Access:** Enables interception and categorization of network requests.
- **Storage Access:** For saving session data and public suffix lists securely.

### How to Check Permissions

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. If prompted, allow the permissions requested.
3. Alternatively, check the extension's page in your browser's extensions manager to verify that permissions are granted.

<Warning>

</Warning>

## 3. Opening uBO Scope for the First Time

Now that the extension is installed, pinned, and permissions granted, let's open uBO Scope to view the network connections for your current active tab.

### Steps to Open the Popup UI

1. Click the **uBO Scope** icon in your toolbar.
2. The popup window will appear showing three sections:
   - **Not Blocked:** Domains for which connections were allowed.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains stealthily blocked without alerting the webpage.
   - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked by other content blockers.
3. The header shows the current tab's hostname and domain.
4. At the top or on the icon, you will see a badge count indicating the number of unique third-party domains connected.


<Tip>
If the popup displays ‘NO DATA’ or remains empty, refresh the active tab’s page to allow uBO Scope to collect connection data.
</Tip>

## 4. Basic Configuration Cues

uBO Scope works immediately without requiring in-depth user configuration. However, keep these points in mind to avoid confusion.

- The **badge count** represents the number of distinct third-party domains from which your current tab has connections.
- The extension categorizes domains into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked based on network request outcomes.
- If you see zero or unexpectedly low counts shortly after installation, ensure you have activated the extension and refreshed tabs.

<Note>
There is no complex setup required. uBO Scope’s design emphasizes zero friction for first-time users.
</Note>

### Problem: No Data in Popup on Opening

- Refresh the active tab’s page.
- Confirm you have allowed needed permissions in your browser.
