# Your First Session with uBO Scope

Welcome to your first session using uBO Scope! This guide will help you open your browser, activate the uBO Scope extension popup, and understand how to interpret its core data: the badge count and the categorized list of remote connections. By the end of this tutorial, you'll confidently use uBO Scope to visualize all third-party network connections for the webpages you visit.

---

## 1. Open Your Browser and Navigate to a Webpage

1. Launch your preferred supported browser: Chrome (version 122 or later), Firefox (128 or later), or Safari (18.5 or later).
2. Visit any webpage of your choice that you want to analyze for remote server connections.

> Note: uBO Scope monitors all network requests your browser makes for the active tab, including those that are attempted or successfully completed, irrespective of your content blocking settings.


## 2. Activate the uBO Scope Popup

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. This icon features the uBO Scope logo corresponding to your platform.
2. Click the icon once to open the uBO Scope popup window. This popup presents detailed information about the remote connections originating from the current webpage.

> Tip: If the icon is not visible, ensure the extension is installed and enabled. Refer to the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/introduction-setup/installation) for help.


## 3. Understanding the Popup Interface

Upon opening, the uBO Scope popup displays three main connection categories and a summary header:

### Header: Current Tab Hostname

- Shows the hostname and domain of the current active tab.
- This helps confirm which webpage's connections you are reviewing.

### Summary Section

- Displays the count of distinct third-party domains the webpage has connected to.
- This badge count is replicated on the toolbar icon as a quick privacy exposure indicator.

### Connection Categories

The connections are grouped as follows:

- **Not Blocked**: Domains from which network requests succeeded without being blocked. These represent allowed third-party connections.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains for which requests were redirected or blocked stealthily without explicit indication. These often involve redirects or silent filtering techniques.
- **Blocked**: Domains for which network requests failed or were explicitly blocked by content blockers or network policies.

> Note: The categorization is driven by real network outcomes, offering an accurate picture unaffected by content blocker block counts.


## 4. Interpreting the Badge Count

- The badge number on the toolbar icon and inside the popup's summary shows the total count of **distinct allowed third-party domains**.
- A lower number indicates fewer third-party servers accessed, which typically translates to better privacy.
- Not all third-party connections are malicious or unwanted; common legitimate third parties include content delivery networks (CDNs) and essential service providers.


## 5. Walkthrough: Viewing Connections for the First Time

Follow these simple steps to see uBO Scope in action:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a webpage">
Open your browser and navigate to any website you want to analyze.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon">
Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup displaying connection information.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the hostname">
Confirm the hostname shown matches the webpage you are inspecting.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the badge count and summary">
Note the number indicating distinct allowed third-party domains connected.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore the categorized connection lists">
Expand each section: Not Blocked, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked to see domain details and request counts.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 6. Practical Tips for Your First Session

- **Refresh the page**: The popup updates dynamically with real-time connection data for the current tab.
- **Multiple tabs**: Each tab has its own badge count and popup data.
- **Interpreting counts**: Counting domains, not individual requests, helps reduce noise and focuses on unique third-party entities.
- **Unicode domains**: Domains are shown in human-readable format using Punycode decoding.


## 7. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **No data displayed**: Ensure you are clicking the icon on an active tab with a loaded webpage. Some internal pages or browser-specific pages do not generate network requests.
- **Badge is blank**: A blank badge indicates zero allowed third-party domains connected, meaning either no connections or all third-party requests are blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked empty**: Not all sites use stealth blocking techniques; this section can remain empty unless such activity is detected.


## 8. Next Steps After Your First Session

- Use the popup regularly to observe how websites you visit connect to third parties.
- Experiment by enabling or disabling content blockers to observe changes in connection counts.
- Refer to the [Interpreting the Badge Count and Popup Results](/guides/core-workflows/interpreting-badge-and-results) guide for deeper insights.
- Explore the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/first-steps-validation/troubleshooting) page if you encounter any problems.

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Your First Session">
<Accordion title="Why doesn't the uBO Scope icon appear in my browser toolbar?">
Make sure the extension is installed and enabled. Check browser extension settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why does the popup show 'NO DATA'?">
Ensure you are on a webpage (not a browser settings or new tab page). Reload the page and try again.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is the badge count unexpectedly high or low?">
Remember the count shows distinct allowed third-party domains, not the total number of blocked or attempted connections. A high count reflects more third-party connections.

## How It Works Behind the Scenes (Primer)

- uBO Scope uses browser `webRequest` APIs to listen to network events (successful, redirected, or blocked).
- It organizes these by browser tab and aggregates outcomes per unique domains.
- Domains are derived using an internal public suffix list to identify registrable domains from hostnames.
- The extension dynamically updates the badge count and popup UI reflecting the current tabâ€™s connections.

> This accurate monitoring works regardless of other content blockers or DNS filtering enabled.

## Visual Example: Popup Layout

```plaintext
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Hostname Header: example.com                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| domains connected: 12                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| not blocked                                         |
|   - cdn.example.net (5)                              |
|   - images.example.com (2)                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| stealth-blocked                                     |
|   - redirect.example.org (1)                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| blocked                                            |
|   - ads.example.net (3)                              |
