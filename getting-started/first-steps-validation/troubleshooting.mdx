## 1. Installation Problems

### Common Symptoms
- Extension does not appear in your browser’s toolbar.
- Installation fails with an error message.
- Extension disappears after browser restart.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Verify Supported Browser and Version**
   - Ensure you are using a supported browser:
     - **Chrome:** version 122.0 or higher
     - **Firefox:** version 128.0 or higher
     - **Safari:** version 18.5 or higher
   - Older browser versions will not support the extension properly.

2. **Use Official Extension Stores**
   - Install uBO Scope only from the official stores to ensure compatibility and authenticity:
     - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
     - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
     - For Safari, follow your browser’s recommended installation process.

3. **Check for Browser Policies or Restrictions**
   - In managed environments (e.g., corporate), extensions might be blocked.
   - Confirm no policies or antivirus software are preventing installation.

4. **Reinstall the Extension**
   - Remove the extension completely, then reinstall using the official source.

5. **Restart Your Browser**
   - After installation, restart the browser to ensure the extension loads correctly.

## 2. Missing or Denied Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to operate correctly, primarily to monitor web requests and store session data.

### Key Permissions
- **`webRequest`**: To collect network connections.
- **`storage`**: To save session and domain data.
- **`activeTab`**: To access details of the active browser tab.

### Troubleshooting Permission Issues
1. **Prompt Denied**
   - If the browser prompts for permissions during install or first use, and you deny them, uBO Scope will not function as expected.
   - Solution: Re-enable permissions by managing the extension settings in your browser’s extensions page.

2. **Check Extension Settings**
   - Navigate to your browser’s extensions manager.
   - Find uBO Scope and verify all required permissions are granted.

3. **Reinstall if Permissions Are Persistently Not Applied**
   - Remove and reinstall the extension to reset permission prompts.

4. **Browser Restrictions**
   - Some browsers or environments may restrict permission grants by policy. Check with your administrator if applicable.

## 3. Unresponsive or Blank Extension Popup

If clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon shows a blank or unresponsive popup, use these steps:

1. **Reload the Extension Popup**
   - Close the popup and click the icon again.
   - For persistent issues, restart the browser.

2. **Confirm the Extension Is Enabled**
   - In extensions manager, verify uBO Scope is enabled.

3. **Check for JavaScript Errors**
   - Open your browser’s developer tools (usually F12 or right-click > Inspect) and check the Console when opening the popup.
   - Errors related to `popup.js` or resources not loading indicate installation or permissions problems.

4. **Clear Browser Cache and Data**
   - Sometimes stale data causes UI issues. Clearing cache can help.

5. **Check Network Requests Are Being Captured**
   - uBO Scope relies on browser `webRequest` API to capture data.
   - Browse to a webpage and see if the badge updates. If not, webRequest API may be blocked or not supported.

6. **Restart the Browser**
   - Often resolves transient glitches with service worker or extension background scripts.

## 4. Unexpected or Inaccurate Badge Count

The badge count on the toolbar icon represents the number of distinct third-party remote servers successfully connected **not blocked** by your browser or content blockers.

### Common Causes and Fixes

| Issue                          | Description & Fix                                                        |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Badge Count Is Always Zero     | This indicates uBO Scope is not tracking any network requests.
- Confirm permissions and installation.
- Make sure you are browsing active tabs.
- Restart the browser.
| Badge Count Higher Than Expected | Some connections are allowed through by content blockers or occur outside of blocking scope.
- This is expected behavior reflecting true exposure.
- Review your content blocker settings if you want to reduce connections.
| Badge Not Updating After Navigations | The extension may have lost tracking or background script stopped.
- Reload browser.
- Clear browsing data.
| Badge Not Clearing After Tab Closed | Session data might be cached.
- Restart browser to clear session.
