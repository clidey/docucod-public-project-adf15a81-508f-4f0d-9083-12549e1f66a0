# Quick Validation Checklist for uBO Scope

This guide helps you quickly confirm that uBO Scope is installed correctly and operating as expected in your browser. It highlights the key indicators to verify your setup immediately, so you can trust that the extension is actively monitoring your network connections.

---

## 1. Check the Badge Icon on the Toolbar

- After installing uBO Scope, look at the extension’s toolbar icon in your browser.
- The badge should show a numeric count representing the number of distinct third-party domains that have connected during your current browsing session.
- ✅ A visible count (not empty) generally means uBO Scope is active and monitoring network connections.
- ⚠️ If the badge is blank or missing, ensure the extension is enabled and reload the page.

<Tip>
The badge count updates dynamically based on your browsing activity, giving you an at-a-glance privacy exposure metric.
</Tip>

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup window.
- This popup displays detailed categorized connection data collected from the active tab:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains from which content was successfully loaded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains for which connections were redirected stealthily by content blocking.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where requests were actively blocked.
- The popup header shows the tab's hostname and domain, helping you confirm which site’s data you are analyzing.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Popup and Observe Header">
Click the uBO Scope icon to see the popup with your current tab’s hostname and domain displayed clearly at the top.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domain Lists">
Check each domain list (Not Blocked, Stealth-Blocked, Blocked) for entries. Presence of domain names indicates active data tracking.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Summary Count">
Verify the total number of connected domains is listed under "domains connected:" reflecting data counted in the popup.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The counts and domains update live as you browse sites with network activity.
</Note>

---

## 3. Verify Network Request Monitoring

- uBO Scope utilizes browser APIs to listen to and categorize network requests.
- Successful operation is indicated by seeing varied domains listed in the popup with increasing counts as you navigate dynamic sites.
- If counts remain at zero over several sessions of active browsing, re-check permissions and browser compatibility.

<Tip>
Try visiting a complex webpage (e.g., news site or social platform) and then open the popup to confirm domains appear.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Appearing or Updating">
- Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser's extension settings.
- Refresh your active tab or open a new tab and visit a site with network requests.
- Check that browser permissions to observe web requests are granted.
- Restart the browser if the problem persists.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty">
- Confirm uBO Scope has permission to access the active tab.
- Reload the tab and try again after some network activity.
- Verify you are using a supported browser version (Chrome ≥ 122, Firefox ≥ 128, Safari ≥ 18.5).
- Clear browser cache and restart.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpectedly High or Low Badge Counts">
- Remember the badge reflects distinct third-party server connections, not just block counts.
- Some legitimate domains (like CDNs) may contribute to counts.
- No action needed unless counts are static despite browsing different sites.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
