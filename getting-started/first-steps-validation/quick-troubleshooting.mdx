# Quick Troubleshooting Scenarios

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve common issues encountered during the initial setup and first use of uBO Scope. Whether the extension's toolbar badge isn't showing, the popup panel appears empty, or connection counts seem incorrect, these practical scenarios and solutions ensure you can confidently verify your installation and start benefiting from transparent network connection reporting.

## 1. Toolbar Badge is Missing or Not Updating

The toolbar badge provides a live count of distinct third-party servers your current tab connects to. If you don't see the badge or the number does not change as you browse, follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm Extension Installation and Activation">
Ensure that uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your browser's extensions/add-ons manager.
- **Chrome/Edge:** Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` and verify uBO Scope is enabled.
- **Firefox:** Go to `about:addons` > Extensions.
- **Safari:** Check Safari preferences under Extensions.
</Step>
<Step title="Pin uBO Scope to Toolbar">
Pin the extension to your toolbar so the badge is visible:
- Click your browser's extension icon menu.
- Find uBO Scope and click the pin icon.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload the Active Tab">
Sometimes the badge requires a tab refresh to initialize properly.
- Press `Ctrl+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+R` (macOS).
- Confirm the badge count updates based on new network activity.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Browser Permissions">
uBO Scope needs the `webRequest` and `activeTab` permissions to operate:
- Verify permissions in the extension details page.
- If permissions are restricted, adjust your browser settings or reinstall.
</Step>
<Step title="Restart Your Browser">
A quick restart reloads extensions and resolves transient issues.
- Close all browser windows.
- Reopen the browser and reload the tab.
- Check if the badge appears and updates.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If using Firefox on Android, ensure your browser version is at least 128.0 due to minimum version requirements.
</Note>

## 2. Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists

When you open uBO Scope's popup, it displays connection statistics grouped as "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked." Seeing "NO DATA" or empty sections means the extension hasn't captured network requests for the active tab.

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify the Active Tab is Loaded">
uBO Scope collects data per active tab. Make sure the tab has finished loading a webpage that initiates network connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload the Page to Trigger Network Requests">
Refresh the tab to generate fresh network activity for the extension to observe.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Extension is Ready">
uBO Scope internally loads a public suffix list and session data at startup. Give it a few seconds after browser launch to initialize before opening the popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Check for Content Blockers Interference">
Some content blockers might interfere or silently block needed browser APIs.
- Temporarily disable other content blocking extensions.
- Revisit the site and open the popup again.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Console for Errors">
Open the popup's developer console (right-click inside popup > Inspect) to check for errors that might indicate issues in extension communication or data reception.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you often encounter empty data in the popup, try visiting commonly network-active pages (e.g., news sites, social media) to confirm data capture works.
</Tip>

## 3. Connection Counts Appear Incorrect or Unexpected

You might notice the badge count or popup domain lists showing different numbers than expected. This typically relates to how uBO Scope counts unique third-party domains rather than total requests or blocked items.

<Steps>
<Step title="Understand What the Badge Counts">
The badge counts **unique third-party remote servers** your current tab connects to that were allowed or stealth-blocked, not total network requests.

This means a high number indicates more third-party connections, lower is typically better for privacy.
</Step>
<Step title="Check for Stealth or Blocked Domains">
Open the popup to see how connections are categorized:
- **Not Blocked:** Connections allowed through.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections suppressed stealthily by content blockers.
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked.

The popup detail clarifies counts per domain.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Your Content Blockers and DNS Settings">
Different content blockers or DNS-level filters can influence which connections are allowed or blocked.
- Note uBO Scope reports based on browser's `webRequest` API visibility.
- Some network requests outside the API scope may not show.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload Tabs and Monitor Changes">
Refresh the page after changing content blocker settings and watch the badge and popup to observe dynamic updates.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Don't rely on block counts from other extensions or 'ad blocker test' pages as they may misrepresent actual network connection behavior.
</Warning>

## 4. General Troubleshooting Tips

- **Ensure Browser Compatibility:** Use supported browser versions (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- **Update Extension:** Confirm you have the latest uBO Scope version (1.0.1 or newer).
- **Cross-Check Installation:** Follow browser-specific installation procedures.
- **Allow Time to Initialize:** After browser start, wait a few seconds for internal data loads.
- **Use Realistic Browsing Scenarios:** Visit real websites with typical third-party network activity.
- **Inspect Browser Console Logs:** For advanced troubleshooting, check browser console for errors or warnings related to uBO Scope.
