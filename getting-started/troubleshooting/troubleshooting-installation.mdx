# Troubleshooting Installation & First Use

When installing and launching the uBO Scope browser extension, you may encounter common hiccups such as the extension icon badge not appearing, permissions issues, or the extension failing to record network activities as expected. This guide provides targeted solutions to these initial challenges, helping you get uBO Scope up and running smoothly.

---

## 1. Badge Not Appearing on Toolbar Icon

The toolbar badge indicates the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected on the active tab — it’s your primary visual cue that uBO Scope is functioning. If the badge does not appear:

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Verify Installation Was Successful**
   - Confirm uBO Scope is installed in your browser extensions list.
   - For Chromium and Firefox, look for the uBO Scope icon near the address bar.

2. **Check Browser Version Compatibility**
   - Ensure your browser meets minimum version requirements:
     - Chromium: 122 or higher
     - Firefox: 128 or higher
     - Safari: 18.5 or higher

3. **Confirm Extension Permissions**
   - uBO Scope requires permissions: `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`. Verify these permissions are granted.
   - Sometimes, after installation, permissions may be blocked or require user confirmation.

4. **Reload the Browser and Extension**
   - Restart your browser to ensure background scripts initialize.
   - If necessary, disable and re-enable uBO Scope in your extensions manager.

5. **Open a Webpage with Third-Party Connections**
   - Navigate to a content-rich website known to connect with third-party domains.
   - The badge count should update to reflect distinct third-party connections.

6. **Check for Conflicting Extensions**
   - Some extensions may interfere with others’ ability to access browser APIs.
   - Temporarily disable other extensions, especially other blockers or privacy tools, and check if the badge appears.

### Common Pitfalls

- Installing uBO Scope but never visiting a site that generates third-party network requests.
- Using incognito/private browsing without explicitly enabling uBO Scope for those sessions.

<Warning>
If the badge is still missing, inspect your browser’s extension management for errors or blocked access. Certain restrictive corporate policies or antivirus software can also prevent extension functionality.
</Warning>

## 2. Extension Installed But No Network Activity Recorded

If uBO Scope’s badge shows zero or remains empty despite browsing activity, it means no third-party remote servers are detected or recorded.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Verify Network Activity Triggers**
   - Open a new tab and visit sites known for third-party content (e.g., news sites, large e-commerce).
   - Confirm the toolbar badge updates accordingly.

2. **Check the Popup Panel
**
   - Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
   - The panel should list domains under "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", or "blocked" categories along with connection counts.
   - If it only shows "NO DATA", uBO Scope is not receiving network events.

3. **Ensure Browser API Support**
   - uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network requests.
   - Some browsers or environments may restrict this API or its scope.

4. **Review Content Blocker Interaction**n
   - uBO Scope functions independently of content blockers but must receive raw network data.
   - If your content blocker aggressively hides network requests or browser restricts access, uBO Scope may miss information.

5. **Clear Browser Cache and Restart**
   - Clearing the cache can reset network state and permissions.
   - Restart the browser to refresh extensions.

6. **Reinstall uBO Scope**
   - Remove and reinstall the extension from official stores to fix corrupted installs.

<Note>
You can confirm uBO Scope is working correctly by visiting this page with third-party resources and observing the badge rise and domain listings in the popup.
</Note>

## 3. Permissions Issues and Extension Not Functioning

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network connections. If these permissions are denied, the extension cannot function properly.

### Resolving Permissions Issues

1. **Review Extension Permissions page**
   - In your browser's extension settings, confirm uBO Scope has these permissions:
     - `activeTab`
     - `storage`
     - `webRequest`
     - host permissions for URLs starting with `http://`, `https://`, `ws://`, and `wss://`.

2. **Manually Enable Permissions if Needed**
   - Some browsers prompt for permission after installation - respond affirmatively.

3. **Avoid Browser Restrictions**
   - Some browsers may restrict extensions from running in incognito/private mode unless explicitly allowed.
   - Enable uBO Scope in private mode if you wish to use it there.

4. **Corporate or Security Software Policies**
   - Some workplaces or security software may block extension permissions.
   - If possible, whitelist uBO Scope or check with your administrator.

## 4. Extension Icon Missing or Not Visible

If you cannot find the uBO Scope icon after installation:

### Actionable Steps

1. **Check Extension Toolbar Visibility**
   - In Chromium and Firefox, extensions may be hidden behind an overflow menu (`puzzle` icon).
   - Pin uBO Scope icon to the toolbar for easy access.

2. **Reinstall from Official Stores**
   - Use the verified installation links:
     - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
     - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

3. **Restart Browser After Installation**
   - This ensures all UI components initialize correctly.

4. **Verify Browser Compatibility**
   - Unsupported or outdated browser versions may not support extension action icons.

<Warning>
Make sure you are not running in a browser profile that disables extensions or has overridden UI behavior.
</Warning>

## 5. Network Requests Not Tracked as Expected

Sometimes it may appear that uBO Scope does not track network requests fully or correctly.

### Causes and Fixes

1. **Network Requests Out of Scope**
   - uBO Scope captures requests monitored by the browser `webRequest` API only.
   - Some browser features or apps use network connections invisible to this API (e.g., certain service workers, extensions, or native apps).

2. **Content Blocker or DNS-level Blocking**
   - Though uBO Scope reports independently, some DNS or system-level blocking will result in requests not reaching the API.

3. **WebSocket Support Differences**
   - Some browsers may limit the tracking of WebSocket (`ws://` or `wss://`) connections.

4. **Reload or Clear Extension Data**
   - Close all tabs, reload the extension, and clear storage data if glitches appear.

## 6. Quick Diagnostic Checklist

- Install uBO Scope from official sources.
- Ensure browser version matches minimal requirements.
- Confirm extension permissions include `webRequest` and active tab permissions.
- Reload your browser after installation.
- Pin the extension icon to your browser toolbar.
- Visit a webpage with third-party content; watch the badge update.
- Open the popup panel to check domain connection results.
- Disable conflicting extensions if data is missing.

## 8. When to Seek Help

If after following these troubleshooting steps your extension still does not function correctly:

- Check your browser’s developer console for extension-related errors.
- Visit the [uBO Scope GitHub repository issue tracker](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/issues) for known issues or to report a new problem.
- Consult browser extension support forums for your specific browser.


<Tip>
Keeping your browser and extensions up to date is the best way to avoid permissions and compatibility issues with uBO Scope.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Remember, uBO Scope’s badge count reflects unique third-party remote server connections. Absence of the badge or zero count means no such traffic is detected for the current active tab.
