# Troubleshooting First Use

Understanding the initial issues you might face after installing uBO Scope is crucial for a smooth experience. This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve common problems such as the popup not showing data, the badge count not updating, or unexpected results appearing. By following these practical debugging steps, you can ensure uBO Scope accurately reports third-party connections and provides reliable insights.

---

## 1. Common Issues and Their Solutions

### 1.1 Popup Displays 'NO DATA' or Appears Empty

When clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon, if the popup shows 'NO DATA' or no domain connections are listed, consider the following:

- **Verify Active Tab**: uBO Scope reports connections only from the active browser tab. Ensure you are viewing a fully loaded webpage in the current tab.
- **Check Permissions**: Confirm you granted the extension all required permissions at installation and browser prompt, especially access to network requests (`webRequest`).
- **Reload the Tab**: Network monitoring starts fresh upon page load. Reload the webpage to trigger new network requests.

<Tip>
If the page is a browser internal page (e.g., `chrome://` or `about:` URLs), uBO Scope cannot access network data, resulting in no information.
</Tip>

### 1.2 Toolbar Badge Does Not Update or Remains Blank

The badge on the toolbar icon indicates the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected. If this number does not appear or fails to update:

- **Ensure Page Activity**: The badge updates only when a webpage makes outbound network connections. Open a website with active remote requests.
- **Browser Compatibility and Version**: Verify you are using a supported browser version (`Chrome 122+`, `Firefox 128+`, or `Safari 18.5+`). Earlier versions may block or restrict background scripting.
- **Extension Conflicts**: Disable other content blockers or extensions temporarily to check for interference.

### 1.3 Unexpected or Odd Connection Counts

If you notice unusually high or low counts of connections:

- **Understand What Counts**: uBO Scope counts distinct third-party domains successfully connected, not every resource requested.
- **Check Content Blockers**: Other blockers may stealth-block or silently allow connections, affecting the count.
- **Reload and Test Fixed Sites**: Retry with popular websites known to have typical third-party counts to calibrate expectations.

## 2. Step-by-Step Debugging Workflow

Follow these precise steps to identify and resolve issues with uBO Scope's active monitoring:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Extension Permissions">
1. Open your browser's extension management page (`chrome://extensions`, `about:addons`, or Safari Extensions).
2. Find uBO Scope and click on "Details".
3. Confirm all permissions, especially "Access your data on websites" and "Read and modify network requests", are enabled.
4. If any permissions are missing, remove and reinstall the extension.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload and Test a Popular Website">
1. Open a well-known site that loads third-party content (e.g., https://news.ycombinator.com/).
2. Wait for the site to fully load.
3. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon; check if the popup shows connection data.
4. Observe the toolbar badge; it should display a non-zero count if third-party connections exist.
</Step>
<Step title="Disable Other Extensions to Avoid Conflicts">
1. Temporarily disable other content blockers or privacy extensions.
2. Reload the website and check if uBO Scope reports connections properly.
</Step>
<Step title="Clear Browser Cache and Cookies">
1. Clear cache related to the active tab.
2. Reload the site to force all network requests anew.
</Step>
<Step title="Restart the Browser">
Completely close all browser windows and restart to ensure the extension's background service is freshly loaded.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Browser Version Compatibility">
Ensure you meet minimum browser requirements:
- Chrome version 122 or higher
- Firefox version 128 or higher
- Safari version 18.5 or higher
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Troubleshooting Tips and Best Practices

- **Do Not Expect Data on Local or Internal Pages:** uBO Scope cannot monitor network requests on browser internals or local files.
- **Network Request API Limitations:** Some browser-level blockers or VPNs may prevent webRequest API events from firing, limiting visibility.
- **Patience with Badge Updates:** Badge text may update after subtle network events or delayed responses; allow a few seconds after page load.
- **Avoid Popups from Background Tabs:** Only the active tab’s data is displayed; switching tabs clears and reloads data.

## 4. When to Seek Further Help

If issues persist after these steps:

- Revisit the [System Requirements](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/system-requirements) and [Installing uBO Scope](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/installing-extension) guides to confirm proper setup.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Installation](/getting-started/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-install) guide for installation-specific issues.
- Check for known issues or submit questions via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).

## 5. Summary

Troubleshooting first use revolves around understanding permissions, ensuring your browsing environment meets the requirements, and confirming that web requests are properly monitored and reported. By systematically verifying permissions, browser compatibility, and interference from other extensions, you will regain full visibility into third-party network requests. Remember, uBO Scope relies on the browser's webRequest API and can only report connections it sees — limitations from browser internals or network conditions may impact functionality.

<Tip>
Proactively reload pages after installation and permission grants to kickstart uBO Scope's monitoring. If you open the popup too early or on a page without network activity, you may see no information—this is expected behavior.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Do not use ad blocker test pages or fake test sites expecting realistic results. uBO Scope reports actual network connections from real websites, providing reliable and actionable insights.
</Warning>
