# Extension Not Showing Data?

If uBO Scope is not reporting any network requests or showing "NO DATA" in the popup panel, this guide will help you troubleshoot and resolve common visibility issues. This page focuses specifically on ensuring uBO Scope has the necessary permissions, that no other extensions are interfering, and that your active browser tab is properly supported.

---

## 1. Confirm Browser Permissions

uBO Scope relies on powerful browser APIs to observe all network connections. Missing or denied permissions prevent the extension from gathering data.

### Action Steps:

- Open your browser’s extension management page.
- Locate uBO Scope and check its permissions.
- Ensure the extension has access to the following permissions:
  - **webRequest**: Required to monitor network traffic.
  - **activeTab**: Required to access the active browser tab's details.
  - **Host permissions** for URLs matching `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and where applicable WebSocket origins (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).
- If permissions requests appeared during installation, ensure you approved them.

<Tip>
Without these permissions, uBO Scope cannot detect or categorize network requests.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Verify That uBO Scope Is Enabled

Sometimes the extension may be installed but disabled.

### Action Steps:

- Go to the browser’s extensions page.
- Confirm the toggle next to uBO Scope is ON (enabled).
- If disabled, enable it and reload your browser tab.

---

## 3. Check for Conflicting or Blocking Extensions

Other security, privacy, or developer extensions may interfere with uBO Scope’s ability to read network events.

### Action Steps:

- Temporarily disable other extensions, especially those that handle network traffic or content blocking.
- Reload the tab you are monitoring.
- Open uBO Scope’s popup to check if data now appears.

<Tip>
Running uBO Scope in a clean profile or disabling extensions selectively helps isolate conflicts.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Ensure You Are Viewing a Supported Tab

uBO Scope only monitors network requests in active tabs with standard web content.

### Action Steps:

- Confirm you are on a normal HTTP or HTTPS webpage.
- uBO Scope’s badge and popup show data relevant to the currently active tab only.
- Extensions or pages without standard network requests (e.g., the browser’s internal pages like `about:` or `chrome://`) will not report data.

<Warning>
If you switch tabs, the popup automatically updates for the newly active tab. If that tab has no network activity, data will not show.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Reload the Active Tab and the Extension Popup

Network data is collected when pages load or generate network traffic.

### Action Steps:

- Reload the webpage in the active tab to trigger new network requests.
- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup panel.
- Check if domain lists and connection counts populate.

<Tip>
If no new requests trigger, try navigating to a different page to force fresh network activity.
</Tip>

---

## 6. Review the Toolbar Badge and Popup UI

- The toolbar badge shows the number of unique third-party remote servers connected during the active tab’s browsing.
- The popup panel breaks down connections into "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" categories.

If the badge shows “0”, but your site loads normally, it can indicate either no external connections or that uBO Scope is not capturing data.

---

## 7. Advanced: Check Browser Console for Extension Errors

Technical users can investigate errors or warnings in the browser’s developer console which might explain why uBO Scope is not functioning.

### How to Access:
- In Chromium-based browsers: `Ctrl+Shift+J` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+J` (Mac).
- In Firefox: `Ctrl+Shift+K` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+K` (Mac).
- Look for any error messages related to uBO Scope or its background scripts.

## 8. Common Pitfalls and How to Resolve Them

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Fixes">
<Accordion title="Permission Denied for Web Request API">
- **Symptom:** No network data and errors about permissions.
- **Fix:** Reinstall the extension and ensure you approve all permission requests.
- Verify your browser version meets minimum requirements.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Toolbar Icon Missing or Inactive">
- **Symptom:** Extension icon doesn’t appear or is grayed out.
- **Fix:** Check if the extension is enabled and pinned to the toolbar.
- Ensure the browser is not in a restricted mode or profile.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Data on Internal or Secure Tabs">
- **Symptom:** Popup shows “NO DATA” for browser internal pages.
- **Fix:** This is expected behavior; uBO Scope only monitors standard webpages.
- Test on a regular HTTP(S) site instead.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Conflicts with Other Network Monitoring Extensions">
- **Symptom:** No updates or missing network requests.
- **Fix:** Disable or remove conflicting extensions temporarily to isolate the issue.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Check>
If after following all the above steps, you still see no data, ensure your browser is up to date and no firewall or privacy software outside the browser is blocking network observation.
