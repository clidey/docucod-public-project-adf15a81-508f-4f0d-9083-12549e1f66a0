# Installation Issues & Permissions

This page addresses the most common installation and permission-related challenges users may face when installing or running uBO Scope across supported browsers. It provides clear, actionable solutions to ensure smooth setup and proper extension functionality.

---

## 1. Understanding Permission Requirements

uBO Scope relies on key browser permissions to monitor network requests and display connection data accurately. Without these permissions properly granted, the extension cannot function as intended.

### Required Permissions:
- **`webRequest`** — Allows uBO Scope to observe network requests and their outcomes.
- **`storage`** — Stores session data and suffix lists.
- **`activeTab`** — Accesses the currently active tab to correlate network data.
- **Host permissions** — Access to all HTTP and HTTPS URLs (`http://*/*` and `https://*/*`, plus websocket permissions on some browsers).


<Tip>
Always grant full host permissions during installation if prompted; declining or restricting these will limit uBO Scope’s visibility into network requests, reducing accuracy.
</Tip>

## 2. Common Installation and Permission Errors by Browser

### Chromium (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)

- **Issue:** Extension fails to install or does not activate network monitoring.
  
  **Solution:**
  1. Ensure your Chromium browser version is **122 or higher**.
  2. Install uBO Scope from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
  3. When prompted for permissions, accept all, especially `webRequest` and full host access.
  4. After installation, verify the extension’s icon is visible in the toolbar and shows a badge count after loading some web pages.

- **Permissions Not Working:**
  
  Sometimes Chrome disables host permissions to limit extension access.

  **Fix:**
  - Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
  - Find uBO Scope.
  - Click "Details" and confirm "Site access" is set to "On all sites" or "When you click the extension" (choose the former for full functionality).

### Firefox

- **Issue:** Extension installs, but data does not update, or permission prompts appear repeatedly.

  **Solution:**
  1. Confirm your Firefox version is **128 or higher**.
  2. Install uBO Scope from [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
  3. Check that you accept the requested permissions.
  4. Firefox may require manually enabling the `webRequest` permission due to strict security models.

- **Known limitation:** Firefox's WebExtension API restricts certain webRequest capabilities on some platforms, potentially reducing data tracking.

### Safari

- **Issue:** Extension does not load or fails on version older than 18.5.

  **Solution:**
  1. Verify you are running **Safari 18.5 or later**.
  2. Safari restricts extension capabilities heavily; ensure the extension is installed via Apple's approved mechanism.
  3. Accept all permission prompts.
  4. Safari’s manifest requires strict minimum version—running an unsupported version will silently block the extension.

- **Permissions:** Safari may not support full WebRequest API features. Expect partial data or reduced functionality.

## 3. Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Walkthrough

Follow these steps to diagnose and resolve common installation or permission problems:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Browser Compatibility and Version">
Check your browser version against uBO Scope’s minimum requirements:
- Chromium ≥ 122
- Firefox ≥ 128
- Safari ≥ 18.5

Update your browser if below these versions.
</Step>
<Step title="Reinstall Extension from Official Store">
Uninstall any existing uBO Scope installation.

Reinstall only from the official extension stores linked in the installation guide to avoid corrupted or outdated versions.
</Step>
<Step title="Grant All Requested Permissions">
During installation or first launch prompts, grant all permissions related to:
- WebRequest
- ActiveTab
- Storage
- Host access (all sites)

If denied, some features will not work.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Extension Settings for Site Access">
In your browser’s extension management page, verify that uBO Scope’s site access is allowed on all sites.

Adjust settings if restricted.
</Step>
<Step title="Test Extension on Sample Sites">
Reload common websites with visible third-party content.

Look for badge number updates and popup data changes.

If counts remain zero or no data appears, permissions may be incomplete or blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Console for Errors (Advanced)">
Open your browser’s developer console for the extension popup or background script.

Look for error messages indicating permission denials, API failures, or uncaught exceptions.

Use these clues to adjust browser or extension settings.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Best Practices to Avoid Permission Pitfalls

- **Do not disable or limit host permissions** after installation; doing so prevents network request monitoring.
- If you use strict privacy settings or blockers that manage extension permissions, whitelist uBO Scope.
- Keep your browser updated to leverage the latest WebExtension API improvements.
- After browser upgrades, verify that uBO Scope still has proper permissions — browsers sometimes reset or alter permissions post-update.

<Tip>
Regularly check your extension’s status and permissions, especially after browser updates or when encountering unexplained data disappearance.
</Tip>

## 5. What to Do If Problems Persist

- **Restart Browser:** After permission changes or updates, restart the browser.
- **Clear Browser Cache and Restart:** Some state inconsistencies can be resolved by clearing caches.
- **Disable Conflicting Extensions:** Certain extensions may interfere with WebRequest or storage APIs.
- **Consult Browser Logs:** Advanced users can inspect background page logs for detailed error insights.
- **Refer to Troubleshooting Guide:** See the broader [Troubleshooting & Common Issues](../troubleshooting-install) page.
- **Get Support:** Use the GitHub repository’s Issues page to report persistent or uncommon errors.

## 6. Quick Verification After Fixes

After applying fixes or reinstalling:

1. Navigate to any website with third-party content.
2. Observe the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge updating with a number.
3. Click the toolbar icon to open the popup and verify domain connection data is populated.

If these steps succeed, installation and permissions are properly configured.
