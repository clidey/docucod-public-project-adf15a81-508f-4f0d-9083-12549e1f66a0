# Troubleshooting Installation

This guide helps you resolve common installation issues with **uBO Scope**, such as missing permissions, unsupported browsers, or extension load failures. If you encounter problems launching or using the extension after installation, follow the troubleshooting steps below to identify and fix the root cause.

---

## 1. Verify Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope supports recent versions of major browsers, but minimum version requirements apply:

- **Google Chrome / Chromium-based browsers:** Version 122 or later
- **Mozilla Firefox:** Version 128 or later
- **Safari:** Version 18.5 or later


### How to check your browser version

- **Chrome:** Go to `chrome://settings/help`
- **Firefox:** Go to `about:support`
- **Safari:** Click on Safari > About Safari


> <Check>If your browser version is older than listed, update your browser to the latest stable release and then try reinstalling uBO Scope.</Check>

---

## 2. Confirm Extension Permissions

uBO Scope requires the following permissions to function correctly:

- `activeTab`
- `storage`
- `webRequest`

Additionally, the extension requests access to all HTTP and HTTPS sites (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`) plus WebSocket protocols for network analysis.

### Symptoms of missing permissions

- The extension icon doesn’t appear or is disabled.
- The badge never updates or shows "NO DATA" in the popup.
- Network requests are not detected or reported.

### How to check permissions

1. Navigate to your browser's extension or add-ons page:
   - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
   - Firefox: `about:addons`
   - Safari: Safari > Preferences > Extensions

2. Locate uBO Scope and click **Details** or equivalent.
3. Ensure it requests and has access to the above permissions.

> <Warning>If any permissions are missing or disabled, enable them and reload the extension or restart the browser.</Warning>

---

## 3. Reinstall the Extension

Sometimes installation can be corrupted or incomplete. Follow these steps for a clean reinstall:

### For Chromium-based browsers

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find uBO Scope and click **Remove**
3. Visit the Chrome Web Store [uBO Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
4. Click **Add to Chrome** and confirm installation


### For Firefox

1. Open `about:addons`
2. Find uBO Scope and click **Remove**
3. Visit Firefox Add-ons page [uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
4. Click **Add to Firefox** and follow the prompts


### For Safari

1. Go to Safari > Preferences > Extensions
2. Disable or uninstall uBO Scope
3. Reinstall via the App Store or from the extension’s official source

> <Tip>After reinstalling, restart your browser to ensure all components initialize correctly.</Tip>

---

## 4. Check for Conflicting Extensions

Other extensions that also use the `webRequest` API or block network requests aggressively might interfere with uBO Scope’s ability to monitor connections.

### Steps to diagnose conflicts

1. Temporarily disable other extensions one by one.
2. Check if uBO Scope starts reporting connections normally.
3. If yes, identify which extension causes the conflict.

> <Tip>Prioritize disabling other content blockers, privacy tools, or VPN-related extensions first, as they commonly interfere.</Tip>

---

## 5. Inspect Browser Console for Errors

Errors during extension startup or execution can be viewed in the browser's developer console:

### How to open console

- **Chrome / Edge:** `Ctrl+Shift+J` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Opt+J` (Mac)
- **Firefox:** `Ctrl+Shift+K` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Opt+K` (Mac)
- **Safari:** Enable Developer menu in Preferences, then select **Show JavaScript Console**

Look for errors related to uBO Scope or `webRequest` permissions.

> <Tip>If you see manifest or permission-related errors, revisit the previous sections on compatibility and permissions.</Tip>

---

## 6. Clear Browser Cache and Restart

Cached data or browser glitches can cause unexpected extension behavior.

### To clear cache:

- Chrome & Firefox: Open browser settings > Privacy & Security > Clear browsing data > select cached images & files
- Safari: Safari > Clear History

After clearing cache, restart the browser and test uBO Scope again.

---

## 7. Consult Browser Support Resources

- [Chrome Extension Troubleshooting](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769)
- [Firefox Add-ons Help](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/extensions-troubleshooting)

Additionally, visit the uBO Scope [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) to check for known issues or report bugs.
