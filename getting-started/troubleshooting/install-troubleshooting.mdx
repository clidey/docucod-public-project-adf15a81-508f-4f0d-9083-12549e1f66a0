# Installation Troubleshooting

This page addresses common issues you might encounter when installing uBO Scope. It provides clear, actionable solutions for problems such as unsupported browser versions, missing permissions, and the extension not appearing after installation. Follow these steps to diagnose and resolve installation problems effectively.

---

## 1. Confirm Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope supports specific minimum browser versions to ensure full functionality:

- **Chromium-based browsers:** Version 122 or newer
- **Firefox:** Version 128 or newer
- **Safari:** Version 18.5 or newer

### How to check your browser version:

- **Chromium:** Open `chrome://version` (Chrome, Edge, Brave)
- **Firefox:** Open menu > Help > About Firefox
- **Safari:** Safari menu > About Safari

<Warning>
Using an unsupported browser version will prevent uBO Scope from functioning correctly. If your browser version is below these thresholds, update it before proceeding.
</Warning>

## 2. Verify Extension Installation

After installing uBO Scope from the official browser store, confirm that the extension is properly installed and enabled.

### Steps:

1. Open your browser's extensions or add-ons page:
   - Chromium: `chrome://extensions`
   - Firefox: `about:addons`
   - Safari: `Safari` menu > `Settings` > `Extensions`

2. Ensure uBO Scope appears in the list.
3. Check that the extension is enabled (toggle or checkbox).
4. Pin the extension icon to your browser toolbar for easy access:
   - In Chromium-based browsers, click the Extensions icon and click the pin icon next to uBO Scope.
   - In Firefox, the extension should appear near the address bar; use the customization menu to ensure visibility.
   - In Safari, enable it to show in the toolbar from the extension settings.

<Note>
If uBO Scope does not appear in the extensions list after installation, re-install the extension and ensure you are using the official store links:

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

Safari users should verify Safari version compatibility.
</Note>

## 3. Check Required Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to function:

- `activeTab` — To access the active tab's network details.
- `storage` — To save session and configuration data.
- `webRequest` — To monitor network requests.

### How to verify permissions:

1. Open the extension's details page (from the extensions/add-ons manager).
2. Review the permissions section.
3. If prompts to grant permissions appear, accept them.

<Tip>
Sometimes, denying these permissions during installation or after updates blocks uBO Scope from monitoring requests. To fix this, toggle the extension off and on again or remove and re-install while granting all permissions.
</Tip>

## 4. Extension Icon or Badge Not Visible

If you cannot see the uBO Scope toolbar icon or badge count, follow these steps:

1. Confirm the extension is pinned or enabled as described in Section 2.
2. Check your browser toolbar customization to ensure uBO Scope is not hidden.
3. Restart your browser to refresh the UI.
4. If using multiple profiles or containers, verify installation in the active profile.

<Warning>
In rare cases, browser UI bugs may delay or fail to show the extension icon immediately after installation. Restarting the browser or reinstalling the extension typically resolves this.
</Warning>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Issue: Extension fails to install or shows errors during installation">
- Ensure your browser meets version requirements.
- Check if you have internet connectivity to access the extension store.
- Disable other extensions temporarily that may interfere with installation.
- Clear browser cache and retry installation.
- Consult browser-specific logs or error messages.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Issue: Permissions not fully granted, extension unable to track requests">
- Remove and reinstall the extension, carefully granting all requested permissions.
- Manually check and enable permissions from the extensions manager.
- In some browsers, permission consent is prompted only once; reinstalling resets this.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Issue: Badge count or popup shows no data after installation">
- Navigate to any website (preferably one with third-party content).
- Wait a moment for uBO Scope to collect network data (badge count updates happen dynamically).
- If no connections appear, test with other sites to rule out network or privacy restrictions.
- Disable other extensions that may block webRequest API access.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Confirm Manifest Permissions Match Browser Requirements

uBO Scope's manifest specifies required permissions and host permissions.

- For **Chromium**, ensure the browser is version 122 or higher to support Manifest v3 service worker background scripts.
- For **Firefox**, host permissions include `http`, `https`, `ws`, and `wss` schemes.
- For **Safari**, verify the strict minimum version supports web extensions.

Incorrect browser versions or restrictive browser policies can cause failure even if the extension installs.

<Info>
For full manifest details, review the browser-specific manifest files in the repository:
- [Chromium manifest.json](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/platform/chromium/manifest.json)
- [Firefox manifest.json](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/platform/firefox/manifest.json)
- [Safari manifest.json](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/platform/safari/manifest.json)
