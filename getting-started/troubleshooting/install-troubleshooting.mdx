# Troubleshooting Installation & Permissions

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve the common pitfalls encountered during the installation and initial setup of the uBO Scope browser extension. Whether the extension icon doesnâ€™t appear, permissions are not granted properly, or store-based installation errors occur, this practical advice empowers you to overcome setup hurdles swiftly without delay.

## 1. Common Installation Issues & How to Fix Them

### Issue: Extension Icon Does Not Appear in the Browser Toolbar

**Symptoms:**
- After installation, you do not see the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
- The browser does not prompt for or show any permissions for the extension.

**Step-by-step resolution:**

1. **Verify Extension Installed Correctly**
   - Open your browser's extensions page:
     - Chrome: `chrome://extensions`
     - Firefox: `about:addons`
     - Safari: `Preferences > Extensions`
   - Confirm uBO Scope is listed and enabled.

2. **Pin or Enable the Extension Icon**
   - Some browsers hide newly added extensions by default.
   - In Chrome or Firefox, click the puzzle piece icon and pin uBO Scope.
   - In Safari, ensure you have enabled it from the Extensions preference pane.

3. **Reload the Browser**
   - Restart the browser completely and check again.

4. **Check for Browser Compatibility**
   - uBO Scope requires specific minimum browser versions:
     - Chrome 122 or higher
     - Firefox 128 or higher
     - Safari 18.5 or higher
   - Running an earlier version can prevent proper installation or icon display.

<Tip>
Check the browser version from the `About` menu and update if needed before reinstalling.

### Issue: Browser Permission Requests Not Prompting or Denied

uBO Scope requires permissions to function correctly, including access to active tabs, storage, and network requests (webRequest API).

**How to verify and resolve:**

1. **Confirm Permissions Granted**
   - Go to your browser's extension permissions interface.
   - Ensure uBO Scope has these permissions:
     - `activeTab`
     - `storage`
     - `webRequest`
   - Also, ensure *host permissions* include `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` (and WebSocket URLs on Chromium and Firefox).

2. **Re-Enable Permissions**
   - If permissions are missing or revoked, toggle them on again or reinstall the extension.

3. **Allow Pop-Ups or Confirm Security Prompts**
   - Some browsers may block permission prompts silently if pop-ups are blocked.
   - Temporarily disable pop-up blockers or check the browser's notification area.

4. **Avoid Installing from Untrusted Sources**
   - Always install uBO Scope from official browser stores to ensure permissions flow correctly.

### Issue: Errors During Installation from Browser Store

**Common error messages:**
- "Extension cannot be installed"
- "Corrupt manifest file"
- "Required version mismatched"

**Remedies:**

1. **Confirm Browser and Extension Version Compatibility**
   - Every platform has a manifest with specific minimum browser version constraints:

| Browser  | Minimum Version Required |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| Chrome   | 122+                    |
| Firefox  | 128+                    |
| Safari   | 18.5+                   |

2. **Clear Browser Cache and Restart**
   - Old extension cache data can interfere with installation.

3. **Use the Correct Platform-Specific Package or Store Link**
   - Chrome: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp
   - Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/

4. **Check for Conflicts with Other Extensions**
   - Disable potentially conflicting extensions temporarily and retry.

## 2. Advanced Permission Debugging

If the extension installs but fails to record connections or the popup shows no data:

### Step 1: Check Browser Support for `webRequest` API

- uBO Scope relies heavily on the `webRequest` API.
- Some browsers or versions restrict or modify this API.
- Confirm support in your browser version or consult the prerequisites guide.

### Step 2: Inspect Extension Logs

1. Open the browser's Developer Tools for extensions:
   - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/` > toggle Developer mode > Inspect views > service worker or background page
   - Firefox: `about:debugging` > Debug uBO Scope
2. Watch for error messages regarding permissions or failed background script execution.

<Tip>
A lack of `webRequest` listeners or permission errors here often indicates incomplete installation or restricted API availability.
</Tip>

## 3. Quick Check Checklist Before Reinstall

Ensure the following prerequisites are met before attempting reinstallation:

- Browser is up to date to meet minimum version requirements.
- Internet connection is active and stable.
- Browser extension settings allow installation from official stores.
- No pending browser updates or restarts.

---

## 4. Recovery and Support

If you continue to experience problems after performing the above steps:

- **Clear all extension data:** Remove uBO Scope, clear browser extension cache, then reinstall.
- **Try a fresh browser profile** to rule out profile corruption.
- **Verify that other extensions are not blocking or interfering** with network requests or UI elements.

<Tip>
Before reaching out for support, gather details on your browser version, platform, installed extensions, and any error messages encountered.
</Tip>

## Appendix: Platform-Specific Permission Notes

| Platform | Key Manifest Permissions & Notes |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| Chrome   | Requires `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest` permissions and host permissions for `http://*/*` and `https://*/*`, plus websocket URLs. Minimum Chrome 122 required. |
| Firefox  | Similar permissions as Chrome, with host permissions including `wss://*/*` and `ws://*/*`. Minimum Firefox 128 required. |
| Safari   | Similar permissions, but no websocket host permissions are indicated. Minimum Safari 18.5 required. |

Ensure your installation source provides the correct platform manifest to avoid permission issues.

<Note>
Permission mismatches or missing host permissions are the main cause of installation-related troubleshooting issues.
