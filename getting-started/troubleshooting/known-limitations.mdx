# Known Limitations & Gotchas

Understanding the boundaries of what uBO Scope can and cannot detect is crucial to setting the right expectations. This page details the current product limitations and subtle behaviors users and filter list maintainers should be aware of when using uBO Scope. Transparency about these limitations ensures users interpret the extension's data accurately and appreciate the scope (and limits) of network connection reporting.

---

## 1. Requests Outside the Reach of the `webRequest` API

uBO Scope relies entirely on the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network requests. However, **not all network requests are exposed through this API.** This fundamental limitation means that:

- Requests made by certain browser features or APIs that do not surface via `webRequest` will be invisible to uBO Scope.
- Network activity generated by native browser optimizations, speculative prefetching, or specialized internal protocols may not be reported.

### What This Means for You

- Some resource loads may occur without appearing in uBO Scope's popup or badge count.
- The extension's data should be seen as a comprehensive, but not absolute, record of network requests.

<Tip>
If you notice missing connection entries, first confirm whether those requests are managed by browser internals or extensions that bypass standard webRequest tracking.
</Tip>

## 2. Content Blockers Using Stealth Techniques

Many modern content blockers aim to be stealthy to prevent detection by websites or to reduce webpage breakage. Such stealth blocking techniques may:

- Completely hide blocking activity from the browser’s network APIs.
- Prevent the browser from emitting events that uBO Scope depends on.

### Impact on uBO Scope

- uBO Scope may not detect or report all blocking activities performed by stealthy blockers.
- The extension may categorize some stealth-blocked requests differently or miss them altogether.

<Note>
While uBO Scope tries to distinguish stealth-blocked requests from allowed or fully blocked ones, stealth techniques can limit visibility. This is a technical reality beyond the extension’s control.
</Note>

## 3. Badge Count Interpretation Caveats

The toolbar badge count reflects the **number of distinct third-party remote servers with connections**, not the total number of blocked or allowed requests.

- A higher badge count indicates more unique third-party connections,
- but this does **not** directly imply worse privacy or less blocking.

This subtlety is vital when comparing with other blockers or interpreting extension statistics.

<Tip>
Always think of the badge count as a gauge of ‘distinct third-party server connections’ rather than a direct measure of blocking success.
</Tip>

## 4. Domain Grouping and Public Suffix List (PSL) Limitations

uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List (PSL) to accurately group network requests by effective domain.

- The PSL is regularly updated and shipped with the extension.
- However, some new or rare domains, private domains, or unusual cases may not be perfectly grouped.

### What to Expect

- Most queries are accurately grouped.
- In rare cases, some requests may appear under unexpected domain groups.

<Info>
The extension automatically refreshes the PSL and caches it in session storage to maintain up-to-date domain grouping.

## 5. Cross-Origin and WebSocket Connections

- WebSocket (`ws://` and `wss://`) connections are monitored in browsers that expose these URLs through `webRequest` permissions.
- Occasionally, browser or platform limitations may result in missed WebSocket connections.

### Browser Support Notes

- Chrome and Firefox provide explicit host permissions for WebSocket URLs, enabling better coverage.
- Safari currently cannot monitor WebSocket connections due to platform restrictions.

---

## 6. Browser and Platform Specific Nuances

uBO Scope supports Chrome (v122+), Firefox (v128+), and Safari (v18.5+), but each browser's implementation of the `webRequest` API leads to subtle differences:

| Browser | Notable Limitations |
|---------|--------------------|
| Safari  | Limited WebSocket monitoring, strict manifest permissions |
| Firefox | Robust API support, but some Android quirks |
| Chrome  | Full API support including WebSocket, starting from v122 |

<Warning>
Always check your browser’s version and permissions (see Supported Browsers & System Requirements) to ensure full functionality.
</Warning>

---

## 7. Limitations in Reporting Redirects and Errors

- Redirects that change protocols or involve non-network URLs might be missed or miscategorized.
- Some network errors do not report IP addresses or status codes; uBO Scope treats these conservatively as errors but coverage may vary.

---

## 8. Incomplete Visibility on Network Requests Initiated Outside Browser Tabs

uBO Scope specifically monitors requests tied to browser tabs.

- Requests made outside the context of tabs (e.g., service workers, background fetches) are not tracked.
- This means some network activity from the browser or extensions themselves may not be visible.

---

## Recommended Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope in conjunction with browser developer tools for comprehensive analysis.
- Keep uBO Scope updated to benefit from the latest fixes and PSL updates.
- Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-common-issues) guide if suspected discrepancies arise.
