# Troubleshooting Installation & First-Run Issues

This section helps you quickly resolve common problems encountered during the installation or first use of uBO Scope. If you find that uBO Scope is not working as expected—such as the extension icon missing, no badge count appearing, or the popup interface failing to show data—follow these practical troubleshooting steps to get back on track.

---

## 1. Verify Extension Installation

### Step 1: Confirm uBO Scope is Installed
- Open your browser's extensions or add-ons page:
  - **Chrome:** `chrome://extensions/`
  - **Firefox:** `about:addons`
  - **Safari:** Preferences > Extensions
- Ensure uBO Scope appears in the list and is enabled.

### Step 2: Check Version and Permissions
- Make sure the version displayed matches the latest stable release (currently 1.0.1).
- Confirm permissions granted:
  - **ActiveTab**
  - **Storage**
  - **webRequest** (critical for network monitoring)

<Tip>
Without the `webRequest` permission, uBO Scope cannot monitor network requests, so ensure this permission is granted.
</Tip>

## 2. Check Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope requires a modern browser supporting Manifest V3 and the `webRequest` API's handling permitted by the browser.

- **Chrome:** Minimum version 122.0 or above.
- **Firefox:** Minimum version 128 or above.
- **Safari:** Minimum version 18.5 or above.

Older browser versions or incompatible browser forks may not support required APIs, causing limited or no functionality.

<Warning>
Attempting to use uBO Scope on unsupported browsers or outdated versions will cause monitoring failures and missing UI features.
</Warning>

## 3. Extension Icon and Badge Not Showing

If the uBO Scope icon or badge count is missing from the toolbar:

### Step 1: Toolbar Visibility
- Make sure the extension icon is not hidden in the overflow menu.
- Pin or drag the icon to the toolbar for easy access.

### Step 2: Badge Updates
- The badge reflects the count of distinct third-party remote server connections detected per active tab. It will be empty if:
  - The webpage has no network activity (e.g., blank page).
  - uBO Scope failed to capture requests (see permissions or API conflicts).

### Step 3: Confirm Background Service Activity
- Browsers sometimes suspend the extension’s background service worker (especially in Chromium). Reload your browser or restart your computer to restore extension operation.

## 4. Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Empty Results

If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or does not update with network requests:

### Step 1: Reload the Page
- The active tab must have loaded its content to start network monitoring.
- Reload the tab and then open uBO Scope popup again.

### Step 2: Check for Conflicting Extensions
- Some other extensions might interfere with network monitoring APIs or permissions.
- Temporarily disable other extensions to isolate conflicts.

### Step 3: Browser API Support
- uBO Scope depends on the browser's `webRequest` API functionality.
- Some browsers limit or deprecate portions of this API, which can prevent data capture.

<Note>
For example, Firefox and Chrome use slightly different APIs; uBO Scope adapts accordingly but rely on official, supported browsers and versions.
</Note>

## 5. How to Reset uBO Scope Data

To resolve persistent incorrect or stale badge counts or popup data:

- Disable and re-enable the extension.
- Clear extension storage:
  1. Go to browser storage settings or `chrome://extensions/` > Details > Clear Data.
  2. Alternatively, uninstall then reinstall the extension.

<Tip>
Reloading tabs after reset ensures fresh network data collection.
</Tip>

## 6. Common Installation Issues

### Issue: Installation Fails or Extension Not Listed
- Confirm your browser is supported and up-to-date.
- Install from the official sources:
  - Chrome Web Store
  - Firefox Add-ons site
  - Safari Extensions Gallery or the developer's instructions
- Disable any security or corporate policies that might block extension installation.

### Issue: Permissions Not Granted
- Review extension permissions during installation or in browser settings.
- Some browsers require manual permission enablement for `webRequest` or similar.

### Issue: Manifest or API Errors
- Ensure no manual modifications were made to extension files.
- Use the official release without editing manifests or scripts.

## 7. Advanced Diagnostics

If basic troubleshooting does not solve your problem:

- Open the browser's developer console on the extension background page/service worker.
- Look for errors related to `webRequest`, `storage`, or runtime messages.
- Consult the GitHub repository for known issues or submit an issue: [https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope)

## 8. Additional Tips

- Regularly update uBO Scope alongside your browser updates.
- Combine uBO Scope with your content blocker for enhanced privacy insights.
- Remember, a lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, a sign of better privacy.

# Appendix: Permissions and APIs

uBO Scope relies on permissions declared in your browser’s extension manifest:

- `activeTab`: To interact with the current tab.
- `storage`: To save session data and public suffix list.
- `webRequest`: To capture and monitor all network requests for analysis.

Without these, uBO Scope cannot function correctly.
