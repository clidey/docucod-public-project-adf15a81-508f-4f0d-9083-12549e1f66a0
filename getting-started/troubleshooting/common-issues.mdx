# Troubleshooting Common Issues

Ensure your experience with uBO Scope is smooth by addressing frequent setup and first-use challenges. This guide focuses on resolving issues like missing toolbar badge counts or an unresponsive popup, helping you quickly get back on track.

## 1. Badge Count Does Not Appear or Stays at Zero

When the badge on the toolbar icon does not display or remains at zero, it usually indicates that the extension is not receiving or processing network data correctly.

### Steps to Diagnose and Fix

1. **Verify Installation and Permissions**
   - Confirm that uBO Scope is installed from the correct store for your browser: Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari Extensions.
   - Check that permissions for `webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab` are granted.
     - In Chrome, visit `chrome://extensions/` and click Details on uBO Scope. Under Permissions, ensure `Access to URLs` and `webRequest` are enabled.
     - In Firefox, check `about:addons` > Extensions > uBO Scope > More options for permissions.
   - Without these permissions, the extension cannot monitor network connections.

2. **Reload the Browser Tab and Extension**
   - Sometimes the extension might not have initialized for the current tab. Reload the page you want to monitor.
   - Restart your browser or disable and re-enable uBO Scope.

3. **Check for Conflicting Extensions or Settings**
   - Other content blockers or privacy extensions might interfere with uBO Scope's ability to monitor network requests.
   - Temporarily disable other extensions to see if the badge updates.

4. **Inspect Network Request Monitoring**
   - uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API. If your browser or profile restricts this API (e.g., privacy-focused browsers with limited APIs), uBO Scope may not work fully.
   - Note: DNS-level blocking or network requests outside browser control are not visible to uBO Scope.

### Example Verification

- Open a website with known third-party connections (e.g., a news site).
- Observe if the badge count changes from empty to a number representing distinct third-party domains.
- If no change occurs, review above diagnostic points.

<Warning>
If the badge count is constantly zero despite network activity, it usually means the extension isn't actively monitoring. Follow the permission and reload steps carefully.
</Warning>

## 2. Popup Panel Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Blank

Seeing 'NO DATA' in the popup or an empty connection list suggests that no network data has been collected or the popup failed to load the data.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Ensure the Extension is Enabled and Running**
   - Confirm uBO Scope is enabled in your browser extensions list.
   - Make sure background processes of the extension are running (may need to restart browser).

2. **Reload the Tab and Open Popup Again**
   - The popup retrieves data related to the currently active tab. Switch to a tab where network requests were made and reload it.
   - Open the popup shortly after to allow data retrieval.

3. **Review Console Errors (Developer Tools)**
   - Open Developer Tools for the popup:
     - In Chrome/Firefox, right-click the extension icon > Inspect popup.
     - Look for errors that indicate messaging failures or data loading issues.

4. **Confirm Step-Wise Extension Behavior**
   - Sometimes, delayed storage reads or browser internal delays can cause fleeting 'NO DATA' messages.
   - Wait a few seconds then reopen popup.

### Practical Tip

- Avoid opening the popup immediately after redirect or navigation; the extension needs a short moment to process network requests.

## 3. Toolbar Badge Does Not Update on Tab Change

If switching between tabs doesn’t update the badge count appropriately:

1. **Verify Browser Support and Version**
   - Some browsers require minimum versions for correct API support (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

2. **Check for Tab Metadata Loss**
   - uBO Scope tracks network requests per tab; closing and quickly reopening tabs may reset data.
   - Ensure tabs remain open to retain session data.

3. **Try Reloading Background Script**
   - In Chromium-based browsers, go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable Developer mode, and click 'Service Worker' link to check background.
   - Reload the background script if possible.

---

## 4. Extension Does Not Seem to Monitor WebSocket Connections

uBO Scope tracks HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket protocols when browser exposes these through `webRequest` API.

- If you notice expected WebSocket connections missing:
  - Confirm browser supports and the extension has permissions to monitor ws:// and wss://.
  - Check that your browser’s privacy settings or other extensions do not block WebSocket monitoring.

---

## 5. General Recommendations for Reliable Operation

- **Keep your browser updated**: New browser versions fix bugs in APIs that uBO Scope depends on.
- **Reload pages and extension after installation**: Initial page loads before installation won’t be tracked.
- **Avoid multiple conflicting content blockers simultaneously**: They might interfere with each other’s network reporting.
- **Consult extension settings or permissions promptly if issues arise**.
