# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide helps you quickly diagnose and resolve the most frequent problems encountered during the installation or the first run of uBO Scope. Whether you don’t see any data, the extension appears inactive, or permissions seem to block operation, these actionable steps will get you back on track.

---

## 1. Extension Appears Inactive or Is Missing

If you installed uBO Scope but it’s not showing any data or the icon seems absent:

### Step 1: Confirm Installation
- Verify that uBO Scope is installed correctly in your browser:
  - In Chrome and Edge: visit `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`
  - In Firefox: open `about:addons`
  - In Safari: check Preferences > Extensions

### Step 2: Activate the Extension
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled:
  - Toggle the extension on if it’s disabled.

### Step 3: Locate the Toolbar Icon
- Browsers sometimes hide new extensions:
  - Check the browser's extension overflow menu (`puzzle` icon in Chrome).
  - Pin uBO Scope to the toolbar for easy access.

### Step 4: Reload the Browser
- Restart your browser to apply extensions’ active state.

**If the icon is still missing or inactive:**
- Reinstall the extension from the official store:
  - [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

<Note>
Installing uBO Scope from unofficial sources can cause extension failures or malicious software risks. Always use official stores.
</Note>


## 2. Missing Permissions Prevent the Extension from Working

uBO Scope relies on browser permissions to monitor network requests and report connection outcomes.

### Step 1: Ensure Proper Permissions Are Granted
- Required permissions include:
  - `activeTab` — to detect which tab is active
  - `webRequest` — to intercept network requests
  - `storage` — to save session data

### Step 2: Verify Permissions in Browser
- In your browser’s extension settings, confirm that the extension has all required permissions.

### Step 3: Check Host Permissions
- uBO Scope requests access to all HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket URLs to track requests.
- Confirm that permissions include:
  - `http://*/*` and `https://*/*`
  - (In Chromium-based browsers) also `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*`

<Warning>
Restrictive browser policies or enterprise settings can block these permissions and prevent uBO Scope from functioning properly.
</Warning>


## 3. No Data Shows in the Popup on First Use

Seeing "NO DATA" or zero domain counts in the popup is a common early confusion.

### Step 1: Confirm the Extension Is Activated for the Page
- Check if the extension icon shows a badge count on the current tab.
- If the badge is blank, it means no network requests were recorded yet.

### Step 2: Confirm Network Activity
- Reload the webpage to generate new network requests.
- After reloading, click on the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.

### Step 3: Check Content Blockers Interference
- Extensions like uBlock Origin or other blockers might block requests before uBO Scope measures them.
- This is expected behavior; it means connections are being blocked.

### Step 4: Inspect if Your Browser Supports Required APIs
- uBO Scope relies on Manifest V3 and `webRequest` API support.
- Confirm your browser version supports these APIs.
- Visit [System Requirements](../install-and-requirements/system-requirements) for detailed compatibility.


## 4. The Toolbar Badge Count Is Not Updating

If the number shown on the icon doesn’t change or stays blank:

### Step 1: Reload the Tab
- Network requests are counted as they happen.
- Reload the tab to trigger fresh network request processing.

### Step 2: Confirm Extension Has Access to the Tab
- Some browsers require explicit permission for extensions to operate on specific pages or domains.
- Ensure uBO Scope has permission for the current page.

### Step 3: Close and Reopen the Popup
- Sometimes the popup UI does not auto-refresh.
- Close and reopen the popup to trigger data fetch.

### Step 4: Try on Another Tab or Website
- Test uBO Scope on a different site with known network activity to isolate the problem.


## 5. Extension Does Not Detect WebSocket Requests

WebSocket traffic requires special handling by the extension.

### Step 1: Confirm Browser Support
- uBO Scope’s manifest requests WebSocket URL permissions (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) in Chromium browsers.
- Ensure your browser supports WebSocket filtering in Manifest V3.

### Step 2: Reload the Site
- WebSocket connections are detected only as they are initiated during page load or interaction.
- Reload the page and observe the extension badge.


## 6. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Multiple content blockers** may conflict; uBO Scope reports based on network requests visible to the browser, but some requests may be blocked earlier by other extensions or network-level blockers.
- **Incognito/Private mode:** uBO Scope may not be enabled in private windows unless granted explicit permission.
- **Browser updates:** Ensure both your browser and uBO Scope are up to date to have the latest compatibility and features.


## 7. Summary: Quick Recovery Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Installation and Activate Extension">
Check your browser’s extension manager to ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Extension Permissions">
Confirm all permissions especially `webRequest` and host permissions are granted.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload Browser and Page">
Restart your browser and reload the webpage to trigger request tracking.
</Step>
<Step title="Open Extension Popup and Check Data">
Click the toolbar icon and verify domain activity and badge counts are present.
</Step>
<Step title="Test on Different Sites">
Try browsing other sites to ensure the extension is working globally.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 8. Where to Get Further Help
