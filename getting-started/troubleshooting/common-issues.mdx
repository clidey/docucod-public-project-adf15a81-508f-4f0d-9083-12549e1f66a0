# Resolving Common Installation and Usage Issues

This guide helps you quickly diagnose and fix frequent problems encountered during installing and using uBO Scope. Whether the extension does not appear in your browser, the toolbar badge fails to update, or you face permission errors, this page directs you toward straightforward solutions so you can start monitoring your network connections effectively.

---

## 1. Extension Not Appearing After Installation

### Steps to Verify and Fix:

1. **Confirm Browser Compatibility**
   - uBO Scope supports recent versions of Chromium (version 122 or later), Firefox (128 or later), and Safari (18.5 or later).
   - Check your browser version and update if needed.

2. **Check Extension Installation Status**
   - Visit your browser's extensions page:
     - **Chrome:** `chrome://extensions/`
     - **Firefox:** `about:addons`
     - **Safari:** Safari Preferences → Extensions
   - Ensure uBO Scope (sometimes labeled 'uBlock Origin Scope' or 'uBO Scope') is installed and enabled.

3. **Allow Necessary Permissions**
   - The extension requests permissions like `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` to monitor network requests.
   - If permissions were denied during installation, enable them via the extension settings.

4. **Restart the Browser**
   - Sometimes a browser restart resolves lingering extension loading issues.

<Tip>
If the extension still does not appear, try uninstalling and reinstalling from the official source (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari extensions gallery).
</Tip>

## 2. Toolbar Badge Not Updating or Showing Correct Counts

The toolbar badge reflects the count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the current tab. If it remains blank or does not update:

### Verify and Resolve:

1. **Ensure Active Tab Has Network Activity**
   - The badge updates per active tab with network connections.
   - Try visiting a webpage with known third-party requests.

2. **Browser Limits and Privacy Settings**
   - Some browser privacy settings or other extensions might block or interfere with `webRequest` API events.
   - Temporarily disable conflicting privacy or ad-blocking extensions to test.

3. **Reload the Tab**
   - After installing or enabling uBO Scope, reload your active tab to trigger fresh network monitoring.

4. **Check for Background Service Worker Activity**
   - The extension background script tracks requests; if it is suspended or crashes, badge updates can fail.
   - Restart the browser to reset the extension background.

<Warning>
Browsers sometimes restrict extensions from accessing webRequest events on certain pages, such as internal browser pages (`chrome://` or `about:` URLs), so no badge updates will occur there.
</Warning>

## 3. Permissions or Errors Related to Network Requests

If you see errors or no data due to permission restrictions:

1. **Review Host Permissions**
   - uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor HTTP and WebSocket connections.
   - Manifest declarations include:
     - **Chromium & Firefox:** `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, `ws://*/*`
     - **Safari:** only `https://*/*` and `http://*/*`

2. **Browser Restrictions**
   - Safari limits WebSocket permission monitoring.
   - Confirm your browser’s extension permissions support these network protocols.

3. **Reload or Reinstall Extension**
   - Sometimes reinstalling or updating the extension refreshes permissions.

4. **Check Console Logs**
   - Open the browser extension console to view logged errors (Browser DevTools → Extensions → uBO Scope).

<Note>
Errors in permissions or blocked API access will usually manifest in the extension console logs. Identifying these early prevents prolonged troubleshooting.
</Note>

## 4. Extension Popup Shows No Data or 'NO DATA'

The popup displays real-time summaries for the active tab. If it shows 'NO DATA':

1. **Confirm You Have an Active Tab With Network Traffic**
   - Open websites that trigger third-party connections.

2. **Wait a Few Seconds for Data to Load**
   - uBO Scope gathers data asynchronously; a brief delay before display is normal.

3. **Reload the Tab**
   - Reloading forces fresh network events that the extension can monitor.

4. **Try Opening the Popup on Different Tabs or Websites**
   - Some special sites or offline tabs produce no data.

5. **Verify Extension Initialization**
   - Restart the browser to ensure the extension's background service initializes properly.

<Tip>
The popup uses Unicode conversion to show domain names correctly. If domains do not display, it may indicate data deserialization issues — usually resolved by restarting the browser.
</Tip>

## 5. Special Notes About Browser Restrictions

- **Chromium** supports all declared permissions including WebSocket monitoring (`wss://` and `ws://`).
- **Firefox** supports similar permissions but requires browser version 128 or higher.
- **Safari** restricts WebSocket monitoring and supports HTTP/HTTPS only. Safari also requires minimum version 18.5.

<Warning>
uBO Scope relies on browser `webRequest` APIs that have different levels of support and restrictions across browsers and their versions — consider this when troubleshooting.
</Warning>
