# Resolving Common Installation & Activation Issues

Starting uBO Scope for the first time should be straightforward. However, you might encounter some common installation or activation problems that can prevent the extension from working properly. This guide addresses these frequent issues and provides concise, effective solutions to ensure a smooth onboarding experience.

## 1. Missing or Invisible Toolbar Icon

**Problem:** After installing uBO Scope, the toolbar icon does not appear or is missing.

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Check Browser Extension Settings:**
    - In your browser's extensions or add-ons page, verify that uBO Scope is enabled.
2. **Pin the Extension Icon:**
    - Some browsers hide icons by default.
    - In Chrome or Chromium, click the puzzle-piece icon, then pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.
    - In Firefox, ensure the add-on is set to show its icon.
3. **Restart Browser:**
    - Close and reopen your browser to refresh the extension loading.
4. **Reinstall if Necessary:**
    - Remove and reinstall uBO Scope from the official store.

<Tip>
Pinning the extension icon ensures quick access to the popup panel and real-time connection insights.
</Tip>

## 2. Insufficient Permissions Errors

**Problem:** uBO Scope shows errors or fails to function due to lacking permissions.

**Diagnosis:**
- The extension requires specific permissions to observe network requests:
  - `activeTab`
  - `storage`
  - `webRequest`
  - `host_permissions` covering HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs.

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Verify Permissions During Installation:**
    - Accept all requested permissions when prompted by the browser.
2. **Check Extension Settings:**
    - Visit your browser's extension management page and ensure uBO Scope has all necessary permissions granted.
3. **Browser-Specific Notes:**
    - Chromium-based browsers require permissions for websocket protocols (`ws://`, `wss://`).
    - Safari's stricter permission model may limit websocket monitoring; see the compatibility notes.
4. **Update Browser to Supported Version:**
    - Minimum supported versions:
      - Chrome/Chromium 122+
      - Firefox 128+
      - Safari 18.5+
    - Older versions may block or restrict required permissions.

<Warning>
Without the full permissions and supported browser versions, uBO Scope cannot reliably monitor network connections.
</Warning>

## 3. Browser Incompatibility or Unsupported Version

**Problem:** uBO Scope fails to install or does not activate properly.

**Diagnosis:**
- The extension is designed for modern browsers supporting Manifest V3 and WebExtension APIs.

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Check Browser Version:**
    - Ensure your browser version meets or exceeds the minimum:
      - Chrome/Chromium: 122.0 or higher
      - Firefox: 128.0 or higher
      - Safari: 18.5 or higher
2. **Upgrade Browser:**
    - Update your browser to the latest stable release.
3. **Avoid Using Unsupported Browsers:**
    - Browsers without Manifest V3 support cannot run uBO Scope.

<Note>
For Safari users, WebSocket monitoring is limited due to manifest and API restrictions; this may affect data accuracy.
</Note>

## 4. Extension Appears Installed but No Data is Shown in Popup

**Problem:** The toolbar icon is visible, but the popup displays 'NO DATA' or shows zero connections.

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Reload Active Tabs:**
    - Network connection data is collected on page loads.
    - Reload your open tabs after installing uBO Scope to capture activity.
2. **Verify Browsing Activity Includes External Connections:**
    - Visit websites known to load external resources (e.g., news or content-rich pages).
3. **Confirm Browser Permissions:**
    - Check that `webRequest` permissions are active.
4. **Verify Badge Counts:**
    - The toolbar badge should display a number; zero or missing badge indicates no data collected.
5. **Restart Browser:**
    - Sometimes restarting the browser is necessary to initialize background scripts.

<Tip>
Try visiting well-known third-party service sites (e.g., https://www.cnn.com) to trigger network requests.
</Tip>

## 5. Installation Fails with “Extension Disabled” or “Blocked” Messages

**Problem:** The browser refuses to enable uBO Scope or disables it automatically.

**Causes & Steps:**

1. **Conflicting Extensions:**
    - Some security or content blockers may flag uBO Scope as suspicious.
    - Temporarily disable other extensions to test.
2. **Corrupted Extension Installation:**
    - Remove and reinstall from the official extension store.
3. **Browser Security Policies:**
    - Corporate or managed devices may block certain extensions.
    - Contact your system administrator to whitelist uBO Scope.
4. **Development or Sideloaded Versions:**
    - Self-installed versions might require enabling developer mode.

## 6. Data Does Not Update in Real-Time

**Problem:** The popup panel shows stale data, not reflecting current browsing sessions.

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Understand Background Service Worker Behavior:**
    - The extension uses background scripts that can be unloaded; some delay in data update may occur.
2. **Reload or Reopen Popup:**
    - Close and reopen the popup panel to refresh data.
3. **Wait for Network Request Processing:**
    - Data is updated after a 1-second debounce timer on network events.
4. **Reload Tabs:**
    - Reload active tabs to trigger fresh network requests.

---

## 7. uBO Scope Shows No Data for WebSocket Connections

**Context:**
- WebSocket traffic is only monitored if the browser supports the relevant `webRequest` events for `ws://` and `wss://` URLs.

**Resolution:**

1. **Confirm Browser Support:**
    - Chromium and Firefox support WebSocket monitoring fully.
    - Safari support is limited; WebSocket traffic may not be tracked.
2. **Update to Latest Version:**
    - Use the latest browser build to maximize API support.
3. **Verify Extension Host Permissions:**
    - Ensure host permissions include WebSocket URL schemes.

## 8. Troubleshooting Persistent Issues

If you still encounter problems after following the above steps:

1. **Check Browser Console Logs:**
    - Open developer tools in the extension popup or background context (in Chrome: chrome://extensions -> uBO Scope -> service worker).
    - Look for errors or warnings.
2. **Reset Extension State:**
    - Remove and reinstall the extension.
    - Clear browser cache.
3. **Review uBO Scope's Online Resources:**
