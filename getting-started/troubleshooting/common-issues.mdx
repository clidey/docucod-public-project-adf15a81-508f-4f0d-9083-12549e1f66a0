# Solving First-Run Problems

When you use uBO Scope for the first time, you may encounter scenarios where the popup shows no data or the toolbar badge icon doesn't update as expected. This page helps you diagnose and quickly fix these common first-run issues, ensuring that uBO Scope provides accurate insights right away.

---

## 1. Why No Data Appears in the Popup

The popup interface relies on live network data collected from the active browser tab. If it shows "NO DATA," it means no connection data has been recorded for the current tab yet.

### Common Causes and Fixes

- **No Network Requests Detected Yet**: The tab might not have performed any network requests since uBO Scope was installed.
  - _Fix:_ Reload the web page or switch to a different tab known to generate network requests.

- **Extension Initialization Delay**: The extension's background service worker and the Public Suffix List take a moment to load when you first install or restart your browser.
  - _Fix:_ Wait a few seconds after installing before opening the popup.

- **Permissions Missing or Disabled**: uBO Scope requires permissions such as `webRequest` and storage access to monitor network requests.
  - _Fix:_ Verify permissions under your browser extension settings. Refer to [Troubleshooting Installation & Permissions](./install-troubleshooting).

### Verification Steps

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
2. Observe the hostname displayed at the top. If it says "NO DATA," proceed to reload the page.
3. Reload the page and wait a few seconds.
4. Check the popup again; you should see domain data and connection counts.

<Tip>
If no data appears even after reloading, try opening a different website that generates network requests, such as a news site or social media platform.
</Tip>

## 2. Toolbar Badge Does Not Update or Shows No Count

The badge icon displays the number of distinct third-party domains connected to in the active tab. If it remains empty or does not update, it can cause confusion about extension activity.

### Common Causes and Quick Fixes

- **No Third-Party Connections in Tab**: The current webpage might not have made any third-party network requests.
  - _Fix:_ Navigate to a different website with external resources.

- **Background Service Worker Inactive**: Browser service workers managing the extension can occasionally be evicted or delayed.
  - _Fix:_ Refresh the page, close and reopen the tab, or restart the browser.

- **Browser Incompatibility or Version**: The extension requires certain minimum browser versions (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
  - _Fix:_ Ensure your browser version is up to date. See [Prerequisites & Supported Platforms](./prerequisites).

- **Extension Conflicts**: Other extensions interfering with `webRequest` listeners may block uBO Scope from capturing requests.
  - _Fix:_ Temporarily disable other extensions and check if the badge updates.

### Verification Steps

1. Visit a site with many external resources (e.g., `https://www.wikipedia.org`).
2. Open the uBO Scope popup and check for domain counts.
3. Confirm the badge displays a number matching the popup's domain count.

<Warning>
If your site uses HTTPS but your browser or network environment proxies or interferes with HTTPS connections, `webRequest` data might be incomplete.
</Warning>

## 4. Understanding How uBO Scope Collects Data

Behind the scenes, uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network requests made by the current tab. Its background script categorizes connections into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked outcomes, and keeps track of distinct domains.

- The extension resets data on main frame navigation to keep the report relevant.
- The badge text updates asynchronously shortly after network requests complete.

### Why Some Requests Might Not Appear

- Browser privacy features or other extensions may suppress request data.
- Some network activity outside the browser's `webRequest` scope cannot be tracked.

## 5. Quick Fixes and Tips

- **Reload the site after installing uBO Scope** to start fresh network data collection.
- **Interact with the webpage** (navigate, click links) to generate requests.
- **Avoid opening the popup immediately after installation**; allow some time for initialization.
- If data remains missing, **check browser developer console for extension errors**.
- When sharing issues, include browser version and list of other active extensions.
