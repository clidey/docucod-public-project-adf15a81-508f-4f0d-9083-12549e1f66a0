# Badge and Popup Troubleshooting

This guide helps you resolve common issues related to the uBO Scope extension's user interface, specifically problems where the toolbar badge does not update, the popup fails to display current data, or the displayed information appears stale. By following these actionable steps, you will quickly identify and fix typical UI glitches to ensure uBO Scope works reliably in your browser.

---

## 1. Understand What Should Happen

Before troubleshooting, recall the expected behaviors:

- **Badge Count:** The extension's toolbar icon badge reflects the number of distinct third-party remote domains connected to on the current active tab. It updates dynamically as the page loads or changes.
- **Popup Display:** Clicking the badge opens a popup showing categorized domain connection data—allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked—fresh for the active browser tab.

If either does not behave as described, proceed with the following troubleshooting checks.

## 2. Basic Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Restart Your Browser

Close and reopen your browser completely. This simple action often resolves UI state issues caused by memory glitches or stalled extension processes.

### Step 2: Verify Extension is Enabled

- Open your browser's extensions or add-ons page.
- Confirm that uBO Scope is installed and enabled.

### Step 3: Check for Browser and Extension Updates

- Update your browser to the latest version to ensure compatibility:
  - Chromium 122+ (e.g., Chrome, Edge)
  - Firefox 128+
  - Safari 18.5+
- Update the uBO Scope extension if an update is available.

### Step 4: Confirm uBO Scope Permissions

To work properly, uBO Scope requires:

- Access to all HTTP and HTTPS sites (host permissions: `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`)
- Permissions for `webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab`

Verify these permissions exist in the extension details page. Lack of permissions prevents the extension from monitoring network requests and updating UI elements.

## 3. Specific UI Troubleshooting

### Issue: Badge Does Not Update or Shows No Count

**Actions:**

1. **Refresh the Active Tab:** Reload the current page to trigger a new network request session.
2. **Open Other Tabs:** Switch to other tabs with network requests to verify if the badge updates elsewhere.
3. **Clear Session Data:**
   - Disable and re-enable the extension to reset.
   - Alternatively, clear browser session storage for the extension if accessible (advanced).
4. **Watch for Interference:**
   - Check if other content blockers or privacy tools might interfere; uBO Scope works alongside them but conflicts are rare.

### Issue: Popup is Blank, Does Not Show Data, or Shows “NO DATA”

**Actions:**

1. **Close and Reopen the Popup:** Sometimes the popup fails to load correctly on first click.
2. **Reload the Active Tab:** The popup data is tab-specific and requires fresh data from current tab requests.
3. **Check Network Requests:** Ensure the page is actively making HTTP(S) or WebSocket requests; static pages won’t show much data.
4. **Restart Browser:** Reset background processes that feed the popup.

### Issue: Popup Shows Stale or Incorrect Data

**Actions:**

1. **Reload Tab and Popup:** Refresh the tab and then open the popup to fetch current details.
2. **Switch Tabs:** Switch away and back to the troublesome tab to force data refresh.
3. **Check Browser Version & Extension:** Outdated components may cause desynchronization.

## 4. Advanced Checks

### Verify Extension Background Activity

The extension relies on background scripts and browser APIs that:

- Track network requests via `webRequest` listeners
- Maintain per-tab session data

If the extension background process is inactive or blocked by the browser:

- Try disabling and enabling the extension.
- Clear browser caches and restart.

### Permissions and Host Patterns

Ensure your browser has not restricted uBO Scope's `host_permissions`. Restrictions will break network monitoring.

- On Chromium browsers, check extension's "Site access" settings.
- On Firefox, verify Add-on permissions in about:addons.
- On Safari, ensure the extension meets minimum version 18.5 and is allowed full access.

## 5. Contact and Further Help

- Check for open issues or discussions on the [uBO Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
- Report your issue with detailed description, browser versions, and any error logs you can access.
