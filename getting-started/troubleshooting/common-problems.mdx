# Resolving Common Installation Issues

When setting up uBO Scope, occasional installation or operational issues may arise due to browser restrictions, permission challenges, or conflicts with other extensions. This guide provides clear, practical steps to overcome these typical hurdles, enabling you to get started with confidence and without delay.

---

## 1. Understanding Browser Compatibility and Permissions

uBO Scope supports the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari with the permissions and APIs required to track remote connections.

### Verify Your Browser Version

Make sure your browser meets these minimum version requirements:
- **Google Chrome:** version 122 or later
- **Mozilla Firefox:** version 128 or later
- **Safari:** version 18.5 or later

Older browser versions may block the extension from using required APIs or restrict functionality.

### Confirm Required Permissions

On installation, the browser will prompt you to allow uBO Scope these permissions:
- Access to active tabs
- Storage access
- Web Request monitoring

If permissions are denied, uBO Scope cannot monitor network connections properly.

<Tip>
If the extension is installed but you see no data or a zero badge count, verify that all permissions are accepted.
</Tip>

## 2. Common Installation Problems and How to Fix Them

### Problem: Extension Not Appearing in the Browser Toolbar

#### Solution:
- **Chrome:**
  1. Click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions menu).
  2. Pin uBO Scope to the toolbar by clicking the pin icon next to it.
- **Firefox:**
  1. Click the menu button and select "Customize Toolbar."
  2. Drag and drop the uBO Scope icon to the toolbar.
- **Safari:**
  1. Open Safari preferences > Extensions.
  2. Ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
  3. Add the extension icon to the toolbar via "View > Customize Toolbar."

<Tip>
Browser toolbars can be customized; extension icons can be hidden. Locating and pinning uBO Scope ensures easy access.
</Tip>

### Problem: No Connections Detected or Badge Count Remains Zero

This often happens if browser permissions are insufficient or the extension is not running correctly.

#### How to Troubleshoot:
1. **Verify permissions:** Open extension details in your browser and confirm all requested permissions are granted.
2. **Restart your browser:** Sometimes, a fresh browser start activates the extension fully.
3. **Check for conflicts:** Disable other content blockers or privacy extensions temporarily, as they may interfere with uBO Scope’s webRequest listeners.
4. **Test on multiple websites:** Visit well-known sites that load multiple resources (e.g., news sites) to trigger network requests.

<Tip>
uBO Scope listens to the browser’s webRequest API, so any network filtering that happens outside this API scope (like system-level proxies) may cause incomplete data.
</Tip>

### Problem: Extension Fails to Install or Gets Blocked by Browser

Browsers may block extensions during installation if they are not from verified sources or if security settings are restrictive.

#### Fixes:
- Always install uBO Scope from official stores:
  - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
  - Safari Extension Gallery or System Preferences > Extensions

- Temporarily relax stricter security settings if your enterprise or antivirus software is interfering.
- If you are loading the extension manually for development, ensure the browser is in developer mode and follows instructions for loading unpacked extensions.

<Warning>
Do not install extensions from untrusted or unknown sources as this exposes you to security risks.
</Warning>

### Problem: Conflicts with Other Content Blockers

Other installed blockers or privacy tools may restrict uBO Scope’s ability to monitor network requests fully.

#### Resolution Steps:
1. Temporarily disable other content blockers and observe if uBO Scope reports connections.
2. If a conflict is detected, consider adjusting settings or scopes of other extensions.

<Note>
uBO Scope is designed to work alongside blockers but relies on the webRequest API being available and unfiltered.
</Note>

## 3. Resetting and Reinstalling the Extension

If issues persist after trying the above, a fresh reinstall often resolves corrupted states or permission glitches.

### How to Reinstall:

1. Remove uBO Scope from your browser.
2. Restart the browser.
3. Install the extension again from the official source.
4. Accept all permission prompts during installation.
5. Open a few websites to confirm that connection counts and popup data begin populating.

<Tip>
After reinstalling, verify that you can open the popup and see allowed, stealth, and blocked domains for active tabs.
</Tip>

## 4. Additional Troubleshooting and Help

### Viewing Logs

For advanced troubleshooting or developers:
- Check browser console logs for errors related to uBO Scope.
- Check the Service Worker (Chrome) or background scripts logs for runtime errors.

### Network Request Visibility

Remember, uBO Scope can only see requests managed by the browser's `webRequest` API. Some network activity initiated outside browser APIs (e.g., native apps, VPN-filtered DNS) will not be visible.

### Getting Help

- Review the [Installation Basics](../../getting-started/installation-basics/install-extension) guide for detailed setup instructions.
- Visit the GitHub repository for issues and community support: [https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope)

<Info>
The extension's transparency-focused design helps you identify actual network connections, not just blocks, allowing better understanding of privacy exposures.
