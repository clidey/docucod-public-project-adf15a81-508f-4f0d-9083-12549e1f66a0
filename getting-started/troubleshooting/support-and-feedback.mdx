## 1. Getting Help with Installation and Setup

Whether you're installing uBO-Scope for the first time or facing challenges after installation, these resources will assist you in resolving common issues and understanding the setup process.

### Step 1: Review the Installation and Prerequisites Documentation

Before seeking direct support, make sure you have reviewed:

- [System Requirements](https://example.com/getting-started/install-and-requirements/system-requirements) – Confirm your browser and OS versions meet minimum requirements.
- [Browser Installation Guide](https://example.com/getting-started/install-and-requirements/browser-installation) – Follow step-by-step installation instructions tailored to your browser.
- [Activating and Locating the Extension](https://example.com/getting-started/first-run-and-setup/activating-extension) – Ensure uBO-Scope is enabled and accessible in your browser toolbar.

This groundwork prevents common missteps and often resolves early issues.

### Step 2: Use the Troubleshooting Resources

If your extension is installed but not working as expected:

- Consult [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](https://example.com/getting-started/troubleshooting/common-issues) for quick fixes covering inactive extensions, missing permissions, or no data display.
- Check the [Validating Successful Setup](https://example.com/getting-started/first-run-and-setup/quick-validation) guide to confirm functionality.

### Step 3: Report Persistent Installation Problems

If issues persist after these steps:

- Collect relevant details: browser version, operating system, uBO-Scope version (findable in extension details), and a description of the problem.
- Visit the **Support and Feedback** section below to submit a detailed bug report or request help.


## 2. How to Submit Feedback or Report Bugs

We value your input to improve uBO-Scope. Here is how you can share feedback or report problems effectively.

### Step 1: Use the GitHub Repository Issues

The primary platform for bug reports and feature requests is the uBO-Scope GitHub repository:

- Repository URL: [https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope)

#### How to submit an issue:

1. Navigate to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/issues).
2. Search existing issues to check if your problem or suggestion is already reported.
3. If not, click **New issue**.
4. Provide a descriptive title and a detailed description including:
    - Steps to reproduce the problem
    - Your environment (browser, version, OS)
    - Screenshots or logs if applicable
    - Expected behavior vs. actual behavior

<Tip>
Clear, detailed reports help maintainers quickly understand and resolve issues.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Feature Requests and Suggestions

Feel free to use the GitHub Issues to propose new features or improvements. When making suggestions:

- Explain why the feature would be valuable
- Describe typical use cases or scenarios

### Step 3: Engage Respectfully and Monitor Your Reports

- Be patient; maintainers may take time to respond.
- Monitor your issue for questions or requests for more details.
- Provide timely updates if the issue changes or resolves.


## 3. Community and Additional Support Resources

Besides direct GitHub interaction, consider these avenues:

- **Browser Stores:** Sometimes users share tips or workarounds in reviews on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
- **Related Documentation:** Use other guides such as:
  - [Basic Usage Walkthrough](https://example.com/getting-started/first-run-and-setup/basic-usage-walkthrough) to understand interpreting domain activity.
  - [Analyzing Allowed, Stealth, and Blocked Domains](https://example.com/guides/core-workflows/analyzing-allowed-stealth-blocked) for advanced insights.


## 4. Best Practices for Support Requests

Following these best practices will enhance your experience:

- Always specify your extension version and browser details.
- Provide exact error messages or unexpected behaviors.
- Illustrate what you have already tried.
- Check if your issue might be addressed in the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](https://example.com/getting-started/troubleshooting/common-issues) guide.


## 5. Legal and Privacy Considerations

When sharing logs, screenshots, or details:

- Avoid sharing sensitive or personal data.
- Follow data privacy best practices.
