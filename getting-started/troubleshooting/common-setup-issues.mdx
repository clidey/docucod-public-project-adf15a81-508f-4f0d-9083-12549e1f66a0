# Common Installation & Startup Issues

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve frequent issues encountered during the installation and startup of uBO Scope. These issues range from the extension not appearing after installation, insufficient permissions blocking its operation, to compatibility problems with specific browser settings. By following the practical checks and remedies below, you can restore uBO Scope’s functionality and confidently continue your privacy diagnostics.

## 1. Extension Not Visible or Missing

If you cannot locate the uBO Scope icon or extension in your browser toolbar after installation, follow these steps:

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Confirm Successful Installation:**
   - In your browser’s extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions/` or `about:addons`), check if uBO Scope is listed and enabled.

2. **Enable the Extension:**
   - If it is disabled, toggle it on.

3. **Pin the Extension (Chromium-based browsers):**
   - Click the puzzle-piece icon in the toolbar, then click the pin icon next to uBO Scope to make it always visible.

4. **Check the Toolbar Overflow:**
   - Some browsers hide icons in an overflow menu — open it to check.

5. **Restart the Browser:**
   - Occasionally, a restart is needed after installation.

### Common Pitfalls

- Installing a different version accidentally (e.g., from an unofficial source).
- Extension conflicts that prevent uBO Scope from loading.

<Warning>
Always install uBO Scope from official sources: the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp), [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/), or Apple Safari Extensions Gallery. Avoid third-party downloads.
</Warning>

## 2. Insufficient Permissions Blocking Operation

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network requests and display relevant data.

### Required Permissions

- **`webRequest`**: To observe all web requests.
- **`activeTab`**: To interact with the current browser tab.
- **`storage`**: To save session data and public suffix lists.

These permissions are declared in the manifest file and requested during installation.

### How to Verify Permissions

1. Open your browser’s extension management page.
2. Locate uBO Scope and view its permissions.
3. Ensure it has permissions for `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`.

### Remedies

- If permissions are missing, try removing and reinstalling the extension.
- For enterprise or managed browsers, ensure your policies allow these permissions.

<Tip>
If you experience unexplained lack of data or empty popup issues (see next section), permission problems are the most probable cause.
</Tip>

## 3. Incompatibility with Browser Settings or Other Extensions

Certain browser settings or other privacy/security extensions might interfere with uBO Scope’s ability to monitor web requests.

### Common Scenarios

- **Content Security Policies (CSPs)** or strict privacy settings may restrict webRequest APIs.
- Other extensions that aggressively block network requests or intercept web requests before uBO Scope.
- Browsers with incomplete or non-standard webRequest API implementations.

### How to Diagnose

- Disable other privacy or network monitoring extensions temporarily to see if uBO Scope works.
- Test uBO Scope on different websites.
- Confirm that your browser version is supported (refer to Supported Browsers & System Requirements).

### Remedies

- Update your browser to the latest version.
- Configure or disable conflicting extensions.
- Check browser-specific issues (see Troubleshooting No Data or Empty Popup).

<Note>
Chromium browsers require at least version 122.0. Firefox minimum version is 128.0, and Safari requires 18.5 or newer for full compatibility.
</Note>

## 4. Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Empty

After clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon, if the popup remains empty or displays "NO DATA", it means no network connection data could be retrieved.

### Quick Validation

1. Ensure the active tab has fully loaded a web page — uBO Scope collects data per tab.
2. Open several different tabs and check the popup in each to rule out tab-specific issues.
3. Make sure you have visited websites with network activity.

### Common Causes

- The extension lacks the necessary permissions to monitor network requests.
- The browser forbids extensions from accessing network data due to privacy settings.
- The extension's background service worker failed to load or crashed.
- Browser cache or session storage corruption.

### Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

<Steps>
<Step title="Reload the Page and Popup">
Refresh the webpage in the active tab, then open the uBO Scope popup to check for updated data.
</Step>
<Step title="Restart the Browser">
Close all browser windows completely, then reopen and check if the popup populates.
</Step>
<Step title="Reinstall uBO Scope">
Remove the extension and reinstall it from the official source to reset all stored session data.
</Step>
<Step title="Clear Browser Storage">
Manually clear browser extension storage (consult your browser's docs), or reset storage by reinstalling.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Console for Errors">
Open the popup’s developer console (right-click popup, Inspect) and look for error messages indicating permission or service worker issues.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Further Assistance

If the issue continues, consult the [Troubleshooting: No Data or Empty Popup]( /getting-started/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-no-data ) guide for more advanced diagnostics.

## 5. Other Common Startup Issues

### Frequent Problems

- **Browser not supported or outdated:** Check your browser version matches the minimum requirements.
- **Corrupt extension installation:** Remove and reinstall.
- **Conflicting security software or firewall:** May block extension or its background scripts.

### Quick Checks

- Verify your browser version:
  - Chrome ≥ 122
  - Firefox ≥ 128
  - Safari ≥ 18.5
- Restart your system if you suspect process locks or conflicts.
- Temporarily disable firewall or antivirus that might interfere.

<Warning>
Enterprise managed devices may have restrictions that prevent extension functionality. Consult your system administrator if you suspect this is the case.
</Warning>
