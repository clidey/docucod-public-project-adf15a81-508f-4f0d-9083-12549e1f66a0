# Common Installation Problems & Fixes

This page helps you diagnose and resolve typical installation issues encountered when setting up the uBO Scope browser extension. By following these actionable solutions step by step, you can overcome hurdles like permissions errors, missing extension icons, and incompatible browser versions to ensure a smooth start with uBO Scope.

---

## 1. Permission Denied Errors

If uBO Scope is not functioning correctly or shows no data, permission denials are a common cause. These errors happen when the extension lacks required permissions to monitor network requests.

### How to Fix Permission Denied Issues

1. **Check Extension Permissions in Browser Settings**
   - Open your browser’s extension page.
   - Locate uBO Scope.
   - Ensure _webRequest_, _activeTab_, and _storage_ permissions are granted.
   - For some browsers, you may need to explicitly allow the extension to run on all sites.

2. **Reinstall the Extension**
   - Remove uBO Scope from your browser.
   - Reinstall it from the official web store for your browser:
     - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
     - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
   - During installation, accept all permission requests.

3. **Reload the Browser or Restart It**
   - Sometimes a browser restart is required to apply permission changes.

<Tip>
If you are using a privacy or security suite, check if the extension permissions are blocked or restricted there.
</Tip>

## 2. Extension Icon Not Showing in Toolbar

Sometimes after installation, the uBO Scope icon does not appear on the toolbar, causing confusion about whether installation was successful.

### Steps to Restore the Toolbar Icon

1. **Pin the Extension Icon**
   - In Chromium-based browsers, click the puzzle piece icon (extensions menu).
   - Find uBO Scope.
   - Click the pin icon to keep it visible on the toolbar.

2. **Check Toolbar Settings**
   - Make sure your browser is not hiding toolbar icons due to overflow or settings.

3. **Verify Installation**
   - Go to the browser’s extensions page.
   - Confirm uBO Scope is installed and enabled.

4. **Clear Browser Cache (If Needed)**
   - Sometimes browser glitches cause UI hiccups.
   - Clear the cache or profile data and restart the browser.

<Warning>
If the icon still does not show, verify the extension is installed from an official source and matches the current version (1.0.1).
</Warning>

## 3. Incompatible Browser Versions

uBO Scope has strict minimum browser versions for each supported platform due to reliance on modern browser APIs.

### Supported Browsers & Minimum Versions:

| Browser           | Minimum Version |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Chrome/Chromium   | 122.0           |
| Firefox           | 128.0           |
| Safari            | 18.5            |

### What to Do If Your Browser is Outdated

1. **Update Your Browser**
   - Open your browser’s settings menu.
   - Navigate to _About_ or _Help_ section.
   - Check for updates and install the latest version available.

2. **Use an Alternative Supported Browser Temporarily**
   - If your current browser cannot upgrade, install uBO Scope on a supported alternate browser.

3. **Confirm Extension Manifest Version**
   - uBO Scope requires manifest version 3 compliant browsers.
   - Legacy browsers or those without MV3 support will not run the extension.

<Note>
Older or beta versions of browsers may cause unpredictable issues. Always use stable releases.
</Note>

## 4. Extension Shows No Data or 'NO DATA' in Popup

If the popup panel only shows 'NO DATA', it means uBO Scope is not capturing network events.

### How to Fix This:

1. **Verify Extension Is Enabled and Permissions Are Granted**
2. **Browse a Website After Installation**
   - Open any website and try to load various pages to generate network activity.
   - The badge count and popup should update accordingly.

3. **Check for Conflicting Extensions**
   - Other content blockers or privacy extensions could interfere.
   - Temporarily disable them and test uBO Scope again.

4. **Reload or Restart Browser If Needed**

## 5. Network Request Monitoring Not Working as Expected

Sometimes uBO Scope may not show expected connections, especially with stealth or blocked content.

### Tips to Improve Network Monitoring

- Make sure your browser supports the `webRequest` API fully; some newer privacy modes limit this.
- Confirm that no system-wide DNS or network filters are blocking requests at a level uBO Scope cannot detect.
- Test with common websites to verify basic functionality.
