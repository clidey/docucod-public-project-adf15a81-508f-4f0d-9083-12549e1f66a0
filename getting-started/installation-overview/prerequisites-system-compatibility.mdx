# Prerequisites & System Compatibility

Before installing and using uBO Scope, it is essential to ensure your environment meets the necessary browser and operating system requirements. This guarantees seamless integration of the extension and optimal performance in monitoring network connections.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope supports mainstream modern browsers with extension frameworks compatible with Manifest Version 3 (MV3). Below are the browsers where uBO Scope can be installed:

- **Chromium-based Browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)**
  - Minimum Chrome version supported: **122.0**
  - Supports `webRequest` API required for network monitoring.

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum Firefox version supported: **128.0**
  - Full support for the required APIs on desktop and Firefox for Android.

- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum Safari version supported: **18.5**
  - Support requires `safari-web-extension` architecture with limited extension APIs.


## 2. Operating System Compatibility

The extension runs within supported browsers and is compatible with these operating systems:

- Windows 10 / 11 (via Chromium or Firefox)
- macOS 13+ (via Safari, Chromium, or Firefox)
- Linux distributions with Chromium or Firefox
- Android (Firefox for Android only)


## 3. Permissions and Host Access

uBO Scope requires explicit permissions to monitor network requests:

- **Active Tab Access**: To read information about the currently active browser tab.
- **Web Request Permission**: Allows the extension to observe and log network requests, including redirects, errors, and successful responses.
- **Storage Access**: To save session data and the public suffix list for domain parsing.

Additionally, host permissions provide URL access to all HTTP and HTTPS requests for:

- `http://*/*`
- `https://*/*`
- For Chromium and Firefox, also WebSocket URLs:
  - `ws://*/*`
  - `wss://*/*`


## 4. Browser Extension Permissions by Platform

| Platform        | Permissions Required                    | Notes                                            |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium        | activeTab, storage, webRequest          | Requires minimum Chrome 122.0                      |
| Firefox         | activeTab, storage, webRequest          | Minimum Firefox 128.0; includes WebSocket support |
| Safari          | activeTab, storage, webRequest          | Requires Safari 18.5+; limited WebSocket support  |


## 5. Network and Security Considerations

- The extension operates by monitoring network requests through the browser's `webRequest` API. It can detect requests even when other content blockers intervene, as long as the browser reports these requests.
- Some network requests made outside the reach of the browser's `webRequest` API (e.g., in isolated environments or specialized apps) will **not** be monitored.
- Firewalls, VPNs, or network proxies should not block the browser's internal extension APIs.


## 6. Practical Recommendations Before Installing

- Use the latest stable version of your supported browser.
- Confirm the browser supports Manifest V3 extensions.
- Check that no corporate policies restrict extension permissions like `webRequest`.
- Ensure you have permissions to install extensions.


## 7. Summary Checklist

<Check>
- Are you running **Chrome 122+**, **Firefox 128+**, or **Safari 18.5+**?
- Do you have sufficient permissions to install extensions?
- Is `webRequest` permission available and not disabled?
- Does your browser allow access to the required host URLs (`http`, `https`, and optionally WebSocket)?
- Are you expecting monitoring of network requests initiated by web pages in these browsers?
</Check>


## 8. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Compatibility Challenges">
<Accordion title="Extension Not Installing or Loading">
- Ensure you meet minimum browser version requirements.
- Verify extension platform compatibility.
- Confirm internet connectivity for downloading the extension.
- Check for conflicting or restrictive security software.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing or Faulty Badge Counts">
- Verify `webRequest` permissions are granted.
- Confirm your browser supports the required APIs.
- Check browser policy settings that might block extension access.
- Restart your browser to refresh extension state.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Network Monitoring Behavior">
- Some specialized browsers or privacy-focused platforms may restrict the `webRequest` API.
- Network requests made outside the main browser process or sandbox may be unreported.
- Check for interaction with other extensions that modify requests.
</Accordion>
