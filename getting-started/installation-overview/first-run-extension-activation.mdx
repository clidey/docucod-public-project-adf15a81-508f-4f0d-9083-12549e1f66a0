# First Run & Extension Activation

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through what to expect when you launch the extension for the first time, how to activate it, verify that it’s running correctly, and a quick introduction to its main interface and toolbar badge.

## 1. Activating uBO Scope After Installation

Once you have installed uBO Scope from the official browser extensions store or manually in your browser, the extension requires no additional setup to start functioning. Here’s how to confirm activation and initial readiness:

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the Extension Icon in Your Browser Toolbar">
Look for the uBO Scope icon near your browser's address bar. It looks like a small badge with the uBO Scope logo.

- In Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge): It appears next to the address bar.
- In Firefox: It is near the address bar or inside the overflow menu.
- In Safari: It appears on the Safari toolbar after installation.

</Step>
<Step title="Click the Extension Icon to Open the Popup Panel">
Click the uBO Scope icon to open its popup interface. This panel displays the network connections made by the active tab.

- The panel shows a summary of domains connected.
- Sections split connections into "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked".

</Step>
<Step title="Confirm the Badge Count Appears on the Toolbar Icon">
The badge count on the icon indicates the number of distinct third-party remote servers your current tab has connected to.

- A number means uBO Scope is actively monitoring.
- An empty badge means no third-party connections detected yet.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you don’t see the extension icon, check your browser’s extension management page to ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding What Happens on First Launch

uBO Scope immediately begins monitoring network activity for each new tab you open or reload. When visiting websites:

- It reports and categorizes all remote server connections.
- It listens to network requests via the browser’s `webRequest` API, regardless of other content blockers you have installed.
- It classifies requests as:
  - **Allowed**: Connections that succeeded.
  - **Blocked**: Connections explicitly blocked.
  - **Stealth-blocked**: Connections that are redirected or otherwise hidden from the page.

This means even on first launch without additional configuration, uBO Scope tracks real-time network requests transparently.

## 3. A Quick Tour of the Extension Interface

Once you open the popup panel, you will see several key interface elements:

### a. Tab Hostname Header
Displays the hostname and domain of the active webpage.

### b. Summary Section
Shows the total number of distinct third-party domains connected.

### c. Connection Categories
Three sections list domains by request outcome:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains allowed and contacted successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were redirected or otherwise stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked:** Domains for which requests were blocked.

Each domain entry includes the number of requests in parentheses.

### d. Toolbar Badge
Reflects the count of distinct allowed third-party remote servers for the current tab.

This aggregating badge reflects your privacy exposure, where a lower count is typically better.

## 4. Verifying Successful Setup

Follow these straightforward steps to confirm uBO Scope is fully operational:

<Steps>
<Step title="Load a Trusted Website">
Open a website you frequently visit.

<Check>
The badge number on the extension icon should update to reflect active network connections.
</Check>
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel for Details">
Click the uBO Scope icon.

- The popup updates to list domains and categorized connection outcomes.
- Verify that the hostname matches the site you opened.
</Step>
<Step title="Navigate to a Different Tab and Refresh">
Switch tabs or open a new tab and reload a website.

- Watch the badge count update.
- Confirm the popup content refreshes accordingly for the new active tab.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The extension respects browser security restrictions; some sites, particularly local or internal network addresses, might show limited or no data.
</Note>

## 5. Tips to Enhance Your Onboarding Experience

- **Pin the Extension:** For fast access, pin uBO Scope’s icon to your browser toolbar.
- **Refresh Pages After Installation:** Reload any already-open websites after installing so the extension can detect network requests.
- **Understand the Badge Count:** This count reflects distinct third-party domains successfully connected, not total requests or blocks.

## 6. Common Pitfalls at First Run

- **No Badge Count appears:**
  - Ensure the extension is enabled.
  - Refresh the tab after installation.
  - Some tabs like browser settings or internal pages are not monitored.
- **Popup shows 'NO DATA':**
  - Wait a moment for data collection.
  - Reload the webpage.
- **Extension icon missing:**
  - Verify installation or pin extension to toolbar.
