# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Before installing uBO Scope, it is essential to verify that your environment supports the extension fully. This page guides you through the necessary browser compatibility, version requirements, and other technical prerequisites to ensure uBO Scope operates optimally and provides accurate network connection analysis.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension that leverages the browserâ€™s `webRequest` API to monitor all network connections initiated by web pages. Because it relies on this API, not all browsers are compatible, and specific minimum browser versions are required.

| Browser       | Minimum Supported Version | Notes                                  |
|---------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Google Chrome / Chromium-compatible** | 122.0                      | Requires Manifest V3 support and `webRequest` permissions. |
| **Mozilla Firefox**                 | 128.0                      | Includes Firefox for desktop and Android with `webRequest` support. |
| **Safari**                        | 18.5                       | Uses Safari Web Extensions; minimum strict version enforced. |


### Why Minimum Versions Matter

Each browser enforces different levels of extension APIs and permissions. uBO Scope needs access to network request events (`webRequest`) and storage APIs, which are only guaranteed in these versions or later. Installing the extension on older versions may cause failure or partial functionality.

## 2. Permissions and API Requirements

To function correctly, uBO Scope requires the following permissions granted to the extension:

- **`webRequest`**: Essential for tracking all network requests and their outcomes.
- **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to associate network data with the active browser tab.
- **`storage`**: Needed for saving session data and public suffix list for domain detection.

> These permissions are automatically requested during the installation from the official browser extension stores. Ensure you accept all prompts.

## 3. Network and Security Considerations

- uBO Scope monitors HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket (`ws` / `wss`) connections as permitted by the browser.
- For browsers restricting or sandboxing `webRequest` API (e.g., in private or incognito modes), uBO Scope may have limited visibility.
- Network request events made outside of `webRequest` API scope (such as certain browser internals or features) are not visible to uBO Scope.

<Note>
Since uBO Scope relies heavily on browser capabilities, running it via Developer Mode or from untrusted sources can pose security risks and may lead to functionality degradation or errors.
</Note>

## 4. System & Environment Requirements

- **Operating System**: Any OS that supports the above browser versions (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS for Safari)
- **Disk Space**: Minimal (extension footprint and occasional cached data for domain suffix list)
- **Internet Access**: Required during extension update and to fetch public suffix list data on first run or as needed

## 5. Compatibility with Other Extensions

uBO Scope is designed to work alongside other content blockers or privacy extensions. It reports accurate network request outcomes regardless of other blockers.

> However, some extensions or browser settings may interfere with the `webRequest` API, diminishing uBO Scope's accuracy.

## 6. Summary of Installation Readiness

Confirm the following before proceeding to installation:

- You have a supported and up-to-date browser version:

  - Chrome 122+
  - Firefox 128+
  - Safari 18.5+

- You have a stable internet connection for extension fetching and updates.
- You accept all requested permissions during extension installation.
- No conflicting privacy settings or extensions block `webRequest` API access.

## Troubleshooting Common Pre-Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Extension Not Showing Up After Installation">
- Verify your browser version meets minimum requirements.
- Check that the extension was properly installed from the official store.
- In Chrome, ensure the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions`.
- Restart the browser if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Are Not Granted">
- Some browsers require manual acceptance of permissions.
- Check extension settings and grant permissions if requested.
- For Firefox, verify extension is allowed to run in private windows if you use those.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Requests Not Being Tracked">
- Review browser privacy settings that may block tracking.
- Confirm no other extensions interfere with the `webRequest` API.
- Check for any VPNs or DNS-level filters that might alter network visibility.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported Browser Version">
- Upgrade your browser to the latest stable version.
- If you use browser forks or lesser-known browsers, check for `webRequest` API support.
</Accordion>

## Additional Technical Notes

- uBO Scope uses an embedded and cached version of the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/list/) to accurately distinguish top-level domains from subdomains for domain categorization.
- Domains and hostnames are decoded using punycode for proper internationalized domain name (IDN) representation.
- The extension manifest files reflect these settings and permissions across supported platforms.
