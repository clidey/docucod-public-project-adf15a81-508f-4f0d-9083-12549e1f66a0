# Installing uBO Scope

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension that transparently reveals all remote server connections initiated by webpages, helping you understand which third-party networks your browser communicates with. This guide walks you through installing uBO Scope on the major supported browsers — Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari — using official extension stores or manual installation for minimal setup effort.

---

## Supported Browsers and Versions

- **Chromium-based browsers:** Google Chrome & derivatives (min. version 122.0)
- **Firefox:** Mozilla Firefox (min. version 128.0)
- **Safari:** Safari (min. version 18.5)

These versions are required to ensure compatibility with uBO Scope’s manifest and use of WebExtensions APIs, especially `webRequest` and MV3 background service workers.

## Step 1: Install from Official Stores

The simplest and most reliable way to install uBO Scope is through the official browser extension marketplaces. Follow these links and instructions for your browser.

### For Chromium-based Browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Edge)

1. Open the [Chrome Web Store page for uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
2. Click **Add to Chrome**.
3. Confirm installation by clicking **Add extension** in the popup.
4. You should see the uBO Scope icon appear near the browser toolbar.

### For Firefox

1. Open the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Confirm installation by clicking **Add** and optionally grant requested permissions.
4. The uBO Scope extension icon will appear in the toolbar.

### For Safari

1. In Safari, open the App Store or follow this [Safari Extension page](https://apps.apple.com/app/idyour-app-id-here) (replace with official link if provided).
2. Search for **uBO Scope** or visit directly if available.
3. Click **Get** and install the extension.
4. Open Safari > Preferences > Extensions and enable uBO Scope.

<Note>
If you do not find uBO Scope in the Safari Extension gallery, you may install the development version manually (see Manual Installation below).
</Note>

## Step 2: Manual Installation (Advanced / Development Use)

If you prefer or require manual installation (e.g., for development, testing a local build, or installing on browsers without store access), follow these platform-specific instructions:

### For Chromium-based Browsers

1. Download or build the uBO Scope extension source files.
2. Open your browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle at top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked**.
5. Select the folder containing uBO Scope files (e.g., `build/uBO-Scope.chromium/`).
6. The extension will load and its icon will appear near the toolbar.

### For Firefox

1. Download the source files or build.
2. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
3. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
4. Select the `manifest.json` file inside the uBO Scope directory (for example, under `build/uBO-Scope.firefox/`).
5. The extension loads temporarily (lasts until Firefox restarts).

### For Safari

1. Safari requires extensions to be signed and packaged.
2. For development, open **Safari > Settings > Extensions** (or Preferences > Extensions).
3. Enable **Developer Mode**.
4. Use Xcode to open the extension project and run it on Safari.
5. Alternatively, if you have the packaged extension, install through Safari’s extension installer.

<Tip>
Manual installation is recommended only if you wish to modify or debug the extension, or if automatic store install is not possible. For everyday use, always use the official web stores.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Confirm Installation Success

After installing, verify the extension is active and ready:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar — the icon’s badge will indicate the number of distinct third-party connections detected on your active tab.
2. Click the icon to open the popup panel. You should see the hostname and categorized domains (Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, Blocked).
3. Browse to a website, and observe the badge count changing based on network connections.

<Check>
If the popup reads **NO DATA** or shows empty counts, reload the webpage or try navigating to another site.
</Check>

---

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Use on pages where you want to audit third-party requests;** content-heavy sites typically show more connections.
- **Remember that a lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, which usually means less exposure to external resources.**
- **uBO Scope works alongside other content blockers without conflict, as it solely monitors network requests via the browser’s `webRequest` API.**
- **If you notice no badge or data, ensure the extension has permission and that your browser version meets minimum requirements.**

## Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

### Extension Does Not Appear or Icon is Missing

- Verify the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions/settings page.
- Restart your browser to force reload extensions.
- Ensure your browser version meets the minimum required version.

### Popup Displays 'NO DATA' Continuously

- Refresh the active tab to trigger data capture.
- Browsers limit `webRequest` API usage on pages like internal browser pages (new tab, settings) — try with regular websites.

### Badge Count Never Updates

- Confirm the extension has host permissions for the URLs you visit.
- Disable other conflicting extensions temporarily to test.

### Issues Installing on Safari

- Safari might require manual approval of the extension in preferences.
- Use Xcode and developer tools for sideloading unsigned versions.

# Quick Reference

| Browser | Install Link |
|---------|--------------|
| Chromium (Chrome, Edge) | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |
| Safari | See App Store or manual install instructions above |

For manual packaging or development:

- Use `tools/make-package.sh` script on Linux to prepare an unpacked extension folder for a specified platform (chromium, firefox, safari).

Example usage:
```bash
./tools/make-package.sh chromium 1.0.1
```

This will create a ready-to-load unpacked package in `build/uBO-Scope.chromium` with manifest updated to version `1.0.1`.

Refer to the GitHub repository for the latest source and build instructions.
