## 1. Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

| Browser  | Minimum Version | Installation Source | Notes |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ----- |

## 3. Browser-Specific Requirements

### Chromium-based browsers

- Must be version 122.0 or newer, as uBO Scope requires Manifest Version 3 and its associated APIs.
- Uses a service worker (`background.service_worker`) for background processing.
- Host permissions include HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and Secure WebSocket URLs.

### Firefox

- Requires Firefox version 128 or newer on both desktop and Android.
- The extension includes the necessary `browser_specific_settings` for Gecko compatibility.
- Supports WebSocket and Secure WebSocket.

### Safari

- Strict minimum version 18.5 as mandated by manifest file.
- The extension follows Safari’s web extension model with background scripts loaded as modules.

## 4. Permissions Required

- **activeTab**: To access details of the tabs user interacts with.
- **storage**: To persist session and configuration data.
- **webRequest**: Mandatory to observe and log the network connections of browser tabs.
- Host permissions for `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, as well as websocket schemes `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*` (except Safari which only includes HTTP and HTTPS).

## 5. Verifying Compatibility Before Installation

Before installing uBO Scope, verify the following:

1. **Check your browser version:**

   - In Chrome/Edge/Brave, navigate to `chrome://settings/help`.
   - In Firefox, go to `about:support` or `Menu > Help > About Firefox`.
   - In Safari, choose `Safari > About Safari` from the menu.

2. **Confirm Manifest V3 support:**

   - For Chromium browsers, Manifest V3 is supported starting from Chrome 122.

3. **Ensure connectivity:**

   - uBO Scope fetches the Public Suffix List dynamically for effective domain parsing, which requires outbound internet access.

## 6. Tips & Best Practices

- Use the **latest stable versions** of supported browsers to benefit from security and compatibility improvements.
- If you use mobile devices, note that full functionality is guaranteed on Firefox Android only.
- Avoid installing uBO Scope on unsupported or older browsers, as the extension may fail silently or exhibit unpredictable behavior.
