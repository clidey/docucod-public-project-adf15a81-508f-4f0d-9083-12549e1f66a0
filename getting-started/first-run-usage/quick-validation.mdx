# Validating Proper Setup

Ensure your uBO Scope extension is functioning correctly by following these quick validation steps. This guide helps you confirm that the extension accurately tracks third-party connections, updates badge counts as expected, and reflects real network activity for the websites you visit.

---

## 1. Verify the Extension is Active

Before validating functionality, confirm that uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled in your browser:

- Open your browser’s extension or add-on manager.
- Check that uBO Scope is listed and enabled.
- Ensure permissions requested (such as `webRequest`) are granted.

If the extension is not enabled or permissions are missing, refer to the [Initial Configuration](./initial-configuration) guide to resolve setup issues.

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar.
- The popup panel should appear automatically without any errors.
- The top section will display the hostname and the main domain of the current active tab.
- Below, you will see three sections labeled **Not Blocked**, **Stealth-blocked**, and **Blocked** with domain counts.

## 3. Observe Real-Time Domain Counts

Visit a commonly used website with known third-party connections, such as example.com or cnn.com. Then:

- Click the uBO Scope popup to refresh the view.
- Observe the **domains connected** count at the top summary.
- The badge on the extension’s toolbar icon should update to match the number of distinct allowed third-party domains detected for the active tab.

If you see a zero count or no domains listed when browsing sites known to have third-party resources, the extension may not be collecting data properly.

## 4. Understand Domain Categorization

uBO Scope shows third-party domains grouped by outcome:

- **Not Blocked**: Domains your browser connected to successfully (allowed).
- **Stealth-blocked**: Domains where the browser encountered redirects or stealth blocking.
- **Blocked**: Domains blocked due to errors or explicit blocking rules.

Review this categorization by clicking through the popup to ensure domain counts appear consistent with your browsing experience and any content blockers you have enabled.

## 5. Confirm Badge Count Syncs with Popup Data

- The number visible on the browser toolbar icon (the badge) represents the count of distinct third-party domains successfully connected.
- Open the popup and confirm the number next to **domains connected** matches this badge count.

Discrepancies between these counts indicate synchronization issues or that tab-specific data is not updated correctly.

## 6. Troubleshooting Tips

<Tip>
If you do not see any data or the popup shows 'NO DATA':
- Reload the current browser tab.
- Wait a few seconds to allow network requests to be captured.
- Restart your browser and try again.
- Confirm uBO Scope permissions under your browser settings.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use known test websites with heavy third-party content to confirm behavior:
- https://www.wikipedia.org
- https://www.nytimes.com
- https://www.youtube.com
</Tip>

<Warning>
If your browser restricts extensions’ access to webRequest events (common in some browsers or private/incognito modes), uBO Scope may not receive accurate connection data. Confirm browser policy compatibility in the [Integration & Compatibility](../overview/feature-overview-and-integration/integration-and-compatibility) guide.
</Warning>

## 7. Reviewing Data Details

For a deeper check:

- Open the popup UI and inspect listed domains.
- Domains are presented with counts of connection occurrences.
- Compare these with your browser’s network inspector to verify accuracy.

## 8. What Success Looks Like

You have successfully validated uBO Scope setup if:

- The popup UI opens without errors.
- The badge shows a dynamic count when browsing sites.
- Domains are categorized correctly into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- Counts in the popup and badge match for the current tab.
