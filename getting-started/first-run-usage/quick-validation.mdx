# Quick Validation & First Insights

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with **uBO-Scope**! This guide will walk you through a simple checklist to quickly verify that the extension is installed, running correctly, and providing real-time insights into your browser's network connections.

---

## 1. Confirm uBO-Scope is Installed and Active

Before you begin, ensure that uBO-Scope is installed in your supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+). If you haven't installed it yet, please refer to the [Installing uBO-Scope](../setup-install/install-browser) guide.

### Steps:

1. Locate the uBO-Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It usually appears as a small badge displaying a number (or empty if no third-party domains are detected).
2. Make sure uBO-Scope is enabled and not disabled or hidden.

<Tip>
If the icon is not visible, check your browser's extension management page and ensure it is enabled and has the necessary permissions.
</Tip>

## 2. Open a New Webpage to Generate Network Activity

A key feature of uBO-Scope is its ability to report distinct third-party remote servers your browser connects to on any webpage.

### Steps:

1. Open a new browser tab.
2. Navigate to a commonly visited website such as https://example.com or any site of your choice.
3. Wait a few seconds for the page to fully load and for network requests to complete.

<Tip>
Choosing websites you frequently visit helps you get realistic insight into typical third-party connections.
</Tip>

## 3. Verify the Toolbar Badge Updates

The badge on the uBO-Scope icon reflects the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connected with on the current webpage.

### Steps:

1. Observe the number displayed on the badge immediately after the page load.
2. The number should represent a count of unique third-party domains allowed on the loaded page.
3. If the badge is empty or zero, it indicates no third-party connections were detected.

<Warning>
An unusually high badge count might indicate many third-party trackers or resources loading on the page, which can impact privacy.
</Warning>

## 4. Open the uBO-Scope Popup for Detailed Insights

To get a detailed breakdown of the connections detected, use the popup interface.

### Steps:

1. Click the uBO-Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup.
2. The popup shows three outcome sections:
   - **Not Blocked**: Domains with allowed network requests
   - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where requests were stealth-blocked (e.g., redirected or silently blocked)
   - **Blocked**: Domains where requests were blocked explicitly
3. Review the list of domains and counts under each outcome category.

<Info>
The popup helps you understand how many and which third-party domains your browser connects with, and the effectiveness of any content blocking applied.
</Info>

## 5. Interpret the Output

- The summary at the top of the popup shows the total number of distinct domains connected.
- Domains in the **Not Blocked** section are third-parties your browser successfully communicated with.
- **Stealth-Blocked** indicates connections blocked silently or redirected.
- **Blocked** shows explicitly denied connections.

<Tip>
Use this data to assess your privacy exposure and content blocker effectiveness at a glance.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

If any of these conditions occur, follow the recommended steps:

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues During Quick Validation">

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Stuck or Not Updating">

- Try visiting a simple site with minimal third-party content (like example.com).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
