# Quick Validation Test

Welcome to your quick validation guide for uBO Scope. This workflow will help you confirm that uBO Scope is installed correctly and is actively monitoring network connections as designed. Within minutes, you'll verify that the extension accurately reports connections made by webpages and displays this information in the toolbar badge and popup panel.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & Setup Verification

Before starting the quick test, ensure:

- **uBO Scope is Installed:** Confirm installation from your browser's official extension/add-on store.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Using a supported browser version: Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+.
- **Permissions Granted:** The extension has permissions for `webRequest`, `storage`, and access to active tabs.
- **Extension Enabled:** The extension is active and not disabled or removed.

<Tip>
If uncertain, revisit the [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/getting-started/requirements-installation/installation-instructions.mdx) to ensure prerequisites and installation steps are complete.
</Tip>

## 2. Open a Supported Website

Choose any website known to load external resources from third-party servers. For example:

- https://example.com
- https://news.yourfavoritewebsite.com

Visit the website in a new browser tab where uBO Scope is enabled.

<Tip>
Aim to use real-world sites that load multiple resources like images, scripts, or ads from external domains for a meaningful connection count.
</Tip>

## 3. Check the Toolbar Badge Count

Locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar. Observe the badge count displayed on the icon:

- The badge number represents **the number of distinct third-party domains with network activity** (allowed connections).
- A count of zero or very low at a busy website likely indicates uBO Scope is monitoring properly.

<Check>
If the badge shows a count, it means uBO Scope has detected remote server connections initiated by the page.
</Check>

## 4. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup panel. The popup is your direct interface to review network connection details:

- At the top, you will see the current tab's hostname and domain shown clearly.
- The **domains connected** summary displays the total count of third-party domains allowing connections.
- Connection outcomes are categorized into:
  - **Not blocked**: Third-party domains that successfully loaded resources.
  - **Stealth-blocked**: Domains with stealth blocking applied.
  - **Blocked**: Domains whose network requests were explicitly blocked.

Each section lists domain names with the count of connections observed.

<Tip>
Use this panel to quickly grasp your real-time privacy exposure on the active tab.
</Tip>

## 5. Validate Data Accuracy and Responsiveness

To further validate uBO Scope's functionality:

- Navigate to different pages or reload the current page and observe:
  - The badge count updates dynamically reflecting current network activity.
  - The popup panel immediately reflects any changes in allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked domains.

- Open developer tools' network tab to compare actual requests with uBO Scope reporting if desired.

<Warning>
If network requests are not reflected in the popup or badge count remains static despite page activity, verify permissions and reload the extension or browser.
</Warning>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Quick Test Issues">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Appearing or Stuck at Zero">
- Confirm uBO Scope extension is enabled.
- Check your browser has granted `webRequest` and `storage` permissions.
- Reload the browser tab or restart the browser.
- Ensure you are visiting a website fetching third-party resources.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Panel Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists">
- Wait a few seconds after opening the popup to let data load.
- Reload the current tab and open the popup again.
- If persistent, see the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/getting-started/troubleshooting/common-issues.mdx) documentation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Browser Does Not Support Required APIs or Permissions">
- Check if your browser version meets requirements (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Update the browser to the latest stable version.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Success Criteria and Next Steps

You have successfully validated uBO Scope's operation if:

- The toolbar badge dynamically shows counts of distinct third-party domains communicating over the network.
- The popup panel opens without errors and displays categorized connection domains.
- The data updates responsively when changing or reloading tabs.

Congratulations! Your uBO Scope environment is configured correctly and ready to provide valuable insights into remote server connections.

## Example Validation Quick Commands for Developers

If you want to manually verify extension logs or background activity, you can:

1. Open the browser's extension debugging tools.
2. Inspect the background service worker or background script.
3. Check the console for logged network events or errors.

This advanced step is optional and typically unnecessary for end users focused on functionality validation.
