# Validating Extension Functionality

Ensure that uBO Scope is accurately capturing and reporting your browser's network connections by following this guide. By visiting a test site and reviewing the extension’s popup interface and badge, you confirm that the extension is tracking connection outcomes properly.

---

## 1. Confirm Installation and Permissions

Before validating functionality, verify that uBO Scope is correctly installed and that required permissions are granted:

- **Check installation:** Ensure uBO Scope is installed from an official source for your browser ([Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp), [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)).
- **Verify permissions:** The extension needs `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` permissions to function. See the [Initial Configuration & Permissions](https://docs.uboscope.org/getting-started/installation-setup/basic-configuration) guide for granting permissions.

---

## 2. Visit a Known Test Website

To observe the extension in action:

1. Open a new browser tab.
2. Navigate to a website known to load content from multiple remote servers, such as `https://www.example.com` or similar well-known public sites.
3. Wait a few seconds to allow the site to fully load and its network requests to be processed.

This step simulates a typical browsing session with multiple network connections, enabling uBO Scope to collect connection data.

---

## 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface

To review collected connection data:

1. Click on the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup panel will open, displaying domain histogram sections categorized by connection outcome:

   - **not blocked (allowed):** Domains with successful connections.
   - **stealth-blocked:** Domains whose requests were redirected stealthily.
   - **blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked or resulting in errors.

3. At the top, observe the header showing the current tab’s hostname and domain.
4. The summary section below shows the count of distinct third-party domains connected.

---

## 4. Understand What You Are Seeing

- The **domain and hostname display** breaks down the current tab's main domain. It handles internationalized domains properly by showing the Unicode representation.
- The **domain counts** under each outcome provide the number of unique domains and the number of connections per domain.
- The **badge text** on the toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct allowed (not blocked) third-party domains for the active tab.

A rising domain count indicates more third-party connections. Aim for a low count for better privacy, but remember some legitimate or essential connections are normal.

---

## 5. Confirm Successful Operation

You have successfully validated functionality if:

- The popup displays the current tab’s domain correctly.
- You see multiple domains in the allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked sections after visiting the test site.
- The badge count number appears on the extension icon and corresponds to the allowed connections count.

If the popup shows "NO DATA" or "?" for domain counts, or the badge is blank after browsing, proceed to troubleshooting.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="No Data Displayed in Popup">

- Refresh the current webpage and then open the popup again.
- Confirm that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (notably the `webRequest` permission).
- Make sure you are on a web page with network activity (some internal pages may produce no data).
- Disable other extensions temporarily to rule out interference.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">

- Reload or restart the browser to reset extensions.
- Ensure you have the latest version of uBO Scope.
- Check if the browser supports the `webRequest` API fully (see [System Requirements & Compatibility](https://docs.uboscope.org/getting-started/installation-setup/prerequisites)).

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows Incorrect or Garbled Domain Names">

- Verify that your browser supports Internationalized Domain Names (IDN).
- Try refreshing the tab and reopening the popup.
- Clear browser cache or restart if the issue persists.

## 7. Next Steps

- For comprehensive understanding, explore the [First Launch & User Interface Overview](https://docs.uboscope.org/getting-started/first-run-usage/first-run) page to master interpreting connection outcomes.
- See [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](https://docs.uboscope.org/getting-started/first-run-usage/troubleshooting) if you encounter persistent problems.
- Dive into [Core Concepts & Terminology](https://docs.uboscope.org/overview/product-intro-core-concepts/core-concepts-terminology) to understand underlying principles about connections, domains, and blocking outcomes.
- Consider the [Key Features & Typical Workflows](https://docs.uboscope.org/overview/architecture-feature-overview/feature-summary-and-workflows) to learn practical uses of uBO Scope.

---

## Additional Tips

- **Use realistic browsing scenarios** during validation to capture meaningful network requests.
- **Beware of network caching effects** which may reduce visible requests; use browser developer tools to confirm actual network activity.
- **Regularly update the extension** to maintain compatibility with browser API changes.

---

By following this guide, you will confidently verify that uBO Scope functions correctly and begins delivering insights into your browser's remote server connections.
