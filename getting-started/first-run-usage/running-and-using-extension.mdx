# First Run & Using the Extension

Welcome to your first interaction with **uBO Scope**, the browser extension designed to reveal the real network connections your browser makes to remote servers. This guide will walk you through accessing the extension's popup interface, interpreting the domain and connection status information it presents, and understanding the badge count and visual indicators as you browse the web.

---

## 1. Accessing the uBO Scope Popup UI

The core of uBO Scope’s insight is delivered through its popup UI accessible directly from your browser’s toolbar.

### Steps to Open the Popup:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a colored badge with the extension's logo.
2. Click the icon once to open the popup panel.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the icon, ensure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions/settings menu and that your toolbar is showing the extension icons.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Layout and Information Display

Once opened, the popup provides a summary of remote server connections for the active browser tab.

### Key UI Elements:

- **Hostname Display** at the top shows the current page’s hostname and domain in a Unicode-friendly representation.

- **Domains Connected** section shows the count of distinct third-party domains contacted by the page.

- **Three Outcome Sections** showing the connection status of remote servers:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains successfully contacted.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains for which network requests were redirected stealthily.
  - **Blocked**: Domains for which network requests were blocked with errors.

- **Domain Rows** list individual third-party domains with the number of connections made.

### How the UI Updates:

The popup dynamically updates based on network activity in the current tab. The list shows domains sorted alphabetically, providing a quick at-a-glance understanding of network traffic.

## 3. Interpreting the Badge Count and Visual Indicators

The toolbar icon badge is more than decoration—it communicates the number of distinct third-party domains contacted during browsing.

- A **higher badge count** means more third-party contacts; generally, a **lower count** is preferred for privacy.
- The count reflects the number of unique third-party domains to which network connections were attempted or successful.

### Visual Indicator Highlights:

- **Badge Number**: Number of unique third-party domains contacted.
- **Popup Sections Colors** (may vary by theme but typically):
  - **Allowed (Not Blocked)**: Represents domains your browser connected to successfully.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Indicates network requests that were silently redirected, often indicating subtle blocking.
  - **Blocked**: Requests that failed entirely to connect.

<Tip>
Remember: Not all third-party connections are harmful—many are legitimate content delivery networks or APIs essential for website functionality.
</Tip>

## 4. Running Your First Operation

Let’s put it all together by running a simple scenario:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Website">Navigate to any website you frequently use or want to examine.</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar to open the popup panel.</Step>
<Step title="Observe Hostname and Domain">Verify that the hostname at the top matches your current website in Unicode format.</Step>
<Step title="Review Connected Domains">Study the listed domains under Not Blocked, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked sections.</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Badge Count">Look at the number displayed on the toolbar icon badge for the current domain connection summary.</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
To refresh the data for the current tab, simply close and reopen the popup or navigate to a different site and return.
</Tip>

## 5. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Use uBO Scope as a Privacy Insight Tool:** The badge count and domain details help you audit the number and identity of third-party domains your browser connects to.
- **Compare Across Tabs:** Open different sites’ popups to see how their third-party connections differ.
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains:** These may indicate transparent redirections or filtering by other extensions or network layers.

<Warning>
The extension relies on the browser’s webRequest API. Some network requests outside this scope (e.g., browser internals, VPN traffic) might not be reflected.
</Warning>

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup and Badge Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty"> 
- Ensure the page is fully loaded.
- Verify uBO Scope has appropriate permissions.
- Try refreshing the page and reopening the popup.
- Check that other blocking extensions don’t interfere with the webRequest API.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- The count updates on network activity; try navigating to a new page.
- Reload the extension by disabling and re-enabling it.
- Restart the browser if issues persist.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Names Displayed as Punycode or Gibberish">
- The extension converts internationalized domain names to Unicode for clarity.
- Domains with unusual encoding may appear technically; this is expected.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. How It Fits Into Your Workflow

uBO Scope gives you actionable insights directly where you browse:

- **Privacy enthusiasts** can monitor their exposure to third-party domains.
- **Filter list maintainers** gain evidence on which domains are contacted and their blocking status.
- **General users** get transparency on what connections their browser initiates.

### Example: Viewing Connections on example.com

1. Go to https://example.com.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. Observe the hostname “example.com” at the top.
4. See the 'domains connected' count at the summary section.
5. Review the allowed and blocked third-party domains.

This immediate visibility helps you understand the network behavior of the page you visit.
