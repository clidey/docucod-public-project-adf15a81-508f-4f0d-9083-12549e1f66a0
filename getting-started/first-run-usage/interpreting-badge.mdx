# Understanding Badge Counts & Domain Data

## Introduction

The toolbar badge icon in uBO Scope presents a single, crucial metric: the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected during your browsing session on the active tab. This page helps you understand exactly what this badge count reports, why it matters for assessing privacy exposure, and how to make sense of the domain-level data shown in the popup interface after installation.

By the end of this guide, you'll be able to confidently interpret what a badge count means, understand the different connection outcomes, and use this insight to verify your content blocker's effectiveness.

## 1. What the Badge Count Represents

- The badge shows the **count of unique third-party domains** from which your browser has successfully made network connections while loading the active webpage.
- These are domains distinct from the first-party site you are visiting.
- For example, if you visit `example.com` and your browser connects to three unique third-party domains like `cdn.net`, `tracker.com`, and `analytics.org`, the badge will show “3”.

### Why This Metric Matters

- It quantifies your **surface exposure** to remote servers beyond the website you intentionally visit.
- Lower counts imply fewer distinct third parties have been contacted, which generally correlates to **better privacy**.
- It is a practical measure to evaluate the effectiveness of your content blocker in reducing unnecessary or unwanted third-party connections.

<Tip>
The badge count reflects **distinct third-party domains** and not the total number of blocked or allowed requests. This distinction helps avoid the misconception that higher block counts always mean better protection.
</Tip>

## 2. Underlying Domain Data in the Popup

After clicking the badge, the popup interface displays more detailed domain data categorized by connection outcome. This data breakdown helps you drill down into **who those third parties are** and **how the extension interprets each connection**.

### Popup Interface Sections

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Third-party domains your browser connected to successfully without being blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections underwent redirections or subtle blocking (a form of stealth blocking).
- **Blocked:** Domains completely blocked by your content blocker or network defenses.

The popup also shows a summary count of the number of connected domains at the top, which should match the badge number for the active tab.

### How Domains Are Counted

- Domains are derived using the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org) to normalize hostnames to their registrable domains.
- For example, connections to `ads.tracker.example.com` and `cdn.tracker.example.com` are counted as one domain: `example.com`.

### Visual Example

```text
Summary: domains connected: 3

Not Blocked
- cdn.net (5 connections)
- analytics.org (2 connections)

Stealth-Blocked
- stealthtracker.com (1 connection)

Blocked
- ads.badtracker.net (7 connections)
```

This shows the distinct domains and counts of connection attempts per category.

## 3. Interpreting the Badge Numbers & Domains — Real Scenarios

### Scenario A: Lower Badge Count

- Your badge shows “1” while visiting a news site.
- Popup shows only the CDN domain allowed.
- Interpretation: Your content blocker is effectively preventing nearly all third-party connections except essential ones.

### Scenario B: Higher Badge Count

- Badge reads “12” visiting a popular social media site.
- Popup shows multiple analytics, advertising, and social widgets connected.
- Interpretation: Your browsing exposure is higher due to many third parties contacting your browser.

### Scenario C: Badge Disappears (Zero Count)

- You visit a local intranet page or a blank new tab.
- Badge is empty (no number).
- Interpretation: No third-party connections detected for the tab.

<Note>
The badge count resets when you navigate to a new page or open a new tab because uBO Scope tracks connection data per active tab session.
</Note>

## 4. Why the Badge Count is a Superior Privacy Metric

- Block counts alone can be misleading as blocking many requests from the same domain only counts once toward the badge.
- uBO Scope’s third-party domain count reflects **distinct entities** your browser actually connected to, representing true exposure.

<Tip>
Use the badge count to complement your understanding of privacy exposure. A content blocker with slightly lower block counts but significantly fewer distinct third-party connections may offer better privacy protection.
</Tip>

## 5. Best Practices for Using Badge Counts and Domain Data

- Check the badge whenever you visit a new site to gauge third-party exposure.
- Use the popup to identify persistent third-party domains and determine whether they should be allowed.
- Combine with filter list tuning to reduce unwanted connections.

<Warning>
Remember: not all third parties are malicious or privacy-invasive. Some are essential, such as CDN providers or API hosts. Use the badge count as a guide, not the sole authority.
</Warning>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Badge Counts & Popup Data">
<Accordion title="Why does my badge display a number but the popup shows no domains?">
This can happen if the network data for the current tab hasn't fully loaded or if the popup content hasn't rendered yet. Try refreshing the page or reopening the popup.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is the badge count sometimes higher than I expect?">
The badge counts distinct third-party domains that had any network activity. Some sites dynamically load many resources or trackers, so a higher count reflects actual network connections, not just blocked domains.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some domains show under 'stealth-blocked'?">
Stealth blocking refers to subtle blocking techniques like redirect blocking. These domains had connection attempts interfered with but may not appear as outright blocked, distinguishing them from fully blocked domains.
