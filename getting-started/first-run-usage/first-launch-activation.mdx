# First Launch and Configuration

Welcome to uBO Scope! This guide walks you through enabling the extension immediately after installation, ensuring you grant the necessary permissions, access the extension's toolbar icon, and complete basic configuration steps. By following this guide, you will verify that uBO Scope is active and ready to reveal the remote server connections your browser makes.

## 1. Enabling uBO Scope After Installation

After installing uBO Scope in your browser, it may require explicit permissions to operate fully. Browsers often prompt immediately after installation or upon first usage.

### Step-by-Step to Enable Permissions:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope Extension Icon:**
   - Find the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar. It uses the logo shown below:

     ![uBO Scope Icon](img/browsericons/logo32.png)

2. **Address Permission Prompts:**
   - When prompted, grant permissions for `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`. These are essential for uBO Scope to monitor network requests properly across HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket URLs.

3. **Verify Permissions in Browser Settings:**
   - Optionally, open your browser's extension or add-on management page.
   - Confirm uBO Scope has the required permissions:
     - Access to all sites URLs (http://*/*, https://*/*, ws://*/*, wss://*/*)
     - Use of browser storage
     - Ability to monitor web requests

<Tip>
Permission granting is critical for the extension's full operation. Without these, uBO Scope cannot report remote server connections.
</Tip>

## 2. Accessing the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

Once enabled, you can interact with uBO Scope via its toolbar icon.

### How to Access:

1. **Click the uBO Scope Icon:**
   - This opens the extension's popup interface, presenting real-time summaries.

2. **Understanding the Popup:**
   - The popup displays:
     - The hostname of the currently active tab.
     - A summary of connected domains by outcome categories:
       - **Not Blocked** (allowed third-party connections)
       - **Stealth-Blocked** (requests silently blocked or redirected)
       - **Blocked** (requests explicitly blocked)

3. **Toolbar Badge:**
   - The icon badge shows the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected to the active tab.

<Note>
The count on the badge helps assess your browsing exposure; a lower count typically indicates fewer third-party network connections.
</Note>

## 3. Basic Configuration Steps

uBO Scope is designed to work immediately after installation with minimal configuration needed. However, here are the basic steps to confirm and optimize setup:

### Step 1: Confirm Browser Version Compatibility
- Ensure you are running a supported browser and version:
  - Chrome/Chromium-based browsers: version 122 or higher
  - Firefox: version 128 or higher
  - Safari: version 18.5 or higher

### Step 2: Confirm Extension is Active
- Verify the extension icon appears on the toolbar.
- Click the icon to open the popup; the interface should load without errors.

### Step 3: Check for Active Network Monitoring
- Visit various websites in tabs.
- Open uBO Scope popup to see if connections and domain counts update accordingly.

### Step 4: Customize if Necessary
- Currently, uBO Scope does not require user-configured settings.
- Future releases may introduce additional configuration options.

<Check>
If your toolbar icon does not display domains count or remains inactive after installation, revisit permission settings.
</Check>

## 4. What to Expect When uBO Scope is Working Correctly

When properly enabled and working, you will observe:

- **Active Badge Count:** The toolbar icon shows a number representing the unique third-party domains your browser has connected to on the current page.
- **Popup Interface Details:** 
  - The hostname of the active tab is displayed at the top.
  - Sections below show domains grouped by “not blocked”, “stealth-blocked”, and “blocked” status, each listing domains and how many requests were made.
- **Real-Time Updates:** As you browse, the counts and domain lists update automatically to reflect current connections.

<Tip>
The badge count refers to unique domains, not total requests. This gives higher-level insight into exposure without overwhelming details.
</Tip>

### Visual Example

```plaintext
[uBO Scope Icon: Badge "3"]  <- Toolbar Icon

Popup displays:
Host: example.com

Domains connected: 5

Not Blocked:
- cdn.example.net (2)
- analytics.partner.com (1)

Stealth-Blocked:
- tracking.example.org (1)

Blocked:
- ads.provider.io (1)
```
