# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve frequent problems encountered during the installation and first use of uBO Scope. Whether the extension badge is missing, no data appears in the popup, permissions seem incomplete, or browser compatibility issues arise, these practical troubleshooting steps will get you up and running.

## 1. uBO Scope Badge Not Visible on Toolbar

The toolbar badge indicates the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser communicated with. If the badge is missing after installing the extension:

### Action Steps:

1. **Verify Installation**
   - Confirm uBO Scope is installed by visiting your browser's extensions page:
     - Chrome/Chromium: `chrome://extensions`
     - Firefox: `about:addons`
     - Safari: `Preferences > Extensions`

2. **Check Toolbar Access**
   - Chrome/Chromium: The icon might be hidden. Click the puzzle piece icon and pin uBO Scope for quick access.
   - Firefox: Look for the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar or overflow menu.
   - Safari: Ensure the extension is enabled in Safari’s Extensions settings.

3. **Reload Browser or Restart**
   - After installation, restart the browser or reload the extension to initialize components fully.

4. **Confirm Required Permissions**
   - uBO Scope relies on permissions:
     - `webRequest` to monitor network requests.
     - `storage` for retaining session data.
     - `activeTab` for tab-specific monitoring.
   - If any permissions were denied, the extension will not operate correctly.
   - Reinstall or reset permissions if needed.

5. **Use Supported Browser Versions**
   - Supported browsers and minimum versions:
     - Chromium-based browsers: Version 122 and above.
     - Firefox: Version 128 and above.
     - Safari: Version 18.5 and above.

   Older versions might not support the necessary APIs.

<Warning>
If you are using a browser that blocks extension icons or limits permissions (for example, some privacy-focused browsers), the badge may not appear or update correctly.
</Warning>

## 2. Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Empty

After clicking the badge, if the popup displays 'NO DATA' or no third-party domains:

### Action Steps:

1. **Reload the Active Tab**
   - uBO Scope populates data based on network activity on the current active tab.
   - Refresh the webpage to generate new network requests monitored by the extension.

2. **Browse to a Site with Third-party Connections**
   - Not all webpages generate third-party network requests.
   - Visit popular sites (e.g., news portals, social media) known to load external resources.

3. **Check for Other Extensions Interfering**
   - Some extensions may block or obscure network requests from being reported.
   - Temporarily disable other content blockers and test again.

4. **Verify Extension Permissions**
   - Insufficient permissions cause the extension to not receive network event data.
   - Recheck permissions or reinstall the extension.

5. **Inspect Background Service Worker Status**
   - Especially for Chromium, Google's new Manifest V3 requires service workers to manage background tasks.
   - Extensions might be suspended; try disabling and re-enabling the extension to restart its service worker.

<Note>
Uptime of the background script affects data collection; if the service worker is evicted, it will restart but lose ephemeral context.
</Note>

## 3. Permissions Problems Preventing Operation

uBO Scope requests runtime permissions to function correctly. If you encounter errors or warnings:

### Action Steps:

1. **Review Extension Permissions in Browser Settings**
   - Make sure `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` permissions are granted.
   - Without `webRequest`, uBO Scope cannot observe network connections.

2. **Grant Access to All HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket URLs**
   - The extension requires host permissions for:
     - `http://*/*`
     - `https://*/*`
     - `ws://*/*`
     - `wss://*/*`
   - Confirm these host permissions under extension details.

3. **Reinstall if Permissions Were Denied**
   - Remove and reinstall uBO Scope.
   - During installation, accept all permission prompts.

4. **Adjust Privacy or Security Settings**
   - Some browsers or corporate policies restrict extension permissions.
   - Adjust these policies or run a profile without restrictions.

<Warning>
Without necessary permissions, uBO Scope cannot accurately measure network requests, resulting in no data or incorrect badge counts.
</Warning>

## 4. Browser Incompatibility or Limitations

Certain browsers or versions may not fully support uBO Scope due to API restrictions or design choices.

### Action Steps:

1. **Use One of the Confirmed Supported Browsers**
   - Official support:
     - Chromium (Chrome, Edge, Brave)
     - Firefox (Gecko-based)
     - Safari

2. **Check Browser Version against Requirements**
   - Minimum versions are crucial for Manifest V3 and API support (see Permissions section above).

3. **Be Aware of Content Security Policies (CSP)**
   - Some sites or browser environments with strict CSP may prevent extensions from injecting or working properly.

4. **Try in a Clean Profile or Different Browser**
   - Establish whether the issue is browser-specific or related to your current profile/configuration.

5. **Review Known Browser-Specific Limitations**
   - Safari may have tighter host permissions or WebRequest support limitations.
   - Firefox and Chromium engines have differences in service worker backgrounds.

<Note>
Refer to the official installation pages for browser-specific instructions and supported versions:
- [Chromium installation](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
</Note>

## 5. Tips for Successful Setup and Validation

- **After Installing, Refresh Your Browsing Tabs** to allow uBO Scope to capture fresh network request data.
- **Keep Other Network Monitoring Tools Disabled** if they conflict or interfere with extension APIs.
- **Check the Badge Count** on your toolbar icon — it represents unique third-party domains contacted.
- **Open the Popup Interface** to verify detailed domain lists classified as:
  - Not Blocked
  - Stealth-Blocked
  - Blocked

These confirmations ensure uBO Scope is active and tracking network interactions correctly.

<Tip>
Always start troubleshooting by verifying extension installation, permissions, and browser compatibility to avoid wasted effort on less common issues.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Ignoring permissions or using unsupported browsers will prevent uBO Scope from functioning correctly.
</Warning>

<Info>
uBO Scope’s badge and popup depend on accurate monitoring through granted permissions and supported browser APIs.

## Appendix: Verifying uBO Scope Operation

You can confirm uBO Scope is working correctly by:

1. Navigating to a site with multiple known third-party domains (e.g., news or social media).
2. Observing the badge count increase accordingly.
3. Opening the popup interface to see categorized domain lists, indicating not blocked, stealth blocked, and blocked connections.

If these indicators update dynamically as you browse, the setup is successful.
