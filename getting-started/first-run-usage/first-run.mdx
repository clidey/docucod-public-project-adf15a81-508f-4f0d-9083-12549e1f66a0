# First Launch & User Interface Overview

Welcome to your first look at uBO Scope's popup interface! This guide will walk you through opening the popup for the first time and understanding its clean, intuitive user interface. You'll learn how connection data is presented by domain and outcome status, along with how to interpret the browser badge that provides a snapshot of your privacy exposure.

---

## 1. Opening uBO Scope for the First Time

Once you have uBO Scope installed and necessary permissions are granted (see the [Installing the Extension](../installation-setup/install-extension) and [Initial Configuration & Permissions](../installation-setup/basic-configuration) pages), you are ready to launch the extension's popup UI:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon next to your browser's address bar.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup window.
3. The popup will load data about the current tab’s network connections.

<Tip>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA', it means uBO Scope has not yet captured network data for the active tab. Try reloading the tab or navigating to a webpage to generate connection activity.
</Tip>

## 2. Exploring the Popup User Interface

The popup UI is designed to offer clear, immediate insights without clutter:

### Tab Hostname Section
- At the top, the **Tab Hostname** heading displays the main domain of the currently active tab.
- If no data is available, it shows 'NO DATA'.

### Summary Section
- Below the hostname, you'll see a summary stating the total number of distinct domains connected to by the active tab.

### Connection Outcome Sections
The popup divides connected domains into three outcome categories, each with its own section:

- **Not Blocked** (Allowed): Domains with connections that were permitted.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains with connections that were blocked in stealth mode (invisible to scripts, etc.).
- **Blocked**: Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.

Each category section contains:
- A heading with the outcome label.
- A scrollable list of domains, each showing the domain name and a badge with the count of connections associated.

### Domain Row Example
Each domain entry looks like this:

```plaintext
[domain.name]   [count badge]
```

where `[domain.name]` is the remote domain and `[count badge]` shows how many connections were observed.

## 3. Understanding the Browser Badge Indicator

Apart from the popup, uBO Scope also displays a small badge on the extension icon:

- This badge shows a quick count of third-party domains connected to by the current tab.
- It updates in real time as network events are captured.

This indicator lets you gauge your browsing privacy exposure at a glance without opening the popup.

<Note>
The badge count reflects distinct connected domains only, not total network requests.
</Note>

## 4. Using the Popup Effectively

To get the most from uBO Scope’s UI on your first launch:

- **Test with active browsing:** Load popular websites or news sites with third-party trackers to see real-time updates.
- **Observe categorizations:** Notice which domains appear in each outcome section to understand how your content blockers interact.
- **Use the connection counts:** Higher counts in 'Blocked' or 'Stealth-Blocked' sections indicate effective blocking.

## 5. Troubleshooting and Tips

- If the popup remains empty or shows 'NO DATA' despite browsing activity:
  - Refresh the active tab.
  - Confirm that uBO Scope is enabled and permissions are properly set.
  - Review the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../first-run-usage/troubleshooting) page for guidance.

- The UI supports light and dark color schemes automatically based on your browser or OS settings.

- Connection data shown is session-based and clears upon tab reload or browser restart.

<Warning>
Remember that uBO Scope displays *observed* connections through your browser's webRequest API; some connections may not appear if blocked or restricted by the browser or other extensions.
</Warning>

## 6. Next Steps

After familiarizing yourself with the popup UI:

- Head to [Validating Extension Functionality](../first-run-usage/validate-functionality) to confirm uBO Scope captures and reports network connections accurately.
- Explore [Understanding the Badge and Popup Indicators](../../../guides/core-workflows/reading-badge-and-popup) for deeper insight into interpreting data.
