# Your First Open: Using the Popup

Welcome to your initial exploration of uBO Scope’s popup interface. This guide leads you through opening the popup, navigating its dashboard, and understanding the summarized connection data so you can immediately benefit from real-time insights about remote servers contacted by the web page you’re visiting.

---

## 1. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

Your first step is to open uBO Scope’s main dashboard via its popup panel.

### How to Open the Popup

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon** in your browser’s toolbar. It is identified by the extension’s logo.
2. **Click the icon once.**

This action opens a small popup window that displays detailed domain connection information related to the active browser tab.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the icon immediately, check your browser’s extension menu or customize your toolbar to ensure uBO Scope is visible.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Understanding the Popup Dashboard

The popup is designed to give you a clear, categorized snapshot of remote domains connected to the current tab.

### Popup Header: Tab Hostname and Domain

At the top, you will see two parts:

- **Hostname - Partial or full domain of the current page**: displays the specific hostname if it's a subdomain.
- **Domain - The main domain name**: shown beside or below the hostname, representing the core domain registered.

If no data is available for the tab (for example, right after opening the browser or on a new tab), the label will say **NO DATA**.

### Key Interface Sections

The popup layout is divided into three clearly labeled categories, each illustrating the connection status for domains detected:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains that your browser successfully connected to without blocking.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were stealth-blocked; network requests attempted but prevented in a subtle way.
- **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked by your content blocker or network filtering.

Each section lists domains along with a badge count showing **how many times** a connection to that domain was made during your current browsing session.

### Domains Connected Summary

Near the top, you’ll see a summary line:

```
domains connected: <number>
```

This represents the total count of distinct third-party remote domains connected (allowed) during the current tab’s session.

<Note>
A lower count here generally signals better content blocking or fewer third-party connections.
</Note>

## 3. Navigating Domain Connection Details

The popup presents each domain on its own line with two pieces of information:

- **Domain Name**: The third-party domain, converted into readable Unicode when needed.
- **Count Badge**: The number of network requests made to that domain.

### Interpreting the Sections

- **Not Blocked:**
  - These domains represent active connections from the page to external servers.
  - Legitimate third-party services like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) often appear here.

- **Stealth-Blocked:**
  - These are domains whose connection attempts were blocked silently to avoid breaking page functionality or user experience.
  - They may indicate tracker or ad domains that the extension prevented in a subtle manner.

- **Blocked:**
  - Domains explicitly blocked by your content-blocking rules.
  - May include trackers, ads, or unwanted remote servers.

### Practical Tips

- Focus on domains in the **Not Blocked** section to audit what third-party servers your visited page actively communicates with.
- Repeated connection counts suggest frequent resource loads or continuous communication with a domain.
- Use these insights to evaluate privacy exposure or performance impacts.

## 4. Visual and Usability Notes

- Domains are displayed in a clear vertical list, sorted alphabetically for quick scanning.
- Unicode domains are automatically converted for easier recognition (e.g., internationalized domain names).
- The popup dynamically updates as you navigate pages or as network connections evolve.

<Tip>
If you do not see expected data after navigating, try reloading the tab and then reopening the popup.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Popup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Your First Popup Experience">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' After Opening">
1. Ensure you are on an active tab that has completed some network activity.
2. Refresh the page to generate connection data.
3. Confirm that the extension has permissions (activeTab, webRequest) enabled.
4. If problem persists, restart the browser or reinstall the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update or Shows Incorrect Values">
- The badge count reflects the number of distinct allowed (not blocked) domains.
- Refresh the page or switch tabs to refresh badge counts.
- Check that no conflicting content blockers are interfering with connection reporting.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain List Appears Empty or Partial">
- Confirm network requests are occurring on the tab.
- Check extension is enabled and not disabled by browser.
- Allow some time for data collection as it processes events asynchronously.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps

After you’ve explored the popup and understood how to interpret the connection data, consider:

- Reviewing [Interpreting Badge Counts and Domain Lists](/guides/workflows/interpreting-badge-counts) for deeper insights.
- Learning how to [Analyze Connections Made by Websites](/guides/workflows/analyzing-network-connections) for tailored privacy decisions.
- Checking out the [Installation Instructions](/getting-started/requirements-installation/installation-instructions) if you haven’t installed the extension yet.
