# Initial Configuration

After installing uBO Scope, a minimal but essential setup is required to ensure the extension functions correctly and provides accurate reporting of your browser's remote connections. This guide walks you through handling the necessary permissions, activating the extension, and adjusting basic browser settings to unlock full capabilities immediately.

---

## 1. Verify Extension Activation

uBO Scope must be enabled and active in your browser to monitor network requests effectively.

### Steps:

1. Open your browser’s extensions or add-ons page:
   - **Chrome/Chromium:** Navigate to `chrome://extensions` or use the menu > Extensions.
   - **Firefox:** Navigate to `about:addons` > Extensions.
   - **Safari:** Open Safari Preferences > Extensions.

2. Locate **uBO Scope** in the list.
3. Ensure the toggle switch or checkbox is activated (i.e., the extension is enabled).

<Tip>
If the extension is not visible or enabled, revisit the installation instructions to reinstall uBO Scope from the official store.
</Tip>

## 2. Grant Required Permissions

uBO Scope relies on browser permissions to access network request information across sites.

### Essential Permissions:
- **`webRequest`**: To listen to and analyze network requests.
- **`activeTab`**: To interact with the current tab where you invoke uBO Scope.
- **`storage`**: To store session data and configurations locally.
- **Host permissions** for all HTTP and HTTPS URLs.

### Steps to Confirm Permissions:

1. On the extensions page, click on **Details** for uBO Scope.
2. Scroll to the Permissions section.
3. Confirm that all required permissions above are granted.

<Tip>
Browsers may ask for explicit permission during installation or first use. If any required permission is missing, the extension cannot collect accurate data.
</Tip>

## 3. Adjust Browser Settings for Optimal Functionality

Since uBO Scope monitors network traffic via the browser’s `webRequest` API, certain browser settings must be verified for full data access.

### For Chromium-based Browsers:

- Ensure no conflicting privacy settings block the extension’s ability to monitor requests.
- Make sure the extension is allowed to run in incognito if you intend to use it there (enable this explicitly).
- Confirm the browser version is 122 or later, as required.

### For Firefox:

- Confirm minimum browser version 128 or higher.
- Enable the extension’s ability to access all sites and use the `webRequest` API.
- If using Firefox Android, check for any platform-specific limitations.

### For Safari:

- Confirm Safari version 18.5 or newer.
- Ensure permissions consent is granted for extension network monitoring.

<Tip>
Always keep your browser updated to meet or exceed the minimum supported versions for uBO Scope to work properly.
</Tip>

## 4. Confirm Extension Popup Behavior

The uBO Scope popup UI is where you view your active tab’s network connection insights.

### What to Expect on First Use:

- The badge count on the toolbar icon displays the number of distinct third-party domains allowed through.
- Opening the popup shows sections for `not blocked`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked` domains with counts.

### If Data Does Not Display:

- Reload the active tab or open a new tab.
- Check that the extension is enabled on that tab’s site.
- Verify no other extensions or browser policies are interfering.

<Tip>
The popup is designed to present meaningful information only after the extension has had a chance to observe network requests on your active tab.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="The Badge Count is Not Updating or Shows '0'">
- Ensure the extension is enabled and has all permissions.
- Refresh or reopen the tab you want to monitor.
- Verify that you are browsing HTTP/HTTPS sites (uBO Scope tracks these schemes).
- Disable other extensions temporarily to rule out conflicts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Displays 'NO DATA' or Remains Blank">
- Wait a few seconds for the extension to process network events after loading a page.
- Reload the page and check again.
- Verify the extension has required permissions.
- Check browser version compatibility and update if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Browser Blocks Extension Functionality">
- Some browsers impose restrictions on extensions’ access to network data.
- Verify browser settings for extension permissions, especially on managed devices.
- On Safari, explicitly allow the extension in preferences.

## Next Steps

Once your extension is configured and active:

- Begin browsing websites to see real-time network connection reports.
- Use the popup to interpret allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Consult [Feature Quickstart](/overview/feature-overview-and-integration/feature-quickstart) for an interactive introduction to the UI.
- Dive deeper into understanding key data by reviewing [Core Concepts & Terminology](/overview/architecture-and-core-concepts/core-concepts-terminology).
