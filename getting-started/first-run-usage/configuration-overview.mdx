# Configuration & Permissions

Understand what permissions uBO Scope requires, why they are necessary, and how to verify the extension has the appropriate access. This guide walks you through the initial setup steps and any confirmation prompts you may encounter when first launching the extension.

---

## 1. Permissions Overview

uBO Scope relies on specific browser permissions to fulfill its core purpose of monitoring and reporting all network connections initiated by websites. These permissions ensure it can transparently detect and categorize remote server connections.

- **`webRequest` Permission**: Allows uBO Scope to listen to and intercept network requests across all tabs, providing real-time visibility into requests made, blocked, redirected, or allowed.
- **`activeTab` Permission**: Enables the extension to interact with and gather information about the currently active browser tab.
- **`storage` Permission**: Used to persist session data and configuration locally within the browser.
- **Host Permissions (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and where applicable, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`)**: Required for webRequest listeners to operate on all network traffic URLs.

These permissions are declared in the extension's manifest file and are prompted by the browser upon installation or first run.

<Note>
If you are using uBO Scope on Safari, Chromium, or Firefox, note that some differences in manifest structure exist, but required permissions remain effectively the same.
</Note>

## 2. Why These Permissions Matter

- The **`webRequest`** permission is essential to independently observe all network requests that browsers make, regardless of any content blocking performed by other extensions or the browser itself. Without it, uBO Scope cannot provide accurate telemetry.

- The **host permissions** cover all HTTP and HTTPS URLs (and WebSocket protocols in Chromium and Firefox) so uBO Scope can monitor every remote server connection attempt.

- **`activeTab`** lets the extension interactively query data about the tab you are actively viewing, enabling precise per-tab reporting.

- **`storage`** ensures your connection data and session state are safely saved and restored during browsing sessions, so you can review historical data as needed.

## 3. Verifying Extension Permissions

Once installed, you should confirm uBO Scope has the required permissions and is operating correctly.

### Step-by-Step Verification

1. **Access the Browser Extensions Page:**
   - In Chromium or Edge, navigate to `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`.
   - In Firefox, go to `about:addons`.
   - In Safari, open Safari Extensions from the preferences pane.

2. **Locate uBO Scope:**
   Find uBO Scope in the list of installed extensions.

3. **Review Permissions:
**
   - Click on the extension details or options button.
   - Confirm the extension lists these permissions:
     - Access to all sites (`http://*/*` and `https://*/*`) for monitoring network requests.
     - `webRequest` permission.
     - `activeTab` and `storage` permissions.

4. **Check Optional Confirmation Prompts:**
   - When first activated, some browsers may ask you to grant or confirm permissions explicitly.
   - Accept these prompts to allow full extension functionality.

5. **Observe Toolbar Badge:**
   - Navigate to any website.
   - The uBO Scope toolbar icon badge updates with the count of distinct third-party domains connected.
   - This badge indicates active monitoring and adequate permissions.

<Tip>
If the badge remains blank or the extension appears inactive, permissions may be limited or blocked. Revisit the permissions settings and re-enable all necessary access.
</Tip>

## 4. Initial Setup & Configuration Steps

Beyond permissions, uBO Scope requires minimal setup as it is designed for seamless operation after installation.

### Initial Launch Behavior

- Upon first launch, uBO Scope initializes background data, loading necessary resources like the public suffix list to identify and group network domains.

- It awaits your browsing activity to start collecting and processing network telemetry.

- No manual configuration is needed to start monitoring network connections.

### Confirming First Run

- Visit a website to trigger network request monitoring.

- Open the uBO Scope popup by clicking its toolbar icon.

- The popup shows domain connection data categorized as **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

- The badge counter on the toolbar icon updates to reflect the number of distinct third-party domains connected.

<Note>
If you're a filter list maintainer or a privacy enthusiast, you may find the session data persistence and public suffix processing especially useful for analysis and auditing.
</Note>

## 5. Common Initial Setup Issues & Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied or Disabled

**Symptom:**
- The extension does not show any badge or popup data.
- Browser displays permission errors in the extension page or console.

**Solution:**
- Manually re-enable all requested permissions in the browser’s extension management page.
- Reinstall the extension if necessary.
- Restart your browser to refresh permissions and background processes.

### Toolbar Badge Not Updating

**Symptom:**
- No badge count appears, even after navigating to various sites.

**Solution:**
- Confirm that host permissions include `http://*/*`, `https://*/*` and WebSocket protocols when applicable.
- Verify that the extension is enabled and active.
- Disable conflicting extensions that might block or interfere with `webRequest` API access.

### First Launch Delay

**Symptom:**
- On first installation, the popup may not immediately show data.

**Explanation:**
- uBO Scope loads and parses the public suffix list and session data asynchronously during startup.
- This process may take a moment before all monitoring and data display is functional.

**Tip:**
- Give the extension a few seconds upon startup before expecting data display.

## 6. Permissions Declared per Browser

| Browser  | Key Permissions & Host Permissions                                   |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium | `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest` with hosts:
`https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, `ws://*/*` |
| Firefox  | `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest` with hosts:
`https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, `ws://*/*` |
| Safari   | `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest` with hosts:
`https://*/*`, `http://*/*`                                |

<Info>
WebSocket monitoring permissions (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) are enabled in Chromium and Firefox but currently absent in Safari due to API limitations.
