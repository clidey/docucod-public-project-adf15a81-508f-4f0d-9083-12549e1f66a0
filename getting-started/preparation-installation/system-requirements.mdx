# System Requirements for uBO Scope

Before installing uBO Scope, it's essential to verify that your environment meets the requirements to ensure smooth compatibility and full functionality. This guide details supported browsers and operating systems, specific prerequisites for Chromium, Firefox, and Safari, and important browser API dependencies.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers & Versions

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with the major modern browsers, with version-specific requirements to guarantee proper operation:

- **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, etc.)**
  - Minimum Chrome version: **122.0**
  - Requires support for Manifest v3 extensions with service workers

- **Mozilla Firefox (desktop & Android)**
  - Minimum Firefox version: **128.0**
  - Must support Manifest v3 and browser-specific extension APIs

- **Safari (macOS)**
  - Minimum Safari version: **18.5**
  - Requires Safari Web Extensions compatible with Manifest v3

<Note>
For Safari, version 18.5 or newer is mandatory because uBO Scope uses the latest extension APIs only available starting with this version.
</Note>

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

uBO Scope runs as a browser extension and its compatibility largely depends on the host browser version supported on the operating system:

- **Windows**
  - Compatible with Chromium browsers and Firefox versions mentioned above

- **macOS**
  - Fully supported through Safari 18.5+, Chromium browsers, and Firefox

- **Linux**
  - Supported in Chromium and Firefox matching version requirements

- **Android**
  - Supported via Firefox for Android version 128 and above
  - Chromium-based browsers on Android do not currently support required Manifest v3 APIs for uBO Scope.

---

## 3. Browser API Prerequisites

uBO Scope relies on specific browser APIs to monitor and report network activity effectively:

- **webRequest API**
  - This is the core browser API that uBO Scope uses to observe network requests in real time.
  - Must be fully supported and expose detailed request lifecycle events such as `onBeforeRedirect`, `onResponseStarted`, and `onErrorOccurred`.

- **Manifest Version 3 (MV3) Support**
  - uBO Scope is built as an MV3 extension using service workers (Chromium) or background scripts (Firefox, Safari).
  - Browsers must support MV3 extensions and necessary MV3 background scripts/service worker lifecycle.

- **Host Permissions**
  - The extension requires permissions to observe network requests on all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and Secure WebSocket URLs.

- **Storage Permissions**
  - Access to browser local and session storage for saving session data and the public suffix list.

## 4. Summary of Manifest Permissions & Platform Differences

| Feature                     | Chromium                              | Firefox                             | Safari                              |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Manifest Version            | 3                                   | 3                                 | 3                                  |
| Minimum Browser Version     | 122                                 | 128                               | 18.5                               |
| Background                 | Service worker (`background.service_worker`) | Background scripts (`background.scripts`) | Background scripts (`background.scripts`) |
| Permissions Required       | `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`| Same as Chromium                   | Same as Chromium                   |
| Host Permissions           | HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS urls            | HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS urls           | HTTP, HTTPS urls (WS/WSS not listed) |

<Warning>
Safari does not currently list WebSocket (`ws://` and `wss://`) permissions in its manifest. The extension continues to monitor supported protocols through HTTP and HTTPS only.
</Warning>

## 5. Preparing Your Environment

To ensure a smooth installation and operation of uBO Scope:

1. **Upgrade your browser** to meet or exceed the version requirements listed above.
2. **Verify your browser supports Manifest v3 extensions.**
3. **Check browser settings** that may affect extension permissions or API functionality such as security, privacy, or content blocking settings.
4. **Ensure network connectivity** allowing webRequest API monitoring (some environments or proxies may limit extension capabilities).

<Tip>
Using the latest stable release channel of your browser provides the best experience with uBO Scope.
</Tip>

## 6. Common Compatibility Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Compatibility Questions">
<Accordion title="Can I use uBO Scope on mobile Chromium browsers?">
Currently, mobile Chromium-based browsers do not fully support Manifest v3 extensions or the webRequest API required by uBO Scope, so installation is not possible on these platforms.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if I use a customized or privacy-enhanced browser?">
Custom browsers or privacy-focused builds that restrict or disable the webRequest API or Manifest v3 extension support may prevent uBO Scope from functioning correctly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Do I need any separate software or APIs enabled?">
No external dependencies or plugins are required. However, your browser must allow the webRequest API to observe network traffic for uBO Scope to work properly.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
