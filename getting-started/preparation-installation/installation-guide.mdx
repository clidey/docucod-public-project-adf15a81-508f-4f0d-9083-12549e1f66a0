This is the easiest and recommended installation method.

#### 2.1.1 Chromium-based Browsers

1. Open your Chromium-based browser.
2. Visit the [Chrome Web Store uBO Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
3. Click **Add to Chrome** (or equivalent button).
4. Confirm the permissions request to complete the installation.

#### 2.1.2 Firefox

1. Open Firefox.
2. Navigate to the [Mozilla Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
3. Click **Add to Firefox**.
4. Approve permissions when prompted.

#### 2.1.3 Safari

<Note>
If you cannot find uBO Scope in your browser’s official store, or prefer a manual or development version, use the manual installation method below.
</Note>

### 2.2 Manual Installation (Developer Mode / Unpacked Extension)

Manual installation lets you build and load uBO Scope directly from the source code, useful for development or if the store version is unavailable.

#### Step 1: Download the Source Code

- Clone or download the latest source from the GitHub repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
  cd uBO-Scope
  ```

#### Step 2: Build the Extension Package (Optional)

- For manual packaging (Linux example):

  ```bash
  ./tools/make-package.sh <platform>  # platform: chromium, firefox, safari
  ```

- This generates a build folder with the extension files.

#### Step 3: Load the Extension in Your Browser

##### Chromium-Based Browsers

1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle at top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the `build/uBO-Scope.chromium` directory or the root folder if building isn’t done.

##### Firefox

1. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Select the `manifest.json` file under `build/uBO-Scope.firefox` or source folder.

##### Safari

1. Open Safari and enable the **Develop** menu via Preferences → Advanced.
2. Open **Extension Builder** under the Develop menu.
3. Add the extension folder (`build/uBO-Scope.safari`), then enable it.

<Warning>
Manual installation is intended for advanced users. Be aware that manually loaded extensions might require reloading after browser restarts.
</Warning>

## 3. Verifying Installation

After installing uBO Scope, confirm the extension is properly installed and active.

### 3.1 Toolbar Icon

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. The icon acts as a toolbar badge showing the count of distinct third-party remote servers detected.
  - The badge will be empty initially until you navigate to any webpage.

### 3.2 Verify from the Popup UI

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
2. The popup should display:
   - The hostname and domain of the current active tab.
   - Sections listing connections: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** domains.
   - A summary with the total number of connected domains.

### 3.3 Test Network Monitoring

- Visit a frequently used website (e.g., https://example.com).
- Check the uBO Scope badge for a number indicating distinct third-party connections.
- Open the popup and verify that connections are categorized and listed.

<Tip>
If the badge count remains empty or the popup shows “NO DATA,” reload the page or try another site since uBO Scope updates data per active tab.
</Tip>

## 4. Platform-Specific Notes & Considerations

### Chromium

- Requires version 122 or newer for Manifest V3 compliance.
- The background service worker manages network request listeners.
- Permissions must be granted explicitly on installation.

### Firefox

- Minimum version 128 is required to support Manifest V3 extensions and `webRequest` API.
- Background script runs in a module context.
- In Firefox, the extension ID is fixed as `uBO-Scope@raymondhill.net`.

### Safari

- Version 18.5 or newer.
- Extension packages are signed via Apple’s extension ecosystem.
- Permissions scope excludes WebSocket; only HTTP/S URLs are monitored.

<Note>
For Safari, the `host_permissions` scope is limited compared to Chromium and Firefox and does not include `wss://` or `ws://` URLs.
</Note>

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Issue: Extension Icon Does Not Appear

- Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements.
- Check that extension installation was completed without errors.
- Restart your browser and try again.

### Issue: No Data Shown or Badge Remains Empty

- Ensure that you have navigated to an active tab with HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
- Reload the page after uBO Scope installation.
- Verify that content blocker extensions are not interfering in unexpected ways.

### Issue: Permissions Denied or Installation Failed

- Double-check permissions prompts and approve them.
- Try manual installation if the extension store method fails.

<Tip>
Refer to the [Validating and Troubleshooting](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/first-use-setup/validating-installation) guide for comprehensive troubleshooting steps.
