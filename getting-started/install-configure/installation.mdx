# Installing uBO Scope

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions to install the uBO Scope extension on supported web browsers: Chromium-based browsers (Chrome), Firefox, and Safari. You will find both direct installation methods via official browser stores and manual installation guidance for advanced users.

---

## Supported Browsers and Versions

- **Chromium (Chrome)**: Version 122.0 or higher
- **Firefox**: Version 128.0 or higher
- **Safari**: Version 18.5 or higher

<u>Note:</u> These minimum versions ensure full compatibility with the extension’s required permissions and APIs.

---

## Installation Overview

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension that reports remote server connections. It requires permissions to access network request data and works independently across browsers using manifest version 3.

Each browser package is tailored to its environment with appropriate manifests and background scripts.

---

## Step 1: Install from Official Browser Stores

The recommended method for installation is through your browser’s official extension/add-on store. This guarantees you receive safe, signed, and up-to-date versions.

### Chromium (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)

1. Open your Chromium-based browser.
2. Navigate to the [Chrome Web Store - uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
3. Click **Add to Chrome**.
4. Confirm any permission prompts.
5. Once installed, the uBO Scope icon will appear in your toolbar.

### Firefox

1. Open Firefox.
2. Go to the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
3. Click **Add to Firefox**.
4. Approve permissions when prompted.
5. The extension icon will then appear in the Firefox toolbar.

### Safari

1. Open Safari on your Mac (macOS 14 or later recommended).
2. Access the App Store and search for **uBO Scope** or use the following direct link if available.
3. Install the extension and enable it in Safari's Preferences > Extensions.

<u>Important:</u> Safari requires macOS 14+ and Safari 18.5+ due to manifest restrictions.

## Step 2: Manual Installation for Advanced Users

If you prefer to install the extension manually (e.g., for development or sideloading), follow these steps per browser.

### Prerequisites

- Clone or download the [uBO Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
- Have basic familiarity with your browser’s developer extension mode.

### Chromium Manual Installation

1. Open your Chromium-based browser.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle switch at top-right).
4. Click **Load unpacked**.
5. Select the folder `build/uBO-Scope.chromium/` created by the packaging script or extracted manually.

> To package:
> ```bash
> ./tools/make-package.sh chromium
> ```

### Firefox Manual Installation

1. Open Firefox.
2. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
3. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
4. Navigate to `build/uBO-Scope.firefox/` and select any file inside the folder.

> To package:
> ```bash
> ./tools/make-package.sh firefox
> ```

### Safari Manual Installation

Manual Safari extension installation requires using Xcode and the Safari Web Extensions toolchain:

1. Open the Safari extension project in Xcode.
2. Build the extension for Safari 18.5+.
3. Enable the extension in Safari’s Preferences > Extensions.

Note: This is an advanced process beyond typical user needs.

> To package:
> ```bash
> ./tools/make-package.sh safari
> ```

## Step 3: Verify Installation

After installation, verify your success:

- The uBO Scope icon appears in the browser toolbar.
- Click the icon to open the popup interface and confirm it shows connection data or "NO DATA" if no browsing activity yet.
- The extension requests appropriate permissions during installation.

If these criteria are met, uBO Scope is installed correctly.
