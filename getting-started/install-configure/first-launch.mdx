# First Launch and Permissions

Welcome to your first experience with **uBO Scope**. This guide walks you through starting uBO Scope after installation, explains browser permission requests, and ensures your extension is effectively monitoring your browsing activity. You'll also discover how uBO Scope reliably reports network connections regardless of other blockers you may have enabled.

---

## 1. Launching uBO Scope for the First Time

Once you install uBO Scope from your browser's official extension store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari Extensions Gallery), follow these steps to get started immediately:

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Icon">
Find the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar area. It appears as a small badge counter, showing the number of distinct third-party servers connected from the currently active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Icon to Open the Popup">
Click the icon to open uBO Scope's popup interface. This panel presents a categorized overview of domains connected by the active tab: Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Allow Required Permissions">
When you open uBO Scope for the first time, your browser will prompt you to grant permissions required by the extension (detailed below). Accepting these permissions is essential for the extension to monitor network requests accurately.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Monitoring Activity">
Upon granted permissions, uBO Scope immediately begins tracking network connections on your active tabs. The badge count updates dynamically, reflecting real-time third-party domain connections.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Permission prompts may vary by browser and version. If you accidentally dismiss or block permissions, follow your browser's extension settings to re-enable them.
</Note>

## 2. Permissions Requested by uBO Scope

To function correctly, uBO Scope requests several critical permissions. Here's what they mean and why they matter:

| Permission      | Purpose                                                                                         |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `activeTab`     | Allows the extension to interact with the currently active browser tab to monitor its network activity in real-time. |
| `webRequest`    | Enables uBO Scope to listen to and analyze all network requests (HTTP/HTTPS/WebSocket) occurring in the browser.     |
| `storage`       | Provides persistent storage for session data and user settings needed for accurate tracking and resuming state.    |

### Host Permissions

The extension also declares permissions to observe all HTTP/S and WebSocket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` depending on the browser) so it can detect all outgoing network requests.

<Warning>
These permissions allow extensive network request monitoring but only within your own browser; uBO Scope does not modify or block any connections. It is an observation and reporting tool.
</Warning>

## 3. Ensuring Effective Monitoring of Active Tabs

uBO Scope automatically tracks network connections on your active browser tabs. To confirm monitoring is effective, ensure the following:

- The extension icon's badge shows a number representing distinct third-party domains connected by the active tab.
- Opening the popup displays domain lists sorted by connection outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).
- The extension remains active when you switch tabs or reload pages.

If monitoring appears inactive:

- Check that the extension is enabled in your browser's extensions or add-ons manager.
- Confirm the necessary permissions were granted (see section 2).
- Refresh tabs to trigger new network request capturing.

<Tip>
If using other content blockers or privacy tools, rest assured uBO Scope operates independently and continues reporting all network requests visible through the browser's `webRequest` API.
</Tip>

## 4. How uBO Scope Works with Other Content Blockers

One of uBO Scope's strengths is its reliable reporting **regardless of which content blockers are active** on your browser. Whether you use uBlock Origin, Adblock Plus, or DNS-based blockers, uBO Scope listens directly to the browser’s low-level network request events.

This means:

- uBO Scope accurately sees whether requests were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Results shown on the badge and popup are based on real network behavior, not just filter list hits or block counts.
- It helps you debunk common myths about blockers by showing the actual third-party connections your browser makes.

<Info>
As long as the browser reports requests through its `webRequest` API, uBO Scope provides a trustworthy, transparent insight into all network connections triggered by webpages.
