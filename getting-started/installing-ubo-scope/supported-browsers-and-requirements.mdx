| Browser    | Minimum Version | Notes                                    | Official Install Link                                        |
|------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium   | 122.0+          | Also supports Microsoft Edge (Chromium) | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox    | 128.0+          | Also supports Firefox for Android        | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)                  |
| Safari     | 18.5+           | Requires Safari's strict minimum version | See Apple App Store or Safari Extensions                      |


### Browser Compatibility Details

- **Chromium-based browsers** require version 122 or higher due to manifest and API compatibility.
- **Firefox** support starts at version 128 for stable and mobile editions.
- **Safari** requires version 18.5 or newer, leveraging Apple's modern web extension support.

> These version requirements align with the underlying APIs used by uBO Scope, such as the `webRequest` API, ensuring accurate network monitoring.


## 2. System and Environment Prerequisites

Before installing uBO Scope, verify the following system conditions:

### Operating Systems Supported
- Windows, macOS, Linux (Chromium and Firefox)
- iOS/iPadOS for Safari (via App Store installation)
- Android for Firefox (via Firefox Add-ons)

### Browser Settings
- **Enable WebExtensions:** Ensure your browser supports and allows installation of third-party extensions.
- **Permissions:** uBO Scope requires specific permissions (detailed below) to function correctly.


## 3. Required Permissions

To transparently track connections, uBO Scope requests the following permissions:

- **`webRequest`** — To observe and record network requests initiated by web pages.
- **`storage`** — To save session data, like tab-specific connection info.
- **`activeTab`** — To access data for the currently active tab.
- **Host Permissions:** uBO Scope requires access to web traffic URLs, including:
  - `https://*/*`
  - `http://*/*`
  - Additionally for Chromium and Firefox: `wss://*/*` and `ws://*/*` for WebSocket tracking.


> These permissions are essential to deliver comprehensive insights into all network connections, including HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket protocols.


## 4. Official Installation Sources

To maintain security and reliability, always install uBO Scope from official channels matching your browser:

| Browser    | Official Source Link                                                                                                           |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium   | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)                        |
| Firefox    | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)                                                         |
| Safari     | Safari Extensions from the Apple App Store or developer page for Safari web extensions                                         |


## 5. Minimum Browser Version Verification

### How to Check Your Browser Version

- **Chromium/Edge**: Click the menu (three dots), go to `Help` → `About Google Chrome` or `About Microsoft Edge`.
- **Firefox**: Click the menu (three lines), choose `Help` → `About Firefox`.
- **Safari**: Go to `Safari` menu → `About Safari`.


## 6. Important Notes and Best Practices

- Running uBO Scope on unsupported browsers or older versions may cause incomplete or inaccurate data reporting.
- Always update your browser to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and API improvements.
- If using Safari, ensure your browser meets the strict minimum version (18.5) or higher.

<Tip>
If you are developing or testing on alternative browsers or versions, be aware that uBO Scope's core network monitoring relies heavily on the `webRequest` API, which might not be fully supported or behave differently.
