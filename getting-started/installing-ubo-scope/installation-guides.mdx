# Installing uBO Scope

This guide walks you through the process of installing uBO Scope, a lightweight browser extension designed to reveal all network connections made to third-party servers by your browser. Whether you're a first-time user or switching browsers, these step-by-step instructions will help you get uBO Scope up and running quickly from official store sources.

---

## 1. Choose Your Browser

uBO Scope supports installation on the following browsers:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.) - Version 122 or above
- **Mozilla Firefox** - Version 128 or above
- **Apple Safari** - Version 18.5 or above

Make sure your browser version meets these minimum requirements to ensure proper functionality.

<Tip>
Check your browser's current version in settings or "About" to verify compatibility before proceeding.
</Tip>

## 2. Installing from the Official Browser Store

For security and automatic updates, always install uBO Scope from your browser’s official add-on or extension store.

### Chromium Browsers
1. Open the [Chrome Web Store uBO Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
2. Click **Add to Chrome** (or your browser’s equivalent button).
3. Confirm any permission prompts.
4. Wait for the extension to install and the icon to appear on the toolbar.

### Mozilla Firefox
1. Open the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Agree to requested permissions.
4. The extension icon will appear on the Firefox toolbar after installation.

### Apple Safari
- For Safari users, install uBO Scope through the [App Store or Safari Extensions Gallery](https://apps.apple.com/app/uBO-Scope/), or follow Apple’s installation instructions for macOS 18.5+.

<Warning>
Safari installs may require manual enabling of the extension in Safari's Preferences under Extensions.
</Warning>

## 3. Verifying the Installation

After installation, confirm that uBO Scope is active:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon on your browser's toolbar. It typically resembles a small shield or badge with a count.
2. Click the icon, which opens the **popup UI** where you will see network connection details as you browse.
3. Open a new tab and visit any website.
4. Click the uBO Scope icon again — the popup should display the domain of the current tab and connection summaries categorized by "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked".

<Tip>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or a question mark for domains connected, try reloading the web page or check that uBO Scope has permission to access the tab.
</Tip>

## 4. Switching Browsers or Manual Installation

If you want to build or customize uBO Scope for browsers outside of official stores or are developing it:

- Clone the [uBO Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
- Use the provided shell scripts in the `tools/` directory to create packages:

```bash
# For Chromium
./tools/make-chromium.sh [version]

# For Firefox
./tools/make-firefox.sh [version]

# For Safari
./tools/make-safari.sh [version]
```

- Load the unpacked or packaged extension manually into your browser’s developer extensions page.

<Note>
Building from source requires a Linux environment and basic shell scripting knowledge.
</Note>

## 5. First-Time User Tips

- After installation, browse a few popular websites to see real-time connection data.
- Pay attention to the badge count—the number represents distinct third-party domains your browser connects to.
- Remember uBO Scope only reports; it does not block connections.

## 6. Common Troubleshooting
