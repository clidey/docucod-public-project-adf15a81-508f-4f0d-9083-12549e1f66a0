# First-Time Configuration

Welcome to your first experience with **uBO Scope**. This guide walks you through opening the extension, reviewing permissions, and getting acquainted with the popup interface. It clarifies what to expect immediately after installation and explains default behaviors to set you up for effective privacy monitoring.

---

## 1. Opening uBO Scope for the First Time

Once installed, uBO Scope integrates directly into your browser toolbar. Follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the Extension Icon">
Find the **uBO Scope** icon in your browser's extension toolbar. It usually appears near the address bar and uses the app’s distinctive logo.
</Step>
<Step title="Click to Open the Popup">
Click the icon to open the popup panel. This panel provides a real-time summary of all remote server connections associated with the active tab.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
If you do not see the icon immediately, verify that the extension installed correctly and is enabled by checking your browser’s extension manager.
</Check>

## 2. Reviewing Permissions Prompt

The extension requests essential permissions to access network request data and interact with pages:

- **activeTab**: Allows uBO Scope to monitor network activity on the currently active tab.
- **storage**: Saves session data and preferences.
- **webRequest**: Listens to network requests to track connection outcomes.

### How to Verify Permissions:

- Upon installation, your browser will prompt to approve these permissions.
- Confirm that all requested permissions are granted to ensure full functionality.

<Warning>
Without these permissions, uBO Scope cannot monitor network activity accurately, limiting its usefulness.
</Warning>

## 3. Understanding the Popup Interface

The main interface offers an instant overview of remote server connections grouped by their request outcome:

### Key Sections in the Popup

- **Hostname Display:** Shows the hostname of the current active tab, with the domain portion highlighted.
- **Summary:** Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains connected during this tab session.
- **Not Blocked:** Lists domains where connections were allowed.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Shows connections that were stealth-blocked via redirects or related mechanisms.
- **Blocked:** Displays domains whose connection attempts were blocked outright.

### What You See at First Run

- If the page is newly opened or no data is available, you will see **'NO DATA'** until network requests are registered.
- The domain counts and lists will populate dynamically as you browse.

<Tip>
The number shown under "domains connected" is the count of unique third-party remote servers contacted by the active page. A lower count usually reflects better privacy protection.
</Tip>

## 4. Default Settings and Behavior

uBO Scope requires no initial configuration for basic use—it works out-of-the-box once installed and permissions are granted. By default:

- It begins monitoring network requests immediately for the active tab.
- The toolbar icon badge updates to reflect the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.
- Popup data reflects the current tab's connection information.

No further setup is required to begin assessing your browsing privacy exposure.

---

## 5. Practical Tips for Your First Run

- Open a new tab and visit a website. Then click the uBO Scope icon to see connections being tracked.
- Remember that legitimate websites often connect to content delivery networks (CDNs) or analytics providers; a small number of third parties is expected.
- Use the categorizations (not blocked, stealth, blocked) to understand what types of connections are allowed or blocked by current content blockers.

<Note>
If the popup does not update or shows no data even on active tabs with network activity, try reloading the page or restarting the browser.
</Note>
