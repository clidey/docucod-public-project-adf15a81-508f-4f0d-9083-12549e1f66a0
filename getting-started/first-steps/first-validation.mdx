# Validating Your Setup

Ensure uBO Scope is functioning correctly by verifying the toolbar badge count and viewing live connection data in the popup panel. This guide walks you through practical verification steps and interpretation of initial results to confirm a successful installation.

---

## 1. Check the Toolbar Badge Count

The badge on the uBO Scope extension icon is your first indicator of operation:

- **What to look for:** A numeric badge displaying the count of distinct third-party domains connected to by the active browser tab.
- **Ideal result:** When visiting a typical website, the badge shows a number greater than zero, reflecting detected connections.

### How to check:

1. Open your browser.
2. Navigate to any commonly visited website that loads external resources (such as a news site or social media page).
3. Observe the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar for the badge.

<Tip>
The badge counts only distinct third-party remote servers contacted, not total requests. A lower number indicates fewer third-party connections.
</Tip>

<Warning>
If the badge remains empty or zero on active tabs visiting normal websites, uBO Scope might not be working or lacks permissions. Proceed to view the popup panel for details.
</Warning>

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

The popup panel provides detailed lists of connected domains categorized by outcome.

### Steps to open:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup panel will appear showing:
   - The hostname of the active tab.
   - The total number of connected domains.
   - Domains grouped into **Not Blocked**, **Stealth-Blocked**, and **Blocked** sections.

### What to expect:

- The domain name at the top should reflect the current tab’s hostname.
- Each section lists domains with the count of connections observed.
- If you see the message "NO DATA" or empty lists, uBO Scope might not have captured connection data yet.

<Tip>
Reload the active webpage to generate traffic. The popup panel updates automatically to reflect the latest data.
</Tip>

## 3. Interpret Basic Results

Understanding the data ensures you verify correct operation and gain initial insights.

| Section          | What It Means                                      | User Action                          |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **not blocked**  | Connections allowed by your content blockers.     | Review for expected external domains.
| **stealth-blocked** | Connections attempted but silently blocked (redirected). | Useful for identifying stealth blocking behavior.
| **blocked**      | Explicitly blocked connections (failures/errors). | Check if expected domains appear here.

### Example:

If, on a news site:

- **Not Blocked** shows `cdn.example.com` with a count of `3`.
- **Stealth-Blocked** list is empty.
- **Blocked** lists suspicious ad trackers.

This confirms that uBO Scope is capturing the connection outcomes accurately.

## 4. Trigger Sample Observations

To generate reliable test data:

1. Visit a popular, content-rich web page such as https://www.bbc.com or https://www.nytimes.com.
2. Observe uBO Scope badge update reflecting third-party domains loaded.
3. Open the popup to inspect domain lists.

<Tip>
Switch between multiple tabs and verify distinct badge counts are updated per tab.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Basic Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues & Fixes">
<Accordion title="Badge Count is Always Zero or Absent">

- Make sure the extension is enabled and has necessary permissions.
- Visit HTTP or HTTPS websites (not `about:blank` or internal pages).
- Refresh tabs after installation.
- Restart your browser.

If issues persist, see the [Resolving Common Installation Issues](/getting-started/troubleshooting/common-problems) page.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA or Empty Lists">

- Ensure you have active network activity in the tab.
- Refresh the page to ensure the extension captures data.
- Close and reopen popup.
- Check if other content blockers are interfering.

For advanced diagnostics, refer to the [Why Is My Badge Count Zero?](/getting-started/troubleshooting/no-connections-badge) guide.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps After Validation

Once your setup is verified:

- Explore the [Launching and Using the Toolbar Popup](/getting-started/first-steps/launching-ubo-scope) guide to learn detailed use of the popup interface.
- Understand how to interpret complex scenarios via [Interpreting Badge Counts and Domain Statistics](/guides/analyzing-network-connections/interpreting-badge-and-popup-stats).
- Learn best practices for filter list maintenance in [Using uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance](/guides/advanced-usage/for-filter-list-maintainers).
