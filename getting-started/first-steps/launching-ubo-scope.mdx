# Launching and Using the Toolbar Popup

uBO Scope provides a clear, actionable view of your browser's network connections directly from the toolbar popup. This guide walks you through accessing the popup, understanding its summary interface, and interpreting the badge count along with connection statuses.

---

## 1. Accessing uBO Scope Popup from the Browser Toolbar

1. **Locate the uBO Scope Icon**
    - After installation, find the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar. It typically features the uBO logo with a badge count.
    - If you do not see the icon, check your browser's extension overflow menu or toolbar customization settings.

2. **Open the Popup Panel**
    - Click on the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
    - The popup loads the latest network connection summary for the currently active tab.

<Tip>
The first time you open it on a tab, data may take a moment to appear as the extension collects information.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Popup Interface

The popup is designed to give you an immediate, comprehensive view of the remote server connections related to the current browser tab.

### Main Interface Elements

- **Tab Hostname Heading**
  - Displays the current tabâ€™s hostname and domain, rendered with Unicode support for internationalized domains.

- **Summary Section**
  - Shows the total number of unique domains connected from the page.
  - This number corresponds to the badge count shown on the toolbar icon.

- **Connection Status Sections**
  The popup is divided into three key outcome categories, each with a list of domains and their connection counts:
  
  1. **Not Blocked (allowed)**
     - Lists third-party domains that successfully established connections.
  2. **Stealth-Blocked (stealth)**
     - Includes domains that were blocked in stealth mode, meaning blocked without the page detecting it.
  3. **Blocked (blocked)**
     - Contains domains whose connections were outright blocked by content blockers or other mechanisms.

### Domain Rows

- Each domain row shows:
  - The domain name (decoded from punycode to unicode)
  - The number of times connections were made or attempted during the session

---

## 3. Interpreting the Badge Count

- The badge count represents **the number of distinct third-party domains** that your browser successfully connected to (allowed connections).
- A lower badge count generally reflects fewer external connections, often a desirable privacy outcome.

<Note>
The badge count does not include blocked domains or stealth-blocked domains. It only reflects allowed third-party connections.
</Note>

<Warning>
Do not use the badge count as a blind measure of content blocker effectiveness. Consider the nature of the connections and domains, not just the number.
</Warning>

## 4. Typical User Flow

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
2. Observe the hostname and domain at the top of the popup.
3. Review the summary number for a quick sense of third-party exposure.
4. Explore the detailed connection categories (allowed, stealth, blocked).
5. Use this insight to determine if your privacy and content blocker settings are working as expected.

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Refresh the Popup Frequently**: As you browse or reload pages, the popup updates the statistics for the current tab.

- **Compare Badge Count to Popup Data**: Verifying the badge count against popup details helps you understand connection context.

- **Look for Unexpected Domains**: Identifying unfamiliar third-party domains can guide filter list adjustments or privacy settings.

- **Use Stealth and Blocked Sections to Detect Hidden Connections**: If stealth-blocked lists have entries, it means connections were silently blocked, which might not be visible to the website.

- **Popup Does Not Collect Data Across Tabs**: The data shown pertains only to the active tab to provide clear context.

## 6. Troubleshooting and Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Not Opening or Blank Content">
- Ensure the extension is installed and enabled.
- Reload the active tab and re-open the popup.
- Check browser permissions for webRequest and storage APIs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count is Zero But You Browse Normally">
- This indicates no third-party connections were allowed or recorded on the active tab.
- Ensure you have browsed sites that trigger network requests.
- Some browsing contexts (new tabs, browser pages) generate no connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Names Appear in Punycode or Not Displayed Correctly">
- The extension converts punycode to unicode for display.
- If display is incorrect, check browser locale and font support.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
