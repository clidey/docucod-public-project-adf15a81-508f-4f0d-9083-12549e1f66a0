# Checking uBO Scope in Action

Discover how to verify that uBO Scope is actively monitoring network connections on the current webpage. This guide walks you through inspecting the popup dashboard, understanding the toolbar badge count, and interpreting connection categories to gain clear insights on your third-party network exposure.

---

## 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

To start observing uBO Scope's monitoring in action:

1. Navigate to the webpage you want to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
   > The popup panel will open, displaying network connection details related to the active tab.

<Check>
If the popup appears blank or shows 'NO DATA', 
- Ensure the page is fully loaded.
- Confirm uBO Scope has the necessary permissions and is installed correctly.
- Try reloading the page and reopening the popup.
</Check>

## 2. Understand the Popup Dashboard Layout

The popup dashboard summarizes third-party network activity with the following main sections:

- **Header (Hostname Display):** Shows the main hostname of the active tab's webpage.
- **Summary Count:** Displays the total number of distinct remote domains connected.
- **Categorized Connection Outcomes:** Lists domains grouped as:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Third parties successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests that were stealthily redirected.
  - **Blocked:** Connections prevented by content blockers or errors.

Each domain displays a count badge indicating how many connections were made to that domain during the page session.

## 3. Interpreting the Toolbar Badge

The uBO Scope extension icon shows a badge with a number:

- **Badge Count Meaning:** It reflects the number of distinct third-party domains **allowed** (i.e., connected successfully) on the current tab.
- **No Badge (Empty):** Indicates no third-party connections were observed or all were blocked.

<Info>
This count helps you measure your privacy exposure: a higher number means more third-party network connections.
</Info>

## 4. Inspect Domain Connection Categories

The popup separates domains into three categories to clarify connection outcomes:

### Not Blocked (Allowed)
- These are third-party domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
- This list represents actual live connections during page load and navigation.
- Counts next to domains show how many connections were made.

### Stealth-Blocked
- Domains with requests that were stealthily redirected or modified to avoid detection by pages.
- These requests did not complete fully as intended by the originating sites.

### Blocked
- Domains for which connections were prevented or failed due to content blockers or network errors.
- This includes domains your content blocker actively blocked.

<Note>
If a category section has no domains, that section will not be displayed in the popup.
</Note>

## 5. Practical Walkthrough Example

Follow these steps to verify uBO Scope activity for any webpage:

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to a website">
Open a site you want to analyze in a new browser tabâ€”for example, https://example.com.
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the displayed hostname and domain count">
Confirm the popup header shows the domain name of the active tab.
Observe the total number of distinct connected domains below the hostname.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine domain lists">
Browse the sections:
- Allowed: confirmed live third-party connections.
- Stealth-Blocked and Blocked: third parties that were obstructed.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret badge count">
Look at the extension icon badge; match the count with allowed domains.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Tips and Best Practices

- **Reload the page if no data appears:** The extension updates data after page load.
- **Use multiple pages to get full insights:** Some pages may have fewer third-party connections.
- **Keep your browser and extension updated** to ensure accurate data capture.
- **Combine with content blockers:** Use uBO Scope to validate how well your blockers reduce unwanted connections.

## 7. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope Popup and Badge">
<Accordion title="Popup shows NO DATA or remains empty">
- The page might not be fully loaded; wait or reload.
- uBO Scope permissions may not be granted; check your browser extension settings.
- The browser might restrict extension API access on certain pages (e.g., internal browser pages).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count is missing or zero after visiting pages">
- This indicates no allowed third-party connections detected.
- Some pages do not load third-party content or your blockers might be highly effective.
- Make sure uBO Scope is enabled and not disabled by browser settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains list updates slowly or seems outdated">
- uBO Scope processes network events with a slight delay to avoid performance impacts.
- Wait a few seconds after page load for data to appear.
- Reload the page if issues persist.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Next Steps

- Explore **[Using the Popup Panel: Reading Connection Summaries](../../guides/getting-started/understanding-the-popup-panel)** for in-depth info on connections.
- Learn about interpreting the **Toolbar Badge & Count** in the guide **[Understanding the Toolbar Badge & Count](../../guides/getting-started/connection-badge-interpreting)**.
- After verification, try auditing other sites with **[Auditing and Reducing Third-Party Connections](../../guides/use-cases-and-patterns/auditing-third-party-connections)**.

_Source Code References for Popup and Badge Handling:_
- Popup HTML & JavaScript handle rendering and categorization of domains (e.g. `popup.html`, `js/popup.js`).
- Background script manages live updating of network outcomes and updating the badge (`js/background.js`).
