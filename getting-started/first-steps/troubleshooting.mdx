# Troubleshooting & Validation

Ensure uBO Scope is functioning correctly by identifying and resolving common issues such as missing popup windows, empty data displays, or permission prompts. This guide offers practical diagnostic steps and quick tests to validate the extension's proper installation and configuration.

---

## 1. Common Issues and Their Resolutions

### 1.1 The Popup Does Not Appear or Open
- **Cause**: The browser may block popups or the extension is not properly installed.
- **Solution Steps**:
  1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon manually.
  2. Ensure the extension is enabled in the browser's extensions/add-ons list.
  3. Restart the browser if the popup still does not appear.
  4. Verify installation from the browser's official extension store.

<Check>
If the popup fails to load, try disabling other extensions that could interfere with popup rendering.
</Check>

### 1.2 The Popup Loads But Shows "NO DATA" or Empty Sections
- **Cause**: The extension hasn't registered network activity for the selected tab or lacks necessary permissions.
- **Resolution Steps**:
  1. Confirm that uBO Scope has permissions for `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
  2. Reload the web page in the active tab to generate network activity.
  3. Wait a few seconds for the extension to capture and process network requests.
  4. Refresh the popup by closing and reopening it.

<Tip>
The extension updates data asynchronously, so immediately opening the popup after a page load might show "NO DATA". Waiting briefly allows data collection.
</Tip>

### 1.3 Suspected Permission Issues or Repeated Permission Prompts
- **Cause**: Browser security settings or extension conflicts prevent permission grants.
- **Steps to Fix**:
  1. Open browser settings and review permissions granted to uBO Scope.
  2. Reinstall the extension to reset permissions.
  3. Restart the browser to ensure permissions are refreshed.
  4. In some cases, disabling stricter content or script blockers temporarily can help.

<Warning>
Do not disable essential security features permanently. Only troubleshoot temporarily and re-enable protections afterward.
</Warning>

### 1.4 Badge Count Does Not Update or Shows Incorrect Numbers
- **Cause**: Background script may have stalled or session data corrupted.
- **Reset Instructions**:
  1. Close all browser tabs and restart the browser.
  2. Clear the extension's session data by disabling and re-enabling uBO Scope.
  3. Open the popup to trigger data reloading.
  4. Verify if the badge count increments upon loading different websites.


## 2. Quick Validation Checklist

Ensure your setup passes these tests to confirm the extension is operating correctly.

<Steps>
<Step title="Validate Installation">
- Navigate to your browser's extension management page.
- Verify uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Check the version matches or exceeds 1.0.1.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Permissions">
- Verify that `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` permissions are granted.
- If unsure, reinstall the extension.
</Step>
<Step title="Interact with Popup">
- Click the toolbar icon.
- Verify the popup appears with the domain name of the active tab.
- Confirm the sections 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' display connection counts or domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Load a Known Website">
- Visit a common third-party rich website (such as news or shopping sites).
- Wait 5 seconds, then open the popup.
- Confirm that domains are listed and the badge updates.
</Step>
<Step title="Permission Troubleshooting">
- If permission prompts appear, follow browser prompts to accept.
- Temporarily disable conflicting security extensions if permission cannot be granted.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Missing or empty data usually result from insufficient permissions or stale session state. Reloading pages and extension helps.
</Note>

## 3. Additional Troubleshooting Tips

- **Browser Version Requirements**: The extension requires at least Chrome 122, Firefox 128, or Safari 18.5. Confirm your browser version if problems arise.
- **Conflicting Extensions**: Content blockers or privacy extensions that aggressively block scripts may interfere with uBO Scope's data collection. Disable them temporarily to test.
- **Network Request Coverage**: uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API. Requests made outside this API (e.g., via system-level DNS blocking or VPNs) may not be reported.
- **Session Data Persistence**: uBO Scope stores session data temporarily using browser session storage. Restarting the browser clears this data and can help reset any issues.

## 4. How to Verify uBO Scope is Working

To confirm that uBO Scope accurately monitors network connections:

1. Open uBO Scope's popup by clicking its toolbar icon.
2. Confirm the active tab's hostname appears at the top.
3. Observe the counts and lists under the sections:
   - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Resources successfully loaded.
   - **Stealth-Blocked**: Requests that were redirected stealthily.
   - **Blocked**: Requests blocked due to errors or content blocking.
4. Browse multiple websites, and verify that the badge count updates correctly to reflect distinct third-party remote servers.

If all these elements function as described, uBO Scope is fully operational.

## 5. Where to Get Help

- Refer to the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/essentials/installation) if setup issues persist.
- Visit the [Popup Panel Documentation](/guides/getting-started/understanding-the-popup-panel) for more on interpreting connection summaries.
- Explore the [Core Terminology](/overview/architecture-and-concepts/core-terminology) to understand outcome categories.
- For advanced issues, check the [System Architecture Overview](/overview/architecture-and-concepts/system-architecture).
