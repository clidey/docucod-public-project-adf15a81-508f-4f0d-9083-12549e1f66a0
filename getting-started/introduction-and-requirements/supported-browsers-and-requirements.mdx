# Supported Browsers & System Requirements

Ensure you start your uBO Scope experience on a compatible browser platform and meet all prerequisites to enjoy seamless operation. This page details the supported browsers, minimum version requirements, and essential conditions before you install uBO Scope.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to work on leading modern browsers that support the WebExtensions API and the necessary `webRequest` permissions. The extension currently supports:

| Browser               | Minimum Version         | Installation Source                                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium-based Browsers| Chrome 122.0 or later   | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox               | Firefox 128.0 or later  | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)                  |
| Safari                | Safari 18.5 or later    | Safari Extensions Gallery (via Safari's extension manager)                            |


### Why These Versions?

- The minimum versions ensure full compatibility with Manifest v3 and the essential browser APIs required by uBO Scope.
- Newer browser architectures impose stricter policies on extensions, which uBO Scope follows to maintain security and stability.


## 2. System Requirements

Before installation, verify your system meets these minimum essential requirements to support the chosen browser and uBO Scope smoothly:

- **Operating System:**
  - Windows 10 or later
  - macOS 11 Big Sur or later (recommended for Safari 18.5+)
  - Popular Linux distributions compatible with your browser

- **Memory & Storage:**
  - Minimum 2GB RAM (4GB recommended for multitasking)
  - At least 100 MB free storage

- **Network:** Active internet connection needed for:
  - Installing the extension
  - Allowing uBO Scope to monitor live network requests

- **Permissions:** uBO Scope requires the following permissions granted during installation:
  - Access to monitor web requests (`webRequest` permission)
  - Storage to save session data
  - Active tab access to gather data relevant to the current browser tab


## 3. Prerequisites

Before you install uBO Scope, ensure the following conditions are met:

- Your browser is updated to or beyond the specified minimum version.
- You have the rights to install extensions on your browser (some managed enterprise environments may restrict this).
- Content blockers or security software do not interfere with extension permissions, particularly network monitoring capabilities.


## 4. Platform-Specific Notes

### Chromium-Based Browsers

- Requires Chrome 122.0 or above due to mandatory Manifest v3 support.
- The extension runs as a service worker background script for better resource management.


### Firefox

- Requires Firefox 128.0 or above.
- Uses background scripts and respects Firefox-specific extension APIs.


### Safari

- Requires Safari 18.5 or above.
- Due to Safari's unique extension distribution model, installation must be done via Safari's Extension Manager.
- Support for `webRequest` API is limited to HTTP and HTTPS (no WebSocket protocols).


## 5. Additional Compatibility Considerations

- **Content Blockers:** uBO Scope can run alongside other content blockers such as uBlock Origin to provide complementary insights.
- **WebRequest API Limitations:** Some network requests that are not visible to the browser's `webRequest` API will not be captured or reported by uBO Scope.


## 6. Verifying Compatibility

To confirm your environment is ready:

```bash
# Check browser version:
# Chromium/Chrome
chrome://settings/help

# Firefox
about:support

# Safari
Safari > About Safari
```

Ensure the version number matches or exceeds the minimum supported version listed above.


## 7. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

<Tip>

- If you experience issues installing or running uBO Scope, first verify your browser version and update if necessary.
- Confirm no other extension or system policy is blocking network monitoring permissions.
- Safari users should ensure their system macOS version supports Safari 18.5+ and that the extension is enabled in Safari preferences.

</Tip>


## Summary

uBO Scope supports Chromium-based browsers (Chrome 122+), Firefox (128+), and Safari (18.5+). Ensuring browser and system requirements are met is critical before installation. Meeting these prerequisites guarantees a smooth installation, accurate reporting, and seamless integration with your browsing experience.
