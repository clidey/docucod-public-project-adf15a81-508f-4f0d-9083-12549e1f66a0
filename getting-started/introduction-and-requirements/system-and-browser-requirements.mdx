# System and Browser Requirements for uBO Scope

Before installing and running uBO Scope, it is crucial to ensure your system and browser meet the minimum compatibility requirements. This guarantees a smooth installation, proper operation, and reliable data reporting from the extension.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers and Versions

uBO Scope is designed for modern web browsers with support for Manifest Version 3 extensions and the required `webRequest` API capabilities. Below are the official supported browser platforms and their minimum versions:

| Browser      | Minimum Version | Notes                                         |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Firefox**  | 128.0 or later   | Compatible with desktop and Android Firefox. |
| **Chromium** | 122.0 or later   | Includes Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers. |
| **Safari**   | 18.5 or later    | macOS and iOS Safari with MV3 support.       |

> These requirements ensure full compatibility with uBO Scope’s background service worker, webRequest permissions, and UI popup features.


## 2. Platform Support

- **Desktop**: Full support on Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions that run the supported browser versions.
- **Mobile**:
  - Firefox Android (version 128.0 and up) supported fully.
  - Safari iOS/macOS supported at version 18.5 and later.
  - Chromium-based mobile browsers generally do not support Manifest V3 extensions yet, so uBO Scope is not supported.


## 3. System Requirements

While uBO Scope is lightweight and performant, here are basic guidelines:

- **Operating System**: Compatible with OS supported by the above browsers.
- **Memory and Storage**: Minimal usage; the extension maintains network request logs and stores session data in browser storage.
- **Network Access**: Requires internet connectivity for monitoring network requests and fetching any updates to internal data repositories (like the Public Suffix List).


## 4. Permissions and Access

uBO Scope requests the following permissions to operate effectively:

- **`webRequest`**: To observe all network request events.
- **`storage`**: To persist session data and internal lists.
- **`activeTab`**: To monitor network activity of the active browser tab.

Your browser must allow you to grant these permissions during installation or update.


## 5. Verification of Compatibility Before Installation

To confirm your browser version, follow these steps:

### For Firefox:
1. Open Firefox.
2. Go to `about:preferences`.
3. Scroll down to the “Firefox Updates” section or go to `about:support`.
4. Verify the version is 128.0 or higher.

### For Chromium Browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.):
1. Open your browser.
2. Navigate to `chrome://settings/help` (or `edge://settings/help` in Edge).
3. Confirm the version is 122.0 or higher.

### For Safari:
1. Open Safari.
2. Check under `Safari > About Safari` in the menu.
3. Confirm the version is 18.5 or higher.


## 6. Common Pitfalls and Tips

- **Outdated Browsers:** Older browser versions will prevent installation or cause malfunction. Always update to the latest stable release.
- **Unsupported Browsers:** Browsers not supporting Manifest V3 or the required webRequest API (e.g., legacy browsers, Firefox prior to 128, Android Chromium browsers) are not compatible.
- **Missing Permissions:** Denying permissions during installation will cause uBO Scope to malfunction or report incomplete data.
