# What is uBO Scope?

Discover how uBO Scope empowers you with transparent insights into all remote server connections initiated by your browser. This lightweight extension is designed to reveal **every attempted and successful domain connection** from any webpage you visit, extending beyond what traditional content blockers disclose.

---

## Core Purpose and Value

uBO Scope’s primary mission is to provide **unfiltered visibility** into your browser's network activity:

- It shows **all connections** attempted or successfully made to remote third-party servers.
- It reports these connections regardless of any content blockers or DNS-based filtering in place.
- Instead of focusing on raw block counts, it emphasizes the **number of distinct third-party domains connected**, a more meaningful privacy metric.

This empowers you to understand the network relationships your browsing generates, discover hidden or stealthy connections, and make informed decisions about your online privacy.

<Info>
The badge count on the uBO Scope toolbar icon always reflects the **number of distinct third-party remote servers connected**, not the number of blocked requests. A lower badge count means fewer potential third-party trackers or resource fetchers.

## Who Should Use uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is intentionally crafted for:

- **Privacy-conscious users** who want to see the full scope of third-party connections—both blocked and allowed—to reduce unwanted network exposure.
- **Filter list maintainers** looking for a reliable tool to observe how lists perform in real environments, including stealth-blocked requests.
- **Content blocker enthusiasts and developers** seeking an accurate measuring tool beyond block counters and test pages.

By exposing all network attempts and outcomes, uBO Scope helps users and maintainers confidently assess privacy risks and fine-tune blocking strategies.

## How uBO Scope Works

uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to track network requests initiated by web pages:

1. Listens to all outgoing network requests matching HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket (`ws://`, `wss://`) protocols.
2. Categorizes each request according to its outcome:
   - **Allowed**: Successful connection and resource retrieval.
   - **Blocked**: Requests that failed or were blocked.
   - **Stealth-blocked**: Redirected or stealthily managed network requests.
3. Aggregates these results by unique domains and hostnames per browser tab.
4. Updates a toolbar badge that counts distinct allowed third-party domains.
5. Presents detailed connection data in a popup panel for the active tab.

This architecture bypasses dependence on specific content blockers and reveals the _actual_ domains your browser tries to reach, irrespective of blocking mechanisms or DNS filters.

<Tip>
While uBO Scope reports network events visible to the browser's `webRequest` API, it cannot track requests made by software outside the browser or those invisible to the API.

## Key Insights and Unique Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage:** See all network connections attempted by the browser, not just those that were blocked.
- **Distinct Domain Counting:** Focus on unique third-party domains rather than raw request counts, offering a clearer metric of exposure.
- **Independent from Content Blockers:** Reports accurately regardless of what other content blockers or DNS filters are active.
- **Myth Busting:** Helps debunk common misunderstandings such as equating higher block counts with better protection.
- **Stealth Block Visibility:** Identifies requests that are stealthily handled or redirected, which typical ad blockers or test pages might miss.

These features elevate uBO Scope as an essential companion for anyone serious about understanding and controlling their browser’s remote connections.

## Real-World Value Scenario

Imagine you're browsing a news website that uses multiple third-party services:

1. Without uBO Scope, you might only see that many scripts are blocked but not which third-parties your browser contacted.
2. uBO Scope reveals that although 10 requests were blocked, the browser still connected to 5 distinct third-party domains unblocked (including some CDN providers).
3. This insight helps you reassess your content blocker settings or filter lists, understanding actual exposure rather than abstract counts.

By putting the domain-level connections front and center, uBO Scope transforms how you view privacy.
