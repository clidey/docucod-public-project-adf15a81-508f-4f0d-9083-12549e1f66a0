# What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a **lightweight browser extension** designed to transparently expose every connection your web browser attempts or successfully establishes with remote servers. By revealing these network activities, uBO Scope provides invaluable insight into third-party interactions — an essential step in understanding and protecting your online privacy.

## Why uBO Scope Matters

Every website you visit can trigger connections to multiple remote servers, often including third-party trackers, content delivery networks (CDNs), or advertisers. While many connections are legitimate, others may infringe on your privacy or slow down your browsing experience.

uBO Scope shines a clear light on this hidden network activity by reporting:

- Which remote servers your browser contacts
- Whether those connections were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked
- The number of distinct third-party servers your browser contacted per tab

This transparency empowers you to understand the true impact of content blockers, privacy tools, or network filters you may use.

## Core Purpose and Philosophy

- **Transparency Over Guesswork:** uBO Scope does not block or interfere itself but reports what happens under the hood.
- **Complement to Content Blockers:** It works alongside any content blockers to report network requests regardless of filtering.
- **Myth Busting:** It debunks common misconceptions about ad blockers, like equating block counts with effectiveness.
- **Simplicity and Focus:** It focuses solely on network request outcomes, presenting the data clearly through a badge count and popup UI.

## How uBO Scope Works

It hooks into your browser's native `webRequest` API to monitor network requests made by each webpage. By listening to events such as redirects, errors, and successes, it categorizes connections into three key outcomes:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** Connections that successfully fetched resources.
- **Blocked:** Connections that failed due to blocking by extensions, filters, or network policies.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were redirected or silently blocked to avoid detection.

uBO Scope tracks these per browser tab and shows them in real-time via an icon badge and an interactive popup.

## Real-World Scenarios Where uBO Scope Helps

### Privacy-Conscious Browsing
Understand exactly how many and which third-party servers are contacted on any website, helping you detect unexpected or hidden trackers.

### Evaluating Content Blockers
Rather than relying on block counts or unreliable test pages, use uBO Scope to see actual network connection patterns to assess your content blockers' effectiveness.

### Filter List Maintenance
Filter list authors can leverage uBO Scope to verify how their rules impact network requests on real-world websites, especially valuable on platforms with limited dev tools.

## Debunking Common Myths

> **Myth:** "A higher block count means a better content blocker."

In reality, a high block count can mean your browser is contacting more harmful or unwanted third-party servers that require blocking. A good content blocker typically results in **fewer allowed third-party connections**, which is the true indicator of effective blocking.

> **Myth:** "Ad blocker test webpages reliably show content blocker effectiveness."

These test sites often create artificial scenarios not representative of genuine browsing behavior. Content blockers employ stealth techniques that these test sites can’t detect accurately.

uBO Scope reports **actual network events during your day-to-day browsing**, providing a reality check far more reliable than any artificial test.
