# Interpreting Domain Statistics

uBO Scope provides a clear window into the network connections your browser makes on any active tab. This guide explains how to read and understand the domain connection counts displayed in the extension's popup, the meaning behind the allowed, blocked, and stealth connections, and how to interpret the badge number on the toolbar icon. By grasping these insights, you can evaluate the health and privacy exposure of your web browsing profile.

## 1. Understanding Connection Categories

uBO Scope classifies connections into three distinct outcomes, each helping you quickly assess what your browser is doing under the hood:

- **Allowed connections**: These are third-party domains your browser successfully connected to while loading the current tab. These connections fetched resources without being blocked.

- **Blocked connections**: These are connection attempts that were explicitly blocked by content blockers or network-level blocking mechanisms.

- **Stealth connections**: These represent connections that were blocked in a stealthy manner—usually redirect-based blocking or other techniques that prevent the page from easily detecting the block.

Each category aggregates *domains* and shows counts, reflecting how many times each domain was involved in connection attempts.

<Note>
The extension detects these outcomes independently of your specific content blocker and works even if blocking happens elsewhere (like DNS). It relies on the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor connections.
</Note>

## 2. Reading the Popup Interface

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup displays per-tab connection statistics.

### Key UI Elements:

- **Hostname Display**: Shows the main domain of the active tab along with any subdomain information.

- **Summary Count**: Shows the total number of distinct third-party domains connected during the tab’s lifetime.

- **Connection Categories**:
  - **Not Blocked**: Lists allowed domains along with how many connections each made.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Lists stealth-blocked domains, highlighting stealth blocking in action.
  - **Blocked**: Lists blocked domains where connections were explicitly prevented.

### Practical Example:

If the popup shows 15 domains connected under "Not Blocked," it means resources from 15 distinct third-party domains were successfully fetched.

<Info>
Counts reflect domain-level aggregation, not individual network requests. This helps focus on real exposure: the number of distinct third parties your browser talks to, not the multiplicity of requests.
</Info>

## 3. Decoding the Toolbar Badge

The badge on the browser toolbar icon shows a simple number: the count of **distinct third-party remote domains allowed** from the current tab.

- **Smaller numbers are better.** A lower count means fewer third-party domains were contacted, so smaller surface for privacy exposure.

- **It excludes the first-party domain** of the active tab—only third-party connections count.

- This number updates live as you browse, letting you monitor connection activity in real time.

<Warning>
Don't confuse a low block count with better blocking. Some blockers may block fewer requests but still allow connections to many third-party domains, increasing privacy exposure.
</Warning>

## 4. What Does a Healthy Browsing Profile Look Like?

### Typical Expectations:

- **Low third-party domain counts for casual browsing**: Most websites should load resources from only a handful of external domains (CDNs, analytics, essential services).

- **Minimal or no stealth blocks for websites you trust**: Seeing stealth blocking often suggests aggressive or background blocking happening on some requests.

- **Blocked domains reflect known trackers or unwanted services**, helping you confirm your content blocker is active and working.

<Check>
If you notice many allowed third-party domains, especially unexpected or unknown ones, consider reviewing your filtering setup or extensions.
</Check>

## 5. Best Practices for Using Domain Statistics

- Use the popup to review individual tabs and see which domains are contacted.
- Combine badge counts with domain lists in the popup to identify unexpected connections.
- Stealth blocks can indicate advanced blocking techniques in use; keep an eye on these to gauge your content blocker’s stealth capabilities.
- Regularly clean or reset your browsers and check connection profiles to catch any changes in your browsing exposure.

## 6. Troubleshooting & Tips

- **No Data or Empty Popup**: Ensure uBO Scope has proper permissions and is enabled. The extension relies on browser `webRequest` API; some browsing modes or strict privacy settings may limit data collection.
- **High Badge Counts**: Investigate which domains are shown in the popup and whether they represent legitimate CDNs or trackers.
- **Unexpected Stealth Blocks**: This may indicate hidden redirection or blocking done by your content blocker; verify your filter lists and extension interactions.

## 7. Where to Go Next

- Consult the [Launching the Extension](getting-started/first-use-and-verification/launching-extension-in-browser) guide to understand how to access and navigate the popup UI.
- Use the [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](getting-started/first-use-and-verification/troubleshooting-setup) document for common problems and solutions.
- Learn foundational concepts in the [Fundamental Concepts & Terminology](overview/core-concepts-architecture/fundamental-terminology) page for deeper understanding.

## Appendix: Technical Notes (For Reference)

- uBO Scope tracks connections per tab using the browser's `webRequest` API.
- Domains are resolved using the public suffix list to accurately group subdomains.
- Allowed, blocked, and stealth counts are maintained separately for domains and hostnames.
- The badge count is updated live based on the number of distinct allowed domains per tab.

By mastering the interpretation of domain statistics in uBO Scope, you gain an actionable view into your browser’s web connections—empowering smarter privacy choices and better understanding of your browsing footprint.
