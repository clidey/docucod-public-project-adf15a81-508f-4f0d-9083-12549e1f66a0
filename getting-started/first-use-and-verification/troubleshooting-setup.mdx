# Troubleshooting Setup Issues

When you first install uBO Scope, you expect to immediately see the extension icon on your browser toolbar, access the popup interface, and observe domain connection data. Occasionally, you might encounter setup problems like missing extension icons, empty or absent data, or permission-related errors. This guide helps you diagnose and resolve these common issues quickly so you can start gaining insights into your browser’s network connections.

## 1. Confirm the Extension Is Properly Installed and Enabled

Before diving into specific error scenarios, start with verifying the extension is installed and active.

### Steps:

- Open your browser's extension management page:
  - **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave):** Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
  - **Firefox:** Navigate to `about:addons`
  - **Safari:** Check extensions via Safari menu > Preferences > Extensions

- Locate **uBO Scope** (displayed as 'uBO Scope' or 'uBlock Origin Scope' depending on browser).

- Ensure the toggle is set to **Enabled**.

- Confirm the extension icon appears on your toolbar. If it is hidden, configure your browser's extension visibility settings to pin or show the icon.

### Troubleshooting:

- If the icon is missing:
  - On Chromium browsers, click the puzzle-piece icon and pin the uBO Scope icon.
  - On Firefox, use the toolbar customization panel to drag and place the icon.
  - On Safari, enable the extension from Preferences.

- If the extension is not listed, reinstall it following the official [Installation Instructions](/getting-started/installation-and-requirements/installation-instructions).

<Note>
The extension requires minimum browser versions to function correctly. See the [Prerequisites & Supported Browsers](/getting-started/installation-and-requirements/prerequisites-and-supported-browsers) page to verify your environment.
</Note>

## 2. Verify Permissions Are Granted and the Extension Is Active on the Page

uBO Scope relies on specific browser permissions and active tab context to report network connections.

### Steps:

- When installing, you should have granted permissions such as `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`. Missing permissions prevent proper data collection.

- Visit the browser’s extension details page to confirm all listed permissions are granted.

- Make sure you are browsing on a site that uses network connections that uBO Scope can monitor (HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket protocols).

- Refresh the tab or open a new tab with a standard website (e.g., https://example.com) to trigger network activity.

### Troubleshooting:

- If you experience missing data in the popup (e.g., 'NO DATA' displayed or zero domains):
  - Reload the current page to allow uBO Scope to capture new requests.
  - Ensure no other extensions or privacy settings block webRequest API access.
  - Check browser settings to confirm that your privacy mode or security extensions don’t isolate or block network request monitoring.

## 3. Understanding Common Popup Issues and How to Fix Them

The popup interface summarizes network request outcomes in categories such as **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** domains.

### Symptoms and Resolutions:

| Issue | Description | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Popup Loads Without Data | Popup displays 'NO DATA' or empty domain lists even on active sites | - Ensure the page is fully loaded and generating network activity.
- Refresh tab or open a new tab.
- Verify extension is enabled and permissions granted.
| Badge Count Not Updating | Toolbar badge remains blank or stale despite active browsing | - Reload the affected tabs.
- Restart the browser to reset extension background processes.
| Icon Does Not Respond or Popup Fails to Open | Clicking the icon does nothing or displays a blank popup | - Restart the browser.
- Check for conflicting extensions that might block popup scripts.
- Clear browser cache or extension storage data.

<Warning>
If network requests are blocked at the network level (e.g., by VPN, DNS filtering, or external firewalls), uBO Scope will not report those as allowed or blocked, affecting displayed data.
</Warning>

## 4. Additional Diagnostic Steps

If issues persist after initial checks:

### 4.1 Reload or Reinstall the Extension

- Disable and re-enable the extension.
- Remove the extension and reinstall from official stores:
  - Chrome Web Store
  - Firefox Add-ons site
  - Safari Extensions

### 4.2 Clear Extension Storage Data

Corrupted or stale storage can cause inconsistent behavior.

- Use your browser’s developer tools or extensions page to clear extension data.
- Alternatively, uninstall and reinstall to start fresh.

### 4.3 Check Console Logs for Errors

- Open your browser’s developer tools > Console while clicking the extension icon or opening the popup.
- Look for permission errors, script loading failures, or message passing issues.
- Errors here often indicate missing permissions or conflicts.

### 4.4 Verify Browser Version Compatibility

Older browsers may lack necessary APIs or manifest features.

- Check your browser version meets the minimum requirements:
  - Chromium 122 or later (Chrome)
  - Firefox 128 or later
  - Safari 18.5 or later

## 5. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Installing from unverified sources:** Always use official browser stores or verified repositories.
- **Ignoring browser permissions:** The extension requires active permissions to access network request data.
- **Conflicts with other extensions:** Privacy or security extensions might interfere with uBO Scope’s listeners.
- **Using privacy modes that block extensions:** Some browsers’ private/incognito modes limit extension capabilities by default.

<Info>
You can configure extension permissions for incognito/private modes manually if needed.
