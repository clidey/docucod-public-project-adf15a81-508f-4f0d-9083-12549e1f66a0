# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

When starting with uBO Scope, some common challenges might prevent you from seeing the extension's expected behavior, such as the icon not appearing, missing permissions, or no data displaying in the popup. This guide empowers you to quickly diagnose and resolve these frequent setup mistakes so you can start monitoring third-party connections immediately.

---

## 1. Extension Icon Not Visible in Browser Toolbar

The uBO Scope icon is your primary access point to the extension’s popup panel and real-time connection data. If you do not see it, follow these steps:

### For Chromium-Based Browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave)
- Look for the Extensions puzzle icon in the toolbar.
- Click the puzzle icon, locate **uBO Scope** in the list.
- Click the pin icon next to it to keep it visible on the toolbar.

### For Firefox
- Click the menu button (three horizontal lines) > Add-ons and Themes.
- Find **uBO Scope**, click the "···" button and select "Show in Toolbar".

### For Safari
- Open Safari menu > Settings > Extensions.
- Ensure **uBO Scope** is enabled.
- If the icon is not visible, customize Safari’s toolbar to add the extension icon manually.

<Tip>
In some browsers, extensions may be hidden by default after installation. Pinning or enabling the icon ensures quick access and confirms the extension is active.
</Tip>

## 2. Missing or Insufficient Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions for full functionality: **activeTab**, **storage**, and **webRequest**. Without these, it cannot monitor network connections.

### Verify Permissions
- Go to your browser’s extension management page.
- Locate **uBO Scope** and check **Permissions** or **Site access**.
- Confirm that all the stated permissions are granted and that the extension has access to URLs matching `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` (and for Firefox, also WebSocket URLs `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*`).

### Resolving Permission Issues
- If permissions are missing, try disabling and re-enabling the extension.
- In some browsers, uninstalling and reinstalling the extension restores permissions.
- For browsers with strict permission prompts, grant permissions when asked during install or first use.

<Warning>
Without the `webRequest` permission, uBO Scope cannot track remote server connections effectively.
</Warning>

## 3. No Data Displayed in the Popup Panel

After clicking the extension icon, if the popup shows **"NO DATA"** or no domain information:

### Confirm Page Activity
- Reload the current webpage or navigate to a new site.
- uBO Scope detects connections per active tab; no site activity equals no data.

### Wait for Data Collection
- Network data collection occurs shortly after page load.
- Give the extension a few seconds to gather and process connections.

### Check Browser Compatibility
- The extension requires browsers that fully support the `webRequest` API.
- Confirm Chrome version 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+ is used.

### Refresh the Popup
- Close and reopen the popup after navigating to a page.
- Occasionally, browser UI bugs require toggling to refresh data display.

<Note>
The badge count on the toolbar icon reflects distinct third-party domains with successful connections. A zero badge may mean no network connections were made or none were classified as third-party.
</Note>

## 4. Extension Appears Disabled or Inactive

If uBO Scope seems installed but inactive:

- Confirm the extension is enabled in the browser’s extensions list.
- Check for conflicting extensions that might block or interfere with uBO Scope.
- Restart the browser to clear any temporary glitches.

## 5. Issues Specific to Browser Platform

### Safari
- Ensure Safari’s extension strict minimum version requirement of 18.5 or later is met.
- The background script runs as a module; verify no errors appear in Safari’s extension console.

### Firefox
- Confirm the extension ID and permissions match the manifest specification.
- Firefox enforces `strict_min_version` 128.0 or higher for compatibility.

### Chromium
- Minimum Chrome version required is 122.0.
- The service worker in background runs as a module; ensure no errors during startup.

## 6. Reinstalling or Resetting uBO Scope

If problems persist:

1. Remove the extension from your browser.
2. Restart the browser.
3. Reinstall uBO Scope from the official extension store for your browser:
   - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
   - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
4. Repeat setup verification steps.

## 7. When to Seek Further Help

- Persistent errors logged in the browser console related to `background.js` or messaging.
- Unexpected badge counts or popup states after prolonged usage.
- Compatibility issues on less common browser versions or operating systems.

In such cases, review the related documentation or seek assistance through the [GitHub repository Issues](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/issues).
