# Understanding the Popup and Badge

The uBO Scope extension provides instant visibility into the network connections your browser makes on a per-tab basis. This guide gives a detailed walkthrough of how to interpret the **popup window** and **toolbar badge**, helping you distinguish between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains at a glance.

---

## 1. Overview of the Popup UI and Toolbar Badge

When you click on the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar, the **popup window** opens. This popup presents a categorized summary of network connection outcomes for the active tab. Alongside, the **toolbar badge** visually quantifies distinct active connections in a concise numeric form.

### What the Toolbar Badge Shows

- The badge number represents the **count of unique third-party domains** that have successfully made network connections (i.e., not blocked).
- A **lower badge count** indicates less exposure to third-party servers — generally a sign of more effective content blocking or fewer external resources.

### Why This Matters

Unlike traditional block counters that tally blocked requests, the badge focuses on _allowed_ connections by distinct domains. This insight helps avoid the misleading assumption that more blocks necessarily mean better privacy.

---

## 2. Popup Sections Explained

The popup window divides network connection outcomes into three distinct sections:

### 2.1 Not Blocked

- **Label:** "not blocked"
- **Purpose:** Lists all domains from which connections were allowed to complete successfully.
- **Details Shown:** Each domain is displayed alongside a count of how many requests to that domain succeeded.

### 2.2 Stealth-Blocked

- **Label:** "stealth-blocked"
- **Purpose:** Shows domains where connections were silently redirected or blocked so stealthily that standard detection methods might not always notice.
- **Details Shown:** Domains and counts indicate how often stealth-blocking events occurred.

### 2.3 Blocked

- **Label:** "blocked"
- **Purpose:** Lists domains explicitly blocked due to errors or content blocker enforcement.
- **Details Shown:** Like the other sections, each blocked domain is listed with the number of failed connection attempts.

### How the Data Is Presented

Each domain entry uses:
- The **domain name**, decoded from punycode where applicable for internationalized domains.
- A **count badge** representing the number of connection attempts for that domain.

Under the hood, these lists are dynamically generated from the current tab’s network activity captured by uBO Scope.

## 3. Understanding Domain Connection Outcomes

uBO Scope tracks network requests at the browser level to identify precise outcomes:

| Outcome         | What It Means                              | How It Affects Badge & Popup                         |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Allowed         | Connection succeeded without interference| Included in "not blocked" popup section and counted in badge number.
| Stealth-Blocked | Connection redirected or silently blocked | Listed under "stealth-blocked". Not included in badge count.
| Blocked         | Connection blocked due to errors or filters| Listed under "blocked". Not included in badge count.

## 4. How to Use the Popup and Badge Together

### Step 1: Open the Popup

Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to reveal connection details scoped to the active tab.

### Step 2: Read the Badge Count

The badge number tells you how many distinct third-party domains your page connected to successfully — a key privacy metric.

### Step 3: Explore the Sections

- Review the **not blocked** section to see domains the page actually fetched resources from, revealing who is getting your data.
- Inspect the **stealth-blocked** section to understand which domains may have been silently redirected or blocked in less obvious ways.
- Check the **blocked** section to verify which domains connections were outright denied.

### Step 4: Identify Legitimate vs. Suspicious Connections

- Many connections to CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) and essential third parties appear in the "not blocked" section and might be required for a webpage to function.
- A large number of diverse domains in the "not blocked" list might indicate broader tracking or unwanted exposure.

---

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Keep an eye on the badge count:** A spike often means new third-party domains are loading, potentially indicating increased tracking.
- **Use the popup to audit:** Regularly check domains to identify unfamiliar or suspicious third parties.
- **Refresh pages:** The popup updates dynamically; reload a page to see updated outcomes.
- **Combine with your content blocker settings:** Use uBO Scope’s insights to fine-tune filters and block lists.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Popup and Badge Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or 'NO DATA'">
This can happen if the active tab has no network activity captured yet or uBO Scope hasn’t finished loading data.

**Solution:**
- Ensure the tab is fully loaded.
- Close and reopen the popup.
- Verify that uBO Scope has proper permissions.
- Check if the webpage actually makes network requests.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Match Expected Blocks">
Remember the badge counts only **allowed** third-party domains, not number of blocking events.

**Solution:**
- Use the popup sections to confirm which domains were actually blocked or stealth-blocked.
- Understand that a blocker with a high block count may still allow many third-party connections.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Domain Names Show as Punycode or Encoded">
Domains from internationalized URLs may appear in punycode (e.g., `xn--`).

**Solution:**
- The popup automatically converts punycode to human-readable Unicode to aid comprehension.
- If you encounter unexpected characters, update uBO Scope to the latest version.
</Accordion>

## 7. Summary

The uBO Scope popup and toolbar badge are your intuitive, real-time windows into your browser’s network activity on a per-tab basis. By clearly displaying allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains, you gain actionable insight into who is connecting with your browser and how effectively connections are controlled.

Use them together to audit exposure, spot unusual activity, and make informed privacy choices.

## Appendix: Relevant Screenshot Example

```
Tab Hostname: example.com

Summary:
Domains connected: 5

not blocked
- cdn.example.net 3
- ads.tracker.org 2

stealth-blocked
- stealth.badguy.com 1

blocked
- blocked.badguy.com 4
```

This reflects 5 distinct third-party domains successfully connected and shown as 5 in the toolbar badge.
