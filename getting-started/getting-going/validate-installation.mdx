# Quick Validation & First Use

This guide helps you verify that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browser's network connections after installation. You'll learn how to access the extension's popup UI and interpret key indicators like the toolbar badge and domain statistics during your first visit to a website.

---

## 1. Confirm uBO Scope is Monitoring Network Connections

After installing uBO Scope, verifying that it is correctly tracking connections is essential to ensure you get accurate, real-time insights.

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

- Look for the uBO Scope icon (a shield with a connected nodes symbol) in your browser's toolbar.
- If it's hidden behind a menu or extension drawer, pin it to your toolbar for easy access.

### Step 2: Validate the Extension is Enabled and Ready

- Click the icon to open the popup panel (described in the next section).
- If the panel loads and displays connection data after visiting a site, the extension is active.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the icon, ensure your browser version meets the system requirements: Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+. See [System Requirements](https://example.com/getting-started/installation-setup/system-requirements) for details.
</Tip>

## 2. Accessing and Understanding the Popup UI

The popup UI shows detailed statistics about network connections for the currently active browser tab. Here’s how to use and interpret it:

### Opening the Popup Panel

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
2. The popup panel will appear, showing the hostname of the visited site and a summary of connected domains.

### Reading the Main Badge and Domain Statistics

- The **main badge count** on the browser toolbar icon indicates the number of **distinct third-party remote domains** that successfully connected.
- Within the popup, you'll see three categorized lists:
  - **Not blocked:** Domains to which allowed connections were made.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where redirects or obfuscated blocking occurred.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were error-blocked.
- Each domain entry also displays the count of requests made to that domain during the visit.

<Note>
The badge count counts distinct third-party domains successfully contacted and is a critical measure of network activity. A lower count means fewer third-party connections.
</Note>

### Example Scenario

- You visit example.com.
- The popup shows "domains connected: 5" and lists domains under each category.
- The badge on the toolbar reads "5," matching the count of allowed (not blocked) domains.

This confirms uBO Scope is actively monitoring and reporting your network connections.

## 3. Step-by-Step: Verify with a Fresh Site Visit

Follow this quick user flow to confirm everything works smoothly:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Browser Tab">
Open a new or existing browser tab and navigate to a website you have not visited recently.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the uBO Scope Icon">
Click the extension icon in the toolbar to open the popup panel.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Hostname and Badge Count">
Check that the panel’s hostname matches the site and that the badge count shows a non-zero number reflecting connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Domain Lists">
Look through the "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" domain lists to review network connection outcomes.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Badge Count Matches Popup Domain Count">
Verify that the toolbar badge and listed allowed domains count correspond closely for accuracy.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or empty domain lists immediately after visiting a site, try refreshing the tab as network requests may still be initializing.
</Tip>

## 4. Interpreting the Toolbar Badge and Popup Indicator

- **Badge Count Meaning:** Shows the count of distinct third-party domains with allowed network connections.
- **Popup Summary:** Offers details on connection outcomes that the badge count alone cannot convey.

This two-level feedback lets you quickly estimate network activity (via badge) and dive deeper (via popup) when needed.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Quick Validation">
<Accordion title="No Toolbar Icon Visible">
- Ensure the extension is installed and enabled from the browser’s extension management page.
- Pin the icon to the toolbar if hidden.
- Confirm the browser version meets minimum compatibility.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA'">
- Reload the tab after navigation to let uBO Scope capture connections.
- Make sure no conflicting extensions block access to network info.
- Check that the extension has the required permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Remains Zero on Active Sites">
- Verify you are visiting sites with third-party connections.
- Disable other content blockers temporarily to verify data flow.
- Restart the browser to reset session data and extension state.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. What’s Next?

After confirming uBO Scope is actively monitoring:
