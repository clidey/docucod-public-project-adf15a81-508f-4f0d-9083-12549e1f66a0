# Basic Configuration

Customize uBO Scope to fit your daily workflow and extract the most relevant insights from your browsing sessions. This guide walks you through the popup user interface, explains how to interpret the connection data, and clarifies key configuration concepts essential for both everyday users and filter list maintainers.

## Understanding the Popup Interface

When you open uBO Scope by clicking its toolbar icon, the popup presents a clear overview of remote network connections made by the active browser tab. The layout is divided into distinct sections, each indicating connection outcomes that help you understand how third-party domains interact with your browsing activity.

### Popup Layout Overview

- **Tab Hostname Header:** Displays the hostname of the current tab's main frame domain. This identifies the website context for which the connection data applies.

- **Summary Section:** Shows the distinct count of third-party domains contacted that were allowed (i.e., not blocked).

- **Outcome Sections:** There are three categories, each with its own header and list of domains:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains that the browser successfully connected to without interference.
  - **Stealth-Blocked (Stealth):** Domains where connections were blocked stealthily, meaning blocked in a way intended to minimize detection.
  - **Blocked:** Domains for which network requests were explicitly blocked or failed.

Each domain is shown alongside a badge indicating the number of connection attempts recorded during the browsing session.

## What Each Configuration Outcome Means

Understanding these outcomes is key to interpreting what uBO Scope reports:

| Outcome        | Meaning                                                                                                             |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Allowed**    | The browser made successful connections to these third-party domains. These count towards the badge number on the toolbar icon, representing active third parties your browser contacted. |
| **Stealth**    | Connections to these domains were blocked stealthily. This means the extension or content blocker prevented access in a way that attempts to avoid detection by the webpage. Useful for maintainers verifying stealth blocking behavior. |
| **Blocked**    | These domains represent network requests that were outright blocked or resulted in errors. This is an explicit block usually caused by your content blocker or network environment. |

## How to Use This Configuration Effectively

### For Everyday Users

- **Monitor privacy exposure:** Focus on the "Not Blocked" section to see which third-party domains your browser truly connects to. Fewer allowed domains generally indicate higher privacy.
- **Understand stealth blocking:** The "Stealth-Blocked" list helps you know what your blockers are silently handling.
- **Detect possible issues:** If domains you expect to be blocked show in "Allowed," it might indicate a blocker misconfiguration or a new third-party service.

### For Filter List Maintainers

- **Validate stealth behavior:** Use stealth-blocked data to confirm how filters are applied silently across domains.
- **Diagnose blocking gaps:** Blocked domains help identify explicitly caught requests, while allowed domains point to potential holes in filter lists.
- **Track third-party domains:** Use the badge count and detailed domain lists to monitor evolving third-party domains contacting websites.

## Practical Walkthrough: Reading the Popup

1. **Open the Popup:** Click the uBO Scope icon next to your browser's address bar.

2. **Identify Current Website:** The top of the popup shows the hostname of the website currently active in your browser tab.

3. **Check Total Connected Domains:** The "domains connected" summary tells you how many distinct allowed third-party domains were contacted.

4. **Review Allowed Domains:** Expand the "not blocked" section to see these domains and their request counts.

5. **Investigate Stealth-blocked Domains:** Check "stealth-blocked" to see which connections are blocked subtly.

6. **Review Explicitly Blocked Domains:** Examine the "blocked" section for domains with explicit blocks or errors.

7. **Interpret Counts:** Higher counts on a domain indicate more frequent connection attempts within the session.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Refresh the Popup Regularly:** The list updates with each network event. Reopening or refreshing the popup ensures you see the latest results.

- **Use Alongside Content Blockers:** uBO Scope complements ad blockers by providing visibility into third-party connections but does not itself block content.

- **Avoid Misreading Badge Counts:** Remember, the toolbar badge reflects distinct allowed third-party domains, *not* total blocked requests.

- **Consider Multiple Sites:** To fully understand your network exposure, check multiple sites and compare their connection profiles.

- **Leverage Domain Counts:** High counts on suspicious third-party domains might warrant further investigation.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Confusing Blocked Counts:** Don't confuse the "blocked" section with the toolbar badge count. Blocked connections are not included in that badge.

- **Ignoring Stealth Blocks:** Some users may overlook stealth-blocked domains; these are crucial for understanding invisible blocking impact.

- **Assuming No Allowed = No Connections:** If the "not blocked" list is empty, there may be no active third-party connections, or network requests might not be captured due to browser limitations.

- **Forgetting Unicode Domains:** The popup displays punycode-encoded domains converted back to Unicode for readability. Occasionally unusual characters may appear for internationalized domains.

---

## Troubleshooting Configuration Views

If the popup shows "NO DATA" or unexpected empty sections:

- **Verify active tab:** uBO Scope only reports for the currently focused browser tab.

- **Check browser permissions:** Ensure uBO Scope has required permissions (`webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab`).

- **Reload the page:** Network requests initialize on page load; refreshing triggers new data.

- **Restart the browser:** If data does not update, a browser restart can reinitialize extension behavior.

- **Review conflicts:** Conflicting extensions might interfere with network monitoring; disable other blockers for testing.

## Summary

The Basic Configuration page equips you with the knowledge needed to confidently interpret uBO Scope’s popup interface and leverage its output for privacy insights, filter list validation, and troubleshooting. Understanding how allowed, stealth, and blocked domains are categorized empowers you to make informed decisions about your browser’s network behavior and content blocking efficacy.

#### Example: Interpreting a Domain Row

| Domain                 | Count | Interpretation                          |
|------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------|
| `cdn.example.com`       | 15    | Browser made 15 successful connections to this CDN domain |
| `ads.tracker.net`       | 1     | 1 stealth-blocked connection attempt detected, blocked silently |
| `blockeddomain.example` | 3     | 3 explicit blocked requests recorded |

By routinely checking these, you gain a clear window into the hidden third-party network activity behind websites you visit.
