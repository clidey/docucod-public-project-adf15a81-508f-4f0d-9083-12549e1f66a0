# Troubleshooting Setup Issues

This guide addresses common problems you may encounter when installing or first using uBO Scope, such as the extension popup not appearing, the badge count not updating, or no data showing in the interface. It offers practical, step-by-step advice to resolve these issues, empowering you to verify your setup and maximize uBO Scope’s visibility into your browser’s third-party connections.

---

## 1. Common Symptoms and Their Causes

### Popup Not Appearing
- The extension icon is missing or clicking it does not open the popup.
- The browser may have blocked the extension, or permissions are incomplete.
- In some browsers, extensions don’t automatically show in the toolbar until configured.

### Badge Not Updating
- The count on the toolbar icon remains blank or stagnant despite browsing activity.
- This usually indicates the extension is not receiving network events.
- May relate to missing or insufficient permissions, incompatible browser version, or network request API limitations.

### No Data Displayed in Popup
- Popup shows “NO DATA” or empty lists.
- Data collection or session tracking may have failed.
- Could be a consequence of extension background process issues or browser-specific restrictions.

## 2. Key Troubleshooting Steps

Follow this flow to diagnose and fix setup problems.

### Step 1: Verify Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope supports these browsers and versions:

- **Chromium-based browsers**: Version 122 or higher
- **Firefox**: Version 128 or higher
- **Safari**: Version 18.5 or higher

Ensure your browser is up-to-date to meet these requirements.

### Step 2: Confirm Permissions Are Granted

The extension requires these permissions to function correctly:

- `webRequest`: Allows monitoring of network requests.
- `activeTab`: Access to the currently active browser tab.
- `storage`: To save data locally.

#### How to Check:
- In your browser's extensions/settings page, find uBO Scope and verify permissions.
- Re-enable missing permissions or reinstall if necessary.

<Tip>
Browsers may restrict the `webRequest` permission for security or performance reasons. If your browser disables or limits this permission, uBO Scope will not report connections correctly.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Inspect Extension Icon and Popup Behavior

- Confirm the uBO Scope icon is visible on the toolbar.
- If not, open your browser's extension management page and enable "Show in Toolbar" or similar.
- Click the icon — the popup must open, showing connection data or loading state.

If the popup does not appear:
- Try restarting the browser.
- Remove and reinstall the extension.
- Check browser console logs for extension errors (Developer Tools > Console).

### Step 4: Validate Network Monitoring

The extension relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API to observe HTTP(S) and WebSocket connections.

- Some browsers limit `webRequest` for privacy or security reasons (e.g., on mobile versions).
- Network requests initiated outside `webRequest` events (e.g., native apps, some browser internals) are not reported.

Use these tests:
1. **Open several websites** known to load third-party content (news sites, e-commerce).
2. **Check if the popup lists domains** and the badge count updates.
3. **If no data, double-check permissions and browser version.**

### Step 5: Clear Extension Storage

Corrupted or stale session data can block updates.

- Go to your browser's extension storage or use the extension UI if available.
- Clear data for uBO Scope.
- Restart the browser and reload tabs.

### Step 6: Review Known Limitations

- uBO Scope cannot observe requests made outside the `webRequest` API’s scope; this limitation is inherent and not a bug.
- Some browsers may restrict access to socket or WebSocket requests, impeding full reporting.
- Content blockers using DNS-level blocking may prevent observation of certain events, but uBO Scope reports what the browser reports.

## 3. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Always install uBO Scope from official stores or trusted sources for updated, compatible versions.
- Use browsers meeting or exceeding minimum version requirements for best support.
- Regularly update your browser and extensions.
- After installation, immediately verify operation using the popup and badge count.
- Avoid mixing multiple extensions that interfere with network request APIs.
- Keep an eye on browser release notes regarding extensions and `webRequest` API changes.

## 4. Verifying Setup Success

Once troubleshooted, validate your setup as follows:

1. Open a new browser tab and visit a website with diverse third-party content.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
3. Confirm the popup displays a hostname and domain, with lists under "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," or "blocked."
4. Check that the badge on the toolbar icon shows a nonzero count reflecting distinct third-party domains.

<Tip>
If the badge shows a count and the popup displays domain data, uBO Scope is monitoring successfully.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Fixes">
<Accordion title="Popup Not Showing After Installation">
- Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser
- Pin the extension icon to the toolbar if hidden
- Restart your browser to apply changes
- Check for any browser updates that may affect extension visibility
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Remains Empty">
- Verify `webRequest` permission is granted
- Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements
- Clear extension storage to reset stale data
- Visit high-traffic websites to trigger network events
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows ‘NO DATA’ Message">
- Refresh the active tab and try opening the popup again
- Confirm that the tab is fully loaded and not in a background state
- If using private or incognito mode, ensure uBO Scope is enabled there
- Try visiting multiple sites to ensure data collection
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="You See Partial or Missing Domains in Popup">
- Check for any conflicting extensions that block network information
- Review browser’s extension settings or privacy protections affecting data
- Understand that requests outside the `webRequest` API scope won’t be reflected
</Accordion>
