# System and Browser Requirements for uBO Scope

Understanding the system and browser requirements is critical to ensuring that uBO Scope functions correctly. This page details the supported browsers, minimum requirements, and specific limitations to be aware of related to the browser APIs the extension uses.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is built to work as a browser extension and supports the following browsers:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge)
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Apple Safari**

Each browser requires a recent version to support the WebExtensions APIs needed by uBO Scope.

### Browser Version Requirements

| Browser    | Minimum Version | Notes                                       |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Chromium   | 122.0+          | Minimum Chrome version 122 or newer          |
| Firefox    | 128.0+          | Requires Firefox 128 or higher (desktop and Android) |
| Safari     | 18.5+           | Requires Safari 18.5 or newer                 |

> These version constraints ensure full compatibility with Manifest V3 and required WebExtensions APIs such as `webRequest`.

### Installation Sources

- **Chromium**: Installed from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- **Firefox**: Installed from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- **Safari**: Installed via Apple’s Safari Extensions Gallery or your developer package


## 2. System Requirements

uBO Scope is lightweight but depends on your system's ability to run the supported browsers. The following are recommended minimal system specifications for an optimal experience:

- **Operating System:** Any that supports the above browser versions (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS for Safari)
- **Memory:** 2 GB RAM minimum; 4+ GB recommended when multitasking
- **Disk Space:** Minimal additional space required for the extension (under 50 MB total storage by browser)
- **Network:** Active internet connection for browsing and network request monitoring


## 3. Browser API and Permissions Limitations

uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API to observe network connections. This API is essential for capturing outgoing and incoming network requests in real time.

### Important Considerations:

- **Network Requests Visibility:**
  - uBO Scope reports network requests visible to the browser's WebRequest API.
  - Requests outside this API (e.g., some DNS-level blocks or native apps) are not captured.
- **Host Permissions:**
  - The extension requires host permissions for all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS schemes.
  - Permissions are explicitly defined in each browser manifest.

### Manifest Permissions Breakdown

| Browser   | Host Permissions                | Other Permissions                     |
|-----------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Chromium | `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, `ws://*/*` | `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest` |
| Firefox  | `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, `ws://*/*` | `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest` |
| Safari   | `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`   | `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest` |

_Note: Safari currently does not support WebSocket (`ws://` & `wss://`) host permissions, limiting the ability to monitor WebSocket connections fully._


## 4. Performance & Security Notes

- **Efficient Resource Usage:** uBO Scope is designed to run efficiently alongside your browser without noticeable performance impact.
- **Session and Data Storage:** It uses browser `storage.session` and `storage.local` APIs to persist network data temporarily and across sessions.
- **Security:** The extension declares minimal required permissions, adhering to best practices. It does not collect or transmit personal data.


## 5. Summary of Limitations to Expect

- Network connections not routed through the browser's WebRequest API will be invisible to uBO Scope.
- Some newer browser API limitations, especially in Safari, can limit full visibility (e.g., WebSocket monitoring).
- The minimum version constraints require users to keep their browsers reasonably up-to-date.


## 6. How to Verify Your System and Browser Compatibility

Follow these steps to confirm that your setup meets uBO Scope's requirements:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Your Browser Version">
- Open your browser’s About page:
  - **Chrome/Chromium:** `chrome://settings/help`
  - **Firefox:** `about:support`
  - **Safari:** `Safari > About Safari`
- Ensure the version number meets or exceeds the required minimum.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Extension Installation Source">
- Install uBO Scope only from the official store links to ensure authenticity and up-to-date versions.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Permissions">
- After installation, click the extension icon, go to "Manage Extensions" and verify the permissions match those specified above.
</Step>
<Step title="Test Network Monitoring">
- Visit a website, then click uBO Scope’s toolbar icon.
- Confirm you see badges and domain information updating as network requests are made.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 7. Troubleshooting Common System and Browser Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with System and Browser Requirements">
<Accordion title="I don't see any network data in the popup">
- Ensure your browser version meets the minimum version required.
- Verify that uBO Scope has all its permissions granted.
- Check that content blockers or privacy settings are not blocking WebRequest API events.
- Restart the browser after installation to initialize the extension fully.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I have the right browser, but WebSocket requests aren't visible">
- Safari currently does not fully support WebSocket monitoring for extensions.
- Chromium and Firefox support WebSocket monitoring if the extension has WebSocket host permissions.
- Confirm you are using the latest version of uBO Scope, and the browser is updated.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The badge count seems unexpectedly low or high">
- Understand that the badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains with network connections.
- A low count indicates fewer third-party network connections, which is typically more desirable.
- Remember uBO Scope measures outcome at the network request level, independent of content blocker backend.
