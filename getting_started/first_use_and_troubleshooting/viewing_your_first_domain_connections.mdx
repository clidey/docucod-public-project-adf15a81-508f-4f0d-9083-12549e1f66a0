# Viewing Your First Domain Connections

Experience your first insight into the remote servers your browser connects to as you navigate to any website. This guide walks you through using the uBO Scope popup and badge count to reveal and interpret all third-party network connections, enhancing your understanding of browser privacy and content blocking.

---

## 1. Prerequisites Before You Begin

Before viewing domain connections, ensure:

- **uBO Scope Extension is Installed and Enabled:** Follow the installation steps for your browser as described in [Installing on Your Browser](/getting_started/installation_and_setup/installing_on_your_browser).
- **Browser is Running an Active Tab with a Website Loaded:** The extension tracks network connections for the active tab only.
- **You Have Network Connectivity:** The extension relies on real network events to report connections.

<Tip>
If you haven’t verified the extension is correctly installed and active, visit the [First Launch & Extension Check](/getting_started/installation_and_setup/first_launch_and_activation) guide first.
</Tip>

## 2. How to Open the uBO Scope Popup

The popup is your window into the network activity for the current browser tab.

1. Locate the uBO Scope extension icon on your browser toolbar. It typically appears as a small badge-enabled icon labeled 'uBO Scope'.
2. Click the icon to open the popup panel.

Upon opening, the popup displays information about the tab’s domain and the third-party remote servers contacted.

## 3. Understanding the Badge Counter on the Toolbar Icon

- The badge number shows the **count of distinct third-party domains your browser successfully connected to from the current tab.**
- A lower count generally means fewer external connections, which often equates to higher privacy.

Watch as this number updates dynamically when:
- You navigate to a new site.
- The current page loads additional network requests.

If the badge is empty, no third-party remote servers were successfully connected to yet.

<Tip>
The badge does not count blocked or stealth-blocked domains — only those connections that were allowed.
</Tip>

## 4. Exploring the Popup UI Sections

The popup UI categorizes domains and counts to help you quickly assess network activity:

### a. Tab Domain Display
- The top header shows the current tab's hostname and domain.
- Unicode and internationalized domain names are displayed correctly using punycode decoding.

### b. Domains Connected Summary
- The total number of distinct third-party domains connected from this tab.

### c. Outcome Categories Breakdown

| Category           | Description                                                                 | What You See in the Popup                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**    | Domains successfully contacted without interference.                         | Domain names with counts of resource requests allowed.     |
| **Stealth-Blocked**| Domains where connections were attempted but stealth-blocked by content blockers or other mechanisms. | Domain names with counts; these connections were intentionally hidden. |
| **Blocked**        | Domains for which connection attempts failed due to blocking rules or errors.| Domain names with counts reported as blocked requests.     |

Each domain row shows the domain name and the number of network requests associated.

## 5. Step-by-Step: Viewing Your First Domain Connections

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to a Website">
Open a new tab and load any website you want to investigate. For example, visit https://example.com.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click on the uBO Scope icon next to your browser’s address bar to reveal the popup panel.
</Step>
<Step title="Read the Tab Domain Header">
Confirm the pop-up shows the domain and hostname of the active tab at the top.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Connected Domains">
Look at the “not blocked” section to see all distinct third-party domains contacted.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Stealth-Blocked and Blocked Details">
Explore the stealth-blocked and blocked sections to understand which domains were subject to content-blocking.
</Step>
<Step title="Notice the Badge Counter Updates">
See the badge on the extension icon reflect the count of allowed third-party domains dynamically.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Interpreting the Data for Your Privacy and Content Blocking

- **Allowed Domains** represent servers your browser connected to without obstruction, which may include CDNs and advertising networks.
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains** are connections hidden or deliberately blocked by content blockers, preventing tracking or unwanted content loading.
- **Blocked Domains** are outright denied connections due to filters or errors.

Understanding these categories helps you gauge the effectiveness of your content blockers and the privacy posture of visited websites.

## 7. Best Practices and Tips

- Refresh the popup by closing and reopening it when navigating to new pages to see updated data.
- Use this tool regularly to understand which third parties are active on websites you frequent.
- Combine insights with other uBO Scope guides to deepen your knowledge about network requests and privacy.

<Note>
The popup data updates only for the active tab. Switch tabs and reopen the popup to view corresponding domain connections.
</Note>

## 8. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Viewing Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or 'NO DATA'">
- Ensure you have navigated to a valid webpage (not blank).
- Verify uBO Scope is enabled and working by checking the extension’s badge and other tabs.
- Try refreshing the page and reopening the popup.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Counter Does Not Update">
- Verify your browser supports the `webRequest` API and that permissions are granted.
- Check other network-related extensions which might interfere.
- Follow the setup verification steps in [First Launch & Extension Check](/getting_started/installation_and_setup/first_launch_and_activation).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Empty Sections in Popup">
- Some websites load resources dynamically; wait a few seconds for the popup to update.
- Reload the page to trigger more network requests.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 9. Next Steps

- Proceed to [Solving Common Installation & Setup Issues](/getting_started/first_use_and_troubleshooting/solving_common_issues) if you run into problems.
- Learn how to [Interpret the Numbers in the Popup](/guides/analyzing-traffic/interpreting-popup) to get more from the data.
- For broader understanding, review the [Key Concepts & Terminology](/overview/architecture-and-concepts/core-terms).

## Summary
By opening the uBO Scope popup, you directly see third-party remote servers your browser connects to for the active tab. The badge count and categorized domain lists give a transparent look at allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections, empowering you to assess privacy and content blocking effectiveness quickly and clearly.

## Example Screenshot

Although screenshots cannot be included in this text format, imagine the popup showing:

- Header: example.com
- Badge: "5"
- Sections listing 5 allowed third-party domains such as cdn.example.net, and fewer stealth-blocked or blocked domains.

Your browsing privacy journey starts here with immediate and actionable visibility.
