# Quick Validation Checklist

Before diving deeper into uBO Scope, it’s essential to confirm that the extension is actively recording network events and reporting domain connections accurately. This checklist provides practical steps to quickly verify that uBO Scope is functioning correctly and delivering the reliable insights it promises.

---

## 1. Confirm Extension Installation and Activation

1. **Locate the uBO Scope Extension Icon:**
   - In your browser’s toolbar, look for the uBO Scope icon. It uses the uBlock Origin Scope branding.
   - If the icon is missing, verify installation via your browser’s extensions/add-ons page.

2. **Verify Extension is Enabled:**
   - Ensure uBO Scope is toggled ON.
   - Check for any browser messages about permissions or disabled extensions.

3. **Open the Popup Interface:**
   - Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
   - The popup should display the current active tab’s hostname and summary.

<Check>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or remains blank persistently, the extension might not be recording events properly.
</Check>

---

## 2. Validate Badge Count on the Toolbar Icon

- The badge number reflects the count of distinct third-party remote domains contacted by the active browser tab.
- Load a website that you know initiates third-party requests (e.g., a popular news site).
- Observe the badge:
  - A non-zero count indicates active tracking.
  - If blank, uBO Scope may not have data or the site has no third-party connections.

<Info>
Remember: A *lower* badge count means fewer third-party connections, which is typically better for privacy.
</Info>

## 3. Inspect Popup Data Details

Once the popup opens:

- **Hostname Display:** The top heading shows the active tab’s hostname 
- **Domains Connected Summary:** Displays the number of distinct domains (third parties) connected.
- **Outcome Sections:** It categorizes domains under:
  - `not blocked` (allowed)
  - `stealth-blocked` (redirects and stealth blocking events)
  - `blocked`

Scroll through the domain lists to confirm that connections are reported realistically.

<Note>
Stealth-blocked means requests that were redirected or blocked invisibly.
</Note>

## 4. Perform a Simple Test to Generate Network Events

1. Open a website with known external resources (e.g., a major news site or social network).
2. Open the uBO Scope popup and observe the domain count and the listed domains.
3. Navigate to another website and watch for the popup data to update accordingly.

<Warning>
If no domains appear after visiting multiple sites, recheck permissions and ensure your browser supports the required `webRequest` API for uBO Scope.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Popup shows NO DATA:**
  - Refresh the active tab.
  - Close and reopen the popup.
  - Reload your browser.

- **No badge count:**
  - Verify that background scripts are running (some browsers might suspend inactive extensions).
  - Check browser compatibility and minimum version requirements.

- **Domains list doesn't update on tab change:**
  - Click the uBO Scope icon after switching tabs to force refresh.
  - Ensure session data is properly loaded in the background (may need a browser restart).

---

## 6. Confirm Permissions and Browser Compatibility

- uBO Scope requires permissions for `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` to work.
- Supported on recent versions of Chromium-based browsers, Firefox (version 128+), and Safari (version 18.5+).
- Ensure these permissions have been granted by checking your browser’s extension details.

## 7. Next Steps After Validation

- If all checks pass, proceed to explore *[Viewing Your First Domain Connections](https://yourdocs.url/getting_started/first_use_and_troubleshooting/viewing_your_first_domain_connections)* to learn how to interpret data.
- For any unresolved issues, review *[Solving Common Installation & Setup Issues](https://yourdocs.url/getting_started/first_use_and_troubleshooting/solving_common_issues)*.
- Use the popup and badge counts regularly to gain transparency into websites’ third-party network activities.

---

## Appendix: Understanding Key Terms

- **Allowed Domains:** Third-party domains from which requests succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains:** Domains with requests redirected or invisibly blocked.
- **Blocked Domains:** Domains with requests explicitly blocked due to errors or by other blockers.
