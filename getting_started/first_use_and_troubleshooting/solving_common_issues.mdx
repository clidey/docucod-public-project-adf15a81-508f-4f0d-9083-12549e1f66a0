# Solving Common Installation & Setup Issues

If uBO Scope isn’t working as expected—such as the toolbar badge not appearing, the popup showing errors, or no network data being displayed—this guide walks you through the most frequent problems and how to resolve them. Follow these practical steps to verify your setup and get uBO Scope running smoothly on your browser.

---

## 1. Verify Extension Installation and Activation

First, confirm that uBO Scope is installed and enabled correctly.

### Steps:

1. **Locate the uBO Scope Icon:**
   - Check the browser toolbar for the uBO Scope icon (a small shield with a badge).
   - On Chromium and Firefox, you may need to click the extensions menu (puzzle piece icon) if not pinned.
   
2. **Confirm the Extension is Enabled:**
   - In your browser’s extensions page, ensure uBO Scope is enabled and allowed to run on all sites.

3. **Check the Toolbar Badge:**
   - The badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected by the active tab.
   - If the badge is missing or empty, it may indicate no connections or an installation issue.

4. **Open the Popup:**
   - Click the uBO Scope icon to open its popup.
   - The popup should display data about domains connected by the current tab.

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- If the extension icon is missing, reinstall uBO Scope using the official browser store links in the [Installing on Your Browser](getting_started/installation_and_setup/installing_on_your_browser) guide.
- If the badge never updates, see the permissions section below.

## 2. Ensure Required Permissions are Granted

uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions to monitor network requests and show accurate data.

### Required Permissions:
- **activeTab:** Access to get the current active tab details.
- **webRequest:** To observe network requests.
- **storage:** To store session data.

### How to Verify:
- Navigate to your browser’s extensions manager.
- Under uBO Scope, look for granted permissions.
- Make sure permissions for ``webRequest`` and ``activeTab`` are present.

<Tip>
Without the appropriate permissions, uBO Scope cannot track connections or update the badge count.
</Tip>

### Granting Permissions Manually:
- Some browsers might require explicit permission prompts.
- Refresh the browser or disable and re-enable the extension to trigger permission requests.

## 3. Confirm Browser Compatibility and Version

uBO Scope targets modern browsers that support the necessary APIs.

### Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions:
- **Chromium-based Browsers:** Version 122.0 and above
- **Firefox:** Version 128.0 and above
- **Safari:** Version 18.5 and above

### How to Check:
- Open your browser's "About" page to view current version.
- Update the browser if it's older than the listed version.

<Warning>
Attempting to use uBO Scope on unsupported or outdated browser versions will cause malfunction or no data collection.
</Warning>

## 4. Troubleshoot Common Popup and Badge Issues

### Case: Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Empty

**Cause:** The extension has not received any network data for the active tab or session data failed to load.

#### Solutions:
- Reload the active webpage to generate fresh network activity.
- Switch to a different tab and back to force the extension to refresh data.
- Disable other extensions that might conflict with uBO Scope (especially other network blockers or privacy tools).

### Case: Badge Count Does Not Update

**Cause:** Possible caching issue, session corruption, or permission restrictions.

#### Solutions:
- Close and reopen the browser.
- Clear the browser’s extension storage data (some browsers allow clearing extension cache).
- In some cases, uninstall and reinstall the extension.

## 5. Platform-Specific Tips

### Chromium-Based Browsers
- Ensure `chrome://extensions/` shows uBO Scope with all permissions enabled.
- WebRequest API requires running in Manifest V3 service worker context; ensure no service worker errors.

### Firefox
- Some Firefox releases enforce stricter extension API permissions; ensure using Firefox 128 or later.
- Check about:debugging for extension logs and errors.

### Safari
- Safari requires version 18.5 or later.
- Ensure uBO Scope is allowed in Safari preferences and has network access permissions.

---

## 6. Review Network and Privacy Settings

- Some privacy or security software, VPNs, or firewall rules can block browser extensions’ access to network events.
- Strict DNS or proxy settings may prevent the extension from seeing network requests in the browser.

<Tip>
Temporarily disable such tools or add exceptions for your browser to test if uBO Scope functions correctly.
</Tip>

## 7. Clear and Reset Extension Data

If you suspect corrupted or stale session data:

### Steps:

1. Open your browser’s extension storage settings or use developer tools where available.
2. Clear local and session storage for uBO Scope.
3. Reload the browser and extension.

<Warning>
This will clear all collected session data, but it will not affect your browsing data.
</Warning>

## 8. When to Seek Further Help

- Consult the [Viewing Your First Domain Connections](getting_started/first_use_and_troubleshooting/viewing_your_first_domain_connections) guide to validate real-time data usage.
- Review [Prerequisites & System Requirements](getting_started/installation_and_setup/prerequisites_and_requirements) to confirm environment compatibility.
