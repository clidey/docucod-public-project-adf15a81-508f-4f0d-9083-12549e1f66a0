# Troubleshooting Common Issues

When using uBO Scope, you may occasionally encounter problems such as missing badge counts, an empty popup, or no reported connections despite network activity. This guide provides step-by-step instructions and practical advice to diagnose and resolve these common issues so you can restore full visibility into your browser's remote server connections.

---

## 1. Ensure Browser Compatibility and Version Requirements

uBO Scope requires a minimum browser version to function properly due to its use of modern APIs:

- **Chromium-based browsers:** Version 122 or higher
- **Firefox:** Version 128 or higher
- **Safari:** Version 18.5 or higher

### How to Check:

- Open your browser settings or `about:` page to verify your current version.
- Update your browser to meet or exceed these minimum versions.

<Tip>
Using outdated browsers can prevent uBO Scope from correctly intercepting network requests, leading to empty or inaccurate data.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Verify Extension Permissions and Settings

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to observe network requests accurately:

- **Permissions:** `activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`
- **Host permissions:** Access to `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` URLs (plus WebSocket URLs on Chromium and Firefox).

### What to Do:

- Open your browser's extensions or add-ons management page.
- Confirm that uBO Scope is enabled and has requested permissions granted.
- If you recently declined permissions, you need to re-enable or reinstall the extension to reset these permissions.

<Warning>
Lack of proper permissions blocks the extension from capturing network events, causing no badge updates or data display.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Check Browser Network Request Reporting

uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor connections. Some scenarios can prevent it from seeing requests:

- **Incognito / Private Mode:** Extension might be disabled here by default.
- **Certain Browser Configurations:** Privacy settings or other extensions may block `webRequest` API reporting.

### Steps:

- Open a regular browsing window (non-incognito/private).
- Ensure no conflicting extensions are blocking or restricting uBO Scope.
- Disable other content blockers temporarily to isolate the issue.

<Note>
For Safari, the extension uses a background script; ensure it is running and not disabled.
</Note>

## 4. Reload the Extension and Browser Tab

Sometimes, temporary glitches cause missing data or badge counts.

Follow these steps:

1. **Reload the extension:**
   - In your browser's extensions page, toggle uBO Scope off and on again.
   - Alternatively, remove and reinstall the extension.
2. **Refresh the active tab:**
   - After reloading the extension, refresh the webpage you want to observe.
   - This triggers fresh network requests, allowing the extension to gather current data.

<Check>
After reloading, the badge count should update according to detected third-party remote server connections.
</Check>

---

## 5. Confirm Tab Focus and Active Tab Data

uBO Scope displays network connections for the active tab only.

- Ensure you are viewing the popup while the tab of interest is active and in focus.
- Network activity on background or inactive tabs is not immediately shown.

### Troubleshooting:

- Switch back to the tab you want to inspect.
- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup for that tab.

---

## 6. Interpret Empty or Missing Badge Counts and Popups

If you see no badge number or the popup shows "NO DATA":

- The page may have no active third-party connections yet.
- The extension may not have registered the initial main frame request.
- There might be extension conflicts or permission issues preventing data collection.

<Tip>
Try navigating to a new page or reload the page to generate new network requests.
</Tip>

---

## 7. Review Browser-Specific Notes

### Safari

- Extension requires Safari 18.5 or newer.
- Safari uses a background script declared in the manifest and may impose stricter permission rules.
- Ensure that the extension is allowed in Safari's Preferences under Extensions.

### Chromium and Firefox

- Ensure minimum Chrome version 122 or Firefox 128.
- Verify that the extension has not been restricted by browser privacy settings.

---

## 8. Additional Diagnostic Steps

### Check Browser Console for Errors

- Open Developer Tools (usually F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).
- Switch to the Console tab.
- Look for errors related to uBO Scope or extension APIs.

### Clear Extension Storage

- Sometimes stale or corrupted session data can cause erratic behavior.
- Clear local storage by disabling and reinstalling the extension or via developer tools.

<Warning>
Clearing storage will reset recorded session data for all tabs.
</Warning>

### Temporary Disable Conflicting Extensions

- Some security/privacy extensions might block parts of the webRequest API.
- Disable other extensions one-by-one to identify conflicts.

## 9. When to Reach Out for Support

If the above steps do not resolve your issue:

- Check the official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) for known issues.
- Open an issue on GitHub describing your problem, browser/version, and steps already taken.
