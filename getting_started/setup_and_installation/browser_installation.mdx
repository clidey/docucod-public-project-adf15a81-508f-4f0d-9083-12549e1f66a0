## 3. Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

If you want to install uBO Scope manually, for example to run from source or developer mode:

### Steps for Chromium and Firefox:

1. Download or clone the uBO Scope repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
```

2. Open your browser's extensions page:

- Chromium: `chrome://extensions/`
- Firefox: `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`

3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** (Chromium) or **Load Temporary Add-on** (Firefox).
5. Select the folder where the cloned repository is located.
   - For Firefox, select the `manifest.json` file inside the root folder.
6. The extension will load temporarily and you should see the uBO Scope icon.

### Safari Manual Installation:

Manual installation is not supported as Safari requires packaging and signing the extension for the App Store.

## 4. Post-Installation Verification

After installation, verify that uBO Scope is active by:

- Checking that the uBO Scope icon appears next to your browser's address bar.
- Opening a new tab and clicking the uBO Scope icon.
- The popup should open and display connection details of the current tab (initially showing "NO DATA" until network traffic is registered).
