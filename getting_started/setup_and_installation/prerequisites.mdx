# Prerequisites & System Requirements for uBO Scope

Ensure your system environment supports uBO Scope for smooth installation and optimal functionality. This guide details supported browsers, system requirements, and necessary permissions to prepare your setup.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with major modern browsers that support the WebExtensions API and the `webRequest` API. Compatibility details per browser:

- **Google Chrome and Chromium-based Browsers**
  - Minimum Chrome version: **122.0**
  - Uses manifest version 3 with a service worker background script
  - Install via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - Minimum Firefox version: **128.0** (including Firefox for Android)
  - Supports persistent background modules
  - Install from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

- **Apple Safari**
  - Minimum Safari version: **18.5**
  - Background scripts use module type
  - Signed and packaged as Safari App Extension


## 2. System Environment Requirements

- **Operating System**:
  - Compatible with operating systems that support the above browser versions.
  - For Safari, this implies macOS versions that support Safari 18.5 or newer.

- **Memory & Storage**:
  - Minimal memory overhead typical of browser extensions.
  - Storage permission usage requires sufficient local storage space for session data.

- **Network Access**:
  - Full internet access is required to fetch the Public Suffix List used internally for domain computations.
  - The extension requests access to all `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` URLs, and in some manifests, websocket protocols (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).


## 3. Required Permissions

To function correctly, uBO Scope needs the following browser permissions:

- **activeTab**: To access details of the current active tab for real-time network request tracking.
- **storage**: To save session data and the parsed Public Suffix List for performance.
- **webRequest**: To listen to network requests and their outcomes.

Additionally, host permissions to access network requests on all web origins are necessary:

- `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` (required for all browsers)
- `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*` (supported on Chromium and Firefox for websocket monitoring)


## 4. Notes on Compatibility and Security

- **Manifest Versions**
  - Chromium and Firefox use Manifest Version 3.
  - Background script is a service worker in Chromium and a module in Safari.

- **Extension Installation Restrictions**
  - Verify that your browser version meets the minimum version requirements to avoid compatibility issues.
  - On Firefox and Safari, the extension requires strict minimum versions enforced by their respective browser settings.

- **Security Considerations**
  - uBO Scope operates with standard browser extension permissions.
  - It does not require user accounts but needs sufficient permission to observe network traffic.


## 5. Verification Before Installation

Follow these steps to verify your environment:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser and Version">
Verify that you have one of the supported browsers installed at the required minimum version. For Chrome, go to `chrome://settings/help`, Firefox to `about:support`, and Safari via 'About Safari'.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Available Permissions">
Ensure you are comfortable granting the extension the permissions it requests during installation. These include access to network requests across all web pages and storage.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Network Connectivity">
Make sure your system can access the internet to allow uBO Scope to fetch its Public Suffix List during first use.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
If your browser or system does not meet minimum requirements, update your browser or consider an alternative supported browser.
</Check>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting System Compatibility">
<Accordion title="Browser Version Too Low">
Upgrade your browser to the latest stable version matching or exceeding the minimum version requirements.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Permissions During Installation">
Review the extension's permission requests carefully. Declining required permissions will prevent proper functionality.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Access Issues">
If the extension cannot fetch the Public Suffix List, check your firewall or proxy settings to allow network requests to internet domains.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Next Steps

After confirming your system meets these prerequisites and requirements, proceed to the [Installing uBO Scope](../setup_and_installation/browser_installation) guide to install and configure your extension.
