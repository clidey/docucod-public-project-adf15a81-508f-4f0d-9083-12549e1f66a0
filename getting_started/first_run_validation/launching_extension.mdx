# Launching and Using the Extension

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with **uBO Scope**, the browser extension that transparently reveals all remote server connections initiated by the websites you visit. This guide will walk you through locating the uBO Scope extension icon, opening its popup interface, and understanding the immediate network insights it provides.

---

## 1. Locate the uBO Scope Icon in Your Browser Toolbar

- After installation, you’ll find the uBO Scope icon in your browser's extension area, usually at the top-right corner near the address bar.
- The icon displays as the uBO Scope logo (a shield with scope-like elements).
- On some browsers (like Chrome), if you don’t see the icon, it may be hidden under the extensions menu (puzzle piece icon). Pin it for easier access.

<Tip>
Pin the uBO Scope extension icon to your toolbar for quick access. In Chrome, click the puzzle piece icon, then click the pin next to uBO Scope.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Open the Popup Interface

- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
- The popup displays detailed information about third-party network connections related to the active browser tab.
- It updates dynamically as new network requests are observed for the tab you are currently viewing.

---

## 3. Understand What You See in the Popup

The popup interface is segmented into several clear sections that help you make sense of network activity:

### a. Page Hostname and Domain Header

At the top, the popup shows the hostname and domain of the current webpage.

- **Example:** For a page on `news.example.com`, "news." may appear as a prefix span, and "example.com" is the main domain.
- This helps you confirm which site’s network connections are being analyzed.

### b. Summary Section

- Displays the count of **distinct third-party remote domains** your browser has connected to while loading the current page.
- Lower counts typically indicate fewer third-party connections, which can mean better privacy.

### c. Outcome Sections

These three areas list third-party domains categorized by their network request outcomes:

| Section         | Meaning                                    |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked** (Allowed) | Domains for which connections succeeded and were not blocked. |
| **Stealth-Blocked** (Stealth) | Domains that were blocked silently or redirected stealthily. |
| **Blocked**            | Domains where connection attempts were explicitly blocked or failed. |

- Each domain is listed with a count showing how many network requests were observed.
- Domains are sorted alphabetically for easy scanning.

<Tip>
Review the "Not Blocked" section to identify which third parties are actively connected on the page. Frequent connections to unknown domains may merit investigation.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Refresh and Observe Network Activity Live

- Navigate around different websites or refresh your current tab.
- Click the extension icon again to see updated network connection data.

<Tip>
Some network connections load asynchronously after the initial page load, so allow a few seconds after page activity before checking the popup for a complete picture.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Key Initial Actions

Once you open the popup for a page:

- **Scan the summary count:** This count reflects distinct connected third-party domains. A high count means many remote servers are contacted.
- **Explore domains listed:** Note domains in the “Not Blocked” category to understand who the site is actually contacting.
- **Identify stealth and blocked:** These can highlight blocking effects or stealth redirects.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Initial Usage

- If the popup shows "NO DATA" or no domains:
  - Confirm you are viewing a right-clickable active tab with network activity.
  - Reload the page and then reopen the popup.
  - Check that you have granted necessary permissions during installation (see Prerequisites & System Requirements).
- If counts seem unexpectedly low or zero, verify your browser supports the webRequest API fully (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

<Warning>
The network requests reported rely on browser webRequest API visibility. Some browser privacy features or configurations may hide certain requests, causing incomplete data.
</Warning>

## 7. Where to Go Next

After successfully opening the popup and viewing your first network analysis results, consider these next steps:

- Explore the [Understanding the Popup & Badge Count](/guides/getting-started/understand-popup-badge) guide to decode what the icon badge numbers mean.
- Try the [Running Your First Network Analysis](/guides/getting-started/first-analysis) walkthrough for a practical example.
- If you encounter any issues, check [Troubleshooting Installation & Startup Issues](/getting_started/first_run_validation/troubleshooting_installation).

This first interaction with uBO Scope will give you immediate insights into the remote servers connected by the sites you visit and lay the groundwork for deeper investigation into network privacy and content blocking effectiveness.

## Visual Example of the Popup Structure

```plaintext
+-----------------------------------+
| [Hostname prefix] example.com     |  <-- Page Hostname and Domain
+-----------------------------------+
| domains connected: 7               |  <-- Summary count
+-----------------------------------+
| not blocked                      v|  <-- Allowed domain section
|  - cdn.example.net (5)            |
|  - analytics.example.org (2)      |
+-----------------------------------+
| stealth-blocked                  v|  <-- Stealth-blocked domains
|  - tracker.hidden.com (1)         |
+-----------------------------------+
| blocked                          v|  <-- Explicitly blocked domains
|  - ads.badexample.com (3)         |
+-----------------------------------+
```

## Additional Tips

- The domain counts aggregate all network requests, including images, scripts, and other resources.
- Domains shown in the "stealth-blocked" category indicate requests silently redirected or stealthily handled by extensions or blockers.
- Frequent review of this data can help identify unexpected third-party requests that may impact privacy.
