# Troubleshooting Installation & Startup Issues

This guide addresses the most frequent problems users encounter immediately after installing uBO Scope: the extension icon not appearing, the popup failing to load or update properly, and the badge count remaining static or missing. By following these actionable steps and understanding common causes rooted in browser settings and permissions, you will restore full functionality and continue benefiting from real-time network connection visibility.

## 1. Extension Icon Does Not Appear in Toolbar

If the uBO Scope icon is missing from your browser toolbar after installation, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Confirm Installation
- Open your browser's extensions or add-ons page.
- Verify that `uBO Scope` is installed and enabled.

### Step 2: Check Browser Compatibility
- Ensure your browser supports uBO Scope:
  - **Chrome/Chromium-based browsers**: minimum version 122.0
  - **Firefox**: version 128.0 or newer
  - **Safari**: version 18.5 or newer

<Tip>
Use the browser’s About page or settings to verify your version.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Reveal Pinned Extensions
- In Chromium-based browsers and Firefox:
  - Click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions menu).
  - Pin the uBO Scope extension to the toolbar.

### Step 4: Restart Your Browser
- Close and reopen your browser to reset extension loading.

### Step 5: Reinstall as Last Resort
- Remove the extension.
- Reinstall from the official store or manually in developer mode.

## 2. Popup Does Not Open or Displays "No Data"

If clicking the uBO Scope icon opens the popup but it remains blank or shows "NO DATA," troubleshoot as follows:

### Step 1: Reload the Active Tab
- Some network events aren’t captured until the current webpage reloads.
- Press `Ctrl+R` / `Cmd+R` or refresh the page.

### Step 2: Confirm Permissions Are Granted
- uBO Scope requires permissions to observe network requests:
  - Read permissions like `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and access to URLs (`http://`, `https://`, `ws://`, `wss://`).
- In the extensions page, verify these permissions are granted and no alerts are shown.

### Step 3: Verify Browser Session Storage
- The extension relies on session data storage.
- Make sure your browser allows storage access for extensions.

### Step 4: Disable Conflicting Extensions
- Other extensions that heavily modify requests or block scripts might interfere.
- Temporarily disable other network-related extensions to identify conflicts.

### Step 5: Open the Popup in a Clean Profile
- Test uBO Scope in a new browser profile without other extensions.

<Tip>
A "No Data" message means the extension has not received any network activity data for the current tab.
</Tip>

## 3. Badge Count Does Not Update or Displays Incorrectly

The badge count on the toolbar icon reflects how many distinct third-party domains uBO Scope has detected and is central to its value. If this count is missing, zero, or stuck:

### Step 1: Verify Network Activity on Current Tab
- Load web pages that make external requests, such as news sites or popular portals.

### Step 2: Reload the Tab
- Refreshing is required to populate new network request data.

### Step 3: Check for Web Request API Support
- uBO Scope uses the browser's `webRequest` API.
- If your browser or platform limits this API (some mobile browsers or developer restrictions), the badge will not update.

### Step 4: Allow Background Scripts to Run
- Check that background scripts are enabled (no aggressive power management or privacy settings blocking service workers).

### Step 5: Restart Browser
- Rebooting ensures the extension's background process starts freshly.

### Step 6: Confirm Extension Version
- Using an outdated extension version may cause instability.
- Ensure you have uBO Scope version 1.0.1 or later.

---

## 4. Common Root Causes to Consider

- **Browser Permissions**: Upon installation, some browsers require explicit permission acceptance before the extension can monitor network events.

- **Content Blocking and Privacy Settings**: Strict privacy or tracker blockers can interfere with uBO Scope’s ability to observe requests.

- **Browser Profile Corruption**: Sometimes profile issues prevent extensions from loading fully.

- **Service Worker Lifecycle**: In Manifest V3, service workers powering extensions can be stopped by the browser to save resources, potentially delaying updates.

- **Network Protocol Limitations**: uBO Scope only tracks HTTP(S) and WS(S) protocols; other protocols or sandboxed environments won't report.

---

## 5. Advanced Troubleshooting Steps

If issues persist after the above, proceed with these diagnostics:

### Step 1: Open Browser Developer Console for uBO Scope
- Access your browser’s extension debug page.
- Locate uBO Scope and open background service worker console.
- Look for error messages or warnings related to permissions or network request handling.

### Step 2: Test Network Request Tracking
- Navigate to sites known for multiple third-party connections (e.g., news aggregators).
- Observe if the badge count updates.

### Step 3: Inspect Extension Storage
- Using browser developer tools, inspect session storage to check if request data is being logged.

### Step 4: Report Issues
- If you encounter bugs or persistent errors, report them at the [GitHub repository issues](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/issues).

## 6. Summary and Next Steps

Once your extension icon is visible, the popup loads data, and the badge counts update dynamically, you are ready to proceed with detailed network analysis. These troubleshooting steps align with common scenarios users face on installation and ensure uBO Scope’s transparency benefits unlock as intended.

For a seamless start, after troubleshooting:

- Return to [Launching and Using the Extension]( /getting_started/first_run_validation/launching_extension ) to familiarize yourself with the popup interface.
- Validate your setup with the [Validating Installation & Quick Function Check]( /getting_started/first_run_validation/first_validation ) guide.

<Tip>
Routine browser updates or major profile changes may occasionally reset extension permissions or behavior. Keep this guide handy to restore functionality swiftly.
