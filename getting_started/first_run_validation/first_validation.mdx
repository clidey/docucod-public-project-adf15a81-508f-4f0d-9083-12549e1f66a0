# Validating Installation & Quick Function Check

This guide helps you verify that uBO Scope is actively capturing network requests by interpreting the popup interface and badge counts. You will learn to understand the meaning behind displayed domains, connection outcomes, and essential checks to ensure the extension operates correctly.

---

## 1. Understanding the Badge Count

After installing and launching uBO Scope, you will notice a numeric badge on the extension icon in your browser toolbar. This badge indicates the number of distinct third-party domains from which network requests have been recorded for the active tab.

- **Badge Number**: Represents the count of unique domains whose requests were allowed (not blocked or stealth-blocked) on the current tab.
- **Empty Badge**: If the badge is empty (no number displayed), it means no allowed network requests have been captured yet for the active tab.

<Tip>
The badge updates dynamically as you browse, reflecting real-time network activity related to the current tab.
</Tip>

## 2. Exploring the Popup Interface

Clicking the uBO Scope icon opens the popup that breaks down network request outcomes by type:

- **not blocked** (Allowed): Domains you connected to that passed without being blocked.
- **stealth-blocked**: Domains whose requests were redirected in a stealthy manner (commonly for tracking avoidance).
- **blocked**: Domains whose requests were explicitly blocked.

Each section lists the domains observed along with the count of requests seen for each.

### Key Popup Elements Explained

- **Hostname Header**: Shows the current tab's hostname and domain (decoded to Unicode if needed).
- **Domains Connected**: Displays the total number of unique third-party domains connected.
- **Outcome Sections**: Segmented by connection outcome, each listing domains with their respective request counts.

### What the Counts Mean

- The request count next to each domain reflects the number of times that domain was contacted during the tab's session.
- Domains are displayed using their Unicode representation for readability.

## 3. Quick Validation Steps

Follow these steps immediately after installation to confirm that uBO Scope is capturing traffic properly:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the extension icon beside your browser's address bar to open the popup interface.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Hostname Display">
Check that the popup shows your current tab’s hostname and domain at the top. If it says 'NO DATA' or is blank, there may be a connection issue or the tab isn't tracking yet.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Badge Count">
Look at the badge number on the extension icon. A non-zero count indicates allowed domains are recorded for this tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Domain Lists">
Within the popup, confirm that at least one domain appears under the 'not blocked' section. If no domains appear and the badge is empty, try refreshing the webpage to generate network requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Assess Connection Outcomes">
Observe if domains also appear under 'stealth-blocked' or 'blocked'. These categories indicate the extension is monitoring different request outcomes as designed.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If your webpage calls multiple third-party servers (e.g., via ads or analytics), you should see a corresponding range of domains and counts in the popup.
</Tip>

## 4. Common Checks for Extension Functionality

- **Active Tab Tracking**: The data shown corresponds only to the currently active browser tab.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Network activity updates occur as you interact with the tab or reload pages.
- **Unicode Domain Support**: Internationalized domain names (IDNs) are decoded and displayed for clarity.

<Note>
If you see no data after extensive browsing or known network activity, verify the extension is enabled and has the necessary permissions, especially the `webRequest` permission.
</Note>

## 5. Troubleshooting Quick Functionality Checks

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Does Not Show Hostname or Domains">
- Reload the current tab and reopen the popup.
- Ensure uBO Scope is active and not disabled in the browser extensions manager.
- Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Number Never Appears or Updates">
- Check that the browser's badge display is supported and enabled.
- Confirm uBO Scope has permission to read the tab’s webRequest events.
- Try restarting the browser to refresh the extension’s environment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains List Empty Despite Network Activity">
- Attempt to visit websites known for third-party content (for example, news sites with ads).
- Verify you are viewing the popup on the correct tab.
- Make sure no other privacy settings or extensions override or interfere with network tracking.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. How uBO Scope Counts Domains

Behind the scenes, uBO Scope uses a robust method to identify and count domains:

- It parses each network request URL to extract the hostname.
- Then, leveraging the Public Suffix List, it determines the registered domain, filtering out trivial subdomains.
- Domains are categorized by the request outcome: allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

<Tip>
The Public Suffix List integration ensures that counts reflect meaningful domains rather than subdomains, which helps you analyze third-party network connections effectively.
</Tip>

## 7. Next Steps After Validating Functionality

Once you confirm that uBO Scope is capturing network requests:

- Move on to the [Understanding the Popup & Badge Count](https://docs.example.com/guides/getting-started/understand-popup-badge) guide for a deeper dive into reading popup data.
- Experiment with browsing different websites to observe the variety of third-party domains.
- Review [Running Your First Network Analysis](https://docs.example.com/guides/getting-started/first-analysis) to learn practical analysis techniques.
