# uBO Scope: Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before you install and use uBO Scope, ensure that your environment meets the necessary requirements. This will guarantee a smooth installation experience and full functionality from the start.

---

## 1. Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a browser extension compatible with modern web browsers. Confirm you are using one of the following supported browsers and versions:

- **Google Chrome:** Version 122.0 or later
- **Mozilla Firefox:** Version 128.0 or later
- **Safari:** Version 18.5 or later

These versions reflect the minimum supported by the uBO Scope manifest configurations and ensure compatibility with Manifest Version 3.

<Note>
Using browsers older than the minimum versions may cause extension installation failure or unexpected behavior.
</Note>

## 2. Permissions Required

To function correctly, uBO Scope requires specific permissions granted during installation:

- **Access to HTTP and HTTPS URLs:** To monitor network requests on web pages.
- **WebSocket URLs:** Support for WebSocket and secure WebSocket connections (except Safari, which currently excludes WebSocket permissions).
- **Active Tab Access:** To associate network data with the active browser tab.
- **Storage:** To save session information locally.
- **Web Request API:** To observe network requests, their redirects, errors, and responses.

These permissions are requested automatically during extension installation and are fundamental for uBO Scope’s ability to accurately display remote server connections.

## 3. System Requirements

### Hardware & OS

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension with minimal system impact. It does not require dedicated hardware or extensive resources. However, to ensure best performance:

- Use an operating system compatible with your browser choice (Windows, macOS, Linux, or mobile OS for Firefox Android).
- Ensure your browser is up-to-date to meet version and security standards.

### Network Requirements

- **Internet Access:** Required for fetching public suffix list updates and for the extension's network monitoring activities.
- **No Special Firewall Configuration Needed:** uBO Scope works with standard internet connectivity. However, ensure your firewall or privacy tools do not block browser extension permissions or network access that uBO Scope needs.

## 4. Additional Considerations

### Public Suffix List Handling

uBO Scope leverages the Public Suffix List (PSL) to differentiate registrable domains from public suffixes for accurate domain reporting. It automatically downloads and caches the latest PSL:

- The extension periodically fetches the [official PSL](https://publicsuffix.org/list/).
- This process requires internet connectivity during the first launch or updates.

<Info>
The PSL usage is transparent to end users but vital for correct aggregation and interpretation of third-party connections.
</Info>

### Extension Updates

Keep uBO Scope updated via your browser's extension store to benefit from fixes, feature improvements, and compatibility updates.

## 5. Verifying Your Environment

Follow these quick checks before installation:

1. **Browser Check:** Verify your browser and version.
   - Chrome: Navigate to `chrome://settings/help`
   - Firefox: Go to `about:support`
   - Safari: Use Safari > About Safari
2. **Internet Access:** Confirm your device is online.
3. **Permissions Awareness:** Understand that you'll authorize network access during installation.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues and Solutions">
