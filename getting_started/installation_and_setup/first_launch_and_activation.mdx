# First Launch & Extension Check

Welcome to your first step with uBO Scope. This guide will help you **verify that uBO Scope is correctly installed, enabled, and actively monitoring your network requests**. By completing these checks, you confirm the extension is ready to provide accurate insights into third-party network connections made by your browser.

---

## 1. Locate the uBO Scope Extension Icon

### What to do:

1. Look at your browser's toolbar (usually at the top-right corner).
2. Find the uBO Scope icon — it uses the uBO logo in various sizes depending on your browser:
   - The icon typically appears as a small shield or badge, matching the extension's branding (see examples below).

### Platform Notes:
- **Chrome/Chromium:** The icon sits beside the address bar, possibly under the puzzle piece (extensions) menu if not pinned.
- **Firefox:** The icon appears in the toolbar; you can pin it for easy access if needed.
- **Safari:** The icon is in the toolbar and titled "uBO Scope" when hovered.

<Tip>
If you cannot find the icon immediately, make sure the extension is installed and enabled by checking your browser’s extensions management page.
</Tip>

## 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup

The popup provides a snapshot of network connections and their statuses for the active browser tab.

### How to open:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup window will open, loading data about the current tab’s network activity.

### What to expect:

- **Tab Hostname:** Displays the hostname of the active tab.
- **Domains Connected:** Shows the number of different domains contacted.
- **Sections:**
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains with allowed connections.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains which experienced stealth blocking (network requests redirected or silently blocked).
  - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked.

If the popup says "NO DATA" or remains empty, the extension might not be monitoring properly yet.

<Tip>
Reload the current webpage to generate network activity if the popup shows no data on first opening.
</Tip>

## 3. Verify the Badge Count on the Extension Icon

The badge count on the toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers with allowed connections for the current tab.

### How to check:

1. Look at the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
2. Verify there is a numeric badge overlay (e.g., a number like '3').
3. The badge number corresponds to the count of connected domains shown in the popup summary.

### What it means:

- A **visible badge number** confirms that uBO Scope is monitoring your network requests.
- The count is the **number of unique third-party domains contacted** successfully.
- A **blank badge** means no third-party connections have been observed yet.

<Warning>
If the badge count does not update after browsing or refreshing pages, the extension might not have proper permissions or might be disabled.
</Warning>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Extension icon not visible
- Visit your browser's extensions or add-ons page.
- Confirm uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- In Chrome, pin the extension to the toolbar.
- In Firefox, drag the icon to the toolbar or enable it.

### Issue: Popup shows "NO DATA" or no domain counts
- Refresh the current tab to trigger new network requests.
- Ensure you are browsing websites that generate network activity.
- Check that your browser allows extensions to access webRequest permissions.

### Issue: Badge count not showing or not updating
- Make sure uBO Scope has the `webRequest` and `activeTab` permissions enabled.
- Disable conflicting extensions that might interfere with network monitoring.
- Restart your browser to reload all extensions.

<Note>
Most issues are resolved after confirming installation, refreshing tabs, and restarting the browser. If problems persist, consult the Common Issues guide for more detailed help.
</Note>

## 5. Confirm Success

Once you see the extension icon with a badge number and the popup shows a hostname with domains under "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," or "blocked," uBO Scope is successfully monitoring network requests.

### What this means for you:

- uBO Scope is actively tracking third-party network connections.
- You can now proceed to explore your network connection details in deeper guides.
