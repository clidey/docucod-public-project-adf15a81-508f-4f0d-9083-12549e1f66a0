# Basic Configuration

The **Basic Configuration** page introduces the default preferences, badge behaviors, and settings of uBO Scope that every user should understand when beginning to use the extension. This guide helps you grasp what settings are immediately available, what they mean for your browsing experience, and how the extension integrates seamlessly into your workflow.

---

## 1. Overview of Default Preferences

uBO Scope installs with sensible defaults designed to provide immediate value without requiring manual setup. These defaults cover how network requests are tracked, how information is presented via the badge, and which requests are considered relevant.

- **Automatic Session Tracking**: uBO Scope begins capturing all relevant web requests upon installation and browser startup.
- **Badge Counting**: The extension displays the number of distinct third-party remote domains connected to on the currently active tab.
- **Use of Public Suffix List**: Domain names are normalized using the Public Suffix List to accurately group domains and subdomains.

<Tip>
No initial configuration is necessary to benefit from uBO Scope. However, understanding these defaults empowers you to better interpret the extension's badge and popup data.
</Tip>

## 2. Badge Behavior Explained

The badge, visible on your browser toolbar once uBO Scope is active, dynamically updates based on network activity per tab.

- Displays a **count** of distinct third-party domains that your browser has connected to for the active tab.
- Updates in real time as you navigate between tabs or as new network requests occur.
- The count does *not* reflect blocked connections but rather the successful or stealth-blocked ones.

### Best Practices

- Consider a **lower badge count as better**, indicating fewer third-party connections.
- Use the badge as a **quick privacy and transparency metric** for sites you visit.

### Common Pitfalls

- Don’t equate a higher badge count with better blocking; a high count means *more* third-party connections happened.
- Badge counts ignore first-party connections and focus strictly on distinct remote third-party domains.

## 3. Default Settings Affecting Your Experience

Some built-in behaviors impact how you experience the extension out of the box:

| Setting                          | Default Behavior                            | Effect on User Experience                                  |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Network Request Types            | Monitors all `http`, `https`, `ws`, `wss`  | Tracks page loads and relevant websocket connections       |
| Tab Session Persistence          | Tab data resets when tabs are closed        | Keeps counts and domains fresh and relevant per active tab |
| Session Data Storage             | Stored persistently to browser storage      | Data survives browser restarts, ensuring consistent metrics |

## 4. Adjusting Basic Settings

Currently, uBO Scope does not expose extensive user-facing configuration options, preserving simplicity and reliability. However, understanding what is configurable in future versions can help you anticipate the tool’s flexibility:

- **Badge display options:** Potential future enhancements might allow toggling badge visibility or changing what the count represents.
- **Detail Levels:** Options could include showing more granular network request info or filtering certain domains.

For now, the system is optimized so you can rely on its automatic tracking and reporting without manual tuning.

## 5. Integration into Your Browsing Workflow

By default, uBO Scope works silently in the background and integrates via:

- **Toolbar badge icon**: Summarizes distinct third-party connections on each active tab.
- **Popup panel** (activated by clicking the icon): Provides a detailed breakdown of network request outcomes grouped as **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

This design promotes minimal disruption while maximizing insight:

- You can quickly glance at the badge for a site’s network connection profile.
- Expand the popup whenever you want deeper investigation for any tab.

## 6. Practical Tips for Your First Use

- **After installation**, simply browse your favorite websites.
- Observe the badge for third-party connection counts.
- Click the badge icon to explore which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- If you notice unexpectedly high third-party connections, consider cross-referencing with your main content blocker settings.

<Tip>
The badge and popup are synchronized per tab session, simplifying stepwise analysis as you navigate different websites.
</Tip>

## 7. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

Although uBO Scope requires little configuration, users might encounter or wonder about these scenarios:

- **Badge not appearing or not updating:**
  - Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and permissions are granted as per your browser’s extension management.
  - Reload the tab or restart the browser to reset sessions.

- **Unexpected low counts:**
  - Some network requests might not be visible if the browser doesn’t expose them to the `webRequest` API.
  - VPNs or proxies might affect what is observable.

- **Popup shows 'NO DATA':**
  - This occurs if the extension has yet to collect network data for the active tab.
  - Refresh the tab or wait a few moments for data to be populated.

For persistent issues, consult the **Troubleshooting Common Issues** and **Verifying Functionality** guides in the Getting Started section.
