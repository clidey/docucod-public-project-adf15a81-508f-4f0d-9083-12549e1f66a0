# Feature Overview

uBO Scope provides a clear and concise snapshot of how webpages connect to remote servers. This page highlights the core features available at a glance, focusing on network request inspection per browser tab, third-party domain tracking, badge reporting for unique third-party connections, and seamless compatibility with leading browsers. Understanding these features is essential for users who want to fact-check blocker claims and reveal hidden or stealthy web requests.

## Instant Per-Tab Network Request Inspection

uBO Scope empowers you to analyze network requests on a per-tab basis, meaning you get precise insight into which third-party servers each webpage is communicating with. As you navigate websites, the extension categorizes each connection into three distinct groups:

- **Allowed:** Requests that successfully connected without being blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests blocked in a way that prevents the webpage from detecting the block.
- **Blocked:** Requests that were visibly blocked.

This granular inspection helps you quickly identify the real network activity behind any webpage, supporting privacy-conscious browsing and detailed evaluation of content blockers.

### Example Scenario
Imagine visiting your favorite news site and suspecting trackers are slipping past your blocker. uBO Scope’s per-tab analysis surfaces exactly which third-party domains were contacted and whether these connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.

## Third-Party Domain Tracking & Distinct Server Badge Count

A hallmark feature of uBO Scope is its ability to count the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by a webpage and display this number as a badge on the browser toolbar icon.

- The **badge count** reflects unique third-party domains, not individual network requests.
- A **lower badge count** generally indicates fewer third-party connections, which often correlates with improved privacy.
- Recognizing that not all third-party servers are problematic—content delivery networks (CDNs), for example, usually result in low counts.

This feature lets you assess the real-world effectiveness of your content blocker beyond mere block counts or misleading test websites.

### Why Badge Count Matters
A higher block count does not necessarily mean better blocking. It's the number of **distinct third-party servers contacted** that truly indicates how many external connections your browser permits.

## Compatibility Across Leading Browsers

uBO Scope integrates smoothly with the major browser families:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Opera)
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Apple Safari** (version 18.5 and above)

Under the hood, uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to listen to network requests and their outcomes. This unified, cross-browser support ensures consistent user experience and reliable data regardless of your preferred browser.

> Note: Network requests made outside the scope of the browser’s `webRequest` API cannot be tracked by uBO Scope.

## How These Features Meet Your Needs

### Fact-Checking Blocker Claims
Many users encounter conflicting claims about which content blocker is more effective. uBO Scope helps you:

- Verify actual third-party connections, cutting through misleading block counts.
- Understand when blockers are stealthy to avoid detection by webpages.
- Debunk unreliable "ad blocker test" sites that generate artificial network requests.

### Uncovering Stealthy Web Requests
Some blockers attempt to hide blocked requests from detection by webpages. uBO Scope makes these stealth-blocked requests visible to you, making it easier to audit and confirm blocker performance.

### Use Case Examples
- A privacy-conscious user monitors the number of external servers contacted on shopping sites.
- A filter list maintainer verifies which requests were stealth blocked during testing.
- A security researcher evaluates how third-party trackers operate under different content blockers.

## Summary
- Per-tab inspection reveals detailed network requests categorized by their outcome.
- Distinct third-party server badge count acts as a reliable metric for connection diversity.
- Broad compatibility ensures data across popular browsers.
- Designed to help users critically assess blocking effectiveness and uncover hidden network activity.
