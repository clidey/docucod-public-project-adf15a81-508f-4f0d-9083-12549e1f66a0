## Unlocking Transparency for Privacy-Minded Web Users

If your priority is to maintain control over your online privacy and reduce exposure to unwanted third-party connections, uBO Scope is designed for you. It helps you audit the network requests initiated by webpages you visit, providing a real-time understanding of exactly which remote servers your browser communicates with.

### What You Can Achieve:
- **Audit network requests:** Identify all remote server connections, distinguishing between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked. 
- **Verify block efficacy:** See which connections your content blocker lets through and which ones are stopped.
- **Simplify privacy analysis:** The extension’s toolbar badge shows the number of distinct third-party servers contacted—helping you gauge privacy exposure at a glance.

### Why It Matters:
Your browser may connect invisibly to multiple third-party servers, many of which track you or cache ads. uBO Scope visualizes these connections, empowering you to reduce unnecessary exposure and make informed decisions about your content blocker configurations.

## Essential Tool for Filter List Maintainers

Creating and maintaining filter lists that effectively block unwanted content is challenging, particularly on devices or environments where robust browser developer tools are limited. uBO Scope fills this gap by serving as a reliable companion tool.

### Use Cases:
- **Monitor network request outcomes:** Confirm whether filter rules are successfully blocking connections.
- **Audit stealth-blocked requests:** Detect requests that are suppressed in a way that might evade some browser inspection methods.
- **Access proxy data:** Useful in environments without comprehensive browser network inspection tools or in automated testing environments.

### Benefits:
Filter list maintainers gain a direct window into the real-world effectiveness of their rules, allowing iterative improvement based on actual network activity.

## For Evaluators and Comparers of Content Blockers

If you are assessing different content blockers or validating blocking claims, uBO Scope gives you a factual, unbiased view into network behavior.

### Key Actions:
- **Compare connections not just block counts:** Instead of relying on potentially misleading block counters, see which distinct third-party servers remain connected.
- **Detect stealth blocking:** Some blockers hide the fact they’re blocking but allow connections, which uBO Scope can reveal.
- **Debunk myths:** Avoid common pitfalls such as trusting ad blocker test webpages or superficial block counts.

### Practical Scenarios:
- Ensuring a lower badge count truly corresponds with fewer third-party connections.
- Validating that an extension’s stealth blocking aligns with actual network request outcomes.

## Real-World Scenario: Auditing Network Requests

Imagine you're visiting an online news site and want to see how many third-party servers the pages really communicate with and whether your content blocker is effective.

With uBO Scope activated, the toolbar icon badge will show the number of distinct third-party servers contacted that were not blocked. Opening the extension popup reveals detailed lists:

- Servers that successfully delivered content ("not blocked")
- Stealth-blocked servers where requests were redirected or suppressed quietly
- Explicitly blocked servers

You can immediately identify if any unexpected domains are connected, helping you refine your privacy strategy.

## How uBO Scope Supports Limited Browser Environments

In scenarios where browser developer tools, especially network inspectors, are unavailable or cumbersome, uBO Scope operates independently by listening to the browser’s `webRequest` API. This lets you see network request results even on lightweight browsers, mobile platforms, or locked-down machines.

---

## Important Considerations

- uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API, so it reports on network requests accessible through this interface. Requests outside this scope cannot be detected.
- The toolbar badge count reflects distinct third-party remote servers contacted, not total requests or items blocked.
- The extension clarifies misconceptions such as equating higher block counts with better content blocking.

---

## Summary

uBO Scope is a precise, reliable companion for anyone serious about understanding web connections: from privacy enthusiasts wanting detailed audits, filter list maintainers verifying rule effectiveness, to evaluators debunking common myths about blockers. It empowers users with transparency, actionable data, and clarity.
