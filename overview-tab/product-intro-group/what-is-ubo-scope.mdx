# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlock Complete Transparency on Web Connections

In today’s complex web ecosystem, every website you visit quietly reaches out to numerous remote servers—some necessary, others intrusive. **uBO Scope** is a powerful browser extension designed to lift the veil on these hidden connections. It reveals all attempted and successful connections to third-party servers **in real time**, empowering you with an unprecedented level of insight and control over your web privacy.

## Why uBO Scope Matters

While many content blockers focus solely on blocking ads or trackers, uBO Scope focuses on **clarity and measurement**. It provides a full visualization of network requests initiated by webpages, categorizing them by what your current content blockers allowed, stealthily blocked, or outright blocked. This unique transparency helps you understand exactly what data travels where.

### Key Benefits

- **Clear visibility** into every remote server interaction—both blocked and allowed—during your browsing.
- **Distinguishes between actual connections and stealthy blocks**, revealing attempts content blockers prevent without alerting the webpage.
- **Accurately measures the impact of your content blocker**, enabling smarter decisions rather than relying on unreliable block counts or misleading ad-block tests.
- **Debunks common myths about content blockers and online privacy**, providing real data rather than guesswork.
- **Lightweight and browser-compatible**, with direct reporting through your toolbar icon and a detailed popup panel.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users who want to **track third-party connections** on every webpage.
- Developers and testers evaluating the **true effectiveness** of content blockers.
- Filter list maintainers seeking clarity on what connections are triggered by webpages.

## Understanding uBO Scope at a Glance

uBO Scope acts as a companion to your existing content blockers, notably uBlock Origin. Instead of blocking content itself, it **monitors network requests at the browser level** using the `webRequest` API. It listens to all outgoing connections, then categorizes and counts them based on whether they were:

- **Allowed:** Successfully completed remote connections.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests that were silently intercepted and prevented without the webpage’s knowledge.
- **Blocked:** Requests actively blocked and reported by the browser’s network layer or content blocker.

This breakdown is surfaced directly in the extension’s popup panel and toolbar badge—showing the number of distinct third-party domains with which your browser communicated.

## How uBO Scope Works

When you visit a webpage, uBO Scope begins tracking all network requests that the browser tries to make. It processes each request’s outcome using event listeners:

- **Redirects:** Detected and logged as 'stealth-blocked' if silently blocked.
- **Errors:** Logged as blocked attempts.
- **Successful responses:** Counted as allowed connections.

uBO Scope groups these connection attempts by the domain and hostname involved, providing counts so you can see which third parties appear most frequently during your browsing session.

<Tip>
The toolbar badge showing a lower count means fewer distinct third-party connections occurred, which generally aligns with better privacy.

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Evaluating Your Content Blocker’s True Effectiveness
Most users compare content blockers solely by their block counts or rely on test websites that simulate ad requests. However, uBO Scope reveals the **actual number of unique third-party servers your browser reached**, which is a far more accurate measure of privacy protection.

### Scenario 2: Exposing Stealth Blocking
Some blockers silently block connections to avoid webpage breakage or detection. uBO Scope lists these stealth blocks separately, showing you exactly what was prevented—even if the webpage remains unaware.

### Scenario 3: Filtering List Maintenance and Privacy Audits
If you maintain filter lists or audit sites, uBO Scope gives you concrete data on third-party domains interacting with pages, invaluable for creating precise filters.

## Practical Tips

- Open uBO Scope's popup during site visits to **see live connection data** divided by ‘allowed’, ‘stealth-blocked’, and ‘blocked’ domains.
- Use the **toolbar badge count** as a quick gauge to compare changes in third-party connections across sites or configurations.
- Regularly compare results with and without different content blockers to **assess their true privacy impact**.

## Common Pitfalls and Misconceptions

- **Don’t rely on block count alone.** A content blocker with a higher block count may still allow more third-party connections overall.
- **Beware of ad blocker test sites.** They often generate unrealistic network requests that don’t reflect real-world browsing.
- Some network requests aren’t visible to uBO Scope if they occur outside of the browser's webRequest API scope, such as certain DNS-level blocks.
