# Using uBO Scope When Browser Tools Are Limited

A practical guide for users who need to analyze network connections in scenarios where standard browser developer tools are unavailable or restricted. This guide demonstrates how to leverage uBO Scope to maintain filter lists and analyze connections on locked-down or restricted devices with actionable strategies.

---

## 1. Understanding the Challenge

In certain environments, such as corporate networks with restricted browser configurations, kiosk setups, or devices locked down for security reasons, regular browser developer tools like the Network tab may be inaccessible. Yet, analyzing third-party connections and filter list effectiveness remains crucial for privacy, security, or development efforts.

**uBO Scope** uniquely addresses this by providing an independent, extension-based view of your browser tab's network activity even when other tools are disabled or unavailable.

---

## 2. What uBO Scope Provides in Restricted Environments

- **Third-party server connections visibility:** uBO Scope counts and reports distinct remote servers your browser connects to per active tab.
- **Categorized outcomes:** Domains are grouped into **Allowed** (connections succeeded), **Blocked** (requests failed or blocked), and **Stealth-Blocked** (requests silently redirected or hidden).
- **Independent from browser tooling:** Works as long as the browser’s `webRequest` API is available, even if developer tools are locked down.

This capability empowers filter list maintainers and privacy-conscious users to verify blocking behavior even on limited devices.

---

## 3. Prerequisites Before Using uBO Scope on Restricted Devices

- **uBO Scope installed:** Installed from official browser stores [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp), [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/), or Safari Extension Gallery.
- **Supported browser version:** Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+ (or as documented in system requirements).
- **Required permissions:** Extension must have `webRequest` and `activeTab` permissions enabled.
- **At least one open tab browsing sites of interest:** To observe network behavior.

Ensure the extension badge on the toolbar is visible after installation indicating data collection readiness.

## 4. Step-by-Step Workflow: Inspecting Network Connections with uBO Scope

Follow these precise steps to gain actionable insights when browser network tools are out of reach:

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup UI.
- The popup will display data related to the currently active tab.

### Step 2: Interpret the Summary Header

- The top section shows the current tab's hostname and domain.
- The **domains connected** count represents distinct third-party domains with allowed connections.
- A lower count typically indicates tighter privacy or blocking.

### Step 3: Review the Categorized Domain Lists

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains where requests succeeded and resources fetched.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with requests silently redirected or hidden from pages.
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests were explicitly blocked or failed.

Each domain entry shows the request count, helping prioritize domains with high frequency.

### Step 4: Use Domain Insights to Maintain or Test Filter Lists

- Identify unwanted domains still being allowed to connect.
- Spot stealth-blocked domains that escape visible blocking but are stealthily redirected.
- Confirm domains correctly blocked by current filter rules.

### Step 5: Reload the Tab and Observe Changes

- Reload your active tab to refresh network activity data in uBO Scope.
- Revisit the popup to analyze updated domain connection outcomes.

### Step 6: Export or Record Findings (Manual)

- Since export features are limited, record observations externally for filter list updates.

## 5. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Use uBO Scope as a privacy checkpoint:** Regularly check domains your browser connects to, especially on locked-down devices.
- **Combine with other tools when possible:** If later access to browser dev tools returns, cross-validate findings.
- **Remember the badge count meaning:** It shows the number of *distinct third-party domains allowed*, not total requests.
- **Prefer domain-level insights:** Helps avoid confusion from block counts or request totals which can be misleading.
- **Reload tabs after making blocking changes:** Verify immediate effects in the popup.

<Note>
Stealth-blocked connections, while not visible to webpages, indicate possible redirection or stealth blocking. Monitoring this category helps maintain effective filters.
</Note>

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Issue: Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Blank

- Confirm that you have an active tab open with a loaded website.
- Verify the extension's permissions are granted (webRequest and activeTab).
- Reload the tab and try the popup again.

### Issue: Toolbar Badge Does Not Update

- Network data collection depends on browser support for the `webRequest` API.
- In some environments, network requests outside the browser’s `webRequest` listener scope (e.g., in private browsing or sandboxed tabs) might not be reported.
- Restart the browser to refresh extension background processes.

### Issue: Misinterpretation of Block Counts

- Avoid judging blocking effectiveness solely by the number of blocked requests or sites that claim to "test ad blockers".
- Focus on unique third-party domains allowed or stealth-blocked.

<Warning>
uBO Scope does not update frequently. For critical filter list updates, rely on additional inspection tools when available.
</Warning>

## 7. Example Scenario: Using uBO Scope on a Restricted Device

> You are a filter list maintainer with a company-issued laptop where developer tools are disabled by IT.
>
> 1. Open the site you want to analyze.
> 2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
> 3. See a list of allowed third-party domains and stealth-blocked domains.
> 4. Identify domains that should be blocked but are currently allowed.
> 5. Make filter list adjustments on a separate device.
> 6. Apply changes and reload the restricted device tab.
> 7. Confirm changes using uBO Scope popup without needing dev tools.

This workflow highlights the value of uBO Scope in environments where your hands are otherwise tied.
