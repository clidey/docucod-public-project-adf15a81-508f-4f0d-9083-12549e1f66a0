## Verifying Installation and Initial Activation

Once installed, confirm uBO Scope is active and ready to monitor connections:

1. **Locate the toolbar icon:** Look for the uBO Scope icon (a shield symbol) in the browser’s extension area.
2. **First activation:** Click the icon to open the uBO Scope popup panel.
3. **Check the badge count:** The toolbar icon’s badge will display the number of distinct third-party domains connected to the active tab (initially, this may show zero for new tabs).
4. **Browse a website:** Visit a website to allow uBO Scope to gather connection data.
5. **Open the popup again:** Click the extension icon to see categorized data of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains.

<Note>
If you do not see the icon after installation:
- On Chrome, ensure the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions`.
- On Firefox, check `about:addons` and that uBO Scope is enabled.
- On Safari, verify activation in Preferences → Extensions.
</Note>
