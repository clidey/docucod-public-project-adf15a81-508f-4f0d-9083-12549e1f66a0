# First Steps & Popup UI Overview

## Introduction

This guide walks you through launching the uBO Scope extension popup for the first time and understanding its main interface sections. You'll learn how to interpret the data you see related to third-party network connections — including domain groups, outcomes (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked), and the meaning of badges — enabling you to quickly grasp what the popup tells you about the network activity of any active browser tab.

By the end of this guide, you will confidently navigate the popup UI and understand the core information it presents about your browser's network connections.

---

## 1. Understanding the Popup UI

### What You'll See When You Open the Popup

Upon clicking the uBO Scope extension icon, the popup interface opens and displays the following key areas:

- **Tab Hostname Banner:** At the top, shows the current active tab's hostname split into the subdomain part and the main registered domain.
- **Summary Section:** Displays the number of distinct third-party remote domains your current tab has connected to.
- **Connection Outcome Sections:** Three categorized lists listing domains based on their network request outcomes:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which connections were successfully made.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where stealth blocking was detected (network activities hidden from the webpage).
  - **Blocked:** Domains from which connections were explicitly blocked.

### Badge and Count Meanings

- The **toolbar badge count** (number on extension icon) indicates the number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections. A lower count usually indicates fewer third-party resources fetched, often reflecting better privacy.

- Within the popup, each listed domain is paired with a **badge count** indicating how many connection attempts to that domain were recorded.

### Why This Matters

uBO Scope reveals connection attempts regardless of your content blocking tools or DNS-level blocking, offering unprecedented transparency into all third-party network activity.

## 2. Step-by-Step: Opening and Interpreting the Popup

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope extension must be installed and enabled in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- You must have active tabs with network activity for data to display.

### Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click on the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to launch the popup UI.

**Expected Outcome:**
- Popup opens with the tab hostname displayed at the top.
- Some data sections (domains connected, allowed, stealth, blocked) load progressively.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the Active Tab's Hostname">
Observe the hostname banner at the top. It shows your current tab’s full hostname, split into subdomain and primary domain.

**Example:** For "ads.example.com", subdomain "ads." is shown separately from "example.com".
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Summary Section">
Look at the summary text below the hostname, showing the total number of distinct third-party domains connected by this tab.

**Success Check:** The number reflects the unique allowed domains your tab connected with.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked Domains">
Scroll through each outcome section:

- **Allowed:** Lists domains with successful network connections.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Lists domains where stealth blocking was applied.
- **Blocked:** Lists domains explicitly blocked by content blocking.

Each domain entry displays a badge counting the number of observed connection attempts.

**Tip:** Sections without any domains remain hidden to reduce clutter.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Badge Counts">
Understand that badge numbers represent how many connections were made or blocked per domain in this tab.

**Best Practice:** A high allowed domains count means more third-party connections. 
Aim for lower counts for better privacy.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Anatomy of the Popup UI Sections

### Tab Hostname Banner
- Displays the domain you are currently inspecting.
- Uses Unicode decoding for internationalized domain names for better readability.

### Summary
- Highlights the total count of third-party remote domains connected.
- Updates live when switching tabs or as new connections occur.

### Outcome Sections
Each of the following sections lists domains categorized by connection outcomes:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** 
  - Networks calls allowed through.
  - Green-themed header to indicate positive status.
- **Stealth-Blocked:**
  - Calls where tracking or connection stealth is applied.
  - Red-themed header signaling hidden or stealthy blocking.
- **Blocked:**
  - Calls explicitly blocked, such as by content blocking rules.
  - Also uses red-themed styling.

Each section shows domains along with connection counts, styled with distinctive badge colors.

---

## 4. Practical Tips for Effective Use

- **Switch Tabs:** Popup data updates when you navigate to a different tab and re-open the popup.

- **Unicode Domains:** Punycode domains are automatically decoded in the popup to display human-readable domain names.

- **Section Visibility:** The popup dynamically hides sections that have no data, so fewer distracting empty lists.

- **Badge Color Clues:** Use the color coding to quickly identify suspicious or blocked connections.

- **Understanding Third Parties:** Remember that third-party connections aren't inherently malicious; common CDNs and services are usually benign.

- **Regular Monitoring:** Occasionally open the popup on frequently visited sites to observe changes in network connections and detect unexpected behavior.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Popup UI Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Sections">
- Ensure you have an active tab with network activity.
- Refresh the active tab or open a new tab to initiate network requests.
- Verify that uBO Scope permissions (e.g., access to activeTab) are granted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Counts Not Updating or Badge Missing">
- Confirm the extension is enabled and running.
- Check browser permissions for "webRequest" and "activeTab" under extension settings.
- Restart your browser to refresh the extension's background scripts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unicode Domains Show as Punycode Strange Strings">
- This is rare; try reopening the popup.
- Ensure the extension is up to date.
- Punycode decoding happens automatically but can fail with malformed domains.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps

Once you are comfortable interpreting the popup UI, consider:

- Reading the [Interpreting Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Outcomes](/guides-main/everyday-use-patterns/interpreting-request-outcomes) guide to deepen understanding of what each connection outcome implies.

- Exploring the [Analyzing Site Connections & Outcomes](/guides-main/everyday-use-patterns/analyzing-network-connections) workflow to use uBO Scope as a powerful network analysis tool.

- Validating your content blocker effectiveness through related guides in validation and troubleshooting.

### Example Scenario

Imagine you open uBO Scope on a news site:

- You see 8 domains connected listed under 'Not Blocked'.
- 1 domain under 'Stealth-Blocked', suggesting stealth content blocking active.
- 2 domains under 'Blocked'.

From this, you recognize common CDNs are allowed, some trackers are stealth-blocked, and explicitly blocked ad servers are listed.

This insight helps reinforce your blocker’s effectiveness and highlights where you might need adjustments.
