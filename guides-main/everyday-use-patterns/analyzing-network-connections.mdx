# Analyzing Site Connections & Outcomes

Discover how to use uBO Scope's popup interface to examine all network requests made by the active browser tab. This guide helps you distinguish between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections, understand badge counts, and assess third-party exposure with clear, actionable steps.

---

## 1. Understanding the Purpose of This Page

When you visit a website, your browser often connects to multiple remote servers beyond the main domain you are visiting. uBO Scope reveals these connections and classifies them based on whether they were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked. This page's goal is to guide you through analyzing this data effectively in the popup UI, empowering you with insights into your browser's network activity.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure:

- uBO Scope is installed and active on your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- You have visited one or more websites and have the relevant tab open.
- Familiarity with the popup UI basics (see [First Steps & Popup UI Overview](/guides-main/getting-started-ubo-scope/first-steps-and-ui-overview)).

---

## 3. Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will be able to:

- Open the uBO Scope popup for the active tab.
- Read and interpret the badge count showing distinct remote server connections.
- Navigate categorized domain lists (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).
- Assess third-party exposure of any webpage you browse.

This insight allows you to evaluate privacy exposure and effectiveness of any blockers in place.

## 4. Time Estimate & Difficulty

- Time Estimate: 5–10 minutes
- Difficulty Level: Beginner to Intermediate

---

## 5. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser.
- The popup will appear, displaying data related to the active browser tab.

**Expected Result:** You see the domain of the active tab displayed prominently with three categorized sections below.

---

### Step 2: Read the Toolbar Badge Count

- The badge on the toolbar icon shows a number representing the count of distinct allowed third-party remote server domains contacted by the active tab.
- Remember: A **lower badge count implies fewer connections to third-party servers, which generally means less exposure**.

---

### Step 3: Interpret the Popup Header

- The header shows the hostname and domain of the active tab.
- The domain (public suffix + registered domain) is the base domain of the current website.

---

### Step 4: Examine the Categorized Domain Lists

The popup UI splits the connected third-party domains into three categories:

#### 4a. Allowed Domains (Not Blocked)
- These domains represent connections that succeeded without blocking.
- They are shown in a section labeled "not blocked".
- Each domain listed includes a badge count indicating how many times that domain was contacted.

#### 4b. Stealth-Blocked Domains
- These are connections that were redirected or otherwise stealth-blocked by the browser or extensions.
- They appear under the "stealth-blocked" section with the domain and count.
- Stealth blocking means the connection attempt was concealed or altered to avoid detection by the site.

#### 4c. Blocked Domains
- This section lists domains to which connection attempts were explicitly blocked.
- These are under the "blocked" section, again with domain names and counts.

---

### Step 5: Use the Domain Counts to Assess Exposure

- Higher counts for a domain indicate multiple connection attempts.
- Comparing counts across categories reveals the effectiveness of your blocking mechanisms.

---

### Step 6: Deep Dive into a Domain

- Although not available directly in the popup, understanding that domains group hostnames allows you to further investigate suspicious or unfamiliar domains with external tools or blocklists.

---

## 6. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Regularly check the badge count:** It gives an immediate sense of third-party connections.
- **Use the categorized list:** Review stealth-blocked domains especially to understand what’s being hidden from the webpage.
- **Cross-reference domains with reputable blocklists:** Helps you identify potential trackers or ads.
- **Refresh the popup after changing tabs:** Each tab has its separate connection data.
- **Note that some third parties are legitimate:** CDNs or essential services may appear here; not all connections are privacy risks.

---

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Popup shows 'NO DATA' or no domains
- Ensure the tab is active and has fully loaded.
- Verify uBO Scope is installed correctly and has required permissions.
- No network activity on the tab will result in no data.

### Issue: Badge count does not update
- Reload the current tab.
- Restart your browser if the badge remains stale.
- Check for browser compatibility or permission issues.

### Misinterpretation of numbers
- Avoid equating higher blocked count with better privacy; the count shows connected domains, not just blocked ones.

---

## 8. Examples

Suppose you load `example.com` and click the uBO Scope icon.

- Badge shows '5'.
- Under not blocked, domains like `cdn.example.net` appear with count `3`.
- Under stealth-blocked, you see `tracker.badsite.com` count `1`.
- Under blocked, `ads.badsite.com` count `2`.

You can infer the site connects to several third parties, some connections are stealth-blocked by uBO Scope or your blocker, and some are outright blocked.

## 10. Summary

This page is your practical companion for analyzing the network connections of your active tab using uBO Scope. Reading badge counts and domain lists gives you actionable insights into third-party exposure and blocking quality, central to privacy-sensitive browsing.

---

## 11. Appendices

### Glossary
- **Third-party remote server:** Any server outside the site’s base domain contacted by the browser for resources.
- **Allowed:** Connections that were successful and not blocked.
- **Blocked:** Connections that were actively prevented.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections prevented or redirected in ways hidden from the site.
