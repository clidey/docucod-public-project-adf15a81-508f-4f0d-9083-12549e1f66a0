# Validating Content Blocker Effectiveness with uBO Scope

## Overview

This guide provides a practical, step-by-step process for using uBO Scope to compare different content blockers in real-world conditions. It empowers you to distinguish truth from common misconceptions about badge counts and results displayed by content blockers or test websites. By following this workflow, you will learn how to accurately interpret network request outcomes, especially when you encounter misleading test pages or marketing claims about content blockers.

---

## Prerequisites

- Have uBO Scope installed and running in your browser. Refer to the [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/wiki/Installing-uBO-Scope) guide if necessary.
- Basic familiarity with the uBO Scope popup UI and its badge (see [First Steps & Popup UI Overview](../getting-started-ubo-scope/first-steps-and-ui-overview)).
- Understanding of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked categories as explained in [Interpreting Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Outcomes](../everyday-use-patterns/interpreting-request-outcomes).

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

- Effectively use uBO Scope to measure the effectiveness of any content blocker.
- Identify and avoid false impressions created by misleading block counts or unreliable testing webpages.
- Confidently make informed decisions when selecting or comparing content blockers based on meaningful network connection data.

## Time Estimate

Approximately 10-15 minutes to perform initial validations and understand results. Additional time may be needed for deeper comparison.

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate: Requires understanding of network request outcomes and critical evaluation of testing claims.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Launch uBO Scope on the Target Website

- Open your browser with the content blocker enabled.
- Navigate to the website or set of webpages you want to analyze.
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.

**What You Should See:**
- The popup shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected under "domains connected".
- Domains are categorized as **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

### 2. Understand and Interpret the Toolbar Badge Count

- The badge count on the toolbar icon reflects the number of **distinct third-party domains** from which content was allowed.
- A **lower number indicates fewer distinct third-party servers accessed** and generally implies stronger blocking effectiveness or reduced exposure.

### 3. Compare Content Blockers by Repeating the Test

- Disable the current content blocker or switch to another.
- Refresh the page and open uBO Scope again.
- Observe changes in the badge count and domain lists.

**Key Actions:**
- Take note if a blocker with a higher badge count actually allows connections to more third-party domains.
- Avoid using block counts from content blockers themselves; they are often misleading.

### 4. Use uBO Scope to Detect Stealth Blocking

- Review the **stealth-blocked** domains list in the popup.
- Understand that stealth blocking means network requests are allowed but tracking or fingerprinting attempts are concealed.
- Use this insight to better assess blockers that prioritize stealth over outright blocking.

### 5. Recognize and Avoid Misleading 'Ad Blocker Test' Websites

- Do not rely on typical ad-blocker test webpages as trustworthy benchmarks; they often simulate artificial requests or fail to detect stealth blocking.

**Why:**
- Such test sites generate network requests that do not reflect real-world sites.
- They cannot detect stealth-blocking behaviors.

### 6. Verify the Number and Identity of Connected Domains

- Investigate domain names listed under **not blocked**.
- Use them to identify which third-party services are contacted.
- Confirm if the domains belong to expected services such as CDNs or critical services.

**Tip:** Record this data across different blockers to compare which domains are being allowed and blocked.

### 7. Refresh and Repeat After Changing Content Blocker Settings

- Experiment with enabling/disabling specific filters or custom rules.
- Observe the domain list and badge count for changes.
- This iterative process helps isolate the impact of particular settings.

### 8. Document Your Findings

- Keep notes on the badge counts and domain listings for each tested content blocker.
- Use this data to make decisions grounded in actual network activity rather than marketing claims or generic block counts.

## Practical Examples

### Scenario: Comparing Two Content Blockers on Same Site

1. With Blocker A enabled, uBO Scope shows badge count 25 with third-party domains list including tracker1.com, analytics.net.
2. With Blocker B enabled, badge count is 30 with domains list including analytics.net, ads.example.org, tracker2.com.

**Interpretation:** Blocker B, despite perhaps reporting more blocks internally, actually allowed more distinct connections, indicating less effective blocking.

### Scenario: Evaluating an "Ad Blocker Test" Site

- Visiting fakeadblocktest.com shows zero blocks reported by your blocker.
- uBO Scope still shows multiple distinct connections under allowed or stealth-blocked.

**Action:** Trust uBO Scope's domain connection data over the test site's claims.

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Badge Count Shows No Data or Zero:**
  - Check that uBO Scope has necessary permissions and is allowed to access activeTab and webRequest APIs.
  - Verify your content blocker is active and configured correctly.

- **Unexpected High Allowed Domains:**
  - Remember not all third-party domains are harmful; some are essential services (CDNs, font providers).
  - Identify the domains to distinguish benign from tracking/blocking targets.

- **Popup Does Not Load or Is Empty:**
  - Reload the browser or extension.
  - See [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../getting-started/validation-support/troubleshooting).

- **Stealth-Blocking Behavior Confusing:**
  - Recognize stealth-blocked domains as ones where blocking is transparent to the webpage but subverted by the blocker.
  - This is a sign of advanced blocking strategies rather than failure.

### Best Practices

- Always use uBO Scope's network connection data for objective comparison.
- Cross-validate multiple sites to get a comprehensive view.
- Avoid relying on content blocker UI block counters or third-party test sites alone.

## How It Fits

This guide complements the [Popup UI Overview](../getting-started-ubo-scope/first-steps-and-ui-overview) and the [Outcome Interpretation Guide](../everyday-use-patterns/interpreting-request-outcomes) by focusing specifically on using uBO Scope to assess how well content blockers actually reduce third-party connections. It replaces unreliable traditional block count metrics with precise domain-based evaluations, helping users make smarter privacy decisions.
