# Debunking Network Blocking Myths with uBO Scope

Understanding the true effectiveness of content blockers is essential for anyone serious about online privacy and performance. However, common industry metrics—like block counts displayed on extension badges or results from ad blocker test pages—can be misleading or outright deceptive. This page clarifies why these traditional measurements fall short and how you can leverage uBO Scope's unique data insights to accurately evaluate any content blocker’s performance.

## Why Common Metrics Mislead You

### 1. Block Counts on Toolbar Badges

Users often compare content blockers based solely on the numeric block count shown on their icons. It seems intuitive: more blocks mean better protection, right? Not necessarily.

- **What Block Counts Represent:** They count individual blocked network requests.
- **What's Missing:** They don't reveal how many distinct third-party servers your browser still connects to.
- **Why it Matters:** A content blocker with a high block count might allow connections to a **greater number of distinct domains**, potentially exposing you to more network activity despite blocking many individual requests.

<u>Example Scenario:</u> 
Imagine two blockers:
- Blocker A blocks 100 requests but still connects to 20 different trackers.
- Blocker B blocks 50 requests but only connects to 5 trackers.

Using only block counts, Blocker A looks better, but it may expose you to more varied third-party data connections.

### 2. Ad Blocker Test Webpages

Ad blocker test sites mimic advertising or tracking behaviors to check if a blocker catches them. While this method may be familiar, it is flawed when assessing modern extension-based blockers like uBO Scope.

- **Why They Fail:** Many blockers use stealth techniques to avoid breaking websites or revealing their presence.
- **Misleading Requests:** Test pages generate fabricated, unrealistic network calls **never encountered in real-world browsing**.
- **Lack of Realism:** Results don’t reflect everyday browsing scenarios and can falsely imply weak or strong blocking.

<u>Bottom Line:</u> Relying on ad blocker test pages does not provide a valid gauge of a content blocker’s effectiveness.

## How uBO Scope Provides Accurate Insight

uBO Scope focuses on what truly matters: **counting the number of distinct third-party servers your browser connects to during real browsing sessions.** It does this by monitoring all outgoing HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket connections through the browser's `webRequest` API, regardless of the content blocker in use.

### Key Points:

- **Distinct Domains vs. Request Counts:** uBO Scope reports the number of unique domains, offering a clearer picture of tracking surface.
- **True Blocking Outcomes:** It differentiates between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections, showing actual results instead of ambiguous block counts.
- **Unbiased Monitoring:** As a companion tool to content blockers, uBO Scope works independently, making it reliable and immune to tricks used by blockers or test webpages.

### What You See in uBO Scope Popup

- **Not Blocked:** Domains from which connections succeeded.
- **Stealth Blocked:** Domains that were redirected or handled stealthily by blockers.
- **Blocked:** Domains from which connection attempts failed.
- **Domain Count Summary:** Total unique domains connected from the active tab.

This granular insight allows you to judge a blocker’s real-world effectiveness accurately.

## Practical Steps to Evaluate Content Blockers Using uBO Scope

<Steps>
<Step title="Install uBO Scope">
Ensure uBO Scope is installed on your browser alongside your preferred content blocker. Installation guides are available for [Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/), and Safari.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup on a Target Website">
Navigate to the website you want to evaluate. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup that reports all third-party connections for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Connection Outcomes">
Inspect the lists under "not blocked," "stealth blocked," and "blocked." Note which domains are allowed through and which are prevented or redirected.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare Domain Counts Instead of Block Counts">
Focus on the total unique third-party domains connected (shown in the summary). A lower domain count generally means better blocking effectiveness.
</Step>
<Step title="Test Across Multiple Sites and Conditions">
Check different websites and scenarios, especially with your content blocker enabled and disabled, to see how network exposure varies.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for Accurate Evaluation

<Tip>
Do not trust block count badges or test sites alone. Use uBO Scope’s domain-based metrics for an objective assessment.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Remember, a blocker that blocks too aggressively without stealth may break website functionality. uBO Scope helps spot such scenarios by showing stealth-blocked connections.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to validate changes after filter updates or installation of new privacy tools.
</Tip>

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Misinterpreting Block Counts:** Don't equate high block counts with better blocking.
- **Using Ad Block Test Pages for Judgement:** These pages simulate unrealistic conditions.
- **Ignoring Stealth Blocking:** Some blockers use subtle methods to prevent detection; uBO Scope reveals these through its stealth category.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues When Using uBO Scope for Evaluations">
<Accordion title="No Data in Popup">
- Ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Confirm that the page is fully loaded.
- Check browser permissions, especially for webRequest API access.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Inconsistent Domain Counts">
- Clear session data or restart the browser to reset internal state.
- Verify that no other extensions interfere with network monitoring.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Confusing Domain Names Displayed">
- uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List and punycode decoding to display domains accurately.
- Some domains may be internationalized; hover or check full domain names if needed.
