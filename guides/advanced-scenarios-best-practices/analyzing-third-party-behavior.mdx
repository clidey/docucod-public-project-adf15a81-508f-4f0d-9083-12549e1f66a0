# Analyzing Third-party Server Behaviors

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you analyze and interpret third-party remote servers contacted by web pages, using uBO Scope's detailed connection reporting. You will learn how to distinguish legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs) from potentially risky or intrusive third-party servers, empowering you to make informed privacy and security decisions.

### Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and active in your browser.
- Basic familiarity with the popup interface, including understanding the categories of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- The browser must be one of the supported versions (e.g., Chrome ≥ 122, Firefox ≥ 128, Safari ≥ 18.5).

### Expected Outcome
After following this guide, you will be able to:
- Identify and classify third-party remote servers contacted by websites in your active tabs.
- Quickly assess which connections are benign (often CDNs) and which might pose privacy risks.
- Use practical tips to triage connections and understand their implications.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10-20 minutes to review, practice, and apply the analysis methods outlined.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate – requires some understanding of web domains and network connections.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup
- Click the uBO Scope browser extension icon in the toolbar.
- Wait for the popup to load the current tab's connection data.
- Verify the tab hostname and domain shown at the top reflect the active webpage.

### 2. Review Domain Connection Outcomes
The popup divides third-party domains into three outcome categories:

- **Allowed:** Domains contacted successfully, indicating permitted connections.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where connections were silently redirected or stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were definitively blocked.

Focus on the **allowed** domains first to understand active network connections.

### 3. Identify the Primary Webpage Domain
- The domain shown in the header is the primary site.
- Third-party connections will be different registered domains.
- Recognize that uBO Scope uses a public suffix list to group domains correctly (e.g., example.co.uk).

### 4. Recognize Common Legitimate Third Parties
- CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) commonly appear as allowed connections (e.g., `cdn.example.com`, `cloudflare.com`).
- These providers typically deliver static content efficiently and are generally harmless regarding privacy.
- Use the count badges next to domains to estimate the volume of resources fetched.

### 5. Spot Potential Privacy Risks
- Unexpected domains or many connections to previously unknown or unrelated hosts may indicate tracking or data collection.
- Pay special attention to allowed connections that are not widely recognized or appear suspicious.
- Consider the stealth-blocked list as evidence of filtering attempts; these connections were intercepted or redirected, potentially revealing attempts to access analytics or tracking servers.

### 6. Use Quick Triage Tips
- Sort or scan domains alphabetically to group by provider.
- Use search tools or external lookup services to investigate unfamiliar domain owners.
- Track whether connections spike on pages with more ads or dynamic content.

### 7. Differentiate Connections by Behavior
- Allowed connections represent the domains your browser accessed successfully.
- Stealth-blocked connections typically represent redirects or modifications not obvious to the page.
- Blocked connections show domains your filters prevented from connecting.

Understand the implications of each outcome category to prioritize privacy enforcement.

### 8. Monitor Badge Counts for Insight
- The toolbar badge count reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.
- Lower counts usually indicate fewer third-party connections and thus a more privacy-conscious session.

### 9. Use Iterative Exploration
- Visit different types of web pages and observe changes in connection patterns.
- Correlate content characteristics (ads, trackers) with domain appearances in the popup.

### 10. Summarize Findings for Action
- Maintain a list of common legitimate domains to whitelist.
- Flag unfamiliar or high-frequency domains for further research.
- Use insights to adjust filter lists or content blocking strategies.

## Examples & Real-World Scenarios

### Example 1: News Website
- Allowed: Domains such as `cdn.provider.com` and `analytics.example.org` appear.
- Action: `cdn.provider.com` is likely delivering static assets; no action needed.
- `analytics.example.org` should be considered a tracking-related connection; stealth-block or block if privacy is a priority.

### Example 2: Online Shopping Site
- Allowed: Connections to payment gateways and ad networks like `ads.partner.com`.
- Blocked: Many ad network domains.
- Interpretation: Some ad networks load stealthily; blocked to protect privacy.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Resolutions">
<Accordion title="No Domains Displayed in Popup">
- Ensure uBO Scope has the required permissions.
- Reload the active tab to trigger requests.
- Verify browser version compatibility.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected High Number of Allowed Domains">
- Some websites use many third parties; this is normal.
- Check for malicious or suspicious domains by researching domain ownership.
- Consider blocking trackers manually or via updated filter lists.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Unknown Hostnames">
- This may happen when no network activity has been recorded yet.
- Refresh the page to trigger more connections.
- Check for extension errors or conflicts with other tools.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Use domain reputation services or WHOIS lookups to validate unfamiliar third-party domains.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Keep your filter lists up to date to improve the stealth-block and block outcome accuracy.
