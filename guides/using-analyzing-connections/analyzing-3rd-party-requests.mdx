# Analyzing 3rd-Party Network Requests on Any Site with uBO Scope

Get hands-on guidance on using uBO Scope to uncover all remote server connections your browser attempts or completes, irrespective of content blocking in place. This guide empowers you to precisely measure what network requests bypass your current blocking setup and understand how uBO Scope categorizes domains as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked—revealing the true behavior of websites against your privacy settings.

---

## 1. Overview of This Workflow

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
This guide walks you through using uBO Scope’s popup interface to analyze any website’s network activity. You will learn how to:
- Interpret domain connection data and categorize network requests.
- Detect third-party services your browser accesses beyond your blocker’s influence.
- Understand the significance of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your browser (see [Install from Official Sources](../getting-started/installation-and-setup/install-from-official-sources)).
- Basic familiarity with browsing and opening extensions’ popup panels.
- A website loaded in an active browser tab whose network connections you want to analyze.

### What You Will Achieve
After completing this guide, you'll confidently interpret uBO Scope’s data about ongoing network requests, revealing:
- All distinct third-party connections made by the current tab.
- Which connections are fully allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked by your setup.
- How these insights help you gauge the effectiveness of your privacy and content blocking controls.

### Estimated Time
Approximately 5-10 minutes to get comfortable with the workflow and interpretation.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner-friendly with clear, immediate actionable steps.

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the Browser Tab to Analyze
Navigate to the website you want to inspect. uBO Scope will monitor the network requests this tab triggers.

### Step 2: Open uBO Scope Popup Panel
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel. It may take a moment to populate.

### Step 3: Understand the Popup Header
- The header shows the **hostname** and **domain** of the current tab.
- Domains are decoded from punycode to a readable format for clarity.

### Step 4: Review the Domain Counts Summary
- The summary shows the total number of unique **allowed** domains connected to by this tab.
- This count reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers from which resources were successfully fetched.

### Step 5: Explore the Three Outcome Sections
The popup divides domains into three categories for clear interpretation:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains which your browser connected to successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or silently blocked to avoid detection by sites.
- **Blocked:** Domains whose network requests failed or were blocked (including DNS and content blocker influence).

### Step 6: Examine Domain Lists and Counts
Within each outcome section:
- Domains are listed alongside how many requests occurred.
- Use this to identify which third parties are active and how frequently.

### Step 7: Relate Observed Domains to Your Privacy Needs
- Lower counts usually indicate tighter privacy.
- Identify unexpected third parties to evaluate risks or filter needs.

### Step 8: Close and Repeat as Needed
Navigate to other tabs or refresh pages to see updated connection summaries.

## 3. Real-World Examples

### Example Scenario: Detecting Bypass Domains
Suppose you have an ad blocker enabled. Using uBO Scope, you open a news website's tab, then:
- The **Not Blocked** section shows common CDN domains your site legitimately requests.
- The **Stealth-Blocked** section reveals requests that your blocker handled silently to avoid interference flags.
- The **Blocked** section shows third-party trackers that your blocker outright prevented.

Interpreting this helps you verify that your blockers are working as expected and flags any third parties bypassing your defenses.

### Example Domain List Snippet
```text
Not Blocked:
- cdn.examplecdn.net (15 requests)
- analytics.service.com (3 requests)

Stealth-Blocked:
- trackers.stealthblock.net (2 requests)

Blocked:
- ads.trackerbad.org (10 requests)
```

## 4. Tips, Best Practices, and Troubleshooting

### Best Practices
- Regularly check uBO Scope while browsing sensitive websites to detect unexpected connections.
- Use insights from domain lists to refine filter lists or privacy settings.
- Refresh pages and observe consistency in domain counts for reliability.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Empty Popup or No Data:** Make sure uBO Scope has proper permissions and the tab is active.
- **Misinterpreting Badge Count:** Remember the toolbar badge shows **distinct allowed third-party domains**, not total requests or blocked counts.
- **Stealth-Blocked Confusion:** Stealth blocking means requests were silently handled — these domains did *not* succeed connecting, but they differ from fully blocked domains.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- Confirm uBO Scope is installed from official stores. 
- Restart the browser if the popup data doesn't update.
- Verify that your browser meets version requirements ([System and Browser Requirements](../getting-started/introduction-and-requirements/system-and-browser-requirements)).
- Visit the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../getting-started/first-steps-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-common-issues) guide for detailed help.

## Appendix: Key Domain Categorization Explained

| Outcome         | Meaning                                                                                         |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Allowed         | Network requests that completed successfully. These are visible, third-party servers your browser connects to. |
| Stealth-Blocked | Requests that were silently intercepted or redirected to prevent detection, often to avoid webpage breakage or detection by trackers. |
| Blocked         | Requests that failed or were outright prevented by your privacy or content blocking setup.                           |

<u>Understanding these categories is essential to correctly interpret the activity seen via uBO Scope.</u>

## Appendix: How uBO Scope Monitors Requests Behind the Scenes

uBO Scope uses your browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor all network requests, regardless of blockers in place. It continuously updates the popup's domain lists and toolbar badge to reflect the real-time state of 
network connections made by each active tab.

For a technical overview of this process, see the [How Does uBO Scope Work? (Architecture Diagram)](/overview/understanding-architecture-concepts/system-architecture-diagram) documentation.
