# Comparing Content Blockers Using uBO Scope

Unlock the true effectiveness of content blockers by using uBO Scope to measure real network connection behavior. This guide walks you through practical scenarios to compare multiple content blockers objectively, enabling you to interpret meaningful metrics beyond superficial block counts. Discover how to read domain connection summaries, debunk misleading block totals, and confidently run tests that reflect real-world browsing.

---

## 1. Introduction

When choosing a content blocker, raw blocking statistics can be deceptive. uBO Scope shifts the focus to the core privacy metric: the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connects to. Lower domain counts typically indicate superior content blocking, reducing your exposure to tracking and unnecessary remote requests.

This guide will help you:
- Use uBO Scope's popup panel to analyze network requests made during browsing sessions with different content blockers.
- Understand the significance of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connection categories.
- Identify common misconceptions about block totals and badge counts.
- Run realistic tests to assess content blockers in scenarios that mirror actual web usage.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, ensure you have:
- Installed uBO Scope on your preferred browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+). See [Install from Official Sources](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/install-from-official-sources) for detailed instructions.
- Multiple content blockers installed and ready to switch between for comparison.
- Basic familiarity with using uBO Scope's popup panel. Refer to [Understanding the Popup Panel and Toolbar Badge](/guides/getting-started/understanding-popup-and-badge) to get comfortable with the UI and badge meanings.
- Realistic test websites or browsing scenarios where you expect third-party connections (avoid synthetic ad blocker test pages, which are unreliable).

## 3. Workflow for Comparing Content Blockers

Use the following step-by-step workflow to compare how different content blockers handle third-party network requests.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Browsing Environment

1. Open your browser and disable all content blockers except one.
2. Clear your browser cache or open a fresh private/incognito window to avoid cached behavior.
3. Navigate to a real-world website you want to test (preferably one with known third-party content).

### Step 2: Open uBO Scope Popup for the Current Tab

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- The popup will display:
  - The current tab's hostname and domain at the top.
  - A summary count of distinct domains connected.
  - Three sections listing domains by outcome:
    - **Not blocked (allowed):** Domains your browser successfully connected to.
    - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where the request was silently redirected or blocked stealthily.
    - **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were explicitly blocked or failed.

### Step 3: Analyze the Data

- Focus on the number of distinct connected domains (displayed next to "domains connected" in the summary).
- Review which domains appear in each section:
  - Fewer allowed domains typically indicate stricter and more effective blocking.
  - Notice domains in stealth-blocked and blocked sections, as stealth blocking is a common advanced technique to avoid breakage while blocking.

### Step 4: Record Your Observations

- Take note or screenshot the domain counts and key domains listed.
- For deeper comparison, list the exact domains allowed and blocked.

### Step 5: Switch Content Blockers and Repeat

- Disable the current content blocker and enable the next one.
- Reload the test website.
- Repeat Steps 2-4 to gather network connection data for each content blocker.

### Step 6: Compare Results Objectively

- Compare the distinct domain counts: lower counts reveal fewer third-party connections.
- Avoid relying on raw block counts or toolbar icon badge numbers from blockers themselves; uBO Scope's domain view is a more accurate privacy indicator.
- Look for differences in stealth-blocked domains to understand blockers’ hidden behaviors.

---

## 4. Interpreting Key Metrics

### Domain Count Summary

- The number next to "domains connected" represents distinct third-party domains your browser connected to during the page load.
- A lower number means fewer remote servers fetched, implying better privacy protection.

### Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, Blocked Sections

- **Allowed (Not blocked):** Domains your browser accessed resources from.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where the extension blocked or redirected requests without the page knowing, preventing detection or breakage.
- **Blocked:** Domains with explicit connection failures, showing straightforward blocking.

### Why Domain Count Matters Over Raw Block Numbers

- A blocker with a high block count may still allow connections to many distinct domains, meaning more exposure.
- uBO Scope debunks the myth "more blocks = better blocking" by focusing on actual network connections, not just block events.

---

## 5. Real-World Testing Tips

- **Avoid adblock test pages:** These pages use artificial URL patterns which don't represent normal browsing and often fail to detect stealth blocking.
- **Use popular or complex websites:** Sites with external analytics, ad networks, CDNs, and API calls provide meaningful data.
- **Test multiple pages per blocker:** Some blockers vary behavior by content or domain.
- **Reload pages or open new tabs:** To refresh uBO Scope data and catch requests anew.

## 6. Example Comparison Scenario

Imagine testing three content blockers: Blocker A, Blocker B, and Blocker C on a popular news website.

| Step                  | Blocker A             | Blocker B             | Blocker C           |
|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Domains Connected     | 27                   | 15                   | 22                  |
| Allowed Domains       | analytics.example.com,<br>cdn.example.com,...   | cdn.example.com only    | analytics.example.com,cdn.example.com,... |
| Stealth-Blocked Domains| 5                    | 10                   | 7                   |
| Blocked Domains       | 8                    | 2                    | 4                   |

**Interpretation:**
- Blocker B has the lowest domain count, indicating it blocks more third-party servers effectively.
- Stealth-blocking by Blocker B suggests it hides some blocking to avoid detection on the page.
- Blocker A has many allowed domains, indicating weaker blocking despite more blocked events.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Panel Results">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows ‘NO DATA’ or Empty Results">
- Ensure you have granted uBO Scope the required permissions.
- Reload or navigate to a new page to trigger network activity.
- Confirm the active tab is correctly captured.
- See [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/first-steps-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-common-issues) for detailed help.
