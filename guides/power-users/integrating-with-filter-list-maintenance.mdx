# Integrating with Filter List Maintenance Workflows

## Workflow Overview

Maintaining up-to-date and effective filter lists requires accurate verification of how blocking rules affect real network requests. This guide demonstrates how uBO Scope empowers filter list maintainers by providing transparent insights into actual network request outcomes during web browsing, especially on platforms where native browser debugging tools are limited or unavailable.

### Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and enabled in a supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with filter lists and blocking concepts.
- Access to filter list rules you want to verify in context.

### Expected Outcome
Filter maintainers will be able to:
- Verify which third-party domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked during browsing.
- Confirm the real-world effect of their filters on network requests.
- Use uBO Scope’s popup interface as an effective validation tool on constrained devices.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15-30 minutes to perform an initial verification and understand outcomes.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate (knowledge of filter lists and network request classification is helpful).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

<u>**Using uBO Scope to Verify Filter List Effectiveness**</u>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup on the Target Website">
    Navigate to a web page where your filter rules should apply. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup interface. This interface reports all third-party connections initiated during the page load.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Interpret Connection Outcomes">
    Review the three categorized sections in the popup:
    - **not blocked:** Domains that made network requests successfully.
    - **stealth-blocked:** Requests that were silently blocked to avoid detection but not reported as blocked by content blockers.
    - **blocked:** Explicitly blocked requests.

    Confirm these match your expectations based on the filter rules deployed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze Domain Counts and Frequencies">
    Each domain listed includes a count of connections made. This helps prioritize which domains are most active and may require attention.
    
    Compare these active domains against your filter list entries to ensure relevant targeting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate on Devices with Limited Debugging">
    On constrained platforms (e.g., mobile devices or restricted OS environments), rely on uBO Scope’s popup as your primary source of network request verification because standard devtools may be unavailable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate Filter Rules Based on Observed Outcomes">
    If unexpected domains appear in the **not blocked** section, update your filter list to address them.
    For stealth-blocked domains, confirm whether your filter rules effectively stealth block these domains or require tuning.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeat Testing to Confirm Changes">
    Reload the website and open uBO Scope again to observe changes after filter updates. Confirm the outcomes align with your intended blocking behavior.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Ensure uBO Scope has all necessary permissions enabled (webRequest, activeTab, host permissions) for accurate reporting.
</Check>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Use Domain-Level Focus:** When analyzing results, focus on domains rather than hostnames for broader blocking coverage.
- **Interpret Stealth Blocking Carefully:** Stealth-blocked entries indicate successful but silent blocking, which might not reflect in browser console errors.
- **Regularly Refresh Session Data:** Close and re-open tabs or the browser occasionally to clear stale session data and get accurate current results.
- **Combine with Filter Testing Sites:** Use real-world sites known for heavy third-party connections, rather than synthetic ad blocker test pages, to gauge filter effectiveness accurately.
- **Anticipate Upcoming Features:** The extension is planned to add more detailed network request insights, enhancing your maintenance workflow further.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Tips for Filter List Maintainers">
<Accordion title="No Data or Empty Popup">
Verify the extension’s permissions and ensure the current tab’s domain is supported. Reload the page and extension if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Domains in 'not blocked' Section">
Confirm that filters are correctly applied and not overridden by other extensions or browser settings. Double-check the syntax and scope of your filter rules.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth-Blocked Domains Not Matching Expectations">
Remember stealth blocking can be browser or rule dependent. If inconsistencies arise, consult the filter list syntax and verify the blocking methodology.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Limited Visibility on Certain Browsers or Versions">
Ensure you are running the minimum supported browser versions (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+). Older versions have incomplete webRequest API support.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Examples

Below is an illustrative example of how uBO Scope might present domain activity during filter list verification.

### Example Scenario
You maintain a filter list and want to verify it blocks tracking domains on example-news-site.com.

- You visit example-news-site.com and open uBO Scope.
- The popup shows **not blocked** domains including cdn.example.com and analytics.safehost.com.
- The **stealth-blocked** section lists tracker.exampletracking.net.
- The **blocked** section includes ads.badadnetwork.com.

This tells you:
- Your filter list successfully blocks the known ad network.
- The tracker domain is stealth-blocked as intended.
- Analytics domains are allowed — you might decide if that is acceptable or needs filter adjustment.

This concise, categorized feedback empowers you to fine-tune your filter list with confidence.
