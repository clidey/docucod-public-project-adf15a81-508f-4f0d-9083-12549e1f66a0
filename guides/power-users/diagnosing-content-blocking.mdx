# Diagnosing Content Blocking and Filter Reliability

## Overview

This guide empowers you to use uBO Scope to effectively diagnose how well your content blocker performs against third-party connections. You will learn how to detect stealth blocking behavior and identify network requests that might be overlooked by your existing filters. Additionally, the guide provides actionable methods to accurately assess content blocking and avoid common pitfalls caused by misleading 'ad blocker test' webpages.

---

## What You Will Achieve

- Compare different content blockers or filter lists by inspecting third-party request outcomes
- Identify stealth blocking, where requests are blocked without apparent indications
- Detect third-party connections that bypass your filters, revealing potential privacy gaps
- Avoid false conclusions from fabricated 'ad blocker test' scenarios

---

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope extension installed in your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+)
- Basic familiarity with uBO Scope’s popup interface and its connection outcomes: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked
- Understanding of what constitutes a third-party domain vs. first-party (refer to Essential Concepts & Terminology)
- Other content blockers enabled for comparison, if applicable

---

## Time Estimate

15–30 minutes, depending on how deeply you investigate third-party connections

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Open uBO Scope Popup for the Current Tab

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup interface.
- Ensure that the active tab is the website you wish to audit.

### 2. Understand the Connection Outcome Categories

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Requests that successfully connected to third-party domains.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests that were blocked silently without explicit indication to the website; these connections never occurred but appear as if they might have.
- **Blocked:** Requests actively blocked by your content blocker or DNS filtering.

### 3. Analyze Third-Party Domains Reported

- Review the list of domains under each category for the current webpage.
- Large numbers of allowed domains suggest that connections are passing through your filters.

### 4. Compare Across Different Blocking Configurations

- Temporarily disable or enable different content blockers or filter lists.
- Observe changes in the uBO Scope popup to see how the counts of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains shift.

### 5. Detect Stealth Blocking Behavior

- Look for domains listed under the stealth-blocked section.
- These are requests that your blocker hides from the page but still considers blocked.
- This detection helps understand if stealth blocking is active and how it impacts request visibility.

### 6. Identify Overlooked Requests

- Pay special attention to domains consistently listed as allowed even when you expect blocking.
- These might represent gaps in your content blocking strategy.

### 7. Avoid Misinterpretation from 'Ad Blocker Test' Pages

- Do NOT rely on fabricated test pages designed to detect ad blockers.
- These pages often fire artificial or unrealistic network requests that do not reflect real-world browsing.
- Use uBO Scope’s real connection reporting instead to verify actual blocking behavior.

### 8. Make Informed Decisions

- Based on your findings, adjust filter lists or content blockers accordingly.
- Prioritize minimizing allowed third-party domains for better privacy.
- Use stealth blocking detection to fine-tune stealth techniques or diagnose breakage.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Perform Audits on Real Websites:** Choose diverse sites that reflect your browsing habits rather than artificial test pages.
- **Use Multiple Blockers Sequentially:** To identify incremental blocking benefits or conflicts.
- **Interpret Badge Counts Contextually:** Badge shows distinct connected third-party domains, not block counts.
- **Refresh Websites After Changes:** Always reload a page after toggling blockers to see accurate connection data.
- **Take Notes of Persistent Allowed Domains:** Investigate if these are necessary CDNs or potential privacy risks.

---

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Empty or Missing Popup Data

- Confirm uBO Scope has necessary permissions (webRequest, activeTab).
- Reload the webpage and reopen the popup.
- Check that the extension is enabled and not blocked by browser policies.

### Misleading 'Ad Blocker Test' Results

- Understand these tests may not represent real browsing.
- Rely on uBO Scope’s reporting on actual third-party connections instead.

### Unclear Stealth Blocking Indication

- Stealth blocking appears as a separate section; a moderate amount is normal for stealthy blockers.
- Excessive stealth blocks may require reviewing blocker settings for possible overblocking or breakage.

### Comparing Blockers Shows Higher Allowed Domains Unexpectedly

- Remember a higher block count does not imply better privacy if allowed third-party connections increase.
- Use domain-level visibility in the popup to assess overall exposure.

---

## Examples

### Comparing Filter Lists

1. Load a news website.
2. Enable one filter list and open uBO Scope popup.
3. Note allowed vs blocked domain count.
4. Disable that filter and enable another.
5. Observe any reductions in allowed domains and changes in blocked or stealth-blocked.

### Detecting Stealth Blocking

- Visit a privacy-sensitive site.
- If stealth-blocked domains appear, it shows stealth blocking is active.
- This reveals your content blocker manipulates requests invisibly.

## Summary

This guide transforms uBO Scope into a powerful diagnostic tool for content blocking reliability. By carefully analyzing allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains, users can detect stealth blocking, uncover overlooked connections, and avoid the trap of unreliable block indicator tests. These insights support informed decision-making to maximize privacy and filter efficacy.

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Problem | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Popup empty or no data | Verify permissions, reload page, ensure extension enabled |
| Unexpectedly many allowed domains | Compare with different blockers or filter lists, reload after changes |
| Stealth blocking unclear | Recognize stealth section in popup, moderate stealth blocks normal |
| Misleading 'ad blocker test' results | Avoid such test pages; rely on real browsing data instead |
