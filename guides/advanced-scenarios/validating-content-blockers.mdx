# Validating Content Blocker Effectiveness with uBO Scope

## Overview

This guide provides a practical walkthrough to assess the real privacy performance of content blockers by leveraging uBO Scope's unique approach to monitoring network connections. It emphasizes why uBO Scope's focus on counting distinct third-party servers your browser connects to—especially through its reporting of stealth-blocked and allowed connections—is more meaningful than relying on traditional block counters or synthetic "ad blocker test" pages.

You'll learn how to use uBO Scope effectively for benchmarking content blockers, identify hidden or stealthy network activity that may evade common detection, and apply best practices to get accurate and actionable privacy insights.

---

## Prerequisites

- You have uBO Scope installed and properly configured in your browser. For installation instructions, see [Installing the Extension](../../getting-started/installation-setup/install-extension).
- The extension has the necessary permissions granted and is active. Refer to [Initial Configuration & Permissions](../../getting-started/installation-setup/basic-configuration).
- Familiarity with basic network privacy concepts and what third-party connections are. See [Core Concepts & Terminology](../../overview/product-intro-core-concepts/core-concepts-terminology).
- Basic understanding of your current content blocker setup (e.g., uBlock Origin, browser built-in blockers).

---

## What You Will Achieve

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

- Accurately measure how effectively your content blocker reduces third-party connections.
- Differentiate between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked network requests.
- Use uBO Scope’s third-party server reporting to reveal hidden connections invisible to common block counters.
- Avoid common pitfalls like relying on synthetic "ad blocker test" websites.

Estimated Time: 10-15 minutes

Difficulty: Intermediate (for users familiar with content blockers and basic network privacy concepts)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Understand uBO Scope’s Metrics and Reporting

Before testing, understand these key outcome categories presented in uBO Scope’s popup and badge:

- **Allowed:** Third-party servers your browser successfully connected to and loaded resources from.
- **Blocked:** Servers for which a network request was made but blocked by your content blocker or other means.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests silently redirected or canceled by the blocker, which don’t produce a traditional block event but are prevented from loading.

<u>uBO Scope reports the **count of distinct third-party domains** in these categories, not just simple request counts.</u> uBO Scope's badge shows the number of unique allowed third-party servers. Fewer allowed third parties means better privacy.

<Check>
Rely on uBO Scope’s third-party domain counts rather than traditional block counts to evaluate the true privacy impact.
</Check>

---

### Step 2: Prepare Your Browsing Environment

1. **Disable other privacy measurement tools and browser features** which might interfere with accurate reporting.
2. **Access a real-world, privacy-critical website** to assess content blocker effectiveness in realistic conditions (avoid artificial "ad blocker test" pages).
3. Open uBO Scope popup by clicking the extension icon near the browser’s address bar.

<Info>
Remember that stealth-blocked connections represent subtle blocking behavior often missed by other tools. uBO Scope uniquely surface this information.
</Info>

---

### Step 3: Observe uBO Scope’s Data During Browsing

- The popup categorizes domains into **Allowed**, **Blocked**, and **Stealth-Blocked** sections with counts per domain.
- The badge shows the count of distinct allowed third-party domains; a lower number implies better content blocking.

Spend some time browsing the website you want to test and watch how uBO Scope updates:

- Notice domains that appear under each outcome.
- Pay attention to domains in the **Allowed** category—these represent third parties loading resources successfully.
- Investigate **Stealth-Blocked** domains as these indicate connections that your content blocker prevented silently.

<Note>
The number of distinct allowed third-party servers is the most relevant metric for privacy-focused assessment.
</Note>

---

### Step 4: Benchmark Against Other Content Blockers or Settings

To evaluate different content blockers or configurations:

1. **Close all tabs and restart your browser** to clear any stale data.
2. Enable your first content blocker and navigate to the test website.
3. Observe and record the distinct allowed third-party domain count and the stealth-blocked and blocked domains in the uBO Scope popup.
4. Repeat with alternative content blockers or different filter list combinations.

This comparative process reveals which setup minimizes unique exposed third-party connections best.

<Tip>
Run multiple browsing sessions or different websites to understand how consistent the blocking performance is across scenarios.
</Tip>

---

### Step 5: Identify Stealthy or Unexpected Network Activity

- Domains appearing under **Stealth-Blocked** indicate blocking that may not be visible with less sophisticated tools.
- Unexpected allowed third-party connections could reveal:
  - Tracking services bypassing filters.
  - Content served via CDNs or third parties you might want to block.
  - False negatives in filter lists.

<Check>
Use uBO Scope’s detailed breakdown to refine your filter lists or adjust settings for tighter privacy.
</Check>

---

### Step 6: Avoid Using Ad Blocker Test Webpages

<u>uBO Scope documentation warns against relying on synthetic ad blocker test pages:</u>

- Such pages use fabricated and unrealistic network request patterns.
- They cannot detect stealth blocking reliably.
- Testing on real websites offers meaningful insights instead.

Choose legitimate, privacy-conscious websites for validation.

## Practical Example

Suppose you want to compare uBlock Origin’s default settings with an enhanced strict filter list:

1. Install uBlock Origin, enable default filters, open a news site.
2. Open uBO Scope popup and observe allowed third-party domains—say 35.
3. Switch uBlock Origin filter lists to an enhanced strict list.
4. Reload the site, open uBO Scope popup again and see allowed third-party domains reduced to 12.
5. Stealth-Blocked domains increased, showing silent block actions.

This process confirms the strict list’s effectiveness beyond simple block counts.

---

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Pitfall: Badge Count Is Misleading

- The toolbar badge counts distinct **allowed** third-party domains, not blocked requests.
- A high block count might correlate with more allowed third parties, meaning worse privacy.

### Pitfall: No Data Appears or Does Not Update

- Verify that uBO Scope has necessary permissions (see [Basic Configuration & Permissions](../../getting-started/installation-setup/basic-configuration)).
- Confirm browser supports the `webRequest` API for your environment.
- Restart the browser and reload tabs.

### Pitfall: Synthetic Test Pages Show Different Results than Real Sites

- Avoid trusting synthetic tests for content blocker evaluation.
- Use diverse real-world sites for more reliable insights.

<Warning>
uBO Scope depends on browser network event reporting; some browsers or configurations may limit data accuracy.
</Warning>

---

## Best Practices

- Regularly cross-check different content blocker configurations with uBO Scope's reporting.
- Use real browsing sessions for extended periods to capture all network activity variations.
- Combine uBO Scope’s insights with content blocker logs or developer tools for deeper analysis.
- Use the stealth-blocked domain list to improve filter lists or identify evasive third parties.
