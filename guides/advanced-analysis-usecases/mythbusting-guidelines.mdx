# Mythbusting: Sound Web Privacy Practices with uBO Scope

## Overview

This guide helps you use uBO Scope to clear up common misconceptions about web privacy measurement and content blocker effectiveness. It explains why simple metrics like block counts or ad blocker test pages can mislead you and shows how focusing on the number of distinct third-party connections provides genuine insights into your privacy exposure. Learn to use uBO Scope to meaningfully compare content blockers or assess website network behaviors with confidence.

---

## Why Traditional Metrics Are Misleading

### Myth #1: Higher Block Counts Mean Better Privacy Protection

Many users assume that a content blocker reporting more blocked items is inherently more effective. However, block counts alone can be deceptive. A blocker could register a high number of blocks yet allow connections to more unique third-party servers. That means you might actually be exposed to more external tracking despite the high block count.

uBO Scope refocuses this evaluation by showing the distinct third-party domains your browser connects to, regardless of which content blocker you use. A lower count here reflects better privacy protection, as it indicates fewer third-party networks reached by your browsing.

### Myth #2: Ad Blocker Test Websites Accurately Reflect Blocking Performance

Specialized test pages designed to showcase ad blockers’ performance often do not represent real-world browsing. They use artificial network requests and scenarios that extensions purposely handle stealthily to avoid page breakage and detection.

Consequently, these test sites may not reveal the true network exposure or blocking efficacy. Instead, use uBO Scope to monitor actual domain-level connections during your real browsing sessions for an honest picture.

## How to Use uBO Scope for Accurate Privacy Insights

### 1. Monitor Distinct Third-Party Domains

When you browse, uBO Scope tracks the number of unique third-party remote servers contacted. This count appears as a badge on the browser toolbar icon and inside the popup UI, reflecting real network exposure.

> **Tip:** Values shown by uBO Scope are always relative to the current page's network requests and report all connection outcomes, whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

### 2. Focus on Per-Domain Connection Data

Beyond block counts, uBO Scope lists third-party domains contacted categorized by outcome:

- **Allowed:** Domains successfully connected to
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections prevented silently
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked

Review these lists in the popup to understand which domains a site accesses and how your blockers handle them.

### 3. Compare Content Blockers Meaningfully

Instead of comparing toolbar block counts, install uBO Scope alongside your blockers and observe how each affects the distinct third-party connections:

- A blocker allowing more unique domains might be less protective, even if its block count is higher.
- Look for blockers that minimize your third-party domain exposure.

### 4. Use Real-World Browsing Patterns

Avoid test pages with fabricated requests. Use uBO Scope during your everyday browsing to see authentic data about network connections and privacy exposure.

## Step-by-Step Workflow to Leverage uBO Scope for Privacy Assessment

<Steps>
<Step title="Install and Launch uBO Scope">
Ensure uBO Scope is installed and running in your preferred browser. Locate the uBO Scope icon on your toolbar to access the popup interface.
</Step>
<Step title="Browse Normally and Open the Popup">
Visit websites you want to assess, then click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup. Wait a moment as uBO Scope collects network request data for your active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Badge and Domain Counts">
Observe the badge number reflecting the distinct third-party domains actively connected. Lower counts generally mean less exposure.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Detailed Domain Categories">
Within the popup, examine:
- **Allowed domains:** Know which third-party servers the page loaded from.
- **Stealth-blocked domains:** Domains that were silently prevented to avoid detection or breakage.
- **Blocked domains:** Domains explicitly blocked by your content blocker.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare Blockers or Sites">
Try different content blockers or different sites and observe changes in third-party domain counts and domain lists. Use this data to judge privacy impact and blocker effectiveness beyond simplistic metrics.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Trust the domain count, not the block count:** Focus on the number of distinct third-party domains contacted by a site for a true measure of exposure.
- **Use uBO Scope alongside your content blockers:** It does not block content itself but provides unbiased insight into connection attempts.
- **Ignore ad blocker test sites:** Focus on real-world web navigation to measure actual privacy exposure.
- **Interpret stealth-blocked domains as silent protection:** These are connections your blockers prevented without alerting the site; valuable but invisible in common metrics.
- **Regularly review connections on frequently visited sites:** Sites can change third-party networks often, adjusting your exposure.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Using **block count on toolbar icons** to compare blockers, which can lead to wrong conclusions.
- Relying on **static or test webpages** that do not reflect typical browsing patterns.
- Misunderstanding **stealth-blocked** vs. **blocked** domains, expecting all blocking to appear as counts in other interfaces.

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Appears in Popup

- Ensure you have allowed necessary permissions during installation.
- Confirm the extension is active and not disabled.
- Refresh the webpage and reopen uBO Scope popup to capture fresh data.

### Badge Does Not Update

- Check if the browser supports `webRequest` API and uBO Scope’s requirements.
- Restart your browser to reset extension state.
- Disable conflicting extensions that might interfere.

### Unexpected High Counts

- Review domain lists in the popup to investigate which third parties are contacted.
- Confirm you are browsing typical sites and not test or development pages.
