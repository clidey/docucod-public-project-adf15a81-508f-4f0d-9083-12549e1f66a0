# Comparing Content Blockers Using uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide empowers you to use uBO Scope to compare how different content blockers affect network connections your browser makes. With practical, step-by-step scenarios, you will learn to identify the third-party servers contacted, understand the distinctions between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections, and evaluate the effectiveness of content blocking strategies through meaningful metrics rather than superficial block counts.

---

## What You Will Achieve
- Understand how uBO Scope measures network connections despite active content blockers.
- Contrast behaviors of different content blockers by observing domains contacted.
- Identify third-party servers that remain visible or are stealth-blocked.
- Make informed decisions on which blockers better protect your privacy.

## Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and activated in your browser.
- Familiarity with opening the uBO Scope popup UI (see guide: [Exploring the Popup UI: Domains and Statuses](https://docs.example.com/guides/getting-started-workflows/understanding-popup-ui)).
- At least two content blockers installed or enabled, for comparison.
- Basic knowledge of web browsing and network connection concepts.

## Estimated Time
~15-30 minutes depending on the depth of comparison.

## Difficulty Level
Intermediate – requires hands-on analysis and interpretation.

# Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Environment

- Disable all content blockers except the first one you want to test.
- Open a new browser tab and navigate to a website where you want to analyze network connections.

<Tip>
Use a realistic, regularly visited site rather than a synthetic testing page to get an accurate picture of real-world connections.
</Tip>

### 2. Open uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
- Observe the hostname displayed at the top – this is the website currently active.
- Note the "domains connected" count – this tells you how many distinct third-party servers your browser connected to.

### 3. Study Domain Outcomes

Examine the three main connection outcome sections:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains from which connections went through successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains for which connections were subtly prevented or redirected to avoid detection.
- **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked from connecting.

Take note of the number and names of third-party domains under each section.

### 4. Record Observations

- Screenshot the popup UI or write down key domain names and counts in each category.
- Pay special attention to domains that frequently appear in "Allowed" despite your content blocker.

### 5. Switch Content Blockers

- Disable the first content blocker.
- Enable the second content blocker you want to compare.
- Refresh the website tab.

### 6. Repeat uBO Scope Analysis

- Open the uBO Scope popup again.
- Observe changes in the connected domains and the distribution across "Allowed," "Stealth-blocked," and "Blocked."

### 7. Compare Results

- Identify which content blocker resulted in fewer distinct third-party domains connected.
- Notice if one blocker achieves stealth blocking more effectively.
- Assess if a blocker with a high block count actually results in fewer allowed connections (a common misconception).

<Tip>
Remember, the goal is to minimize the number of distinct third-party domains contacted, not just maximize block counts.
</Tip>

### 8. Repeat as Needed

- Try multiple websites or different browsing sessions to confirm findings.
- Optionally, clear browser data or open a new browser profile for clean tests to avoid cached connections.

## Key Indicators of Effective Content Blocking

- **Low domain count in "Not Blocked" section:** Indicates fewer third-party servers are actually contacted.
- **Presence of stealth-blocked domains:** Shows the content blocker hides blocking activity effectively.
- **Balanced blocked domains list:** Too many blocked domains might indicate aggressive blocking that risks page breakage.

<Tip>
Legitimate third-party services, such as CDNs, should appear minimally in "Not Blocked" indicating essential resources allowed through.
</Tip>

## Practical Examples

Imagine you are comparing Content Blocker A and Content Blocker B on `example-news-site.com`:

| Test Step           | Content Blocker A              | Content Blocker B              |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Domains Not Blocked  | 8 (includes 3rd-party ads)     | 4 (strict blocking, no ads)    |
| Stealth-Blocked     | 1 (tracking servers)           | 3 (tracking servers & social) |
| Blocked Domains      | 10                            | 7                             |

From this, Content Blocker B shows fewer allowed third-party servers and more stealth blocking, making it more privacy protective.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or '?'">
- Confirm that you have navigated to a valid active tab where uBO Scope can capture network requests.
- Ensure content blockers and uBO Scope are enabled.
- Refresh the website tab and try reopening the popup.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Conflicting Content Blockers Not Appearing Correctly">
- Browser limitations can delay or interfere with monitoring.
- Test blockers separately with fresh tabs.
- Review your browser permissions to allow uBO Scope to observe webRequest events.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Use the badge count on uBO Scope's toolbar icon as a quick indication of total distinct third-party servers contacted by the current tab. A lower number usually means better privacy.
</Tip>

## Advanced Considerations

- Understand that some content blockers perform stealth blocking to avoid detection and prevent webpage breakage, which uBO Scope highlights in the "Stealth-blocked" section.
- Beware of simplistic metrics like block count badges on other blockers—uBO Scope's focus on actual third-party domains contacted reveals the real privacy impact.

## Next Steps

- Consult the guide [Exploring the Popup UI: Domains and Statuses](https://docs.example.com/guides/getting-started-workflows/understanding-popup-ui) for detailed UI explanations.
- Learn to interpret toolbar badge metrics with [Interpreting Toolbar Badge Counts and Metrics](https://docs.example.com/guides/getting-started-workflows/interpreting-badge-counts).
- Validate your setup using [Validating Setup: Ensuring Accurate Measurement](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/getting-using/validation).
- Deepen your understanding on myths about ad blockers in [Common Testing Myths and Best Practices](https://docs.example.com/guides/practical-analyses-advanced-usage/debunking-myths).

---

## Summary
Using uBO Scope to compare content blockers offers a reliable, data-driven approach to understand how effectively they reduce third-party network connections from your browser. By focusing on distinct remote server domains contacted, and differentiating stealth and explicit blocking outcomes, you will gain actionable insight to optimize your privacy and browsing security.
