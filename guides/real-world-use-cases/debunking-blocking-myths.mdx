# Debunking Blocking Myths and Bad Test Sites

## Overview

This guide reveals how uBO Scope exposes misleading claims about content blocker performance by analyzing the limitations of popular ad blocker test pages and addressing common misconceptions. Users will gain evidence-backed insights into actual network connection behavior as reported by the extension, empowering them to evaluate content blockers more accurately.

## Why This Matters

Many users trust ad blocker test websites or block count badges to assess blocker effectiveness. However, these sources often produce inaccurate or incomplete results. uBO Scope cuts through these myths by showing the reality of network connections, making it clear why some assumptions about "better blocking" are incorrect.

---

## 1. Understanding Common Blocking Myths

### Myth 1: "A higher block count means better blocking"

- **What users often think:** The more requests an ad blocker blocks, the better it is.
- **What really happens:** A higher block count can correlate with more network connections allowed from a greater number of third-party servers. This means a blocker with a high block count may actually allow more third-party servers overall, resulting in less effective blocking.

### Myth 2: "Popular 'ad blocker test' websites provide reliable results"

- **What these sites do:** They generate artificial, unrealistic network requests designed to trigger blocker detection or errors.
- **Why this is misleading:** Extension-based blockers often operate stealthily to avoid breaking websites or exposing themselves, so these tests fail to accurately detect true blocking behavior.
- **Effect on users:** Relying on these sites can mislead users about the real-world protection their content blockers provide.

<Info>
Always prefer real browsing analysis over test sites. Use uBO Scope to inspect actual network connections for genuine insights.

## 2. How uBO Scope Reveals the Truth

uBO Scope leverages the browser's webRequest API to transparently track all network connections initiated by web pages, categorizing them as:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully made.
- **Blocked:** Connections intentionally prevented.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections indirectly prevented, for example, by redirects or stealth techniques.

By presenting these details per-domain and summarizing third-party server exposure, uBO Scope helps users see beyond simplistic block counts and fabricated test cases.

## 3. Practical Examples of Debunking Myths Using uBO Scope

### Example A: Comparing Two Content Blockers with Different Block Counts

1. Enable uBO Scope and open a real-world website.
2. Observe the popup panel listing allowed third-party domains.
3. Switch between two blockers and note the:
   - Number of blocked connections (block count badge).
   - Actual number of distinct third-party domains allowed (uBO Scope popup).
4. Notice that the blocker with the lower block count often results in fewer allowed third-party domains, indicating stronger blocking.

### Example B: Assessing Ad Blocker Test Websites

1. Visit a popular "ad blocker test" site while uBO Scope is enabled.
2. Check the number of third-party domains contacted.
3. Observe that many domains in these tests do not reflect typical real-world sites and may skew blocking results.
4. Understand that the stealth-blocking by extensions is not apparent to such test pages, rendering their results unreliable.

<Warning>
Do not trust ad blocker test webpages as definitive indicators of blocker effectiveness.
</Warning>

## 4. Using uBO Scope to Validate Content Blocking in Your Browsing

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup Panel">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel showing connection details for the current tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domain Categories">
Examine the allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domain lists to understand which third-party servers your browser contacted.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Toolbar Badge">
Use the badge number as a count of distinct allowed third-party domains to measure actual network exposure.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare with Block Counts">
Do not rely solely on blocker badges showing block counts; cross-check with uBO Scope's domain lists.
</Step>
<Step title="Repeat on Various Websites">
Perform this inspection across different sites to spot patterns and filter list effectiveness.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Best Practices and Tips

- Always use uBO Scopeâ€™s domain summaries rather than block count badges to assess privacy exposure.
- Disable or ignore third-party ad blocker test pages; prefer real-world site analysis.
- Look for the **lowest number of allowed third-party domains** as an indicator of effective blocking.
- Consider the presence of stealth-blocked domains as a sign that blockers actively prevent connections not visible to the site.
- Use the data uBO Scope provides to inform filter list improvements or blocker choice.

<Tip>
For filter list maintainers, uBO Scope's detailed network insights help identify weaknesses in rulesets and avoid false positives caused by unrealistic test domains.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Misunderstandings when Using uBO Scope to Debunk Myths">
<Accordion title="Misinterpreting Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Stealth-blocked domains aren't failures but indications of successful stealth content blocking by your extension. Check the 'stealth' section to appreciate these subtle blocks.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Confusing Block Counts with Exposure">
Block counts correspond to number of blocked attempts, not total third-party domains contacted. Focus on allowed domain counts instead to understand exposure.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Expecting Test Sites to Behave Like Real Sites">
Remember that ad blocker test sites may send artificial requests; always validate findings on normal websites.
