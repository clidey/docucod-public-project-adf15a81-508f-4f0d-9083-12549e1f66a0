# Comparing Content Blockers Accurately

## Overview

This guide helps you use **uBO Scope** to accurately compare the effectiveness of different content blockers. It clarifies common misconceptions around badge counts and block numbers, explaining why these can be misleading indicators of blocking quality. You will learn a reliable workflow to assess third-party network connections and make informed judgments about content blocker performance based on real-world network activity.

---

## What This Guide Will Help You Achieve

- Understand the true meaning behind uBO Scope's badge count and domain categorizations.
- Learn why block counts alone don't reflect blocking strength or privacy protection.
- Use uBO Scope's popup to compare how different content blockers affect distinct third-party server connections.
- Follow a systematic approach to verify which network requests actually reach remote servers.

---

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
- At least two content blockers installed or activated for comparison.
- Basic familiarity with how browser extensions work with web requests.
- A clear working knowledge of uBO Scope's badge and popup window (refer to [Understanding the Badge and Popup Data](/guides/interpreting-results/badge-meanings)).

---

## Why Badge Counts Can Be Misleading

Many users assume a higher block count or badge number means a content blocker is better. This is incorrect because:

- The badge count in uBO Scope shows the number of **distinct third-party remote servers that a webpage actually connected to** despite blocking.
- A blocker with a high block count may allow connections to more unique third-party servers, meaning more potential data leakage.
- Some blockers stealthily block certain requests, which do not register as blocked in simple tests.
- "Ad blocker test" pages create artificial scenarios not reflective of real-world browsing.

<u>**Value framing:**</u> What truly matters is reducing the number of third-party communications your browser establishes — **not** just increasing the count of blocked request attempts.

## Step-by-Step Workflow to Compare Content Blockers

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Install and Enable the Content Blockers to Compare">
Make sure all the content blockers you want to test are installed and enabled in your browser.

**Expected result**: Each content blocker should be activated independently in separate test sessions or profiles to avoid conflicts.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 2: Open uBO Scope and Access Its Popup Per Test">
Load a typical webpage where you want to evaluate content blocking.

Open the uBO Scope popup by clicking its toolbar icon.

**Expected result**: The popup displays four main sections — domains connected, and lists for allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 3: Take Note of the Toolbar Badge and Domains">
Observe the badge number on the uBO Scope icon; it represents the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to.

Look closely at the domains in the allowed list — these are accessible remote servers where connections were successful.

**Expected result**: A lower badge count and fewer allowed third-party domains indicate a more restrictive content blocker.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 4: Repeat Across Different Content Blockers">
Disable the current content blocker.

Enable the next content blocker and reload the webpage.

Check the badge count and the allowed domains again in uBO Scope's popup.

**Decision point**: Compare the allowed domains list for overlap and differences.

**Expected result**: Identify which content blocker lets through fewer third-party remote servers.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 5: Examine Stealth-Blocked and Blocked Sections for Subtle Differences">
Pay attention to the stealth-blocked domains section — these connections were blocked stealthily, meaning invisibly preventing detection by the webpage.

The blocked domains list shows fully blocked network requests.

**Expected result**: A content blocker that stealth blocks more requests effectively hides its activity and improves privacy.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 6: Validate with Real Browsing and Multiple Websites">
Repeat this test with a variety of websites to avoid skewed data.

This ensures the comparisons reflect typical browsing patterns.

**Expected result**: Consistent trends where one content blocker maintains a lower number of distinct connected domains across sites.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 7: Document Findings and Adjust Usage Accordingly">
Based on badge counts and domain lists, decide which content blocker best reduces unwanted third-party connections.

Use uBO Scope data to configure or fine-tune your blockers or filter lists.

**Expected result**: Informed choices backed by practical, real-world network evidence rather than superficial block counts.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Real Example Scenario

Suppose you want to compare **Content Blocker A** and **Content Blocker B**:

1. Activate Blocker A, visit `example.com`.
2. Open uBO Scope popup; note badge count = 15, allowed domains = `cdn1.com`, `trackr.xyz`, `ads.example`.
3. Switch off Blocker A, activate Blocker B, reload the page.
4. Open uBO Scope; badge count = 10, allowed domains = `cdn1.com`, `analytics.pro`.

**Interpretation:**
- Blocker B connects to fewer distinct third-party servers.
- Tracker `trackr.xyz` and `ads.example` are allowed by Blocker A but blocked by Blocker B.
- Blocker B likely offers better third-party filtering on this site.

## Best Practices for Accurate Comparisons

- Test using real, popular websites — avoid "ad blocker test" pages.
- Use uBO Scope's per-tab popup to review connections in real-time.
- Consider stealth blocking as a positive privacy feature.
- Clear browser caches and reload pages between tests, ensuring fresh network activity data.
- Compare multiple browsing sessions for robustness.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Relying solely on high block counts:** This may falsely suggest better privacy.
- **Using synthetic test pages:** They don’t reflect realistic third-party network behavior.
- **Overlooking stealth blocking:** Some blockers hide block activity — this matters.
- **Ignoring multi-tab or background tabs:** Focus on active tabs for relevant data.

<Tip>
Always combine badge counts with analysis of allowed domains and stealth-blocked lists for a complete picture.
</Tip>

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If uBO Scope’s badge shows no data, ensure the extension has required permissions and is active.
- Reload the page after enabling or disabling content blockers to reset network data.
- Confirm your browser supports the `webRequest` API as this underpins accurate monitoring.
- Consult [Troubleshooting Installation & First-Run Issues](/getting-started/troubleshooting/common-installation-issues) if problems persist.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup title="FAQ">
<Accordion title="Q: Why do some blockers show fewer blocked items but more connected servers?">
A: Because a blocker might block fewer individual requests but still allow connections to more unique third-party servers, effectively leaking more data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Q: Can I trust the badge count on other blocker extensions?">
A: No. uBO Scope independently reports actual network connections visible via the browser, making its badge a reliable indicator.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Q: What does stealth-blocked mean?">
A: Stealth blocking hides blocking activity from webpages to avoid detection and prevent breakage while still blocking the request.
