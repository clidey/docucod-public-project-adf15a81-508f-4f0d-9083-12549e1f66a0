# Analyzing Remote Connections on Any Site with uBO Scope

Discover which third-party servers a webpage contacts, understand their roles (such as CDN providers or trackers), and gain the insight you need to make informed decisions about your online privacy and security using uBO Scope.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide shows you how to use the uBO Scope popup panel to analyze all the remote servers a website communicates with during your browsing session. You'll learn to identify allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains, discern their likely purpose, and decide on next steps to improve your privacy.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and active in your browser.
- Basic familiarity with third-party connections and general web browsing.

### Expected Outcome
- You will be able to view a comprehensive list of all third-party domains a webpage contacts.
- You will understand the categorization into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.
- You will gain the ability to identify domains likely serving content delivery versus tracking or other functions.

### Time Estimate
5–10 minutes to complete the basic steps and interpret data.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Accessing the popup panel
1. Visit the webpage you want to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
3. The popup panel will open, showing the site's hostname and categorized domain lists.

### Understanding the Domain Lists
- **Not Blocked**: Domains from which network connections were allowed. Usually includes essential services and CDNs.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where network requests were redirected or altered to be stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked**: Domains for which network requests were outright blocked.

### Analyzing Domains
4. Review the list of domains under each category. Note the counts beside each domain indicating how many requests were made.
5. Use domain names to infer purposes:
   - Domains related to major CDN providers (e.g., `cloudfront.net`) typically expedite content delivery.
   - Domains with names resembling advertising, analytics, or social media (e.g., `doubleclick.net`, `facebook.net`) may represent tracking or ad services.
6. If a domain appears suspicious or unexpected, consider configuring your content blocker to block it.

### Taking Appropriately Informed Action
7. Based on the analysis, adjust your content blocking rules or preferences outside uBO Scope if desired (e.g., via uBlock Origin or another blocker).
8. Refresh the page and re-open uBO Scope to verify changes in domain connections.

### Verifying Totals
- Observe the summary line indicating the total number of distinct domains contacted.
- Understand that a lower number of allowed distinct third-party domains indicates stronger privacy protection.

<Check>
Always cross-reference domain names to verify their purpose before blocking to avoid unintended site breakage.
</Check>

## 3. Practical Examples

### Example: Analyzing a News Website
- After opening the popup, you might see CDN providers under 'Not Blocked', tracking services under 'Blocked' or 'Stealth-Blocked'.
- You notice `akamai.net` with a high request count—likely CDN.
- You see `ads.exampletracker.com` under 'Blocked'. This shows your blocker is protecting you.

### Example Output
| Category       | Domain               | Count |
|----------------|----------------------|-------|
| Not Blocked    | cdn.fastly.net        | 12    |
| Stealth-Blocked| tracker.example.com   | 3     |
| Blocked       | ads.tracker.com       | 5     |

## 4. Tips & Troubleshooting

### Tips for Effective Analysis
- **Use Domain Information**: Utilize trusted online services or a search engine to research unknown domains.
- **Stay Updated**: Keep your content blockers and uBO Scope up to date for best results.
- **Regular Checks**: Periodically analyze sites you frequent to spot new tracking domains.

### Common Issues
- **Empty Domain Lists**: If you see no data, verify uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled.
- **High Number of Allowed Domains**: May indicate insufficient blocking or presence of many third-party services.

### Troubleshooting Suggestions
- Ensure the extension has appropriate permissions (actively monitoring network requests).
- Confirm browser supports the `webRequest` API as detailed in installation documentation.
- Restart browser or extension if data does not update.

## Appendix: Understanding Domain Categorization in uBO Scope

Each domain listed in the popup falls into one of three categories:

- **Not Blocked**: Domains with allowed connections during page load or interaction.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where requests were redirects or manipulated to prevent tracking but appear as allowed.
- **Blocked**: Domains completely blocked, preventing resource loading or connectivity.

These distinctions help differentiate between fully allowed resources and those with privacy-protecting block measures in place.
