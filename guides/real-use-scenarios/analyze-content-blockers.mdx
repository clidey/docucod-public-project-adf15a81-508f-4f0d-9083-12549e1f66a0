# Comparing Content Blockers with uBO Scope

This guide provides a clear, actionable workflow to use uBO Scope to evaluate the real efficacy of different content blockers. It empowers you to see beyond misleading block counts and understand your true privacy exposure by focusing on distinct third-party remote server connections.

---

## 1. Understanding the Task

### What This Guide Helps You Achieve
You will learn to compare multiple content blockers by analyzing the actual number of distinct third-party domains each allows or blocks, beyond just the block count badges. This approach debunks common ad-blocking myths and lets you make informed decisions about the protection level each content blocker provides.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and activated in your browser.
- Two or more content blockers installed/enabled for comparison.
- Basic familiarity with the uBO Scope popup panel (see [Your First Look: Interpreting the Popup Panel](../../getting-started/first-run-and-configuration/quick-start-using-popup)).
- Test webpages where you want to evaluate content blockers.

### Expected Outcome
- Accurately identify which content blocker truly limits connections to fewer distinct third-party remote servers.
- Understand the role and meaning of the allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domain categories.
- Gain a realistic privacy metric rather than relying on block counts alone.

### Time Estimate
~10-20 minutes for setup and initial tests, depending on how many blockers and test pages you use.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate—requires basic understanding of content blockers and uBO Scope interface.

## 2. Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare Your Testing Environment
1. Ensure uBO Scope is installed and visible in your browser toolbar.
2. Enable or disable content blockers as needed—only one content blocker should be active at a time for comparison.
3. Select websites or webpages for your testing. Start with popular sites or ones where you want to assess privacy.

### Step 2: Open uBO Scope Popup
1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your toolbar.
2. Observe the popup panel displaying the hostname at the top and three sections:
   - **not blocked** (allowed domains)
   - **stealth-blocked** (domains blocked stealthily)
   - **blocked** (domains actively blocked)
3. Notice the number next to "domains connected:" summarizing distinct allowed third-party domains.

### Step 3: Analyze the First Content Blocker
1. With the first content blocker enabled, browse to your target webpage.
2. Open the uBO Scope popup to see the domains connected.
3. Record or take a screenshot of the number of allowed third-party domains.
4. Review the domain lists under each category to identify which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

### Step 4: Switch Content Blockers
1. Disable the first content blocker.
2. Enable the second content blocker.
3. Refresh or reopen the same webpage.
4. Open the uBO Scope popup and review the domains and domain counts again.
5. Record this data for comparison.

### Step 5: Compare the Results
1. Compare the counts of allowed distinct third-party domains among the blockers.
2. A lower number in the **not blocked** section means fewer third-party servers were contacted, indicating better privacy protection.
3. Examine which domains appear allowed or stealth-blocked to understand stealth-blocking effectiveness.
4. Remember that a higher block count badge does not necessarily imply better blocking if it coincides with more allowed third-party connections.

### Step 6: Make Informed Decisions
1. Use the insights from uBO Scope to decide which content blocker reduces your overall third-party exposure most effectively.
2. Consider your browsing habits and the types of domains allowed or blocked.
3. Optionally, repeat this comparison on multiple websites for a comprehensive view.

## 3. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Focus on distinct third-party domains**, not just block counts—uBO Scope quantifies this to show true privacy implications.
- Use **real-world websites** rather than synthetic ad blocker test pages to avoid misleading results.
- Pay attention to the **stealth-blocked** category; stealth blocking reduces detectability by blocking requests invisibly.
- Keep uBO Scope **up to date** to leverage the latest tracking insights.
- Perform multiple tests across browsing sessions for consistency.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: uBO Scope Shows No Data or "NO DATA"
- Ensure the page you are testing is fully loaded.
- Confirm uBO Scope permissions are granted, especially `webRequest`.
- Verify you have the latest version of uBO Scope and content blockers.

### Issue: Block Counts Do Not Match Your Expectations
- Remember that block count badges represent request counts, not domain counts.
- A block count may be higher for a blocker that allows more third-party domains, due to multiple blocked requests per domain.

### Issue: Domains List Empty or Not Updating
- Refresh the page and popup.
- Disable conflicting extensions that may interfere with network request reporting.
