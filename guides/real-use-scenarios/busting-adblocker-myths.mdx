# Evaluating Test Pages and Misconceptions

## Understanding the Limits of Ad Blocker Test Pages

When exploring the effectiveness of content blockers, many users turn to specialized 'ad blocker test' webpages that claim to measure the extent of blocking. However, these pages often provide misleading or incomplete information. This guide walks you through why these test pages are unreliable and how uBO Scope provides a more authentic insight into network requests and blocking outcomes.

---

## Why "Ad Blocker Test" Pages Can Be Misleading

### Unrealistic Testing Scenarios

Ad blocker test pages often make network requests that are fabricated and do not reflect real-world browsing behavior. These requests typically target obscure or artificial domains that any content blocker could easily detect and block, but they don't represent the complexity or diversity of genuine third-party connections across the web.

### Lack of Visibility into Stealth Blocking

Many modern extensions, including uBlock Origin and uBO Scope, employ stealth techniques. These techniques prevent test pages from detecting blocked requests by not revealing whether a resource was blocked or simply never requested.

#### Stealth Blocking Explained
Stealth blocking means the webpage cannot easily discern whether a request was blocked or if it was never initiated.

### Why This Matters
A test page may report zero or few blocks even though your content blocker is actively protecting you. Conversely, a test page might misinterpret stealth techniques as no blocking.

## How uBO Scope Reveals the True Story

uBO Scope uses a different approach to reveal the actual network behavior of webpages:

- It listens directly to the browser's `webRequest` API, monitoring every third-party connection attempt.
- It records outcomes of each connection:
  - **Allowed** (requests that succeeded and were loaded).
  - **Blocked** (requests that were outright blocked).
  - **Stealth-blocked** (requests that were silently blocked using stealth).

This breakdown is visible in the uBO Scope popup panel, giving you a comprehensive picture of network connections beyond what test pages can show.

## Practical Workflow: Evaluating Content Blocking Beyond Test Pages

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Navigate to Real-World Websites">
Instead of using synthetic ad blocker test pages, browse to your favorite websites that include third-party content, such as news sites or online stores.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup panel and observe the summary of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Interpret the Results">
Focus on the number of distinct third-party domains connected:
- A lower count of allowed domains generally means better privacy.
- Stealth-blocked indicates hidden blocking that test pages won’t reveal.
- Blocked domains show explicitly prevented connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: Compare with Ad Blocker Test Page Results (Optional)">
If you want to compare, visit well-known test pages but be aware that displayed block counts there may not match the reality shown by uBO Scope.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 5: Make Privacy Decisions Based on uBO Scope Data">
Use uBO Scope data to assess your content blocker’s effectiveness and adjust your filters or settings accordingly.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Avoid relying solely on ad blocker test pages.** They do not reflect the real-world complexity or stealth techniques used.
- **Use uBO Scope’s badge and popup panel for direct insight** into what happens behind the scenes.
- **Interpret the badge count as a key privacy metric:** it shows distinct third-party connections allowed, not just raw block counts.
- **Remember stealth blocking is a positive privacy feature,** even though it may appear invisible to other tools or test pages.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Misconceptions about Ad Blocker Testing">
<Accordion title="Why does a test page show fewer blocks than uBO Scope?">
Many test pages cannot detect stealth blocking or advanced filtering techniques, making their block count artificially low. uBO Scope listens at the browser level, revealing all block outcomes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I trust block counts on browser toolbar icons?">
No. Unlike the uBO Scope badge which counts distinct third-party domains, many blockers simply tally the number of blocked requests, which might inflate or misrepresent actual blocking.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Should I disable stealth to verify block counts?">
Disabling stealth undermines privacy and can cause page breakage. Instead, rely on uBO Scope’s comprehensive reporting to understand stealth blocking.
</Accordion>

## Summary

uBO Scope demystifies the outcomes of content blocking by providing clear visibility into allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked third-party network requests. This page helps users understand limitations of traditional ad blocker test pages and the advantages of using uBO Scope for accurate privacy assessment.

Keep in mind: A lower count in uBO Scope’s badge represents better privacy exposure, unlike block counts shown in some test pages or blockers.
