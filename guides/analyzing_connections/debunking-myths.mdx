# Debunking Content Blocker Badge Myths with uBO Scope

## Overview

This guide reveals why a higher 'blocked' count on content blocker badges does not necessarily mean better privacy or more effective blocking. Using uBO Scope, you'll learn how to interpret network connection data beyond simplistic badge numbers and understand the real implications of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections in your browser.

By following this guide, you will gain nuanced insights to critically assess content blocker performance using data-driven observations.

---

## What This Guide Helps You Accomplish

- Understand the limitations of badge counts on content blockers
- Learn why more blocked requests can correlate with higher network exposure
- Use uBO Scope to analyze real network connection outcomes
- Distinguish between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains
- Avoid common misconceptions caused by oversimplified metrics

---

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed in a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari)
- Basic familiarity with how content blockers and browser network requests work
- Access to the uBO Scope popup interface (click the toolbar icon to open the popup)

---

## Expected Outcome

After completing this guide, you will confidently:

- Interpret the badge count as an indicator of distinct third-party connections rather than mere block numbers
- Identify when a higher block count actually means more allowed third-party connections
- Apply uBO Scope's detailed breakdown to make informed privacy decisions

---

## Time Estimate

Approximately 10-15 minutes for reading and hands-on exploration.

---

## Difficulty Level

Beginner to intermediate users with interest in privacy and network monitoring.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open uBO Scope and Observe Initial Data

- Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser to open its popup.
- Observe the badge number on the extension icon. This number represents the count of distinct third-party remote domains your browser made successful connections to.
- In the popup, you will see three categories:
  1. **Not blocked:** Domains the browser connected to and were allowed.
  2. **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or stealthily blocked.
  3. **Blocked:** Domains where requests were actively blocked.

> _Tip_: The badge number corresponds to the count of domains under the **not blocked** category, not the blocked domains.

### 2. Recognize That a Higher Blocked Count Doesn’t Guarantee Better Blocking

- Intuitively, users may think a higher blocked domain count on the badge means stronger privacy.
- In reality, this can be misleading. A content blocker that aggressively blocks may still allow a greater number of connections to unique third-party servers.
- This is because block counts measure events, whereas privacy is best represented by how many unique third parties successfully received connections.

### 3. Analyze Domain Connections in the Popup

- Review each domain listed under **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
- Understand that stealth blocking refers to indirect blocking or redirecting the connection quietly without user-visible errors.
- If the **not blocked** domains list is large despite a high block count, this means many third-party servers still successfully connected.

### 4. Compare Across Different Content Blockers (Optional)

- Use uBO Scope while switching between content blockers or filter lists.
- Notice the variation in blocked counts and allowed domains.
- You may observe that the blocker with a higher block count sometimes allows more distinct third-party connections, indicating less effective privacy protection.

### 5. Use the Badge and Popup Together for Real Privacy Insights

- Treat the badge number as the count of unique servers your browser successfully communicated with.
- Focus on reducing this count to improve privacy, not just boosting block counts.
- Use the detailed domain breakdown in uBO Scope's popup to identify which third parties are still active and evaluate their legitimacy.

## Real-World Example

Imagine browsing a website where Content Blocker A shows a badge count of "3" and blocks 10 domains (per internal stats), while Content Blocker B shows a badge count of "8" and blocks 5 domains.

- Without further insight, some users might prefer Content Blocker A because of more blocks.
- With uBO Scope, you see that Content Blocker A actually allowed connections to 3 distinct third-party domains, while Content Blocker B allowed 8.
- This means Content Blocker A blocks more requests but better isolates your browsing by limiting third-party exposure.
- Content Blocker B might technically block fewer domains but allows more third-party servers, resulting in a higher risk to privacy.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions & Pitfalls">
<Accordion title="My badge shows zero but I still see images or ads">
This may happen because uBO Scope only reports distinct third-party servers that your browser connects to, not the number of requests blocked or allowed. Some resources may be served from first-party domains, which do not contribute to the badge count.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why don’t blocked domains appear in the badge count?">
The badge represents the number of distinct third-party domains your browser successfully connected to — not the count of blocked requests. Blocked domains indicate network requests prevented but do not increase badge numbers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can stealth blocking affect results?">
Stealth blocking occurs when requests are redirected or blocked without alerting the webpage. This can result in fewer visible blocked domains but still reduce third-party exposure. Recognize stealth-blocked domains to understand hidden protective actions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope work with other content blockers?">
Yes, uBO Scope reports network request results regardless of which content blocker you use, DNS blocking, or other privacy tools, as long as the browser exposes request information through the webRequest API.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
To maximize privacy, focus on minimizing the number of distinct third-party servers your browser connects to, not just increasing the number of blocked requests.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope regularly to verify blocker effectiveness beyond badge counts.
- Check stealth-blocked domains to get a full picture of network activity.
- Avoid judging content blockers solely on badge numbers or block counters.
- Explore real websites with uBO Scope open to observe genuine network connection behaviors.
