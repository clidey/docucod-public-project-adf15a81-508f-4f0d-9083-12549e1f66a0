# Analyzing Real Websites: Practical Examples with uBO Scope

Explore real-world usage of uBO Scope by walking through analyzing popular websites. This guide takes you step-by-step through how to identify legitimate third-party resources versus those that may track or serve ads, empowering you to make informed decisions using actionable analysis strategies.

## 1. Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Achieve
This guide helps you apply uBO Scope’s network connection insights on popular websites. It teaches you how to distinguish between legitimate third-party domains, such as content delivery networks (CDNs), and potential tracking or advertising domains.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and active in your supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Basic familiarity with the uBO Scope popup interface (see [Your First Insights: Interpreting the Popup](https://docs.uboscope/guides/getting_started/first-insights)).
- Open tabs with popular websites where you want to analyze network requests.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will confidently:
- Interpret uBO Scope’s categorization of domains (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).
- Identify and verify legitimate third-party domains commonly used by websites.
- Detect suspicious or privacy-intrusive domains.
- Improve your understanding of third-party resource patterns on popular sites.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 20-30 minutes per website analysis session.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate — assumes you understand basic concepts of domains and web requests.

## 2. Step-by-Step Website Analysis

Follow these steps each time you analyze a website with uBO Scope.

### Step 1: Open the Website in Your Browser
Navigate to the website you want to analyze, for example, https://www.nytimes.com.

### Step 2: Click the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon
Open uBO Scope’s popup to view the connection details for the active browser tab.

### Step 3: Review the Badge Count
Check the toolbar icon badge number. It represents the number of distinct third-party domains allowed through. A lower number often indicates fewer third-party connections, generally better for privacy.

### Step 4: Understand the Domain Categories
The popup lists domains under three categories:
- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains for which requests succeeded without being blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were redirected or handled silently by the content blocker.
- **Blocked:** Domains actively blocked by your content blocker.

### Step 5: Identify the Website’s First-Party Domain
At the top of the popup, confirm the **hostname** and **domain** correspond to the website you are analyzing. This is your baseline.

### Step 6: Examine Allowed Domains
Look closely at the allowed domains:
- Spot major CDN providers like `cloudflare.net` or `akamai.net` — these are usually legitimate.
- Recognize domains related to essential services (e.g., `googleapis.com` for fonts or analytics).

### Step 7: Spot Potential Trackers or Ad Domains
Focus on unknown or suspicious domain names:
- Cross-reference these with public domain lists or search online.
- Use your judgment to decide if connections are privacy-sensitive or not.

### Step 8: Verify Stealth-Blocked Domains
Check stealth-blocked domains to understand what requests are being silently dealt with by your blocker. This helps uncover hidden trackers or ad networks.

### Step 9: Note Blocked Domains
Review blocked domains to confirm they align with your privacy goals. If you see unfamiliar domains here, research if they are potential threats.

### Step 10: Repeat Analysis on Multiple Pages
Browse different sections or refresh the page to observe changes in connections. Networks vary depending on content.

## 3. Practical Examples

### Example 1: Analyzing News Website
**Site:** https://www.nytimes.com

**Observations:**
- Allowed: `nytimes.com` (first-party), `cloudflare.net` (CDN), `googleapis.com` (font and API services).
- Stealth-blocked: Some ad network domains (e.g., `doubleclick.net`) indicating your content blocker is silently preventing tracking.
- Blocked: Known tracker domains fully blocked, such as social media trackers.

### Example 2: Analyzing E-Commerce Website
**Site:** https://www.amazon.com

**Observations:**
- Allowed: Amazon-owned domains (e.g., `amazonaws.com`), payment gateways.
- Stealth-blocked: Some marketing domains redirected by the blocker.
- Blocked: Third-party ad trackers not part of Amazon’s own infrastructure.

### Example 3: Analyzing Social Media Platform
**Site:** https://www.facebook.com

**Observations:**
- Allowed: Facebook domains.
- Stealth-blocked: Common analytics providers.
- Blocked: External ad networks and trackers detected by uBO Scope.

## 4. Tips and Best Practices

- **Use the Public Suffix List for Domain Context**: uBO Scope uses an up-to-date _public suffix list_ to identify domain boundaries precisely, helping separate parent domains from subdomains.
- **Check Domain Unicode Representations**: The popup converts domains into Unicode for clarity, especially with internationalized domains.
- **Focus on Distinct Remote Servers**: Remember that uBO Scope’s badge counts unique third-party hosts, not just total requests.
- **Combine Observations with External Tools**: For unknown domains, use domain reputation or privacy databases for confirmation.
- **Analyze Connections Across Multiple Pages**: Third-party connections can vary; broad sampling improves insight.

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### No Data in Popup
- Ensure uBO Scope is properly installed and running (see [First Run & Initial Setup](https://docs.uboscope/getting-started/setup/first-run)).
- Verify your browser supports the webRequest API needed to track requests.

### Unexpectedly High Number of Allowed Domains
- Consider temporary page scripts or third-party services dynamically loaded.
- Check for stealth-blocked entries indicating hidden trackers.

### Confusing Domain Names
- Use uBO Scope’s Unicode conversion feature.
- Use the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to understand domain structures.
