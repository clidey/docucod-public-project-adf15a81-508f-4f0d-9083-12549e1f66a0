# Analyzing Third-party Network Connections with uBO Scope

## Overview

This guide empowers you to use uBO Scope effectively to analyze third-party network connections made by websites you visit. You'll learn how to identify which remote servers a site contacts, interpret the privacy implications of these connections, and distinguish legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs) from potentially unwanted third-party domains.

## Prerequisites

- Have uBO Scope installed and configured on a supported browser (Chrome ≥122, Firefox ≥128, Safari ≥18.5).
- Familiarity with opening and using the uBO Scope extension popup panel.
- Basic understanding of web domains and the concept of third-party requests.

## Expected Outcome

By completing this guide, you will be able to:

- Open the uBO Scope popup to view connection data for the active browser tab.
- Identify which third-party domains are contacted and their connection outcomes.
- Evaluate the nature of third-party domains to understand their legitimacy.
- Make informed decisions regarding privacy exposure when browsing.

## Time Estimate

Approximately 10-15 minutes to perform a thorough analysis on selected websites.

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate — Requires interpretation skills and some foundational knowledge of web concepts.

## Step-by-step Instructions

### 1. Open uBO Scope Popup on the Active Tab

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup panel.
- The panel will display the hostname of the page you are currently visiting and a categorized list of domains.

### 2. Understand the Panel Sections

The popup divides third-party network connections into three categories:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains for which network requests succeeded and were allowed.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or stealth-blocked (such as silently prevented) by content blockers or privacy features.
- **Blocked:** Domains for which connection attempts failed or were blocked.

The **domains connected** count at the top reflects the number of distinct third-party domains not blocked, representing your actual privacy footprint.

### 3. Review Third-party Domains

- Examine the list under **Not Blocked** to see which third-party domains your current page communicates with.
- The count next to each domain indicates how many connections or resources were loaded.

### 4. Distinguish Legitimate CDNs and Providers

- Many third-party domains are legitimate CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) providing essential assets such as scripts, images, or stylesheets.
- Familiarize yourself with common CDN domains like `cloudflare.net`, `akamai.net`, or `googleusercontent.com`.
- Use your judgment or search online to verify domains that you do not recognize.

### 5. Identify Potentially Unwanted Domains

- Domains that are less familiar or unrelated to the site’s core functions may represent trackers or advertising servers.
- A high count or frequent appearance of unknown third-party domains might suggest higher privacy exposure.

### 6. Analyze Stealth and Blocked Domains

- Look at **Stealth-blocked** and **Blocked** domains to gauge which requests were prevented.
- This indicates how effective your content blockers or privacy settings are in limiting third-party connections.

### 7. Repeat for Other Sites

- Browse to other websites and observe their third-party connection patterns.
- Compare how different sites interact with third parties to understand varying privacy implications.

## Verification

- The popup updates dynamically for the active tab.
- The third-party domains and categories should reflect real-time network interactions for the website loaded.
- The badge count on the extension icon corresponds to the number of allowed third-party domains.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Contextual Check:** Always consider the website’s function; eCommerce sites often contact payment gateways, while news sites may connect to multiple trackers.
- **Blacklist Awareness:** Use uBO Scope alongside filter lists to see which third-party connections are blocked by your content blocker.
- **Domain Research:** When unsure about a third-party domain, a quick web search can provide insight into its reputation and purpose.
- **Low Count is Better:** A lower number of distinct third-party domains allowed generally means less exposure to tracking.

## Common Pitfalls

- Assuming all third-party domains are malicious: Many are essential infrastructure.
- Relying solely on toolbar badge counts without inspecting detailed domain lists.
- Misinterpreting redirect-based stealth blocking as allowed connections; pay attention to where domains appear.
- Overlooking internationalized domain names (IDNs) — uBO Scope shows them in Unicode form to aid recognition.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Nothing Appears in the Popup

- Ensure the extension is properly installed and active.
- Refresh the page to allow uBO Scope to collect network data.
- Verify permissions and that uBO Scope has access to the tab's network requests.

### Unexpectedly High Number of Third-Party Domains

- Check if the site loads many third-party resources or ads.
- Confirm you are not visiting tracking-heavy or ad-injected websites.
- Ensure no conflicting extensions interfere with network request reporting.

### Domains Appear in the Stealth or Blocked Sections But You See Resources Loading

- Some content blockers perform stealth blocking to avoid page breakage by allowing connections but blocking tracking.
- uBO Scope reflects this in the stealth category to clarify these nuanced cases.

## Examples

Suppose you visit `example.com`:

- The popup shows `example.com` as the main site.
- Under **Not Blocked**, domains such as `cdn.cloudflare.net (5)`, `fonts.googleapis.com (3)`, and `exampleassets.com (8)` appear.
- Under **Stealth-blocked**, you might see `ads.tracker.net (2)`.
- Under **Blocked**, domains like `tracking.badsite.com (4)` appear.

This means your browser loaded resources from common CDNs and your site assets (`exampleassets.com`) while blocking or stealth-blocking ad and tracking servers.

<Callout type="tip">
Use uBO Scope consistently to build a clearer picture of which domains your browsing truly contacts, helping you manage privacy and trace resource origins with confidence.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Beware of assuming a high number of blocked requests implies better privacy; focus on allowed third-party connections for an accurate privacy footprint.
