# Debunking Myths About Content Blockers

## Overview
This guide helps users understand the limitations and common misconceptions about content blockers, focusing specifically on the badge counts shown by these tools and the reliability of 'ad blocker test' webpages. Using uBO Scope as a practical tool, this document shows how to interpret network connection data more effectively and accurately assess content blocker performance through direct evidence rather than assumptions or misleading metrics.

## Prerequisites
- Install the uBO Scope extension on your supported browser (Chromium ≥122.0, Firefox ≥128.0, or Safari ≥18.5).
- Basic understanding of browser extensions and content blockers.
- Access to a webpage you want to inspect and the uBO Scope popup interface.

## What You Will Learn
- Why block counts on content blocker badges are unreliable indicators of effectiveness.
- Why 'ad blocker test' webpages often provide misleading or incomplete information.
- How to use uBO Scope’s real network connection data to make evidence-based conclusions.

## 1. Understanding Content Blocker Badge Counts

### The Myth
Users often believe that a higher block count on a content blocker’s badge means better protection or greater blocking power.

### The Reality
The badge count typically shows how many requests or connections were blocked, but this number alone does not reflect the total number of unique third-party connections allowed by the browser, which is the true privacy metric.

**Why a lower allowed third-party connection count is better:** Even if a blocker shows a high block count, it may still allow connections to many different third-party servers, which potentially impacts privacy.

### How uBO Scope Helps
uBO Scope measures and displays the distinct number of third-party domains a webpage connects to, reflecting the actual network footprint rather than just the block count.

### Practical Tips
- Focus on the number of allowed third-party domains shown in uBO Scope, not just block counts.
- Use uBO Scope’s popup report to see the full picture of network activity.


## 2. Why "Ad Blocker Test" Webpages Are Unreliable

### The Myth
Users trust online "ad blocker test" pages as simple benchmarks to verify if content blockers are functioning properly.

### The Reality
- These pages attempt to detect blocking using artificial and unrealistic network requests.
- Many content blockers use stealth techniques to avoid detection, meaning tests that rely on detecting blocking behavior can be fooled.
- Such pages generate resource requests to domains unlikely used by real-world websites, giving misleading results.

### How uBO Scope Helps
By examining actual network connections a real webpage makes, uBO Scope bypasses artificial test traps and reveals what’s truly going on.

### Best Practice
- Avoid relying on "ad blocker test" sites to measure blocker effectiveness.
- Instead, run real-world site tests and analyze using tools like uBO Scope.


## 3. Using uBO Scope to Debunk These Myths

### Step-by-Step: Investigate Network Connections with uBO Scope

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Webpage Normally">
Navigate to the webpage you want to analyze, keeping your content blocker enabled as usual.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Extension Popup">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup interface.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Badge Count and Popup Data">
Note the badge count showing the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.
Review the popup's "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" sections to see detailed domain connection counts.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare with Your Content Blocker's Badge">
Check your primary content blocker's badge count. Notice how it may differ and why more blocked requests do not always mean fewer allowed domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Make an Evidence-Based Conclusion">
Use the domains and counts reported by uBO Scope to assess your browsing privacy footprint accurately.
Ignore block counts or artificial test pages as definitive benchmarks.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Example Scenario
Visiting a news site with a high block count on the content blocker may still result in a sizable number of allowed distinct third-party connections. uBO Scope will reveal these allowed domains clearly, helping you evaluate blocker effectiveness correctly.


## 4. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Regularly review uBO Scope reports to keep track of your actual privacy exposure.
- If you notice many third-party connections allowed, consider adjusting your blocking lists or rules.
- Remember that not all third-party connections are harmful; evaluate domains based on context.
- Use uBO Scope as a diagnostic companion tool alongside your primary content blocker, not as a replacement.


## 5. Common Pitfalls

- Relying solely on the content blocker's badge count leads to inaccurate conclusions.
- Trusting "ad blocker test" pages can generate false confidence or unnecessary concern.
- Ignoring stealth-blocked connections reported by uBO Scope, which represent requests silently blocked or redirected by other means.


## 6. Troubleshooting & Further Assistance

If uBO Scope shows no data or inconsistent results:
- Confirm the extension is properly installed and has necessary permissions (see [Installing uBO Scope](../../getting-started/installation-and-setup/installing-ubo-scope)).
- Verify that you have reloaded the webpage after installing the extension.
- Consult [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../../getting-started/first-use-and-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues) for detailed help.

## Appendix: Sample uBO Scope Popup Interpretation

When viewing the uBO Scope popup, you will see:

- **domains connected:** The count of unique third-party domains your browser connected to.
- **not blocked:** Domains with successful connections allowed.
- **stealth-blocked:** Domains blocked in a way that the webpage cannot easily detect.
- **blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked by a content blocker or resulting in network errors.

This real-world data enables a more accurate picture of your browsing exposure than badge counts or ad test pages alone.
