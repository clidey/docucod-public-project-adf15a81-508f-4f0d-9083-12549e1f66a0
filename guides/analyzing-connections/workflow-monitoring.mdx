# Step-by-Step: Monitoring Website Connections with uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide empowers you to use **uBO Scope** to monitor and analyze all network connections a website makes. You'll learn how to navigate the popup interface, interpret the categorized connection data, and distinguish between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections. By following these steps, you'll gain actionable insights into third-party connections impacting your privacy.

---

## What You Will Achieve
- See a clear, categorized list of all third-party domains contacted by the site you're visiting.
- Understand how many distinct third-party connections were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Gain the ability to assess website network behavior for privacy implications.

## Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and enabled on your Chromium (v122+), Firefox (v128+), or Safari (v18.5+) browser.
- Basic familiarity with browser extensions and navigating toolbar icons.
- Access to the website you want to analyze.

---

## Time Estimate
Approximately 5 to 10 minutes to get familiar and perform an initial analysis.

# Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Trigger Network Monitoring

- Open your browser and navigate to the target website you want to analyze.
- uBO Scope monitors network connections automatically in the background for the active tab.
- The toolbar icon badge updates dynamically to show the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the webpage.

<Check>
The badge count reflects the number of unique third-party domains **allowed** to connect. A lower count typically means fewer third-party connections.
</Check>

### 2. Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface

- Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser's toolbar.
- The popup will load and display the connection data for the active tab.

<Tip>
If the popup shows NO DATA or is slow to update, reload the webpage to trigger fresh network requests.
</Tip>

### 3. Understand the Popup Layout

The popup divides the third-party domains into three main categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains that the site connected to successfully without interference.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were stealthily blocked, typically by content blockers that hide their actions.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were explicitly blocked.

Each section lists domains along with how many connection attempts were made to them.

### 4. Review Allowed Connections

- Examine the domains under the "not blocked" section.
- These domains represent the third-party servers the webpage actually fetched resources from.

<Tip>
Often, legitimate third parties are CDNs or analytics providers. High counts here could indicate many trackers or ads.
</Tip>

### 5. Review Blocked and Stealth-Blocked Connections

- "Blocked" domains show direct blocks by your content blocker or site restrictions.
- "Stealth-blocked" domains reflect connections blocked without direct visibility to the page, often to avoid detection.

<Tip>
Differences between blocked and stealth-blocked may help identify how aggressive or subtle blocking is.
</Tip>

### 6. Count Summary

- At the top of the popup is a summary showing the total number of connected domains.
- Use this summary as a quick indicator of the site's third-party network exposure.

### 7. Use Insights to Improve Privacy

- If you observe many allowed third-party domains, consider strengthening your content blocking rules or using additional privacy tools.
- Revisit websites periodically using uBO Scope to observe if third-party exposures change over time.

---

## Verification Steps

- Confirm the badge count updates as you navigate to different websites.
- Verify the popup lists domains corresponding to your current active tab.
- Reload the page and watch for changes in allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked sections.

# Practical Example

Suppose you visit `example.com`:

1. **Badge count** shows "12", indicating 12 allowed third-party domains.
2. Clicking the icon opens the popup.
3. You see domains like `cdn.example.net` under allowed, `ads.tracker.com` under blocked, and `hiddentracker.com` under stealth-blocked.
4. You recognize that some allowed domains are safe CDNs, but also identify trackers you want to address.

This immediate insight helps you refine your privacy setup.

# Tips & Best Practices

- **Reload When Needed:** After applying new blocker rules, reload the page so uBO Scope can reflect updated network connections.
- **Use in Conjunction:** Combine findings from uBO Scope with other privacy tools for comprehensive protection.
- **Watch for Stealth Blocking:** Stealth blocking is subtle; use it to detect sophisticated trackers.
- **Interpret Counts Thoughtfully:** A very high allowed count usually signals increased privacy risk.

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope Popup">
<Accordion title='Popup Shows NO DATA or Is Blank'>
- Ensure the page has fully loaded and you are on the active tab.
- Reload the tab to generate fresh network requests.
- Verify the extension is enabled and has necessary permissions.
- Confirm browser support versions (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
- Make sure you have not disabled the extension on the current site.
- Reload the webpage.
- Check browser console for errors related to uBO Scope.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Data Appears Incomplete or Missing">
- Network requests may be happening outside the webRequest API, which uBO Scope cannot monitor.
- Some requests might be blocked by other extensions before uBO Scope can monitor them.
- Verify no conflicting extensions interfere with network request visibility.
</Accordion>
