# Common Use Cases: Privacy, Testing, and Debunking Myths

Explore practical scenarios where uBO Scope shines as an indispensable tool for assessing privacy risks, testing content blocker effectiveness, and clarifying widespread misconceptions about ad blocking tests. This guide offers real-world workflows, actionable tips, and troubleshooting advice to ensure you gain full value from the data presented in the popup panel.

---

## 1. Understanding uBO Scope's Unique Value

uBO Scope visualizes network connections made by webpages, categorizing each remote server involved as **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked**. This granularity empowers you to:

- Evaluate privacy risks by seeing exactly what third parties connect to when visiting new websites.
- Verify if your content blocker is effectively blocking known trackers or other unwanted connections.
- Debunk misleading ‘ad blocker test’ results that do not represent real-world browsing.

The popup panel delivers this at a glance, grouped per domain with connection counts and a dynamic badge count on the toolbar icon reflecting distinct third-party endpoints.

## 2. Evaluating Privacy Risks on New Sites

### Workflow Overview

When visiting an unfamiliar website, your core goal is to understand what external connections it seeks to establish. uBO Scope makes this straightforward:

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope extension installed and active in your browser.
- Ability to access the popup panel by clicking the extension icon.
- Visit the target website freshly (preferably in a new tab).

### Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Target Website">
Navigate to the new website you want to evaluate.
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup Panel">
Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your toolbar to view the popup panel.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect the Popup Header">
Look at the site hostname and domain displayed at the top. Confirm it matches the site you visited.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domain Categories">
- <strong>Allowed:</strong> Domains successfully contacted.
- <strong>Stealth-blocked:</strong> Connections redirected or hidden by content blockers.
- <strong>Blocked:</strong> Network requests prevented from succeeding.

Pay particular attention to allowed third-party domains — a high number suggests greater privacy risk.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze the Summary Count">
Check the number of distinct third-party domains listed — the toolbar badge mirrors this count.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Practical Tips

- Focus on domains you don’t recognize, particularly if they are common tracking, advertising, or analytics services.
- Use the count badges to prioritize which domains are contacted most frequently.
- Consider multiple visits to a site to capture all network activity.

## 3. Verifying Your Content Blocker's Effectiveness

Content blockers vary in how comprehensively and stealthily they block unwanted connections. uBO Scope lets you verify blocking behavior independent of the blocker’s UI claims.

### Workflow Overview

Your goal: Confirm which third-party domains are blocked or allowed when your content blocker is enabled.

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed.
- Content blocker active and configured.
- Visit a website known for loading tracking or advertising domains.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Visit the Website with Content Blocking Enabled">
Load a site where tracking is expected.
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the extension icon to open the popup panel.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify Blocked vs Allowed Domains">
Observe the three categories:
- <strong>Blocked:</strong> Confirm domains your blocker prevents.
- <strong>Stealth-blocked:</strong> These are network requests your blocker intercepts subtly, not directly visible to the site.
- <strong>Allowed:</strong> Third parties your blocker did not block.
</Step>
<Step title="Correlate with Your Blocker's Logs or Settings">
Use uBO Scope data to confirm your content blocker actually blocks domains it claims to, and watch out if the allowed count is unexpectedly high.
</Step>
<Step title="Repeat Tests with Different Sites or Blocker Configurations">
Try sites with various tracking setups or adjust blocker settings to observe impact.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Best Practices & Pitfalls

- A higher block count badge does not always mean better blocking; it can indicate more third parties are contacted.
- Use the *allowed* category as a more accurate privacy indicator.
- Stealth-blocked domains represent subtle blocking and should not be ignored.

## 4. Debunking Misleading 'Ad Blocker Test' Websites

Many rely on specialized 'ad blocker test' sites to assess their blockers. uBO Scope clarifies why these sites are unreliable.

### Why These Tests Mislead

- They rely on network requests crafted solely for testing, not used in real browsing.
- They cannot detect stealth blocking, where requests are hidden but not outright blocked.

### How uBO Scope Helps

By displaying the actual attempted connections from real websites, uBO Scope avoids the artificial scenarios of those test pages.

### Workflow to Confirm

<Steps>
<Step title="Avoid Using Ad Blocker Test Pages as Sole Benchmark">
Understand that these pages don't reflect real-world scenarios.
</Step>
<Step title="Test Real Websites Instead">
Use uBO Scope on well-known websites to see actual network behavior.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Stealth Blocking Presence">
Check the stealth-blocked section in the popup panel, which such tests do not reveal.
</Step>
<Step title="Evaluate Blocker Reliability Using Multiple Indicators">
Consider badge count, categories, and actual third-party domains contacted.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Real-World Examples

### Example: Privacy Audit of a News Website

1. Open https://example-news-site.com.
2. Click uBO Scope icon.
3. See allowed connections including content delivery networks (CDNs) but no excessive tracking domains.
4. Stealth-blocked connections include known ad servers.
5. Blocked connections show trackers you have filtered.

### Example: Diagnosing Ineffective Blocking

1. Visit site with lots of ads loading.
2. uBO Scope popup shows many allowed third-party domains.
3. Badge count is high.
4. Compare with blocker’s dashboard — blocker claims to block more.
5. Use uBO Scope data to adjust filter lists or blocker settings.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting Scenarios">
<Accordion title="Popup Panel Shows 'NO DATA' or Blank">
- Ensure you have visited a site recently in the active tab.
- Refresh the tab and open the popup again.
- Confirm uBO Scope has the necessary permissions.
- Restart your browser or disable/re-enable the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Toolbar Badge Count Does Not Update">
- Visit a new site and wait a few seconds for processing.
- Confirm the background service worker is running (might be inactive due to browser lifecycle).
- Check for any browser-specific quirks or restrictions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains Misclassified or Missing">
- uBO Scope relies on an up-to-date Public Suffix List to group domains — outdated lists can cause misattribution.
- Clear session data if suspect.
- Ensure your browser's webRequest API coverage is not limited.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Patterns for Regular Usage

- **Routine checks:** Use uBO Scope before trusting a website, especially newly discovered ones.
- **Blocker validation:** Regularly cross-check your content blocker performance against the popup data.
- **Filter list refinement:** Developers and maintainers may use uBO Scope's data to pinpoint domains for blocking or allowlisting.

<Tip>
Always verify network outcomes in the context of the full browsing session. Remember, a lower number of third-party domains contacted means fewer potential privacy leaks.
</Tip>

<Note>
uBO Scope measures the real network requests made and their outcomes, regardless of how stealthy or complex content blockers may behave.
