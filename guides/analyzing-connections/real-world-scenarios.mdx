# Real-World Use Cases: Evaluating Content Blockers and Filter Lists

Leverage uBO Scope's powerful network analysis to gain clear, empirical insights into your browser’s true security and privacy posture. This guide walks you through practical workflows that help you compare content blockers, debunk misleading blocker metrics, and evaluate the effectiveness of filter lists with precision. Whether you’re a privacy-conscious user or a filter list maintainer, following these workflows will sharpen your understanding of what gets blocked, what slips through, and why.

## 1. Understanding the Goal: Why Evaluate Content Blockers and Filter Lists?

Content blockers and filter lists are your frontline defense against intrusive scripts, trackers, and ads. However, their effectiveness cannot be reliably judged by superficial metrics like block counts or test sites alone. uBO Scope changes the game by reporting all real network connections your browser attempts, categorized into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked by your current blocker. This empowers you to:

- Identify the **actual distinct third-party servers** contacted.
- Compare different blockers based on what third parties are truly allowed or blocked.
- Detect misleading block counts reported by some content blockers.
- Evaluate filter lists by testing their impact on network activity.

<Check>
Remember: The key privacy metric is the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser successfully connects to. A lower count reflects better blocking coverage.
</Check>

## 2. Prerequisites

Before diving into the workflows, ensure the following:

- **uBO Scope is installed and active** in your browser. Follow the installation guides if needed:
  - [Install uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope#installation)
- You have at least two content blockers or filter lists you want to compare, installed and configurable.
- Basic familiarity with opening the uBO Scope popup and interpreting connection outcomes.
- Access to a consistent site or set of sites to test across blockers.


## 3. Workflow 1: Comparing Content Blockers Side-by-Side

### Purpose
Evaluate how different content blockers impact your browser’s network connections on the *same webpage(s)* to understand which blocks more effectively at the third-party server level.

### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
<Step title="Select a website for testing">
Choose a website with a variety of third-party content (e.g., news sites, social media).

> This diversity ensures meaningful blocking differences can surface.
</Step>
<Step title="Set Content Blocker A active">
Enable your first content blocker/filter list in your browser.

> Disable all others to isolate the effect.
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup and record results">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup.

> Note the count of distinct allowed third-party domains, plus the domains listed under 'blocked' and 'stealth-blocked'.
</Step>
<Step title="Clear session data or reload page">
Reload the test website to ensure fresh data.

> Optionally clear uBO Scope’s session data for a clean state (restart browser recommended).
</Step>
<Step title="Set Content Blocker B active">
Disable Content Blocker A, then enable Content Blocker B alone.
</Step>
<Step title="Repeat data collection with Content Blocker B">
Reload the same test website and open the uBO Scope popup.

> Record the connection counts as before.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze Differences">
Compare the allowed third-party domains count and domains lists between blockers.

> The blocker with lower allowed distinct third-party domains is more effective in reducing real connections.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Best Practices

- Use private/incognito browsing sessions to minimize background connections from other extensions or cached resources.
- Test multiple websites to get a comprehensive perspective.
- Pay special attention to stealth-blocked domains, which represent hidden blocking by your content blocker.

### Common Pitfalls

- Relying solely on block counts displayed by the content blocker, which may be misleading.
- Comparing results on inconsistent or rapidly changing webpages.


## 4. Workflow 2: Debunking Misleading Block Metrics

### Purpose
Show that a higher block count in a content blocker’s UI does not necessarily mean better privacy or blocking. Use uBO Scope to prove that the ultimate privacy goal is minimizing allowed third-party connections.

### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
<Step title="Pick a content blocker with high block count">
Choose a content blocker or filter list known to report a high block count badge.
</Step>
<Step title="Check uBO Scope’s allowed domains count">
Open a webpage and then check uBO Scope’s popup.

> Observe the distinct allowed third-party domains count.
</Step>
<Step title="Switch to content blocker with lower reported block count">
Disable the first blocker; enable a blocker with a lower reported block count.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload the page and re-check uBO Scope">
Reload the same webpage, open uBO Scope again.

> Observe if the allowed third-party domains count is actually lower or higher.
</Step>
<Step title="Conclude from real-world data">
Understand which blocker better minimizes true network connections.

> The blocker with fewer allowed distinct third-party servers protects your privacy better, regardless of its block count UI badge.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Pro Tip
Try testing this across multiple sites and note blockers that stealth-block requests (requests blocked without counter blocks), which some blockers use to reduce breakage while still protecting privacy.


## 5. Workflow 3: Evaluating Filter List Effectiveness

### Purpose
Measure the real impact of adding or updating filter lists on the network activity your browser reports.

### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
<Step title="Baseline measurement">
Enable your base filter list and browse to a target test website.

> Open uBO Scope to view the current network connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Add or update filter list">
Add a new filter list or update an existing one.

> Ensure it is activated properly in your content blocker.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload the test website">
Reload the same page to capture the filter list’s impact.
</Step>
<Step title="View updated network stats in uBO Scope">
Open the popup and compare allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains before and after the filter list addition.

> Look for reductions in allowed third-party domains and increases in blocked or stealth-blocked counts as a success metric.
</Step>
<Step title="Repeat and validate">
Repeat with different sites or filter lists to verify consistent improvements.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Best Practices

- Use the same browsing session to prevent caching effects.
- Document the domain-level outcomes to track filter list performance over time.


## 6. Interpreting the uBO Scope Popup in These Workflows

When you open uBO Scope's popup for a given tab, you’ll see:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which the browser successfully fetched resources.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains blocked in a way that is not visible to the page, reducing detection and breakage.
- **Blocked:** Domains that were explicitly blocked by the content blocker (if detectable).
- **Summary Count:** The badge count showing distinct allowed third-party domains.

Use these categories to analyze the effectiveness and stealthiness of blockers and filter lists.

<Info>
If the tabHost name and domain shown don’t update or show NO DATA, reload the page and ensure uBO Scope is correctly installed and permitted.
</Info>

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Real-World Use Case Issues">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Popup Shows No Data or '?'">
Verify the extension is enabled and granted necessary permissions.

Ensure you are viewing a tab where network requests occur and reload it.

If using private browsing, confirm uBO Scope is enabled in private mode.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Confusion Over Blocked Counts vs Allowed Counts">
Remember, block counts in content blockers do not guarantee fewer network connections.

Always use uBO Scope to verify allowed distinct third-party domains as the true metric.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Testing on Dynamic or Highly Cached Sites">
Websites that heavily cache content might show inconsistent domain counts.

Perform tests in a new private window/session to reduce cache effects.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Tips and Best Practices

- Test multiple sites to understand blocker/filter list behavior broadly.
- Combine uBO Scope with your content blocker’s UI for a fuller picture.
- Focus on minimizing the distinct allowed third-party domains to protect privacy.
- Use uBO Scope regularly to track changes in your browsing network landscape.
- Document results to support filter list development and community reporting.

# Appendix: Example Scenario

Imagine you want to compare how Blocker X and Blocker Y behave on a popular news website:

1. Enable Blocker X only.
2. Navigate to the news website.
3. Open uBO Scope to record allowed third-party domains count.
4. Disable Blocker X, enable Blocker Y.
5. Reload the same news website.
6. Check uBO Scope again.

If Blocker X reports 30 blocked items but allows connections to 25 distinct third-party domains, and Blocker Y blocks 15 items but allows only 10 distinct domains, you see that Blocker Y provides better actual blocking despite a lower block count.

This example concretely shows why uBO Scope’s approach is best for evaluating privacy effectiveness.
