# Interpreting the Popup Panel

Understanding how to read and interpret the uBO Scope popup panel is essential for gaining actionable insights into the network connections your browser makes. This guide walks you through every critical element of the popup interface, explaining what each piece of information means, how the extension categorizes connections, and how to identify potentially suspicious or heavy network activity.

---

## 1. Overview of the Popup Panel

When you click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar, the popup panel appears. It presents a concise but detailed snapshot of all remote server connections related to the active tab.

### Key UI Elements

- **Header (Domain Name Display):** Shows the current tab’s hostname and domain, separated visually for clarity.
- **Summary Section:** Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains connected to.
- **Connection Categories:** Three sections list domains grouped by connection outcome:
  - _Not Blocked (Allowed)_
  - _Stealth-Blocked_
  - _Blocked_

These are shown in dedicated blocks with clear color cues and counts.

### Why This Matters
This breakdown lets you quickly assess the overall network footprint and identify which connections your browser allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked on behalf of content blockers.

---

## 2. Understanding the Header: Hostname and Domain

The header shows two parts:

- The left span (usually grayish) shows the subdomain or hostname prefix that is not part of the main registered domain.
- The right span shows the base domain, derived from the current page’s hostname using the Public Suffix List.

**Example:**

For `news.bbc.co.uk`, the header splits into:
- Left span: `news.bbc.`
- Right span: `co.uk`

This helps disambiguate the exact origin of connections.

---

## 3. The Summary Section: Domain Count

The summary shows the total number of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to for the current tab:

- Displayed as “domains connected: X”
- This count excludes first-party domains related directly to the tab’s main domain.

### Why is This Important?
- A **lower count** is generally better for privacy, indicating fewer third-party server connections.
- A **higher count** could signal tracking, heavy advertising, or extensive resource loading from multiple external servers.

<Tip>
Remember, the badge icon count on the toolbar shows this same number, enabling quick privacy assessments without opening the popup.
</Tip>

## 4. Connection Categories Explained

The popup panel organizes connected domains into three categories based on the network request outcome:

### A. Not Blocked (Allowed)
- Domains here had successful connections.
- Resources from these domains were allowed to load.
- They usually represent necessary or permitted third-party services, like CDNs or analytics.

### B. Stealth-Blocked
- These connections were intercepted and blocked stealthily by content blockers.
- "Stealth-blocked" means the browser or page may receive little or no indication that these requests were blocked.
- Often used to avoid webpage breakage or detection.

### C. Blocked
- Direct blocking of the network request was reported.
- These domains attempted connection but were explicitly prevented.

### Visual Indicators
- _Allowed_ sections are highlighted in green hues.
- _Stealth-blocked_ and _Blocked_ sections are shown using red shades to highlight potential privacy concerns.

---

## 5. Domain Listing Details

Each connection category lists individual domains alongside the number of connections made or blocked from each.

- Domains are presented in Unicode format, decoded for easier reading (using Punycode decoding where necessary).
- The count badge shows how many times that domain was contacted within the current tab session.

### How to Use This
- **Spot High-Volume Domains:** Large counts may indicate heavy resource usage or tracking activity.
- **Identify Suspicious Domains:** Unknown or unrelated domains can be flagged for further investigation.

<Tip>
Pay special attention to domains in the Stealth-blocked and Blocked sections—they often represent trackers or ad servers your blocking rules are targeting.
</Tip>

## 6. Recognizing Genuine Third-Party Servers

uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List to accurately group domain names. This ensures:

- Domains are counted correctly at the registrable domain level.
- Subdomains (e.g. `cdn.example.com`) are grouped under their parent domain (`example.com`), preventing inflated counts.

### Practical Effect
- The popup avoids double counting domains that are part of the same third-party organization.
- You get a realistic view of how many unique third-party domains your browser has contacted.

## 7. Practical Scenario: Using the Popup Panel

Imagine you visit a news website and open the uBO Scope popup:

1. You see the header showing the news site’s domain.
2. The summary indicates connections to 15 distinct third-party domains.
3. In “Not Blocked,” you spot domains like CDN providers or static content hosts.
4. In “Stealth-Blocked” and “Blocked,” you find several advertising and tracking domains.
5. One domain shows a large count badge (e.g., 150), indicating heavy interaction.

You can then investigate if you want to create custom blocking rules or simply monitor your exposure.

## 8. Troubleshooting the Popup Panel

### Issue: Popup Shows “NO DATA” or No Domains
- **Check Permission:** Ensure the extension has permissions for the current tab.
- **Reload Tab:** Sometimes data takes a moment to populate; refresh the page.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Confirm you’re on a supported browser version per the requirements.

### Issue: Badge Count Does Not Update
- **Wait a Few Seconds:** Network events aggregate with a slight delay.
- **Verify Network Activity:** Visit a site with active remote connections.
- **Restart Extension:** Reload the extension to clear stale session data.

<Tip>
If troubles persist, consult the "Troubleshooting Common Issues" and "Known Limitations & Gotchas" guides for deeper diagnostics.
</Tip>

## 9. Best Practices for Maximizing Popup Use

- Use the popup panel after page load completes to get a full snapshot.
- Correlate high counts with names you recognize to filter benign services from potential trackers.
- Use stealth block information to understand when content blockers are shielding you silently.
- Combine insights with badge counts for quick monitoring as you browse.

## 12. Appendix: Sample Popup Panel Elements

```html
<h2 id="tabHostname"><span>news.bbc.</span><span>co.uk</span></h2>
<section id="summary">domains connected: <span>15</span></section>
<section class="outcome allowed">
  <h3>not blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains">
    <div class="row"><span class="domain">cdn.example.com</span><span class="count badge">200</span></div>
    <div class="row"><span class="domain">fonts.googleapis.com</span><span class="count badge">8</span></div>
  </div>
</section>
<section class="outcome stealth">
  <h3>stealth-blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains">
    <div class="row"><span class="domain">tracker.example.net</span><span class="count badge">50</span></div>
  </div>
</section>
<section class="outcome blocked">
  <h3>blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains">
    <div class="row"><span class="domain">ads.adserver.org</span><span class="count badge">20</span></div>
  </div>
</section>
```

This is the actual structure rendered in the popup panel, automatically populated by uBO Scope based on observed network events.
