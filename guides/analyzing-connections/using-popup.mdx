# Using the Popup: Domain Lists and Details

## Overview
The uBO Scope popup interface offers a clear, real-time view of third-party network connections detected on the active browser tab. It visually categorizes domains by their connection status: **Allowed (Not Blocked)**, **Blocked**, and **Stealth-Blocked**, reflecting exactly how network requests were handled. This guide walks you through interpreting these domain lists, understanding their statuses, including handling of Unicode (internationalized) domains, and explains what actions you can (and should) take when using the popup.

---

## 1. What You Will Accomplish
- Understand how to interpret the domain lists and their corresponding connection outcomes in the popup UI
- Identify the meaning of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains with practical context
- Learn how domain counts and statuses correlate with your browser’s network activity
- Gain insight into internationalized domain handling and representation in the popup
- Get practical advice on next steps and troubleshooting

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and active in your browser
- Basic knowledge of web browsing and extensions
- Having an active tab loaded with a webpage that triggers network connections

### Expected Outcome
You will confidently interpret the popup’s domain lists, recognize the significance of each connection status, and effectively utilize the popup interface for auditing third-party connections.

### Time Estimate
5-10 minutes

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## 2. Popup Interface Walkthrough

### A. Popup Layout and Sections
The popup consists of several key areas:

- **Tab Hostname Header**: Displays the hostname and domain of the current active browser tab.
- **Summary Section**: Shows the count of distinct third-party domains connected on this tab.
- **Domain Lists Sections**: Three categorized sections listing domains by connection outcome:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
  - **Stealth-Blocked**
  - **Blocked**

Each domain listed includes a count badge showing how many connections were made to that domain.

### B. How Domain Categorization Works
The popup groups third-party domains based on the request outcomes observed during the page load:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked)**: Domains from which network requests successfully fetched resources.
- **Blocked**: Domains to which requests were blocked by content blockers or failed outright.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains for which requests were redirected or blocked stealthily by the content blocker, without the webpage’s knowledge.

Domains appear under their **registered domain name** to consolidate hosts logically, e.g., `cdn.example.com` and `assets.example.com` both report under `example.com`.

### C. Unicode and Internationalized Domains
Domains with Unicode characters are converted and displayed using their most user-friendly form (Unicode), but internally handled as ASCII punycode. This ensures domain names containing international characters are presented clearly and accurately.

## 3. Step-by-Step: Using the Popup

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup">
Locate the uBO Scope extension icon on your browser toolbar and click it to open the popup interface.

**Expected result:** Popup window appears showing the header with the current tab’s hostname and domain.
</Step>

<Step title="Check the Tab Hostname and Domain">
At the top of the popup, observe the hostname (possibly a subdomain) and the registered domain. This identifies the current webpage whose connections are listed.

**Tip:** If the hostname and domain differ, the prefix shown represents the subdomain portion.

**Expected result:** You can read the page hostname and domain clearly.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Summary Section">
Look at the summary which shows the number of distinct third-party domains that were connected to (allowed).

**Expected result:** Numeric count matches the allowed domains list length.

**Note:** A lower count typically indicates fewer third-party connections, which often relates to better privacy.
</Step>

<Step title="Explore the 'Not Blocked' Domain List">
This section lists all domains from which resources were successfully fetched.

- Each domain has a count badge indicating the number of separate connection attempts.
- Domains appear sorted alphabetically for easy scanning.

**Decision Point:** If you see many unexpected or suspicious domains here, consider reviewing your blocking lists and privacy settings.

**Expected result:** Domains correspond to content elements loaded by the webpage.
</Step>

<Step title="Explore the 'Stealth-Blocked' Domain List">
Review domains whose requests were blocked stealthily.

- These connections are hidden from webpage scripts but reported here.
- Helps identify what stealth blocking is preventing.

**Tip:** Regularly monitor this list to understand any silent blocking your content blocker performs.

**Expected result:** Recognize stealth-blocked domains impacting your privacy.
</Step>

<Step title="Explore the 'Blocked' Domain List">
View domains where requests were blocked outright or failed.

- This includes explicit blocking or network errors.
- These domains do not count towards the allowed domains total.

**Expected result:** Domains reflect your blocking rules and network environment.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Domain Counts and Details">
For any domain, the count shows how many distinct requests were made to it.

**Example:** If the domain `tracker.example` shows a count of 5, the browser attempted 5 separate requests involving that domain during the page session.

**Expected result:** Counts help assess request volume and domain relevance.
</Step>

<Step title="Understand Unicode Domain Display">
Domains with internationalized characters will appear in their native script where possible.

- The extension converts these domains from ASCII punycode to Unicode for friendly display.
- This ensures domains like `münchen.de` appear naturally instead of `xn--mnchen-3ya.de`.

**Expected result:** Domains with Unicode are clearly readable and distinct.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Verify Badge Counts With Popup Data:** The toolbar badge number reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains. Use the popup to validate and understand the sources behind this count.

- **Use Popup to Audit Your Content Blocker:** By reviewing blocked and stealth-blocked domains, verify your content blocker is effectively protecting your privacy.

- **Handle International Domains Properly:** If you frequently browse international sites, rely on the popup's Unicode domain display to easily recognize domains.

- **Refresh the Popup After Tab Change:** The popup data updates on demand; open it in the active tab to see current connection data.

- **Regularly Check Stealth-Blocked Section:** Understanding stealth blocking can help you fine-tune your privacy tools and catch previously unseen trackers.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Usage">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists">
This means uBO Scope has not collected data for the active tab yet.

**Actions:**
- Reload the page to trigger network tracking.
- Confirm the extension is active (see Activation guide).
- Ensure the tab is supported (not a browser internal page).
- Try closing and reopening the popup.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Counts Do Not Match Badge Number">
Sometimes counts in the popup and toolbar badge may appear inconsistent.

**Reason:** The badge reflects distinct allowed domains, while the popup separately lists each outcome category with counts.

**Actions:**
- Confirm you’re viewing the popup for the active tab.
- Reload the page and popup to refresh data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unicode Domains Not Displaying Correctly">
If internationalized domains appear as punycode rather than Unicode:

**Action:** Make sure your browser supports Unicode properties properly.

The extension converts domains appropriately, but browser rendering affects display.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Summary

The popup UI of uBO Scope is your window into the real-time network connections associated with the active browser tab. By clearly segmenting allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains, it equips you with actionable insights into your web privacy footprint. The Unicode domain handling ensures international domains are displayed intelligibly, making the extension practical worldwide.

Consistent reference to the popup aids in auditing your content blocking effectiveness and understanding network activity on any site.
