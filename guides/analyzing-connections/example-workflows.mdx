# Common Workflows and Real-World Examples

## Overview
Explore practical scenarios where uBO Scope empowers you to verify the effectiveness of your content blocker, uncover unexpected third-party connections on popular websites, and confirm tangible privacy improvements after implementing other privacy measures. This guide walks you through typical user journeys focused on gaining actionable insights from the extension's data.

## 1. Verifying Your Content Blocker’s Effectiveness

### Task Description
You want to confidently assess how well your current content blocker limits third-party connections, beyond just relying on block counts or deceptive test sites.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and active in your browser.
- A content blocker enabled (e.g., uBlock Origin).
- Basic familiarity with opening the uBO Scope popup.

### Expected Outcome
Understand the number and categories of third-party servers contacted, isolating those successfully blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed through.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Webpage You Want to Test">
Navigate to a site where you want to audit network connections. News sites, ecommerce platforms, and content-heavy websites often have multiple third-party requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Toolbar Badge">
Look at the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge number. This reflects the distinct third-party domains from which connections were made successfully (allowed).
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface">
Click the extension icon to open the popup UI. This presents categorized lists: 'not blocked' (allowed), 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze Domain Lists">
Review each section:
- ‘not blocked’: Third-party domains that served content.
- ‘stealth-blocked’: Connections subtly blocked without alerting the webpage.
- ‘blocked’: Connections explicitly blocked by your content blocker.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Data">
Use this breakdown to appreciate how your content blocker balances blocking and concealment. A low number of allowed third-party domains typically indicates strong privacy protection.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Best Practices
- Trust the badge count as a measure of distinct allowed third-party servers—not just block count.
- Pay particular attention to stealth-blocked domains as these are trackers sneaked past but blocked quietly.
- Use the domain counts to spot surprising third parties that may require custom blocking rules.

### Troubleshooting
- If the popup is empty or the badge does not appear, verify the extension is enabled and granted necessary permissions. See "Activation and First Run" and "Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues" for help.

## 2. Spotting Unwanted Third-Party Requests on News or Ecommerce Sites

### Task Description
You want to identify potentially privacy-invasive or unnecessary third-party domains contacted while browsing commercial or news websites.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and running.
- Access to a site with multiple embedded third-party elements (ads, analytics, CDNs).

### Expected Outcome
A detailed inventory of distinct remote servers contacted by the page, segmented by connection status for focused review.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Visit Your Target Website">
Open a news or ecommerce website you frequent.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Severity of Third-Party Connections via The Badge">
Note the number on the toolbar badge. A sudden rise from typical baseline values could reveal more third-party activity.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel for Domain Insight">
Click the uBO Scope icon to reveal the current tab’s connection details.
</Step>
<Step title="Review and Take Notes of Unexpected or Suspicious Domains">
Look under 'not blocked' and 'stealth-blocked' categories to spot domains unfamiliar to you or known trackers.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Domain Counts to Prioritize Actions">
Focus on domains with high connection counts first, as they may have a greater privacy impact.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Tips
- Cross-reference suspicious domains against public lists or privacy forums to verify reputability.
- Consider adding custom filters in your content blocker for persistent unwanted domains.
- Use the Unicode-to-ASCII domain conversion insight from uBO Scope to recognize internationalized domains masquerading as legitimate.

### Common Pitfalls
- Don’t confuse CDN domains used for performance optimization with tracking domains.
- Unsupported or invisible network requests outside browser scope will not be reported.

## 3. Confirming Privacy Improvements After Making Changes

### Task Description
After adjusting your privacy setup—such as updating filters, enabling DNS-based blocking, or changing browser settings—you want to verify that third-party connections have decreased or shifted.

### Prerequisites
- Baseline data from uBO Scope before changes (badge counts and popup domain lists).
- Completed your privacy adjustments.

### Expected Outcome
Clear evidence of reduced or changed third-party connections confirming improved privacy.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Gather Baseline Data">
Before making changes, record the badge number and export domain lists from the uBO Scope popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Apply Your Privacy Enhancements">
Enable new filters, adjust content blocker settings, or activate DNS privacy features.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload Target Websites and Observe Badge Changes">
Visit the same sites and watch the badge counts for decreases, which indicate fewer third-party servers accessed.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup and Compare Domain Lists">
Compare the lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains before and after to confirm expected blocking behavior.
</Step>
<Step title="Iterate as Needed">
If unexpected allowed domains remain, consider tightening filters or investigate stealth-blocked domains for potential leaks.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Best Practices
- Use consistent browsing conditions (same sites, same sessions) for accurate before/after comparisons.
- Keep notes on domain changes and counts to track progress over time.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with other diagnostic tools for comprehensive evaluation.

### Troubleshooting
- If no change appears after modifying settings, verify your changes are applied correctly and reload the pages.
- Remember some tracking techniques or embedded content may bypass browser-level blocking.

## Appendix: Example Scenario — Auditing a News Website

Suppose you visit example-news.com and notice a badge count of 15. Opening the popup lists 8 ‘not blocked’, 4 ‘stealth-blocked’, and 3 ‘blocked’ third-party domains.
- You spot an unfamiliar domain “tracker.example.net” showing up under ‘not blocked’ with several connections.
- You consult public filter lists and community forums and learn this domain is a known tracker.
- You add a custom blocking rule targeting tracker.example.net and reload.
- The badge count drops to 12, and “tracker.example.net” moves to ‘blocked’.

This concrete use case shows how uBO Scope empowers you to identify and mitigate unwanted network requests with confidence.
