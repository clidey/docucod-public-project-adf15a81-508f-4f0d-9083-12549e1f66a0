# Using uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance

## Workflow Overview

### Purpose
This guide is designed to empower filter list maintainers with a practical workflow for using uBO Scope to test filters, identify stealth network requests, and verify the effectiveness of block rules. It is especially valuable for maintainers working on platforms with limited or no access to traditional browser developer tools.

### Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and activated in a compatible browser (Chromium-based, Firefox, or Safari).
- Basic familiarity with uBO Scope's toolbar badge and popup interface.
- Access to filter lists you wish to test or maintain.
- An understanding of third-party network connections and filter list terminology is helpful but not required.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will:
- Analyze webpage network request outcomes categorized by uBO Scope.
- Detect stealth-blocked network connections that may bypass filters.
- Confirm that your filter rules effectively block or allow connections as intended.
- Gain insights to refine or create more accurate filter rules.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15–30 minutes to complete the initial inspection and testing cycle, depending on the complexity of the filters and sites tested.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate — suitable for those familiar with content blocking concepts and seeking to maintain or enhance filter lists.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare uBO Scope for Inspection
- Ensure the extension is active in your browser.
- Navigate to the website or use test pages where you intend to analyze filter behavior.

<Tip>
Starting with a site that loads third-party resources is essential since uBO Scope only reports network requests made by webpages.
</Tip>

### 2. Observe the Toolbar Badge
- Monitor the badge on the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
- The badge number reflects the count of distinct allowed third-party domains contacted by the current tab.

<Tip>
A lower badge count generally indicates fewer allowed third-party connections, which is a common goal in filter maintenance.
</Tip>

### 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar button to open the popup panel.
- The popup categorizes third-party domains under three headings:
  - **Not blocked (allowed):** Connections allowed by filters.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Connections prevented by stealthy blocking techniques (e.g., redirects).
  - **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked.

### 4. Analyze the Domain Lists
- Review domains in each section carefully:
  - **Allowed:** Identify third parties that still receive traffic. Confirm if these are necessary or require blocking.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** These may indicate filter rules triggering indirect blocking; analyze to refine your lists.
  - **Blocked:** Validate these are expected and correspond to your filter rules.

### 5. Test Filter Changes
- Modify or create filter rules in your filter list based on observations.
- Reload the target webpage to trigger new network requests.
- Observe how the badge count and popup categorize domains change.

### 6. Verify Outcomes
- Confirm stealth-blocked domains reduce after refining filters.
- Check that allowed third-party domains are minimized as per your goals.
- Investigate any unexpected allowed or stealth domains that may hint at filter bypasses.

### 7. Iterate
- Repeat testing and adjustment cycles until filter behavior aligns with intended blocking policy.
- Use uBO Scope as a real-time verification tool during maintenance.

## Practical Examples

### Example Scenario: Testing a New Blocking Rule
Suppose you want to block a third-party domain `tracking.example.com`:

1. Open the site known to load resources from `tracking.example.com`.
2. Observe that `tracking.example.com` appears under **Not blocked** in uBO Scope.
3. Add a blocking rule in your filter list:

```plaintext
||tracking.example.com^
```

4. Reload the site.
5. `tracking.example.com` should move to the **Blocked** or **Stealth-blocked** sections, and badge count should decrease.


### Example: Identifying Stealth Blocking
Sometimes, a domain is stealth-blocked instead of outright blocked, which could indicate a redirect or indirect blocking:

- Find domains under the **Stealth-blocked** section.
- Investigate filter rules responsible for redirects or other complex block mechanics.
- Consider adding explicit blocking rules if stealth blocking skips some requests.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **No domains displayed in popup:** Ensure uBO Scope is active and reload the page.
- **Unexpected high badge count:** May indicate filters are not blocking as expected or new third-party domains have appeared.
- **Stealth-blocked domains persist after filter updates:** Stealth blocking may rely on browser or extension-specific behaviors; try explicit blocking rules or clear browser cache.

### Best Practices
- Rely on the badge count as a quick summary of allowed connections.
- Use popup detail to guide filter rule precision.
- Avoid relying on ad blocker test sites as they provide misleading results (see mythbusting guides).
- Combine uBO Scope insights with real-world site testing for filter validation.

### Performance Considerations
- uBO Scope runs real-time monitoring but may have slight delays reflecting new requests (due to batching).
- For best accuracy, reload pages fully (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) when testing filter changes.

### Alternative Approaches
- Use uBO Scope alongside the standard developer tools when available for deeper insights.
- Supplement with network analysis from uBlock Origin’s logger tools.
