# Making Sense of Toolbar Badge Counts

## Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count

The toolbar badge count in uBO Scope is a pivotal metric designed to give you a clear and meaningful picture of your browser's network connections. Specifically, it reflects the number of **distinct third-party remote domains** that your browser has successfully connected to during the current tab session.

### Why This Count Matters

- The badge count tracks **allowed connections** only — domains from which your browser actually fetched data.
- A **lower badge count is better**, indicating fewer third-party servers communicating with your browser, which generally correlates with enhanced privacy and reduced tracking.
- The count excludes blocked or failed connection attempts to ensure you focus on actual network exposure rather than just the volume of blocking.

### What Is a “Third-Party” Domain?

Third-party domains are those different from the site you are visiting. This typically includes
- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- Analytics providers
- Advertisers
- Any external servers contacted by embedded scripts or resources

uBO Scope categorizes connections distinctly to help you evaluate the true scope of external communications.

## How the Badge Count is Computed

1. **Monitoring Network Requests:**
   uBO Scope listens to your browser’s network activity through the `webRequest` API.

2. **Classifying Outcomes:**
   Network requests are grouped as:
   - **Allowed:** Successfully completed connections.
   - **Blocked:** Connections prevented by content blockers or other mechanisms.
   - **Stealth-blocked:** Stealthy blocks that may not be obvious but still prevent resources.

3. **Aggregating Unique Domains:**
   The badge count reflects the count of distinct domains in the Allowed category.

4. **Counting Sessions Per Tab:**
   Each browser tab maintains its own count, which updates dynamically as browsing continues.

## Practical Interpretation

Imagine you visit your favorite news site. uBO Scope tracks all remote servers your browser talks to:

- If the badge shows **5**, it means 5 unique external servers sent data.
- If another content blocker shows a high number of blocks but your badge count is high too, your browser might still be connecting to many external domains despite those blocks.

This insight helps you calibrate your content blocking strategies and understand real exposure rather than guesswork based on block counts.

## Common Misconceptions About Badge Counts

<AccordionGroup title="Mythbusting Toolbar Badge Counts">
<Accordion title="More Blocks Means Better Protection">

Not true. A high block count does not guarantee better privacy.
- A blocker that blocks many requests might still allow connections to a broader range of distinct third parties.
- uBO Scope's badge focuses on **distinct allowed connections**, a more accurate privacy indicator.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Ad Blocker Test Pages Are Reliable Benchmarks">

These test pages simulate artificial network requests to trigger blocks, but their scenarios rarely reflect real browsing behavior.
- Most real-world web requests differ significantly.
- uBO Scope emphasizes real browsing data, giving a more authentic measurement.

## Using Badge Counts Effectively

### Tips

- Use badge counts as a direct signal of exposure to third-party servers.
- Compare badge counts across different sites to identify which pages communicate with more external servers.
- When testing content blockers, focus on reducing badge counts rather than just block counts.

### Best Practices

- Regularly observe badge counts on high-traffic and privacy-sensitive sites.
- Combine badge count data with the detailed popup analysis of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains for a full picture.
- Consider that some legitimate services require third-party connections, aiming for a realistic low number rather than zero.

## How This Fits in Your Workflow

1. **Monitor Badge Count:** Observe this number as you browse to gauge your network connections at a glance.
2. **Open the Popup:** Dig deeper into the allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domain lists for contextual insight.
3. **Adjust Blocking Configurations:** If the badge count is unexpectedly high, use the popup data to identify problematic domains.
4. **Validate Changes:** Revisit sites to confirm badge counts decrease as expected.

## Example Scenario

You visit "example-news.com" and see a badge count of `8`.

- Open uBO Scope's popup panel.
- Find that 5 allowed domains are core site assets.
- The other 3 domains come from advertising networks.
- You decide to add custom rules to block those ad networks.
- After applying, the badge count drops to `5` on reloading, confirming the reduction in third-party exposure.

## Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues

| Issue                        | Cause                                   | Solution                                |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Badge count not updating      | Browser event listeners inactive or delayed | Refresh the page or restart the browser | 
| Badge count stuck at zero     | Extension permissions missing or denied | Verify permissions and reinstall if needed |
| Badge count unexpectedly high | Content blocker overlaps or whitelist effects | Review popup details and filter configurations |
