# Mythbusting: What Network Request Counts Really Tell You

## Overview

This guide leads you through real-world scenarios to dispel common misconceptions about network request counts in content blocking. It explains why a higher block count does not necessarily mean a better blocker, and why ad blocker testing websites can provide misleading evaluations. You will learn best practices for using uBO Scope to accurately judge content blocking effectiveness based on realistic network observations.

---

## What This Guide Helps You Accomplish

- Understand the difference between block counts and actual privacy impact.
- Recognize the limitations of conventional ad blocker test pages.
- Use uBO Scope data within real browsing contexts to evaluate blocker performance.
- Avoid common pitfalls in interpreting blocked and allowed request metrics.

## Prerequisites

- Have uBO Scope installed and enabled in your supported browser (see [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope)).
- Basic familiarity with uBO Scope’s popup UI showing allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains (see [Reading Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Domains](./reading-status)).
- Use the extension on real-world websites rather than synthetic test pages.

## Expected Outcome

- Ability to interpret the toolbar badge count and popup domain lists with confidence.
- Skills to distinguish meaningful privacy metrics from superficial block counts.
- Enhanced judgment on content blocker efficiency based on distinct third-party connections.

## Time Estimate

Approximately 10–15 minutes to read and apply insights.

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate: requires understanding basic concepts of network connections and content blocking.

## Understanding Why High Block Counts Aren’t Always Better

### 1. The Fallacy of Block Count as a Quality Measure

Many users equate a high number of blocked requests with better privacy or content blocking. However, uBO Scope demonstrates that the most meaningful metric is not the sheer count of blocked requests, but the number of distinct third-party domains your browser actually connects to.

- A content blocker with a high block count *may still allow connections to more unique third-party domains* than another blocker with a lower block count.
- This means that a blocker seemingly more aggressive in blocking could actually be **less effective** in reducing real network surface exposed to third parties.

<Tip>
Focus on the number of distinct allowed third-party domains (seen in the popup and the toolbar badge) rather than the total block count. A lower number indicates better privacy protection.
</Tip>

### 2. Real-World Behavior Matters

Network requests on the web are complex and dynamic. Real websites load resources from various legitimate CDNs and service providers essential for proper functionality.

- A blocker that indiscriminately blocks many requests may *break site features* or force legitimate connections to fallback domains, potentially increasing the diversity of allowed domains.
- uBO Scope tracks requests regardless of blocking method (extension, DNS, etc.) for accurate visibility of what your browser actually connects to.

### 3. How uBO Scope Counts Domain Connections

uBO Scope counts distinct third-party domains for which there was a connection, not just blocked attempts.

- Allowed: Domains your browser actually fetched resources from.
- Stealth-blocked: Domains the blocker silently prevented without page detection.
- Blocked: Domains explicitly blocked with error outcomes on requests.

This distinction lets you see the *true network exposure* beyond misleading block numbers.

## Why Ad Blocker Testing Websites Mislead You

### 1. Synthetic and Unrealistic Testing Scenarios

Ad blocker test pages make network requests to remote servers that are fabricated and designed solely for test cases.

- These domain requests often do not represent real-world browsing patterns.
- Real websites do not load resources from these arbitrary test domains.

### 2. Blocker Detection and Stealth Techniques

Many modern content blockers employ stealth techniques to avoid webpage detection or breakage.

- Test pages typically detect only naive blocking methods.
- uBO Scope is immune to such tricks by measuring connections at the network request level, independent of page scripts.

However, test pages cannot evaluate a blocker's stealth behavior or realistic performance.

### 3. Misleading Conclusions

- A blocker may fail or appear weak on a test page but perform excellently in actual browsing.
- Conversely, a blocker may block many test requests but fail to restrict distinct third-party domains in real use.

<Warning>
Avoid relying on ad blocker test websites for real assessment. Use uBO Scope on authentic browsing sessions for trustworthy insights.
</Warning>

## Best Practices for Using uBO Scope to Judge Blocker Effectiveness

### 1. Monitor Real Browsing Sessions

- Use uBO Scope while visiting everyday websites you frequent.
- Observe the toolbar badge count: lower is better.
- Open the popup to examine the allowed third-party domain list.

### 2. Compare Configurations Thoughtfully

- Test different blocker settings and note changes in the allowed domain count.
- Remember that fewer allowed domains means reduced network exposure, hence better blocking.

### 3. Understand Domain Aggregation

- uBO Scope groups connections by domain, so multiple requests to the same domain count once.
- Focus on domain reduction, not raw request counts.

### 4. Watch for Stealth-Blocking

- Domains in the 'stealth-blocked' section did not fully load but might have been silently blocked.
- Stealth blocking avoids page breakage but still reduces tracking.

### 5. Use Badge and Popup Together

- The toolbar badge gives a quick numeric summary.
- The popup provides detailed per-domain information for deeper analysis.

<Check>
Always verify with real-world sites and trust the distinct third-party connections metric over block counts or test page performance.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

| Pitfall | Explanation | How to Avoid |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Equating high block count with privacy | High block counts can mean more allowed unique connections | Focus on allowed domain counts with uBO Scope
| Relying on ad blocker test pages | Test pages use artificial domains, not realistic | Use uBO Scope on everyday websites
| Ignoring stealth-blocking presence | Stealth blocking reduces connection silently | Check the stealth-blocked list in the popup
| Misunderstanding domain vs. request count | Multiple requests to one domain count as one | Review domain counts specifically

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If the badge count seems unusually high, make sure you are testing on real sites and not synthetic test pages.
- Confirm uBO Scope has all necessary permissions (see [Installation & Setup](./installing-ubo-scope)).
- Use the popup view to identify domains contributing to counts and verify if they are expected third parties.
- For unexpected increases, consider clearing session data or restarting the browser to reset.
