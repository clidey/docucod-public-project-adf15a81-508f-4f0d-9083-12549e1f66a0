# Using uBO Scope to Audit Site Privacy

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for using uBO Scope to evaluate third-party network connections initiated by websites you visit. It empowers privacy-conscious users, researchers, and digital security auditors to spot potential privacy risks by analyzing which remote servers a site communicates with, including trackers and other external services.

By following this guide, users will gain the confidence and skills to use uBO Scope to assess privacy exposure reliably and make informed decisions about content blockers or browsing habits.

---

## Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed on a supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with your browser’s toolbar and extension interface.
- Active internet connection and permission for uBO Scope to observe network requests.
- For best insight, use on websites where tracking or third-party connections are relevant.

<Check>
Ensure uBO Scope is activated and the badge icon is visible on the toolbar before proceeding.
</Check>

## What You Will Achieve
- Identify and categorize third-party domains contacted by a website.
- Recognize which requests were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Understand the privacy implications of the number and nature of external connections.
- Utilize the popup panel to inspect detailed domain-level connection data.

Estimated completion time: 5–10 minutes per site audit.

Difficulty level: Beginner to Intermediate.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope on the Target Website
1. Navigate to the website you want to audit.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon on your browser’s toolbar.
3. The popup panel will display the site’s hostname at the top and a summary of connected domains.

<Tip>
The badge number on the extension icon shows the count of distinct third-party domains with successful network connections. A higher count indicates more third-party exposure.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Interpret the Badge and Popup Summary
- **Badge Count:** Number of unique third-party domains successfully connected.
- **Domains Connected:** Matches the badge count and displayed in the “domains connected” summary.

### Step 3: Review Domain Lists by Connection Outcome
The popup divides third-party servers into three categories:

- **Not Blocked (allowed):** Domains with successful connections.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains whose requests were blocked stealthily (prevented without visible blocking effects).
- **Blocked:** Domains whose network requests were explicitly blocked.

For each category, the popup lists domains with counts showing how many requests were made.

### Step 4: Analyze Third-Party Domains
1. Examine the domains in each category:
   - Pay close attention to domains categorized as "not blocked" to assess privacy exposure.
   - Compare the stealth-blocked and blocked lists to understand the extent of filtering.
2. Note that many legitimate third-party domains are CDNs or resource hosts, which may be necessary for site function.
3. Identify any trackers, advertising servers, or suspicious domains.

### Step 5: Validate Privacy Findings with Browsing Activity
To confirm real network exposure:
1. Interact with the website, triggering content load, media, or dynamic features.
2. Refresh the uBO Scope popup to see updated domain counts.
3. Observe changes in badge count and domain lists corresponding to your browsing actions.

### Step 6: Use Results to Inform Privacy Decisions
Based on identified third-party domains and their connection outcomes:
- Consider enhancing blocking filters if many unwanted domains appear under "allowed".
- Be cautious about sites with numerous third-party connections, especially to advertising or tracking domains.
- Use the insights to adjust browsing habits or content blocker settings accordingly.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Auditing an E-Commerce Site
- Open an e-commerce site known for tracking 
- Observe a badge count of 15 on the uBO Scope icon.
- Popup displays:
  - Not Blocked: content delivery networks, payment gateways
  - Stealth-Blocked: some advertising servers
  - Blocked: multiple tracking domains
- Interpretation: The site contacts numerous third parties but blocks some trackers stealthily.

### Example 2: Comparing Privacy on News Sites
- Visit two news outlets.
- One shows 7 third-party domains allowed and few blocked.
- Another has 20 allowed domains with many trackers blocked.
- Conclusion: Second site has greater third-party exposure but better filtering in place.

---

## Tips and Best Practices
- **Regularly audit frequently visited sites** to stay aware of changing third-party connections.
- Use uBO Scope in conjunction with your content blocker to verify its effectiveness.
- Remember that not all third-party domains are harmful; CDNs and essential services will appear.
- Avoid relying solely on the badge count; use the detailed popup panel for deeper understanding.
- Refresh the popup after site navigation or dynamic loading to capture all requests.

<Note>
uBO Scope shows network outcomes independent from the content blocker used; it detects real connection attempts, including those blocked stealthily.
</Note>

---

## Common Pitfalls
- **Misinterpreting badge numbers:** A lower badge number is generally better — it signifies fewer third-party connections.
- **Trusting ad blocker test sites:** These are often unrealistic and not reflective of real-world browsing.
- **Ignoring stealth-blocked domains:** These may still imply network requests intercepted invisibly, which affects privacy.

## Troubleshooting

### Popup Panel Shows ‘NO DATA’ or Blank
- Ensure you are viewing an active, loaded web page tab.
- Refresh the page and reopen the popup.
- Confirm that uBO Scope is enabled and has required permissions.

### Badge Count Not Updating
- Trigger network activity by interacting with the site.
- Wait a few seconds for data processing.
- Restart the browser to resolve extension state issues.

### Unexpected High Domain Counts
- Consider whether the site heavily relies on third-party services.
- Use the popup to identify domains and judge their necessity.
