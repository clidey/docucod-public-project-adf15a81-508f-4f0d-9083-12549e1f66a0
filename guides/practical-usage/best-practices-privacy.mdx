# Best Practices: Minimizing Tracking and Exposure

## Overview
This guide empowers you to use uBO Scope effectively to reduce your web tracking footprint by learning how to monitor third-party network connections and respond appropriately. By understanding the counts, categories, and insights displayed in the popup panel, you will be able to make informed decisions that lower your exposure to unwanted tracking and optimize your browsing privacy.

## Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and active in your supported browser (Chromium, Firefox, or Safari).
- Basic familiarity with how to open and read the uBO Scope popup panel (see "Understanding the Popup Panel" guide).
- Awareness that the extension requires granted permissions to observe web requests.

## Expected Outcome
After completing this guide, you will confidently interpret your active tab's third-party connection data, recognize stealth and blocked connections, and apply effective strategies to minimize unnecessary network exposure.

## Time Estimate
Approximately 10-15 minutes to understand concepts and start applying the practices.

## Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## 1. Interpreting Connection Data for Privacy

uBO Scope categorizes third-party network connections into three outcome groups:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** Domains that successfully connected and fetched resources.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where the connection was redirected or altered stealthily by content blockers.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts failed or were actively denied.

### Why Does This Matter?
Your privacy risk correlates directly with the number and types of third-party domains your browser contacts. The goal is to keep the number of allowed third-party domains as low as possible while ensuring websites remain functional.

### How to Use uBO Scope’s Counts Effectively:
- **Check the Badge Count:** A lower badge count on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon means fewer distinct third-party domains have connected, which is positive for privacy.
- **Review the Popup Panel:** The popup displays domains by category, letting you inspect where connections occur.
- **Focus on Domains, Not Request Counts:** The count is about distinct domains, not total requests, highlighting exposure sources more effectively.

<Tip>
Remember, some third-party domains like common CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) are often essential and low-risk. Distinguishing necessary from unnecessary connections helps optimize blocking without breaking sites.
</Tip>

## 2. Monitoring Your Active Tab’s Connections

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup
- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
- Wait briefly as the popup loads data about the current tab’s network connections.

### Step 2: Read the Tab Hostname Header
- At the top, observe the hostname and domain of the active tab.
- This confirms which webpage's connections you are viewing.

### Step 3: Review Summary Information
- Note the number next to 'domains connected' to see how many distinct domains have allowed connections.

### Step 4: Examine Domain Categories
- Look through the three sections: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
- Each domain listed shows how many times it was requested related to the current tab.

### Step 5: Analyze Domains for Privacy Impact
- Identify unexpected or unfamiliar allowed domains.
- Consider blocking or restricting domains that you do not trust or that serve ads/tracking.

<Warning>
Do not rely solely on the number of blocked domains as a measure of protection. Some blockers stealth block or allow many domains with minimal requests. Effective privacy focuses on minimizing allowed domains.
</Warning>

## 3. Strategies to Minimize Tracking and Exposure

### 3.1 Use Content Blockers Alongside uBO Scope
- Combine uBO Scope with content blockers like uBlock Origin or other privacy extensions.
- Monitor changes in allowed domains and stealth/blocked categories.
- Adjust filter lists based on insights from uBO Scope connection data.

### 3.2 Limit Third-Party Connections
- Block or restrict domains repeatedly showing up in allowed sections that are unnecessary.
- Favor blocking trackers known to build user profiles.
- Use stealth blocking configurations where possible to avoid website breakage.

### 3.3 Clean Browsing Sessions
- Close tabs or browser sessions with suspicious or excessive third-party connections.
- Regularly review your active tabs' domain exposure.

### 3.4 Be Wary of New or Unknown Domains
- Use uBO Scope to identify domains not typically associated with your visited websites.
- Investigate unexpected domains before allowing.

<Tip>
Customize filter lists and use blocklists as a proactive approach informed by uBO Scope insights. This results in more targeted and effective privacy protection.
</Tip>

## 4. Practical User Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the toolbar icon and view the active tab's connection summary.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify Allowed Connections">
Scan the 'not blocked' section to see all domains your browser successfully connected to.
</Step>
<Step title="Detect Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Check the 'stealth-blocked' list to understand which domains were redirected or filtered without obvious blocking.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Blocked Domains">
Observe the 'blocked' section for domains that your content blocker or browser denied.
</Step>
<Step title="Decide on Blocking Actions">
If you see unwanted or suspicious allowed domains, configure your filters accordingly to block them in the future.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Impact">
Reload the tab and check uBO Scope again to confirm reduction in allowed domains and tracking exposure.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall: Focusing Only on Blocked Counts
- **Issue:** Assuming more blocks equals better protection.
- **Solution:** Concentrate on reducing allowed third-party domains as tracked by uBO Scope.

### Pitfall: Ignoring Stealth-Blocked Domains
- **Issue:** Overlooking stealth blocking can distort your assessment.
- **Solution:** Use stealth-blocked insights to fine-tune settings and understand hidden filtering.

### Pitfall: Overblocking Breaking Websites
- **Issue:** Blocking essential domains can cause website breakage.
- **Solution:** Use uBO Scope data to identify needed domains and whitelist them cautiously.

### Pitfall: Misinterpreting Badge Numbers
- **Issue:** Confusing the badge count as total requests instead of distinct domains.
- **Solution:** Remember the badge count is strictly the number of distinct third-party domains allowed.

## 6. Troubleshooting Tips

- If the popup displays 'NO DATA' or appears empty:
  - Ensure the tab is active and the page has started loading.
  - Reload the page and open the popup again.
  - Confirm uBO Scope has appropriate permissions (storage, webRequest).
  - Check for conflicting extensions or browser policies blocking access.

- If the number of domains seems unexpectedly high:
  - Review filter lists and content blocker settings.
  - Try visiting a minimal or privacy-friendly website to compare.

- Unexpected domains appearing regularly may warrant additional investigation with domain lookup tools.
