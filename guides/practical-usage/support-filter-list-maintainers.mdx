# Supporting Filter List Maintainers and Power Users

## Introduction
uBO Scope is not just a privacy tool for everyday users; it is an indispensable aid for filter list maintainers and power users seeking an accurate view of third-party remote server connections. This guide provides practical workflows and expert tips on effectively using uBO Scope as a diagnostic device, especially on platforms where browser developer tools are limited or unavailable.

You will learn how to leverage uBO Scope’s capabilities to inspect network requests, understand stealth blocks, and analyze real browsing scenarios, empowering you to improve filter lists with precision.

## 1. Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps filter list maintainers and advanced users use uBO Scope to diagnose network connections, detect stealth blocking effects, and track unique domain interactions during realistic browsing.

### Prerequisites
- Must have uBO Scope installed and active in your supported browser (Chromium, Firefox, or Safari).
- Basic understanding of third-party domains and network request behavior.
- Knowledge of stealth blocking concept (see [Understanding Domain Categories in the Popup](../../guides/core-workflow/understanding-domain-categories)).

### Expected Outcome
- Ability to monitor and interpret network requests to enhance filter lists.
- Skills to identify stealth-blocked domains that evade standard blocking metrics.
- Strategies for troubleshooting and validating filter impacts on devices with limited debugging tools.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15-30 minutes to become comfortably proficient.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate to Advanced.

## 2. Understanding uBO Scope for Filter Maintenance

### Why Use uBO Scope?
Traditional filter list testing can miss subtle network activities like stealth-blocked requests. uBO Scope exposes these by categorizing all network connections per browser tab:

- **Allowed:** Domains that successfully load resources.
- **Blocked:** Connections that were outright blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that were redirected or dropped invisibly, not directly visible to web content or common blockers.

This visibility helps maintainers pinpoint where filters allow unwanted connections or where stealth tactics might bypass detection.

### Scenarios for Power Users
- Verifying filter effectiveness on constrained devices (e.g., mobile, embedded browsers) where console access is restricted.
- Tracking domains involved in complex redirect chains causing stealth blocking.
- Measuring the real distinct third-party domains loaded on pages across multiple filter configurations.

## 3. Step-by-Step Diagnostic Workflow

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope Popup for Target Tab
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in the active browser tab you intend to analyze.
- Observe the popup, which displays the hostname, total distinct domains connected, and categorized domain lists.

### Step 2: Interpret Domain Category Sections
- Review the **Allowed** domain list: these are the network connections that succeeded.
- Check the **Stealth-blocked** domains: these indicate requests that were blocked invisibly or redirected.
- Examine the **Blocked** domains: direct network blocks.

This informs you which domains might require further filter refinement or investigation.

### Step 3: Analyze Counts and Domain Frequencies
- Look at the counts next to each domain; higher counts may indicate repeated network activity useful for prioritization.
- Use these counts to identify domains that frequently slip through or appear in stealth mode.

### Step 4: Test with Different Filter Lists
- Switch your content blocker or filter lists and reload the page.
- Compare the popup data to see how different filter configurations affect allowed and stealth-blocked domains.

### Step 5: Record and Export Findings
- While uBO Scope currently does not have an export feature, consider manually noting key stealth or allowed domains that impact your filter maintenance.
- Use this data to improve rulesets or contribute to filter list projects.

## 4. Practical Tips for Filter Maintainers

### Tip 1: Focus on Stealth Domains to Detect Hidden Bypass
Stealth-blocked domains often indicate complex redirects or evasive techniques used by trackers or advertisers. Investigate these for potential filter enhancements.

### Tip 2: Use Realistic Browsing Sessions
Run uBO Scope monitoring on actual browsing scenarios, not synthetic test pages, to capture meaningful and relevant network activity that affects end-users.

### Tip 3: Monitor Per Tab for Granular Insights
uBO Scope tracks network requests on a per-tab basis, allowing precise correlation of domains with specific browsing sessions.

### Tip 4: Validate on Multiple Browsers
Filter behavior and stealth blocking can vary across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari. Testing on multiple browsers with uBO Scope reveals browser-specific issues.

### Tip 5: Refresh Often to Capture New Sessions
Stealth blocks and connections are session-sensitive. Refresh the page or navigate to different sites to get updated data.

## 5. Handling Devices with Limited Debugging Resources

In environments where browser devtools or extensive networking tools are unavailable (mobile browsers, embedded browsers, restricted OS), uBO Scope becomes a vital diagnostic window.

### Using the Toolbar Badge
- Pay attention to the badge count on the uBO Scope icon: the number reflects distinct allowed third-party domains.
- Lower counts after filter updates mean better blocking or less exposure.

### Popup UI
- Regularly open the popup to visually verify domain categories and counts for your current tab.
- Use the domain lists to understand if your filters behave correctly.

### Remote Debugging
- When possible, leverage remote debugging to collect more detailed session data.
- Use exported session data (via manual steps) to share with filter maintenance teams.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Popup Shows No Data or 'NO DATA'
- Ensure you are on an active, loaded webpage.
- Confirm uBO Scope is allowed to run on the page (check browser permissions).
- Reload the tab and reopen the popup.

### Issue: Badge Count Doesn't Update
- Wait a few seconds; the extension batches network info before updating.
- Restart the browser if the badge remains stale.
- Verify no conflicts with other extensions blocking messaging.

### Issue: Domains Not Appear in Expected Categories
- Understand stealth-category means some blocking happened silently; check filters for rules involving redirects.
- Some domain connections may be detected late; refresh or revisit the page.

## 7. Next Steps and Resources

- Follow the [Monitoring Third-Party Connections Guide](../core-workflow/monitor-connections) to deepen understanding of network data.
- Review [Understanding Domain Categories in the Popup](../core-workflow/understanding-domain-categories) for detailed insights on domain grouping.
- Explore [Debunking Common Ad Block Tester Myths](../../guides/practical-usage/debunking-ad-tester-myths) for context on evaluating blockers.
- Contribute findings or suggestions to filter list communities, leveraging data from uBO Scope.

## 8. Additional Information

uBO Scope’s backend architecture tracks network events using webRequest API listeners and compiles domain data categorized by request outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked) on a per-tab basis. This real-time insight is surfaced via the extension popup UI and badge counts, making it the most practical tool for maintainers looking to assess actual network connections at scale.


---

## Example Scenario: Diagnosing Stealth Blocking on a Complex Site

1. Open a tab on a website known for trackers.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to display the popup.
3. Note domains listed under "stealth-blocked" — these may be trackers that use server redirects or other stealth tactics.
4. Adjust filter lists or create new rules targeting these stealth domains.
5. Reload the tab and observe changes in allowed and stealth domains.
6. Repeat until stealth-blocked domains are minimized.

This workflow helps maintainers reveal blind spots that typical block counts or devtools don’t capture.

# FAQ

### Q1: Can uBO Scope export session data for external analysis?
Currently, there is no automated export feature. Manual recording of popup data or badge counts is recommended for external use.

### Q2: Does stealth blocking mean the content is harmless?
No, stealth blocking indicates requests were redirected or dropped invisibly; these may still represent privacy risks or filter bypass attempts.

### Q3: How often is the data updated in the popup?
Popup data reflects the current tab session and is updated in near real-time with slight batching delays for performance.
