# Comparing Content Blockers with uBO Scope

Explore an eye-opening, practical example of how uBO Scope can objectively evaluate and compare content blockers beyond simple block counts. This guide shows you how to use uBO Scope to monitor allowed third-party remote connections and debunk the common misconception that a higher block count automatically means better protection.

---

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description

This guide helps you objectively compare content blockers by monitoring their true effectiveness in blocking third-party connections using uBO Scope. Instead of just relying on toolbar badge block counts, you will learn how to reveal allowed connections that impact your real privacy.

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your browser.
- At least two content blockers installed that you want to compare (e.g., uBlock Origin, AdGuard).
- Basic familiarity with uBO Scope’s popup UI or willing to review related UI documentation.

### Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will understand how to interpret uBO Scope’s real-world connection data to discern which content blocker better restricts third-party connections, no matter their reported block count.

### Time Estimate

Approximately 15–30 minutes.

### Difficulty Level

Intermediate – assumes ability to manage browser extensions and interpret domain connection data.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Test Environment

- Open your browser and ensure uBO Scope is active.
- Disable all content blockers except the first one you want to test.
- Visit a commonly used website known to load multiple third-party resources (e.g., news website, shopping site).

### 2. Observe uBO Scope Data with First Content Blocker

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup.
- Review the list of third-party domains connected to that site.
- Note the number of **allowed** connections (displayed under 'not blocked') and the count shown in the toolbar badge.

### 3. Document Your Findings

- Record the number of allowed third-party domains.
- Optionally, take a screenshot of the uBO Scope popup for reference.

### 4. Repeat with the Second Content Blocker

- Disable the first content blocker, enable the second one.
- Refresh the same website.
- Open uBO Scope’s popup again.
- Compare the number and identity of allowed third-party connections.

### 5. Analyze the Results

- Identify if the second blocker allows fewer third-party connections or fewer *unique* third-party domains.
- Note any differences in stealth-blocked or blocked domains if relevant.

### 6. Understand What Block Count Really Means

- Recognize that a higher block count in the content blocker UI does not necessarily relate to better blocking.
- A blocker that blocks aggressively but ends up allowing connections from many third-party domains may have a higher block count but poorer real-world protection.

### 7. Draw Conclusions

- Use uBO Scope data to decide which blocker more effectively reduces the number of third-party domains connected.
- Understand your privacy footprint accurately rather than relying on misleading block counts.

## Real-World Example

Imagine you test two blockers:

- **Blocker A** reports 300 blocks on a popular news site.
- **Blocker B** reports 150 blocks on the same site.

You open uBO Scope with Blocker A enabled and see **35 allowed** third-party connections.

Then, with Blocker B, uBO Scope shows **20 allowed** third-party connections.

Despite Blocker A’s higher block count, it leaks more unique third-party connections, meaning Blocker B provides stronger practical blocking. Such insights from uBO Scope help debunk the myth that higher block counts equal better protection.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Always interpret uBO Scope results in context: a lower badge count and fewer allowed domains indicate a better privacy outcome.
- Perform tests on real-world websites rather than synthetic "ad-blocker test" pages that can mislead.
- Review the 'stealth-blocked' and 'blocked' domains sections to understand different blocking outcomes.
- Repeat tests multiple times and across different sites for a comprehensive evaluation.

## Troubleshooting

- **No data shown in uBO Scope popup:** Ensure the extension has permission to monitor network requests (`webRequest` API) and that your browser supports it.
- **Toolbar badge missing:** Confirm uBO Scope is enabled and running; restart your browser if necessary.
- **Conflicting extensions:** Some extensions might interfere; disable other network monitoring or similar extensions during testing.
