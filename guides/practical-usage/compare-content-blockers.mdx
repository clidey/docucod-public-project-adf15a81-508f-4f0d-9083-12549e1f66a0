# Comparing Content Blockers with uBO Scope

## Overview

This guide helps you objectively compare different content blockers using uBO Scope by focusing on the actual third-party connections observed rather than misleading block counts. You'll learn how to interpret network connection data from uBO Scope’s popup interface and toolbar badge, enabling you to make informed decisions about the effectiveness of blockers in reducing your exposure to remote servers.

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed on your preferred browser (Chromium-based, Firefox, or Safari).
- At least two content blockers installed and enabled for testing purposes.
- Basic familiarity with uBO Scope’s popup UI and badge counts. (Refer to [Monitoring Third-Party Connections Guide](../core-workflow/monitor-connections) and [Understanding Domain Categories in the Popup](../core-workflow/understanding-domain-categories) if needed.)

## Expected Outcome

- Clear comparison highlights of how different content blockers affect unique third-party remote server connections.
- Ability to judge blocker effectiveness based on network request outcomes rather than block counts alone.

## Time Estimate

- Approx. 15 to 30 minutes to test and compare results across different blockers.

## Difficulty Level

- Intermediate: requires understanding of network connections and usage of uBO Scope’s interface.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up uBO Scope and Your Content Blockers

- Confirm uBO Scope is installed and active by verifying the toolbar icon and badge count.
- Ensure multiple content blockers are installed and enabled one at a time to isolate their effects.

<Tip>
Testing content blockers one at a time avoids overlapping effects and gives you a clear picture of each blocker’s impact.
</Tip>

### 2. Start with Baseline Measurement (No Content Blocker)

- Disable all content blockers temporarily.
- Visit the website you want to analyze.
- Open uBO Scope’s popup by clicking its toolbar icon.
- Observe and record the number of distinct third-party domains listed under the **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** categories.
- Note the toolbar badge count that corresponds to distinct third-party remote servers connected.

### 3. Measure With First Content Blocker Enabled

- Enable Content Blocker A (e.g., uBlock Origin, AdGuard).
- Refresh or revisit the same website.
- Open uBO Scope popup and observe changes in the network request categories.
- Record the counts of distinct domains allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- Note the updated toolbar badge count.

<Tip>
The **not blocked** count shows the actual unique third-party servers your browser connected to despite the blocker.
</Tip>

### 4. Repeat for Other Content Blockers

- Disable Content Blocker A.
- Enable Content Blocker B.
- Repeat the measurement process.
- Continue for all blockers you wish to compare.

### 5. Analyze Results Objectively

- Focus on the number of **distinct third-party domains connected successfully** (the "not blocked" category).
- A **lower number here means better effectiveness** in reducing third-party exposure.
- Be cautious about higher block counts as these may indicate more complex or less effective blocking.

<Warning>
Do not rely on the total number of blocked requests or block counts alone to assess a blocker’s performance. High block counts can be misleading if more third parties are actually contacted.
</Warning>

### 6. Use uBO Scope to Identify Stealth Blocking

- Check the **stealth-blocked** category to see requests blocked discreetly by the content blocker.
- This indicates blocking that might not be obvious on the surface but reduces privacy risks.

<Tip>
Stealth blocking protects your privacy without triggering errors or webpage breakage, providing a smoother browsing experience.
</Tip>

### 7. Draw Conclusions

- Compare each blocker’s impact on reducing the number of connected third parties.
- Identify blockers that have the lowest distinct domain counts in the **not blocked** category.
- Consider blockers that maximize stealth blocking to minimize disturbances.

## Practical Example

Imagine you want to compare two blockers: "Ad Blocker X" and "Ad Blocker Y" on example.com.

| Blocker       | Toolbar Badge | Not Blocked Domains | Stealth Blocked Domains | Blocked Domains |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| No Blocker    | 15            | 15                  | 0                       | 0               |
| Ad Blocker X  | 5             | 5                   | 7                       | 3               |
| Ad Blocker Y  | 10            | 10                  | 2                       | 3               |

In this case, **Ad Blocker X** reduces the number of unique third-party connections more effectively and uses stealth blocking substantially for better privacy and user experience.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **uBO Scope shows no data or zero badge count:** Ensure uBO Scope has necessary permissions, and your browser supports the WebRequest API.
- **Popup appears blank after switching blockers:** Reload the page and wait a moment for uBO Scope to update session data.
- **Unexpectedly high counts:** Confirm you tested each content blocker in isolation and that browser caching is cleared.

### Best Practices

- Test on real-world, popular websites instead of synthetic "ad blocker test" pages.
- Perform multiple visits if necessary to capture all network connections.
- Use uBO Scope in combination with your blocker’s own logger for deeper insights if needed.

## Summary & Next Steps

- Use uBO Scope regularly to assess the real impact of content blockers beyond just block counts.
- Explore related guides:

  - [Understanding Domain Categories in the Popup](../core-workflow/understanding-domain-categories)
  - [Debunking Common Ad Block Tester Myths](./debunking-ad-tester-myths) 

- Consider filter list maintainer workflows to contribute to improving blocker community tools.

## Appendix: Understanding the Toolbar Badge and Popup UI

The toolbar badge number indicates the **count of unique third-party domains connected successfully** on the active tab. Lower is better.

The popup groups domains into three categories:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains from which resources were successfully loaded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were blocked quietly by the content blocker without triggering errors.
- **Blocked:** Domains whose connection attempts failed or were blocked visibly.

Interpreting these categories helps you understand the actual privacy exposure and the blocking style in use.

<Note>
These counts reflect unique domain counts, not the total number of requests. This avoids skew by repeated connections to the same domain.
</Note>
