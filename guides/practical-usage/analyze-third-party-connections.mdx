# Analyzing Third-Party Remote Connections with uBO Scope

uBO Scope is a powerful companion extension designed to give you clear visibility into all the remote servers a website connects to during your browsing session. This guide provides practical, step-by-step instructions to help you use uBO Scope’s features effectively to distinguish legitimate connections from unnecessary third-party requests, identify privacy risks, and spot unwanted trackers.

---

## 1. Understanding the Purpose and Value

Websites often connect to multiple remote servers—some essential, others questionable or tracking-related. uBO Scope lets you see each unique domain your browser contacts, categorize these connections by their outcome status, and thereby gain control and insight into your browsing privacy.

### What You Will Achieve

- Identify **all distinct remote servers** contacted by any open tab.
- Differentiate between connections that are **allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked**.
- Spot potentially **privacy-invasive or unnecessary third-party requests**.
- Take actionable steps informed by this visibility to improve your online privacy.

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed in a supported browser (Chromium, Firefox, or Safari).
- The extension correctly granted permissions (activeTab, storage, webRequest).
- You are browsing with content blocking enabled or disabled; uBO Scope works independently.

## 2. Quick Start: Accessing Connection Data

1. **Open the website/tab you want to analyze.**
2. **Click the uBO Scope extension icon on your browser toolbar.**
3. **Examine the popup UI that opens, listing remote domains categorized under:**
   - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Successful connections not prevented by any blocker.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections silently intercepted or redirected by content blockers.
   - **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked by content blocking.
4. **Observe the count at the top indicating the number of distinct third-party domains connected.**

<Tip>
A lower number in the badge count is generally better, indicating fewer third-party servers contacted.
</Tip>

## 3. Step-by-Step Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope Popup for the Active Tab

- Ensure you have the tab focused and active in your browser.
- Click on the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
- The heading displays the hostname and domain of the active tab, giving you context.

### Step 2: Review the Summary Section

- The "domains connected" count shows you how many unique remote domains your tab contacted.
- Use this number to gauge overall third-party interaction density.

### Step 3: Inspect Each Outcome Section

- **Not Blocked:** These domains represent servers your browser successfully connected to and fetched resources from. These are typically necessary servers or CDNs.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** These domains reflect connections that were silently redirected or intercepted by blocker mechanisms, giving insight into non-obvious privacy protection.
- **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked connections indicate requests prevented from reaching those third-party domains.

### Step 4: Examine Domain Details

- Each domain listing shows the domain name and a count of how many requests were made to it.
- Domains with high counts signify frequent or multiple resource requests.
- Use domain knowledge or quick web searches to determine if these domains are trusted (e.g., CDN providers vs. known tracking domains).

### Step 5: Make Privacy or Filtering Decisions

- If you find unexpected third-party connections, consider tightening your filters or reviewing your content blocker’s settings.
- Use the blocked and stealth categories as reference points for your current content blocker’s effectiveness.
- Recognize legitimate third parties (e.g., Google Hosted Libraries, CDNs) versus intrusive advertisers or trackers.

## 4. Practical Tips for Effective Analysis

- **Reload the page after installing uBO Scope** to capture fresh connection data.
- **Compare connection lists between browsers or profiles** to validate your content blocker’s performance.
- **Pay special attention to stealth-blocked domains** as these reveal connections your blocker prevents quietly.
- **Use domain lookup tools** to get background on unfamiliar domains.
- Remember: **The count represents distinct domains, not total requests**; multiple requests to the same domain count once.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **No data shown in popup:**
  - Make sure permissions are granted.
  - Visit a website with substantial resources; simple or internal-only pages may report no connections.
  - Reload the tab and popup.
- **Badge count not updating:**
  - Check if the extension is enabled and active in your browser.
  - Open and close the popup to refresh.
- **Confusing domain names:**
  - Use the Public Suffix List integrated in uBO Scope that smartly detects base domains.
  - Beware of domains that might mask trackers using legitimate-sounding names.

## 6. Understanding Outcomes in Context

| Connection Outcome  | Meaning                                          | User Insight                         |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Allowed             | Connection succeeded without intervention        | Legitimate or allowed third-party   |
| Stealth-Blocked     | Connection redirected or silently handled       | Indicates blocker stealth protection|
| Blocked             | Request explicitly blocked                        | Known unwanted or filtered request |

Use this to assess not just how many requests are blocked, but how many distinct third-party servers a site relies on.

## 7. Advanced Analysis Scenarios

- **Identifying excessive third-party trackers:**
  - Compare domains in the 'allowed' section with known tracking domains.
  - Filter or block unwanted trackers based on findings.
- **Evaluating content blocker performance:**
  - Compare the 'blocked' and 'stealth-blocked' sections under different content blocking settings.
- **Filter list maintenance:**
  - Use reported data to refine your blocklists or rules by spotting domains that should or should not be blocked.
