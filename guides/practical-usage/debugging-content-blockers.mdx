# Troubleshooting Content Blockers with uBO Scope

A practical guide for using uBO Scope to verify if content blockers are effectively limiting third-party connections. This guide includes step-by-step techniques for filter list maintainers and users to test the real-world impact of different blocking configurations.

---

## 1. Understanding uBO Scope's Role in Troubleshooting

uBO Scope provides an accurate window into the network requests made by web pages, categorizing connections as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked regardless of which content blockers are active in your browser. This makes it an indispensable tool for verifying if content blockers truly prevent unwanted third-party connections.

When troubleshooting content blockers, uBO Scope helps you answer questions like:
- Are my blocking rules properly preventing connections to known tracking or advertising domains?
- Is stealth blocking hiding some blocked requests from normal detection?
- Are certain connections unexpectedly allowed despite active filters?

By focusing on **distinct third-party remote servers actually contacted or blocked**, you gain comprehensive insight beyond superficial block counts or unreliable "ad blocker test" webpages.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before diving into troubleshooting using uBO Scope, ensure the following:

- **uBO Scope is installed and enabled** in your supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- You understand what the badge count and popup panel represent ([see interpreting badge counts and popup UI](../interpreting-results/badge-and-popup-guide)).
- Your content blocker (such as uBlock Origin) or custom filter lists are configured and active.
- You have a target website or test page where you want to verify content blocking behavior.

## 3. Workflow: Verifying Content Blocking Using uBO Scope

Follow this practical workflow to verify content blocking effectiveness with uBO Scope.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the target webpage">
Navigate to the website you wish to test for content blocking.

**Expected Result:** The page loads normally (or in your expected state with content blocked).
</Step>

<Step title="Open uBO Scope popup panel">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel which lists remote server connections.

**Expected Result:** The popup displays the current tab's hostname and the count of distinct third-party domains under Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth-Blocked sections.
</Step>

<Step title="Analyze the Allowed domains">
Review the "not blocked" section for third-party domains that were contacted successfully.

- Look for unexpected or suspicious domains that you wanted to block.
- Confirm that legitimate CDN domains or first-party hosts show as expected.

**Decision:** If unexpected allow-listed third parties appear, investigate your filter rules or exceptions.
</Step>

<Step title="Analyze the Blocked and Stealth-Blocked domains">
Inspect the "blocked" and "stealth-blocked" domains sections:

- **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed clearly due to blocking.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where blocking was silently performed to avoid detection.

**Check:** These lists should include known advertising or tracking domains targeted by your content filters.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate additional network activity">
To ensure comprehensive testing, trigger additional interactions on the page such as:

- Reload the page.
- Navigate to different internal pages.
- Trigger dynamic content loading or widgets.

**Expected Result:** Network requests refresh and popup data updates accordingly.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm badge count reflects distinct third-party connections">
Look at the extension's badge count on the toolbar.

- This number reflects the count of unique third-party remote servers contacted.
- A lower count indicates tighter blocking or less third-party exposure.

**Tip:** Badge count should correlate logically with the popup's allowed domain list.
</Step>

<Step title="Test modifications to filter lists or settings">
To verify the impact of different blocking rules:

- Temporarily disable or enable specific filter lists.
- Add custom blocking rules.
- Reload the target webpage and observe changes in uBO Scope’s popup data.

**Expected Result:** Changes reflect immediately and accurately in allowed/blocked domain lists and badge count.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Practical Tips for Effective Troubleshooting

- **Use real-world browsing sessions:** Avoid relying on artificial test pages that do not mimic authentic web behaviors.
- **Focus on domains, not just URLs:** uBO Scope aggregates data by domain, letting you quickly identify problematic third parties.
- **Pay attention to stealth-blocked domains:** Sometimes blockers hide their activity, making apparent successful connections misleading.
- **Reload pages after changes:** Filters and settings changes only take effect after a new page load.
- **Compare before/after scenarios:** Toggling particular filters helps isolate which rules impact blocking results.

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting Advice

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues When Testing Content Blockers">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or Stuck Loading">
- Confirm uBO Scope is installed and enabled with required permissions.
- Reload the page or browser.
- Check the extension’s console logs for errors.
- Verify that webRequest API access is available in your browser version.
- See [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../../getting-started/initial-usage-validation/common-setup-issues) for detailed help.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Doesn't Change Despite Page Loads">
- Ensure the tab is active and uBO Scope is monitoring it.
- Reload the page to refresh the session data.
- Some connections might happen outside of webRequest API scope (e.g., DNS blocking) and may not report correctly.
- Confirm no conflicting privacy extensions override or block uBO Scope’s tracking.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Allowed Domains Appear">
- Double-check custom filters or whitelists.
- Look for redirects that happen via stealth blocking.
- Review active filter list versions and update if outdated.
- Manually add blocking rules targeting suspicious domains and test again.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth-Blocked Domains Are Empty or Unexpectedly Populated">
- Stealth-block detection depends on subtle network outcomes.
- Some blockers may choose not to use stealth blocking.
- Differences in browsers or uBO versions can affect stealth block reporting.
</Accordion>

## 6. Example Test Scenario

Imagine you want to verify that requests to `trackers-ad.example.com` are being blocked.

1. Navigate to a page known to load resources from this tracker.
2. Open uBO Scope popup and look for `trackers-ad.example.com` in the **Blocked** or **Stealth-Blocked** sections.
3. If it appears under **Allowed**, check your content blocker’s filter list to ensure a blocking rule exists.
4. Add or enable a blocking rule like:

```plaintext
||trackers-ad.example.com^
```

5. Reload the page and verify that `trackers-ad.example.com` now appears under **Blocked** or **Stealth-Blocked**.
6. Confirm the badge count reflects fewer allowed third-party connections.

This workflow confirms the real-time effectiveness of your blocker configuration.

<Tip>
Always validate content blocker effectiveness with real browsing scenarios rather than synthetic test pages, as uBO Scope reports authentic network results directly from the browser’s webRequest API.
</Tip>

<Note>
Stealth blocking enables some content blockers to silently block requests without causing web page errors or detectable failures. uBO Scope uniquely reports these stealth-blocked domains, giving you a complete picture of blocking activity.
