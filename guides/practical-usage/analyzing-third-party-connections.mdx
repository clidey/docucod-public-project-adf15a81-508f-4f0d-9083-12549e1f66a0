# Analyzing Third-Party Connections with uBO Scope

## Overview

This guide empowers you to use uBO Scope to identify and understand all third-party network connections a website attempts or establishes. It walks you through interpreting connection outcomes shown in the extension's popup panel—categorized as **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**—to gain clear insight into your privacy exposure per site.

Whether you are a privacy-conscious user, a web professional, or simply curious about what happens behind the scenes on the websites you visit, this hands-on guide helps you navigate uBO Scope efficiently to achieve transparency over third-party connections.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following before starting:

- uBO Scope is installed and active in your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- You have the extension’s toolbar icon visible.
- You are browsing a webpage where you want to analyze third-party connections.
- Basic understanding of domain names and how third-party connections can affect privacy is helpful.


## What You Will Achieve

- View a categorized and counted list of third-party domains contacted by the active webpage.
- Understand the difference between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.
- Assess your privacy exposure on a per-site basis.
- Make informed decisions about content blockers and privacy settings.

## Time Estimate

About 5–10 minutes for a typical site analysis.

## Difficulty Level

Beginner to intermediate.

# Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar while on the webpage you want to analyze.
- The popup will open showing the hostname of the active tab and a summary of connected domains.

_Expected Result_: You see a header with the current tab’s hostname, a summary count of connected domains, and three distinct sections labeled **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

---

### 2. Understand Connection Outcome Categories

- **Not Blocked**: Domains in this section represent third-party servers the website contacted successfully without interference.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections attempted but prevented silently by content blockers or stealth techniques, invisible to the network.
- **Blocked**: Connections actively blocked with explicit errors.

_Tip_: A lower number of allowed domains typically indicates less exposure to third-party tracking.

---

### 3. Review the Domain Listings

- Each domain entry is followed by a count badge indicating how many connection attempts were made to that domain.
- Domains are shown in their Unicode form (IDNs are translated for readability).
- The count helps you understand which third-party domains are contacted most frequently.

_Expected Result_: You identify specific third-party domains potentially involved in tracking or content delivery.

---

### 4. Interpret the Summary Count

- The summary at the top shows the total number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- This count reflects the extent of third-party involvement for the current tab.

---

### 5. Make Privacy Assessments Based on Data

- A high count under **Not Blocked** means many third parties might be receiving user data.
- If third-party domains appear mainly in **Stealth-Blocked** or **Blocked**, your content blockers are active and preventing some connections.

_Best Practice_: Use this data to spot unexpected or suspicious third parties and adjust your blocking or browsing behavior accordingly.

# Real-World Example

Imagine visiting `example.com`. After clicking the uBO Scope icon:

- The header shows `example.com` with a summary: `domains connected: 12`.
- The **not blocked** section lists domains like `cdn.examplecdn.com` (count: 10), `analytics.tracker.com` (count: 3).
- The **stealth-blocked** section includes `ads.adnetwork.com` (count: 5).
- The **blocked** section shows `malicious.tracker.com` (count: 2).

This clearly shows which third-party providers are active and which are blocked or stealthily blocked.

---

# Tips & Best Practices

- **Regularly inspect the popup** for sites you frequent to monitor changes in third-party activity.
- **Use the domain counts** to focus on high-frequency third parties that may impact your privacy most.
- **Remember the badge count** on the toolbar icon shows the number of allowed third-party domains; a lower badge number usually means better privacy.
- **Combine insights** from uBO Scope with your content blocker settings to fine-tune your protection.

---

# Troubleshooting

**Problem: No Data shown in popup or it displays "NO DATA"**

- Refresh the webpage and try reopening the popup.
- Confirm the extension has proper permissions and is enabled.
- Verify you are on a valid webpage with network activity (not a blank or new tab).
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../getting-started/usage-validation/troubleshooting-installation) guide if problems persist.

**Problem: Unexpected domains appearing as allowed**

- Keep in mind some third-party domains are legitimate CDN or service providers essential for site operation.
- Cross-reference domains with reputable lists or search online to understand their role.
