# Real-World Use Cases: Audit, Compare, Report

Discover how privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers leverage uBO Scope to gain practical insights into browser network activities. This guide walks you through essential workflows to audit websites for third-party connections, compare content blocker effectiveness across configurations, and generate reliable reports—even in restrictive or limited-access environments.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you use uBO Scope in real-world scenarios to:
- Audit the network connections made by websites you visit
- Compare different content blockers or filter list setups by analyzing actual third-party requests
- Generate accurate, data-driven reports for assessing blocking effectiveness

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed on your browser (Chromium, Firefox, or Safari)
- Basic familiarity with the uBO Scope popup interface and domain status categories (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked)
- Access to multiple content blocker configurations or filter lists to test (optional for comparison)

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to perform practical audits of websites, validate the behavior of content blockers through direct connection data, and create trustworthy reports useful for filter list maintenance or privacy auditing.

### Time Estimate
15-30 minutes per audit or comparison session, depending on complexity and goals.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate—requires some knowledge of browser extensions, filter lists, and privacy concepts.

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Audit a Website’s Network Connections

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Target Website and uBO Scope Popup">
Navigate to the website you want to audit. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup interface.

- Expected Result: The popup displays the number of distinct domains connected to by this tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domain Categorization">
Examine the three sections: **Not Blocked**, **Stealth Blocked**, and **Blocked**.

- Action: Identify which third-party domains are allowed, covertly redirected (stealth), or explicitly blocked.

- Expected Result: Domain counts and names provide insight into network connections for this tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze and Interpret Badge Count">
Check the toolbar icon badge count on the uBO Scope extension. This shows the number of distinct third-party domains allowed.

- Decision Point: A lower count typically indicates fewer third-party connections.

- Expected Result: The badge count aligns with the **Not Blocked** domains shown in the popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Capture and Document Findings">
Record the domain lists or take screenshots of the popup for documentation purposes.

- Tip: Use this data to evaluate website privacy or to compare with expectations.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Compare Content Blockers or Filter Lists

<Steps>
<Step title="Set Up Configuration A">
Activate your first content blocker or filter list configuration.

- Expected Result: uBO Scope tracks network requests under this setup.
</Step>
<Step title="Perform Website Audit (as above) for Configuration A">
Follow the audit workflow to capture network connection data.

- Expected Result: Save or note the domain counts and lists.
</Step>
<Step title="Switch to Configuration B">
Disable the first content blocker and activate your alternative configuration.

- Important: Ensure a fresh session or reload the website tab to collect accurate data.
</Step>
<Step title="Perform Website Audit for Configuration B">
Repeat the audit workflow.

- Expected Result: Collect comparable data under the new configuration.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare Results">
Analyze differences in the allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domain sets between configurations.

- Decision Point: Determine which blocker reduces third-party connections more effectively by comparing the badge count and detailed domain lists.
</Step>
<Step title="Draw Conclusions and Report">
Use the real connection data to assess blocker performance objectively.

- Tip: Avoid relying solely on block counts reported by blockers themselves; uBO Scope captures actual network connection outcomes independent of blocker UI metrics.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Generate Reports for Block Effectiveness

<Steps>
<Step title="Collect Data Over Time or Multiple Sessions">
Repeat audits across different browsing sessions or multiple websites.

- Expected Result: A dataset of connection outcomes aggregated over realistic usage.
</Step>
<Step title="Export or Record Data">
Although uBO Scope does not provide native export, you can manually record popup data or use browser developer tools to log network activity aligned with uBO Scope insights.

- Tip: Consider automation or scripting external to uBO Scope for scalable reporting.
</Step>
<Step title="Summarize Allowed and Blocked Domains">
Organize data by domain counts and frequency for allowed, stealth, and blocked categories.

- Expected Result: A clear picture of which domains are consistently allowed or blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Share With Filter List Maintainers or Teams">
Provide your findings to filter list maintainers or team members responsible for content blocking strategy.

- Value: This real-world data ensures block lists target active domains effectively and support improved privacy.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Use Focused Audits:** Start with high-traffic websites to maximize benefit from connection transparency.
- **Clear Cache Between Tests:** Browsers may cache resources, so reload pages or open new tabs to get accurate connection data per test.
- **Beware of Stealth Blocking:** Domains listed under stealth-blocked are indirectly blocked or redirected; this affects interpretation.
- **Interpret Badge Counts Carefully:** The badge reflects unique allowed third-party domains, not total network requests.
- **Combine With Other Tools:** For comprehensive auditing, use browser developer tools, traffic analyzers, and filter list diagnostics alongside uBO Scope.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Challenges in Real-World Use">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists">
- Verify the active tab has fully loaded network requests.
- Confirm uBO Scope permissions are granted properly.
- Reload the tab and open the popup again.
- Check for other extensions that might interfere.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
- Ensure network activity is occurring in the active tab.
- Try toggling uBO Scope on/off or reloading extension.
- Confirm browser version supports required APIs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Discrepancies Between Content Blocker UI and uBO Scope">
- Understand uBO Scope tracks network requests at the browser API level independently.
- Block counts in content blocker UIs may use heuristics or counters unrelated to actual connections.
- Refer to the guide 'Debunking Blocker Myths & Interpreting Counts' for clarity.
