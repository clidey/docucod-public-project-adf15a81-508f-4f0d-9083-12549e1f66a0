## 3. Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Browser Extension Store

- **Chromium Browsers:**
  - Open Chrome Web Store.
  - Search for "uBO Scope" or directly visit [uBO Scope on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).

- **Mozilla Firefox:**
  - Open Mozilla Add-ons store.
  - Search for "uBO Scope" or directly visit [uBO Scope on Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).

- **Safari:**
  - Visit the Mac App Store.
  - Search for "uBO Scope" supporting macOS 18.5+

### Step 2: Install the Extension

- Click on the **Install** or **Add to Browser** button.
- Confirm any prompts your browser displays.

### Step 3: Verify Installation

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
  - The icon features the uBO Scope logo.
  - If not visible immediately, check the extensions menu or customize toolbar settings.

### Step 4: Grant Necessary Permissions

- The first time uBO Scope runs, it will request these permissions:
  - Access to active tabs (to monitor network connections per tab)
  - Storage access (to save session data and user settings)
  - WebRequest API (to capture network requests)

- Approve these permissions to enable full extension functionality.

> Permissions are essential for uBO Scope to accurately report all third-party connections regardless of your content blocking setup.

### Step 5: Understanding the Toolbar Badge

- Once installed and active, the toolbar icon displays a **badge count**.
- This count represents **the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser has connected to on the current tab**.

> A lower count typically means fewer third-party connections, reflecting a potentially higher privacy level for that webpage.

## 4. Using the Extension Immediately

### Viewing Connection Summaries

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- You will see:
  - The number of distinct connected domains labeled as **domains connected**.
  - Sections showing domains under three categories:
    - **Not Blocked:** Successful connections
    - **Stealth-Blocked:** Redirected stealth block connections
    - **Blocked:** Connections that failed or were blocked

- The popup provides detailed counts and domain names for each category, giving you clear insight into network activity.

> This real-time feedback helps you assess the extent of third-party connections on the sites you visit.

---

## 5. Tips and Best Practices

- **Regularly monitor** the badge count while browsing to quickly spot unusual or high third-party activity.
- Use uBO Scope **alongside your preferred content blocker**; uBO Scope does not block but transparently reports connections.
- For privacy audits, check the **popup summary** to identify domains and validate your blocker’s effectiveness.
- If you use privacy-focused DNS or VPN services, uBO Scope still reports all connections the browser processes via WebRequest API.
