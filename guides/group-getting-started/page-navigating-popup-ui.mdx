- At least one active browser tab with web activity recorded by uBO Scope.
- Familiarity with the concept of third-party connections (recommended but not required).

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will confidently navigate the popup, decipher connection data per tab, and draw actionable conclusions about allowed and blocked remote server connections.

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup
1. Locate the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser (usually near the address bar).
2. Click the icon to open the popup interface.

   <Check>
   Ensure you see the popup titled with the active tab’s hostname. If you see 'NO DATA', wait a moment while the extension gathers data or refresh the page.
   </Check>

### Step 2: Locate the Tab Hostname Section
- The top header displays the current tab’s hostname split into two parts:
  - **Subdomain portion:** Appears on the left in the header (if any).
  - **Main domain portion:** Appears on the right.

This dual-display clarifies how uBO Scope parses the domain structure.

### Step 3: Understand the Connections Summary
- Below the header, find the **domains connected** summary.
- This number shows the count of distinct remote domains connected by the current tab.

### Step 4: Explore the Three Domain Outcome Sections
The popup organizes connected domains into three clear categories:

#### 4.1 Not Blocked (Allowed)
- Displays domains with connections that were permitted by your content blocker or network.
- Shows a list of domain names alongside the number of connection attempts.

#### 4.2 Stealth-Blocked (Stealth)
- Shows domains where connections were stealthily blocked, typically through redirection or other subtle blocking techniques.
- These domains attempted connections but were not outright blocked by the content blocker UI.

#### 4.3 Blocked
- Lists domains whose connection attempts were actively blocked.
- These connections failed to complete due to filtering rules.

### Step 5: Reading Domain Entries
Each domain entry shows:
- **Domain Name:** Rendered in Unicode for better readability, including international domain names.
- **Count Badge:** Number indicating how many connection attempts were recorded for that domain.

Tip: Domains are sorted alphabetically within each section to help you spot known or suspicious domains quickly.

### Step 6: Interpreting the Data
- Higher counts suggest repeated connections or multiple resources fetched from that domain.
- The presence of domains in the **Allowed** section means your browser successfully connected.
- Domains listed under **Blocked** indicate your content blocker prevented those connections.
- Entries in **Stealth** reflect connections blocked without explicit user-block notifications — useful for detecting covert tracking attempts.

### Step 7: Close the Popup
- Click outside the popup area or press the Escape key to close the interface.

## 3. Practical Examples & User Scenarios

### Example: Checking Network Connections on a News Website
1. Open a news website in an active tab.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
3. Observe the **domains connected** count — a well-maintained site might show a few domains (own domain, CDN, analytics).
4. Review the **Allowed** section for known third-party services.
5. Look for unexpected domains in the **Blocked** or **Stealth** sections indicating trackers or unwanted connections.

### Example: Debugging Why a Domain Is Not Blocked
- If a suspicious domain appears in the Allowed section, consider investigating your filter list or adjusting your content blocker.
- Use the count badge to understand connection volume and prioritize action.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Popup shows NO DATA:**
  - Wait a few seconds for data collection.
  - Make sure your browser tab has active network activity.
  - Refresh the tab if necessary.

- **Counts seem unexpectedly low or high:**
  - Remember uBO Scope counts distinct domains, not all requests.
  - Some legitimate third-party services (e.g., CDNs) can inflate counts.

- **Domain names appear confusing or punycode encoded:**
  - The popup decodes punycode to Unicode for better readability.
  - If undecoded domains persist, try refreshing the popup.

### Best Practices
- Use the popup regularly to monitor live connection patterns.
- Compare Allowed, Stealth, and Blocked sections to identify stealthy tracking attempts.
- Combine insights from the popup with your content blocker's settings for fine-tuning.

### Performance Considerations
- The popup is lightweight; performance impact during use is minimal.
- Data updates are asynchronous and efficient, ensuring real-time accuracy without UI freezing.
