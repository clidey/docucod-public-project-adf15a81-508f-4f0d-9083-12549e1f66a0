## 2. Step-by-Step Installation and Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose Your Browser and Access the Extension Store">
Open your browser's official extension/add-ons store:
- Chrome: [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- Firefox: [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- Safari: Use the Safari Extensions menu on macOS 13.1 or later (via App Store)

Access the store to find uBO Scope by searching for 'uBO Scope' or 'uBlock Origin Scope'.

Expected result: uBO Scope extension page is displayed.
</Step>

<Step title="Install uBO Scope">
Click the install or add button on the extension page.

Depending on your browser, you may need to confirm permissions requested (see permission details below).

Expected result: uBO Scope is installed and its icon appears in your browser toolbar.

<Tip>
uBO Scope requires permissions to access network requests (`webRequest`) and storage for its functionality. These are essential and cannot be skipped.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Pin the uBO Scope Icon to Toolbar (Recommended)">
After installation, pin the uBO Scope icon to your browser's toolbar for quick access:
- In Chrome and Firefox: Click the extensions puzzle icon near the address bar and pin uBO Scope.
- In Safari: It appears automatically or can be added via the Extensions menu.

Expected result: The uBO Scope icon is visible on your toolbar.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Permissions and Settings">
Make sure uBO Scope has all required permissions enabled:
- Access to page tabs (`activeTab`)
- Access to network requests (`webRequest`)
- Storage permissions

To verify:
- Go to your browser's extensions page (e.g., chrome://extensions, about:addons).
- Find uBO Scope and check its allowed permissions.

Expected result: All required permissions are granted.

<Warning>
Missing `webRequest` permission means uBO Scope cannot monitor network connections.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Test uBO Scope is Monitoring">
Visit any website that loads external content (e.g., news site, social media, or content-rich site).

Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.

You should see:
- The hostname of the visited tab.
- A summary count of connected distinct third-party domains.
- Lists of domains under the headers: 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'.

Expected result: Data shows the active network connections happening on the page.

<Check>
If no data appears or count stays empty:
- Try refreshing the tab.
- Confirm network activity is generated.
- Check permissions again.
</Check>
</Step>

</Steps>

## 3. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The uBO Scope icon displays a numeric badge representing the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** your browser connected to on the current tab.

- **Lower numbers indicate fewer third-party connections, which generally implies better privacy and less tracking.**
- Third-party domains include CDNs, ad servers, analytics providers, and other external resources.

### Important Notes:
- The badge count **does not represent blocked requests**; it counts allowed distinct connections.
- It updates dynamically as the page loads more resources.

<Tip>
Use the badge as a quick privacy indicator for each site you visit.
</Tip>
