# Understanding the Popup: Reading Domain Data

Discover how to effectively use the uBO Scope extension's popup interface to interpret the domain data it presents. This guide walks you through the different domain lists — allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked — and helps you understand what domain counts, groupings, and statuses mean for your online privacy.

---

## 1. Overview of the Popup Interface

The popup is your window into the network interactions of the current browser tab, revealing what domains your browser communicates with and how those connections are handled. It summarizes network exposure by categorizing domains based on their connection status.

### What the Popup Shows:

- **Tab Hostname Display:** The top shows the hostname of the current tab broken into parts to display the full hostname and its registered domain.
- **Domain Count Summary:** The number of distinct domains your browser connected to while loading the page.
- **Domain Lists Sectioned by Status:**
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains that the browser has successfully connected to.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were redirected or filtered silently without user-visible blocking.
  - **Blocked:** Domains for which a network request was blocked or failed.

---

## 2. Preparing to Use the Popup

### Prerequisites

- You must have uBO Scope installed and enabled in your browser.
- Navigate to a live webpage with active network requests.
- Open the uBO Scope popup by clicking its toolbar icon.

### What You'll Achieve

By the end of this guide, you'll confidently interpret the domain categories shown in the popup and understand what these mean in terms of your browsing privacy and exposure.

## 3. Step-by-Step: Exploring and Interpreting the Popup

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup for the Current Tab">
Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar. The popup will load and display data related to the active browser tab.

**Expected Result:** You see the hostname at the top and a summary count of connected domains.
</Step>

<Step title="Read the Hostname and Domain Header">
At the top, the hostname is split into two parts:

- The first part displays any subdomain prefix (if different from the registered domain).
- The second part shows the registered domain (e.g., example.com).

**What This Means:** Understanding this helps you grasp whether connections are happening to the primary site or third-party domains.
</Step>

<Step title="Check the Total Domains Connected">
Below the hostname, look for the "domains connected" count.

**This number represents:**
- The total distinct domains your browser connected to while loading this page.
- Domains include both first-party and third-party servers.

**Tip:** A lower number here correlates with a smaller network footprint and better privacy.
</Step>

<Step title="Explore the Not Blocked Section">
This section lists all domains your browser connected to successfully.

- Each domain is shown with the count of requests made to it.
- Domains here represent the network resources the page managed to load.

**Privacy Note:** While some connections are necessary, excessive third-party domains may indicate trackers or advertising servers.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Domains listed here were prevented from completing load through stealth blocking:

- These connections might have been redirected or filtered quietly.
- They do not generate visible blocking notifications but are counted separately.

**Significance:** Stealth blocking provides privacy protection without breaking page functionality.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Blocked Domains Section">
This section shows domains where network requests failed or were explicitly blocked.

- Each domain includes the number of blocked requests.
- These are actively prevented connections, which help reduce exposure.

**Insight:** A significant number here means the blocker is actively working to stop undesired connections.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Domain Counts and Groupings">
Within each section, domains are sorted and grouped to show the number of occurrences.

- High counts highlight domains with many requests.
- Groupings help identify dominant servers contacted by the webpage.

**Use Case:** Identifying which domains are most active aids in understanding potential tracking or CDN usage.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Practical Examples

Imagine visiting a news website with multiple embedded ads, content delivery networks (CDNs), and analytics services:

| Section           | Domains Example                    | Interpretation                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked       | example.com, cdn.example.net      | Main site and content served from legit servers.
| Stealth-Blocked   | tracking.example.org              | A tracker redirected or silently filtered.
| Blocked           | ads.example-adnetwork.com         | An ad server's requests were actively blocked.

This snapshot shows your browser successfully retrieved main content, some trackers were stealth-blocked, and ads were blocked outright — a positive privacy posture.

## 5. Tips & Best Practices

- **Refresh the page** while keeping the popup open to see updated domain data after navigation.
- Use the popup to monitor differences before and after enabling or changing content blocking settings.
- Pay special attention to stealth-blocked domains, as these reveal invisible filtering that is often missed by websites.
- Remember, the count reflects distinct domains, not total requests, focusing on server exposure rather than raw traffic volume.
- If the domain list shows 'NO DATA', wait a moment or refresh the page, as network events might still be processing.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Data">
<Accordion title="Popup shows NO DATA or is empty">
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and the toolbar icon is visible.
- Reload the current webpage to generate network activity.
- Confirm the page has active network requests (some pages may have minimal connections).
- Check that the browser version meets system requirements.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Domain counts seem lower than expected">
- Some connections may be filtered at the network or DNS level outside the browser.
- Stealth-blocked domains may reduce the visible allowed list.
- Make sure other content blockers or privacy extensions are not interfering.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Counts or sections do not update on navigation">
- Close and re-open the popup after changing pages.
- Verify the extension has permission to read active tab data.
- Restart the browser if issues persist.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Appendix: Popup Layout Structure

The popup interface categorizes domain lists under clear headings:

```html
<section id="summary">
  domains connected: <span>?</span>
</section>
<section class="outcome allowed">
  <h3>not blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
<section class="outcome stealth">
  <h3>stealth-blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
<section class="outcome blocked">
  <h3>blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
```

Each domain is listed with a badge showing the count of requests, helping quickly scan and assess the browser's network activities.

#### Summary
This guide arms you with practical knowledge and actionable steps to unlock the full value of the uBO Scope popup, understanding how your browser interacts with domains and how the extension displays this data for maximum transparency.

<Tip>
Always remember that a lower count of distinct external domains generally indicates better network privacy and less exposure. Use uBO Scope's popup as your trusted privacy compass.
