# Real-World Use Cases: Mythbusting and Everyday Applications

## Overview
This guide demonstrates how to effectively use uBO Scope during your everyday browsing to achieve genuine transparency about third-party network connections. It breaks down common misconceptions — such as equating a higher block count with better privacy protection or trusting conventional 'ad blocker test' websites — and shows how uBO Scope empowers you to make informed privacy decisions based on domain-level insights.

By following the walkthroughs and practical examples here, you will develop a clear understanding of what uBO Scope reveals about web tracking, third-party interactions, and content blocker effectiveness.

---

## What You Will Accomplish

- Debunk myths about block counts and ad blocker tests.
- Understand how to interpret distinct third-party domain connections.
- Use uBO Scope's popup data to evaluate the real-world privacy impact of browsing.
- Gain confidence in assessing website safety beyond conventional blockers.

---

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser.
- Basic familiarity with the uBO Scope popup interface.
- An active browsing session where network activity is generated.

If you need help installing or setting up uBO Scope, refer to the [Install and Set Up uBO Scope](./installation-setup) guide.

## Time Commitment

Expect to spend about 15-30 minutes initially experimenting with real websites and popup inspection to fully grasp these use cases.

## Step-by-Step Use Cases

### 1. Myth: 'A Higher Block Count Means More Protection'

#### Why This Myth Is False
The block count reported by other content blockers can be misleading. A high block count doesn't necessarily mean the blocker prevents more third-party connections. Sometimes, a high block count corresponds to more third-party domains being contacted because unblocked requests are still fetching resources.

#### How uBO Scope Helps
uBO Scope counts **distinct third-party remote servers your browser actually connects to**.

##### Action Steps
1. Open uBO Scope popup while browsing a website.
2. Observe the badge number and the domains listed under "not blocked".
3. Compare your observations with the block counts from your content blocker.

##### Outcome
You see the **real privacy impact** rather than misleading block numbers. A **lower distinct third-party count** indicates better privacy.

##### Practical Tip
Focus on reducing the number of distinct third-party connections instead of just relying on block counts.

---

### 2. Myth: 'Ad Blocker Test Pages Provide Reliable Results'

#### Why Ad Blocker Tests Are Flawed
- They use fabricated scenarios not seen in real-world browsing.
- Many content blockers perform stealth blocking to avoid detection and do not reveal themselves to test pages.

#### How to Use uBO Scope Instead
Use uBO Scope **to verify the number and identity of distinct third-party connections when browsing normal, reputable websites** rather than relying on synthetic tests.

##### Action Steps
1. Visit common websites you trust or visit frequently.
2. Open the uBO Scope popup and review:
   - Allowed (not blocked) domains
   - Stealth-blocked domains
   - Blocked domains
3. Evaluate the third-party domains in the "not blocked" section to determine actual exposure.

##### Outcome
You gain real insight into your network privacy rather than artificial test results.

##### Best Practice
Dismiss claims of ad blocker superiority based solely on test page results; trust real domain-level data.

### 3. Everyday Usage: Assessing Website Safety via Third-Party Domains

#### Why This Matters
Modern websites often load resources from many third parties, some of which may track you or degrade privacy.

#### How to Use uBO Scope
uBO Scope allows you to see all third-party domains your browser contacts on any page.

##### Workflow
<Steps>
  <Step title='Open the Website'>
    Navigate to a website you want to assess.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Open uBO Scope Popup'>
    Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar to open the popup interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Review Domain Counts and Groupings'>
    Look at the total number of connected domains prominently displayed.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Inspect the "Not Blocked" Domains'>
    Review the actual third-party domains that are allowed by your blocker or settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Check Blocked and Stealth-blocked Domains'>
    See what your filters or browser have blocked explicitly or stealthily.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Make an Informed Decision'>
    If you see many unknown or tracking-related domains in "not blocked," consider adjusting your content blocker or browsing habits.
  </Step>
</Steps>

##### Expected Result
You will have a transparent report of a site's third-party network exposure in real-time.

### 4. Practical Scenario: Using uBO Scope with Popular Websites

Consider browsing sites such as news portals, social media, or e-commerce. uBO Scope popup shows:

- CDN providers used legitimately (e.g., cloudfront.net, akamai.net) usually in "not blocked".
- Tracking or advertising domains appearing in "not blocked" or "stealth-blocked".
- Resources blocked completely appearing in the "blocked" section.

This insight helps evaluate which domains are needed for site functionality and which may intrude on privacy.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Regularly check the uBO Scope popup** during browsing to stay informed about network connections.
- Distinguish between legitimate third parties (CDNs, payment gateways) and tracking/advertising domains.
- Use this knowledge to fine-tune your content blocker or make privacy-conscious browsing choices.
- Remember the badge count signals distinct third-party domains connected; aim to keep this number low.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- If you see unexpectedly high domain counts, reload the page to verify consistency.
- If no data appears in the popup, ensure that uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled.
- Use [Troubleshooting Your Setup](./troubleshooting-setup) if you encounter setup issues.

---

## Summary
uBO Scope is a powerful privacy audit tool that goes beyond superficial block counts and misleading test pages. By focusing on real network activity and distinct third-party servers contacted during normal browsing, users gain authentic transparency to make informed decisions about privacy and content blocking.

Continue exploring the popup interface, understand network visibility, and apply these learnings to protect your browsing footprint effectively.
