# Evaluating Content Blockers with uBO Scope

## Overview

This guide helps you leverage uBO Scope to **evaluate the effectiveness of various content and ad blockers** by revealing real network request outcomes. It provides practical advice on how to analyze connection results, avoid common pitfalls in assessment, and interpret the domain categorizations shown in the popup panel. Understanding these concepts ensures you make informed decisions on the privacy and reliability implications of different blockers.

---

## What You'll Achieve

- Compare multiple content blockers based on actual network connections.
- Understand the distinction between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Detect misleading block count metrics and avoid common evaluation errors.

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and active in your browser.
- One or more content blockers installed and enabled for testing.
- Basic familiarity with the uBO Scope popup panel and toolbar badge (see [Understanding the Popup & Badge](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/first-steps-usage/interpreting-the-popup)).

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Prepare Your Environment

- Open a browser tab with a website you want to test.
- Ensure uBO Scope and the content blockers you intend to compare are enabled.
- Keep the uBO Scope popup available for quick reference.

### 2. Observe the Toolbar Badge

- The badge number represents the count of distinct third-party domains **allowed** (i.e., connections made) on the active tab.
- A **lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections and generally better privacy**.

### 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

- Click the extension icon to open the popup for the current tab.
- Review the three main domain categories:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains with allowed connections.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where blocking was done via stealth techniques (e.g., redirects or rewrites). These connections are hidden from the page but still tracked.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where network requests failed or were actively blocked.

### 4. Analyze Domain Data

- Each domain row shows the domain name and the count of connections.
- Look for excessive allowed third-party domains, which may indicate less effective filtering.
- Review stealth-blocked domains to understand stealth blocking's role and its implications.

### 5. Compare Across Content Blockers

- Repeat the steps with different configured blockers on the same webpage.
- Focus on the **number of allowed third-party domains**, not just the block count that other tools display.
- Use the popup details to get granular insights beyond summary metrics.

### 6. Avoid Common Pitfalls

- **Do NOT rely on block counts displayed by other blockers as a quality measure.** A higher block number might mean more requests were initiated, not necessarily better blocking.
- **Ignore misleading 'ad blocker test' sites** that load artificial or unrealistic domains.
- Understand that stealth-blocking might not show as blocked in other tools but is accounted for in uBO Scope.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Always **test on real websites under normal browsing conditions**, rather than synthetic test pages.
- Cross-reference the popup's domain lists with known CDN or legitimate third-party domains; not all third-party connections are bad.
- When comparing blockers, prioritize those that reduce **distinct allowed third-party domains** effectively.
- Use uBO Scope as a supplementary tool alongside your blockerâ€™s own reporting.

## Example Scenario

Imagine you want to compare "Content Blocker A" and "Content Blocker B":

1. Navigate to a news website.
2. Enable "Content Blocker A" and open the uBO Scope popup.
3. Note the number and names of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
4. Disable "Content Blocker A" and enable "Content Blocker B".
5. Refresh the site and open uBO Scope popup again.
6. Compare the **allowed domains count and list** between the two blockers.

Despite "Content Blocker B" showing a higher number of blocked requests in its own UI, uBO Scope reveals it allows connections to more distinct third-party domains, suggesting it might be less effective in preventing external tracking.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope During Evaluations">
<Accordion title="The popup shows no or incomplete data">
- Verify uBO Scope has the proper permissions.
- Refresh the tab and open the popup again.
- Confirm the tested page is fully loaded.
- Ensure the browser version supports `webRequest` API props required.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth-blocked domains don't appear as blocked in other blockers">
- Understand stealth block uses redirects or rewrites invisible to page scripts.
- uBO Scope detects these as stealth to provide accurate insights.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count seems inconsistent with popup data">
- Badge reflects distinct allowed third-party domains, not total requests.
- Popups also include stealth-blocked and blocked domains with counts.
- Differences arise due to how network events are categorized.

## Summary

uBO Scope enables a **clear, unbiased evaluation of content blockers** based on actual network activity, focusing on the real number of allowed third-party domains rather than misleading block counts. By systematically analyzing allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains, users can make informed decisions and debunk common myths about blocker effectiveness.
