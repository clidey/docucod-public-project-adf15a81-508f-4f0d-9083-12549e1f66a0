# Understanding the Badge and Popup Indicators

## 1. Purpose of This Guide
This guide explains how to interpret the **toolbar badge number** and the **popup interface** in uBO Scope. You'll learn how these indicators represent the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connects to, and how to differentiate between various connection outcomes: allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked.

Understanding these indicators is critical to accurately assessing your online privacy exposure and making informed decisions about your content blockers.

## 2. How uBO Scope Measures Connections: The Big Picture

uBO Scope tracks every network request your browser makes to remote servers. It categorizes servers into three outcomes:

- **Allowed**: Requests that completed successfully and fetched data.
- **Blocked**: Requests that were blocked and failed to connect.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Requests that were redirected or blocked in a subtle way, often without the webpage's awareness.

The number you see on the toolbar badge is a count of **distinct third-party domains successfully connected** during the current tab session.

<Tip>
A *third-party domain* is any domain different from the one of the page you are visiting. A lower badge count means fewer unique third-party servers fetched resources, reflecting better privacy.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

### What the Badge Number Represents
- The badge shows the count of **distinct third-party domains from which data was successfully allowed**.
- It **does not** show blocked domains count or stealth-blocked domains.
- The badge updates reactively as new connections are established or when tabs close.

### Why Focus on Allowed Domains?
- Allowed connections expose your browsing activity to external parties.
- A higher number indicates more third-party interaction, which increases privacy risk.

### Badge Update Flow (Simplified)
1. Network requests trigger event listeners in the background script.
2. Each successful allowed connection adds to the tab’s allowed domains.
3. The tab’s allowed domain count updates the badge text.

<Info>
If the value is empty, it means no third-party remote connections have been recorded yet for the active tab.
</Info>

## 4. Exploring the Popup Interface

The popup provides a detailed breakdown of third-party remote connections for the current tab.

### Sections and What They Show

| Section          | Description                         | What It Includes                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**  | Allowed connections                | Domains successfully connected   |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Redirected or stealth blocked    | Domains with hidden blocking     |
| **Blocked**      | Explicitly blocked connections     | Domains where requests failed    |

### How Counts Are Aggregated
- The popup tallies counts per domain, showing how many times resources were requested or blocked.
- Domains are sorted alphabetically for easy review.

### Domain vs Hostname
- The displayed domains are the **registrable domains** (e.g., example.com), not just the hostname or subdomains.
- This ensures the counts represent distinct third-party ownership effectively.

## 5. Practical Workflow: Reading the Indicators

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup panel.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Toolbar Badge">
Look at the badge number on the extension icon.

- A number indicates how many unique third-party domains have loaded resources.
- No number (empty badge) means no allowed third-party connections yet.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Popup Sections">
Review the three domain lists:

- 'Not Blocked': Which third-party servers allowed connections and how many times.
- 'Stealth-Blocked': Where stealth blocking or redirects occurred.
- 'Blocked': Explicitly blocked connection attempts.

Counts next to domains show connection frequency.
</Step>
<Step title="Assess Your Privacy Exposure">
A lower number of unique allowed domains suggests better privacy.

Use the blocked and stealth-blocked lists to infer what connections were prevented.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- **Focus on the badge count** for quick privacy assessment; it reflects *allowed* third-party remote servers.
- Use the popup to investigate *which* domains are connecting and their status.
- If you notice unexpectedly high allowed domains, investigate which third parties are involved and consider adjusting your content blocker.
- Stealth-blocked domains indicate servers where blocking prevented page awareness; this can help you understand subtle blocking effects.

## 7. Common Misconceptions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Misconceptions About uBO Scope Badge & Popup">
<Accordion title="Is a higher badge count better because it shows more blocking?">
No. The badge only reflects allowed connections, not blocked ones. A lower badge number means fewer allowed third-party connections and thus better privacy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does the badge count blocked domains?">
No. Blocked and stealth-blocked domains are shown only in the popup interface, not on the badge.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are all third-party domains bad?">
Not necessarily. Some third-party domains (e.g., CDN providers) may be essential and not privacy concerns. However, an unusually high number of third parties suggests greater exposure.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Troubleshooting Indicator Issues

<Tip>
If the badge number does not update or shows '0' unexpectedly:
</Tip>

- Ensure the extension has proper permissions (storage and webRequest).
- Try refreshing the active tab.
- Confirm you have visited a webpage that loads third-party resources.
- Verify your content blocker does not interfere with uBO Scope’s operation.

<Note>
The badge will not update for background tabs until you activate them.
</Note>

## 9. Summary

Both the toolbar badge and popup indicators give you a transparent view into your browser’s network connections.
- The **badge** quickly tells you how many unique, distinct third-party domains successfully loaded resources.
- The **popup** offers detailed insight into which domains were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

Use these indicators together to understand and control your online privacy exposure with confidence.
