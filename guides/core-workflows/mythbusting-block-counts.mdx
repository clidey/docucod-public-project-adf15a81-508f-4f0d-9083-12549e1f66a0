# Debunking Block Count Myths with uBO Scope

## Workflow Overview

**What this guide achieves:**

This guide helps you use uBO Scope to critically evaluate the real effectiveness of content blockers beyond superficial badge block counts. It explicitly shows how to uncover and disprove common misconceptions, like confusing a high block count with better blocking performance.

**Prerequisites:**

- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
- Familiarity with basic usage of uBO Scope's popup UI.
- Active browsing session with network activity to analyze (e.g., a few open tabs).

**Expected outcome:**

After completing this guide, you will confidently interpret connection data shown by uBO Scope, understand why block count alone is misleading, and appreciate the extension’s unique approach of tracking distinct third-party remote servers.

**Estimated time:** 10-15 minutes

**Difficulty:** Beginner to Intermediate

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Understand What the Badge Count Represents

- The badge count on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon shows the number of **distinct third-party domains** your browser connected to, not the total blocked requests.
- A **lower badge count** means fewer distinct connections to third-party servers, which generally indicates better privacy and blocking effectiveness.

<Tip>
Remember: The badge count is about *distinct domains contacted*, not the number of blocked requests. Focus on domain count for privacy insights.
</Tip>

### 2. Open the Popup UI for Your Active Tab

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- The popup displays:
  - **Domains connected:** Distinct domains contacted by the active tab.
  - **Allowed:** Third-party domains with allowed (successful) connections.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains with redirect-based stealth blocking.
  - **Blocked:** Strictly blocked domains.

### 3. Compare Connections and Block Counts

- Observe cases where an extension with a high block count might still show a **larger number of allowed domains** in uBO Scope.
- This happens because a blocker may block many requests but still allow connections to many distinct domains, implying potential privacy leakage.

### 4. Challenge the Myth: "Higher Block Count Means Better Blocking"

- Use uBO Scope data to see that a higher block count on your badge or content blocker UI doesn’t guarantee fewer third-party connections.
- Check the **allowed list** in the popup — more allowed third parties means more data is actually loaded from remote servers.

### 5. Avoid Relying on "Ad Blocker Test" Websites

- Be aware that popular "ad blocker test" websites do not reflect real-world browsing and can misrepresent blocker effectiveness.
- These sites use fabricated network requests which do not occur on actual websites.
- uBO Scope reveals what browsers really connect to on the live web, bypassing these unrealistic tests.

### 6. Use Real Browsing Sessions for Validation

- Navigate through websites you trust and analyze the popup’s domain breakdown.
- Note how stealth-blocked and blocked domains differ, reflecting actual browser behavior.

### 7. Interpret the Outcomes Confidently

- **Allowed domains**: Connections that went through successfully.
- **Stealth-blocked domains**: Connections prevented or redirected stealthily by blockers.
- **Blocked domains**: Explicit block events where connection errors occurred.

Use these insights to judge blocker performance, rather than just relying on raw block counts.

### 8. Monitor Badge Counts Over Time

- Keep an eye on the badge count during regular browsing.
- Lower, stable counts generally indicate effective content blocking.

<Tip>
If you see a high block count on other blockers but also a high allowed domain count in uBO Scope, you may want to reconsider the blocker or filter lists you use.
</Tip>

## Practical Example

Imagine you use two blockers A and B:

- Blocker A shows a block count of 100 on its icon.
- Blocker B shows a block count of 40.

You might assume blocker A is better. But when you open uBO Scope popup:

| Outcome Category  | Blocker A (domains connected) | Blocker B (domains connected) |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Allowed           | 30                            | 10                            |
| Stealth-blocked   | 5                             | 4                             |
| Blocked           | 40                            | 15                            |
| **Badge Count**   | 35 (allowed + stealth)         | 14 (allowed + stealth)         |

Here, blocker B has a lower block count *and* fewer allowed domains, meaning it actually blocks more effectively despite showing fewer individual blocked requests.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Badge count doesn't update or seems inaccurate:**
  - Ensure uBO Scope has permission to monitor network requests.
  - Confirm your browser supports `webRequest` API as needed.
  - Refresh the active tab or restart the browser.

- **Popup shows no data:**
  - Make sure you have active network activity in the tab.
  - Some browser restrictions might block capturing requests on certain pages (like internal browser pages).

### Best Practices

- Regularly check the popup on the tabs you use most for browsing privacy insights.
- Combine uBO Scope data with your content blocker's interface to get a comprehensive understanding.
- Use the domain breakdown to identify potentially unwanted third parties you may want to block manually.

### Performance Considerations

- uBO Scope updates its data asynchronously and batches network events.
- Badge counts might take a second or two to reflect recent activity.

### Alternative Uses

- Filter list maintainers can leverage uBO Scope to identify third-party domains allowed unintentionally.
- Researchers can validate real web traffic rather than synthetic ad-block testing sites.
