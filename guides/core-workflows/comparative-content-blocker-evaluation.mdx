# Comparing Content Blockers: Interpreting Badge Counts and Domain Lists

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide empowers you to accurately compare the effectiveness of different content blockers by leveraging uBO Scope's reporting features. It clarifies common misconceptions about the extension's badge counts and guides you in focusing on the most meaningful metric: the number of unique connected third-party servers.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your browser.
- At least two content blockers installed and configured, to test comparatively.
- Basic familiarity with uBO Scope's popup interface and its domain categorizations (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).

### Expected Outcome
By following this workflow, you will learn how to interpret uBO Scope's data correctly to:
- Avoid misleading conclusions based only on badge counts.
- Use the unique connected domains metric as a reliable indicator.
- Understand the differences among allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains in context.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10–15 minutes to test examples and interpret results clearly.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate

## Understanding the Core Concept

Before diving into comparisons, it's critical to grasp how uBO Scope tracks and reports network activity:
- The **badge count** reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to during a page load.
- A **lower badge count** generally indicates fewer external connections, which often translates to higher privacy.
- Badge counts do **not** measure how many requests were blocked but how many unique third-party servers were contacted.

### Why Badge Counts Can Be Misleading

Many users assume a higher block count indicates a better blocker. However, block counts alone don't reveal if the blocker actually allows fewer third-party connections. An extension might block many requests but still allow connections to numerous unique servers, increasing your exposure.

<u>**Example:**</u>
> Content Blocker A shows 50 blocked requests but your browser connected to 25 unique servers.
>
> Content Blocker B shows 30 blocked requests but your browser connected to 40 unique servers.
>
> Despite lower block counts, Blocker B allows connections to more third-party servers, which may suggest less privacy protection.

## Step-by-Step Instructions for Comparing Content Blockers

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Access the uBO Scope extension by clicking its toolbar icon while browsing any webpage.

**Outcome:** You see the popup showing the active tab's hostname, a summary count of connected domains, and lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
</Step>

<Step title="Record Baseline Metrics with Content Blocker A">
Make sure Content Blocker A is active.

Reload the webpage or visit a site you want to test.

Observe the badge count and the 'domains connected' summary in uBO Scope's popup.

Browse the domain lists and note the unique third-party domains connected (allowed, stealth, blocked).

**Outcome:** Establish a baseline number of connected third-party servers while Content Blocker A is active.
</Step>

<Step title="Switch to Content Blocker B and Repeat">
Disable Content Blocker A and enable Content Blocker B.

Reload the same webpage or visit the same site as before.

Open the uBO Scope popup again.

Observe and record the badge count and unique third-party domain counts.

Compare how the unique connected domains differ from the previous baseline.

**Outcome:** You have comparable data for both blockers.
</Step>

<Step title="Focus on Unique Connected Domains Instead of Badge Counts">
Ignore just the badge or block count numbers.

Concentrate on the total number of unique connected third-party domains shown in the summary and domain lists.

A lower unique connected domain count indicates fewer distinct third-party servers were contacted, which means better privacy protection.

**Example:**
- Content Blocker A: 15 unique connected domains
- Content Blocker B: 25 unique connected domains

Content Blocker A is preventing more third-party exposure despite the badge values.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret the Domain Lists Meaningfully">
Understand what each category means:
- **Allowed:** Third-party servers your browser successfully connected to.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that were redirected or modified subtlety (often invisible to webpages), indicating stealth blocking.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed due to blocking.

Evaluate how many significant third-party domains are allowed or stealth-blocked versus outright blocked.

**Outcome:** You get a fuller picture of how the content blockers operate beyond just counts.
</Step>

<Step title="Repeat Tests on Multiple Sites">
Perform the above steps on several websites representing varied complexities (news, e-commerce, streaming).

Notice patterns in unique connected domains and stealth blocking effectiveness.

Identify which content blocker consistently reduces third-party domain exposure.

**Tip:** Use private/incognito windows to avoid cached session data.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Real-World Example

Imagine testing two blockers on https://example.com:

| Content Blocker | Badge Count | Unique Connected Domains | Interpretation                          |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Blocker A       | 10          | 8                        | Few connections, strong privacy        |
| Blocker B       | 20          | 15                       | More connections despite fewer blocks  |

Here, Blocker A offers better protection by limiting unique connected domains, whereas Blocker B allows more distinct third-party servers despite appearing to block frequently.

## Best Practices & Tips

- Always evaluate blockers based on the **unique third-party connected domains**, not just badge or block counts.
- Use multiple sites for evaluation to avoid skewed results from a single page.
- Refresh pages fully between tests; session data can influence results.
- Recognize that some third-party connections are benign or necessary (e.g., popular CDNs).
- Consider the **stealth-blocked** category: it reflects subtle blocking often missed by other metrics.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Badge Count Misinterpretations">
<Accordion title="Over-relying on block counts">
Block counts can be high with a blocker that still allows many third-party domains, misleading your privacy assessment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Ignoring stealth blocking">
Failure to acknowledge stealth-blocked domains can cause underestimating a blocker’s effectiveness.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup title="Data Not Appearing or Updating">
<Accordion title="No data in popup">
Ensure uBO Scope has permission to read active tab data and that the page uses HTTP/S or WS/S protocols.
Reload the extension or browser if the popup remains empty.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count doesn't update">
Make sure uBO Scope and the content blockers are properly installed and active.
Review the Troubleshooting guide if issues persist.

## Summary
uBO Scope offers a unique, reliable way to measure third-party connections in your browser, but proper interpretation of its badge counts and domain categorizations is key. This guide directs you toward evaluating content blockers by focusing on unique domains connected rather than simply block or badge counts, thus giving you a clearer insight into actual privacy impact.

<Tip>
Remember: The true metric of content blocker effectiveness is the number of unique third-party domains *allowed* to connect, not the number of requests blocked.
