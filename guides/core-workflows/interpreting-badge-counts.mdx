# Interpreting Badge Counts and Extension Feedback

## Overview

This guide explains how to understand the **toolbar badge count** and the detailed feedback shown inside the uBO Scope extension popup. It focuses on why a **lower badge count indicates better privacy** by showing fewer distinct third-party remote servers connected during browsing. You'll also learn best practices for decoding the extension's signals and how other content blockers or DNS filters influence these metrics.

## What the Toolbar Badge Count Represents

The badge count displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon reports the **number of distinct third-party remote domains** your browser has connected to for the currently active tab. 

- **Lower badge counts mean stronger privacy**, as fewer third-party servers are contacted.
- This count is based on actual network requests observed by the browser's `webRequest` API — not estimations or blocked request counts.

### Why Focus on Unique Third-Party Domains?

Many users mistakenly assume more blocking badges or block counts mean better protection. uBO Scope shifts the focus to **distinct third-party domains connected**, which provides an accurate picture of the exposure surface:

- A **lower number means fewer external domains provided content or tracking vectors** on the page.
- Counting block events alone can mislead because blockers with higher block counts may allow more domains through, thus increasing privacy risk.

<Tip>
Always interpret the badge count as a **privacy indicator**: fewer remote domains connected equals better privacy protection.
</Tip>

## Understanding In-Popup Indicators

When you click the uBO Scope icon to open its popup, it breaks down remote domains into three categories with domain counts:

### 1. Not Blocked (Allowed)

- These domains are actively connected and loaded resources.
- They are shown under the **`not blocked`** section with count badges indicating how often resources from each domain were accessed.
- This category directly contributes to the toolbar badge count.

### 2. Stealth-Blocked

- Domains listed here represent those connections that were **diverted or redirected** by other blockers or mechanisms stealthily.
- These requests do not appear as blocked errors but were prevented from connecting normally.
- They reveal subtle blocking done behind the scenes.

### 3. Blocked

- Domains here correspond to requests that **failed or were explicitly blocked**, resulting in errors.
- They show where connections were outright denied by content blockers or DNS filters.

<Note>
Seeing entries across all three categories is expected. Importantly, the badge count only counts domains in the **allowed** category.
</Note>

## Best Practices to Decipher the Extension's Feedback

1. **Prioritize the Badge Count:** Use the toolbar badge as the primary quick privacy metric.

2. **Use the Popup for Detailed Analysis:** Open the popup to examine which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, to understand where potential privacy leaks occur.

3. **Consider the Role of Other Content Blockers and DNS Filters:** uBO Scope works alongside other blockers and respects their effects.

4. **Recognize Legitimate Domains:** Not all third-party domains are bad; content delivery networks (CDNs) and essential services often connect legitimately. The goal is to minimize unsolicited third-party connections.

5. **Beware of High Block Counts Without Low Badge Counts:** High blocking without reducing distinct allowed domains indicates limited efficacy.

6. **Use the Extension to Debunk Block Count Myths:** Never equate a higher block count with better protection. Instead, focus on reducing actual third-party connections.

## How Other Content Blockers or DNS Filters Affect Badge Counts

- uBO Scope actively listens to the browser's network traffic to detect connections even if another content blocker or DNS filter intercepts them.
- If a DNS filter blocks a connection before the browser's `webRequest` API sees it, the extension might not detect the request.
- For most modern browsers supporting `webRequest`, uBO Scope will accurately reflect connections allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked regardless of content blocker layering.

<Warning>
The badge count reflects only the domains **connecting through the browser's network stack as observed via `webRequest`**. It cannot account for blocking mechanisms outside this scope, such as system-wide firewalls or DNS filters not visible to the browser.
</Warning>

## Step-by-Step: How to Use Badge Counts and Popup Indicators for Privacy Insights

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Toolbar Badge Count">
Look at the badge on uBO Scope's extension icon. A smaller number means fewer third-party domains loaded on the active webpage.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup">
Click the extension icon to open the popup panel, which breaks down domains into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
Focus on domains under 'not blocked'. These are active connections contributing to your overall exposure.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Stealth and Blocked Domains">
Identify any stealth-blocked domains to understand subtle redirects or filtering, and blocked domains representing denied requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Assess Overall Privacy Posture">
Combine insights from the badge and popup to judge privacy effectiveness. Aim for low allowed domains and understand blocked activity’s impact.
</Step>
<Step title="Investigate Outliers or Unexpected Domains">
If you spot unusual or many allowed third-party domains, consider further investigation or tightening filters.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Common Scenarios & Practical Examples

| Scenario | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Badge count is 0 or 1 | Almost no external third-party connections | Excellent privacy; no further action usually required |
| Badge count is high but popup shows mostly blocked domains | Many requests blocked but several allowed | Review allowed domains to verify necessity and potential privacy risks |
| Stealth-blocked domains present but low allowed count | Some connections are quietly redirected or prevented | Recognize stealth blocking occurs silently—good for privacy |
| Badge count increases after disabling content blocker | More third-party domains are connected | Confirms content blocker effectiveness |

## Troubleshooting Badge Count & Indicator Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Badge and Popup Feedback Issues">

<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating or Stuck">
- Ensure the browser supports and allows the `webRequest` API.
- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled and has required permissions.
- Verify the tab is active and you’re viewing a web page (not browser&apos;s internal pages).
- Reload the tab or restart the browser to refresh data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or Incomplete Data">
- Check your network connection and content blockers around uBO Scope.
- Some websites with complex frames or special networking might show limited data.
- Reload the popup by closing and reopening.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unexpectedly High Allowed Domains Count">
- Consider whether other extensions or DNS filters are interfering.
- Check if the site legitimately calls many third-party services (e.g., ads, widgets).
- Review blocked and stealth-blocked domains for context.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Low Badge Count but Observed Trackers Are Present">
- Understand uBO Scope counts unique remote domains, not individual tracking elements.
- Trackers served from the same domain count once.
- Use this tool alongside a dedicated blocker for tracking identification.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for Getting the Most from Badge Count Interpretation

- Use badge count trends over time for a website to spot changes in privacy exposure.
- Combine badge insights with domain analysis in the popup to decide if further blocking adjustments are necessary.
- Remember that the goal is to minimize third-party connections, not just increase block counts.
- Be patient: some domains are essential and unavoidable; focus on reducing unnecessary external connections.

## Summary

Understanding uBO Scope&apos;s badge count and popup feedback empowers you to see your web privacy at a glance. A lower badge count means fewer third-party domains connected and better privacy. Use the popup for deeper insight into which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked to make informed decisions about your browsing protections.
