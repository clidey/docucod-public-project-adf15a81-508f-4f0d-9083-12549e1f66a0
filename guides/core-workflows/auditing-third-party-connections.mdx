# Auditing Third-Party Connections with uBO Scope

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide walks you through the process of using uBO Scope to audit and understand the third-party servers contacted by any website you visit. It focuses on analyzing the connections shown in the uBO Scope popup interface, distinguishing between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked requests, and interpreting the color-coded connection summaries to enhance your awareness of online tracking and privacy risks.

### Prerequisites
- You must have uBO Scope installed and enabled in your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- Confirm that the extension has required permissions: webRequest, activeTab, storage, and host access.
- Basic understanding of opening the uBO Scope popup and navigating its interface.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will confidently audit the third-party network connections a webpage initiates, understand key distinctions in connection outcomes, and learn to interpret the extension’s visual cues for informed privacy decisions.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10 minutes for a full site audit.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate, with gradual disclosure of concepts and practical advice.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser to open the popup.
- The popup shows information specific to the current active tab.

**Expected Result:**
You see the hostname and aggregated data about third-party domains contacted.


### Step 2: Understand the Color-Coded Connection Categories
The popup divides third-party connections into three categories:

- **Not blocked (Allowed)**: Connections successfully established and not prevented by any content blockers.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Connections silently blocked or redirected by blockers in stealth mode to avoid site breakage or detection.
- **Blocked**: Connections explicitly blocked and reported as errors or failures.

Each category is represented with distinct colors and sections in the popup for quick visual identification.

<Callout type="info">
The 'stealth-blocked' category highlights connections blocked in a way that webpages cannot detect, revealing the often invisible action of privacy tools.
</Callout>


### Step 3: Interpret the Domain-Level Summaries
- The popup lists third-party domains under each outcome category, accompanied by a count indicating how many times these domains were involved in network requests.
- The hostname at the top represents the page’s primary domain. Domains listed are third parties contacted during page load and interaction.

**Tip:**
Focus on domains you do not recognize or frequent third-party trackers to understand possible privacy exposures.


### Step 4: Analyze Connection Counts and Their Implications
- The count beside each domain shows the number of connection attempts to that domain, giving insight into the level of interaction.
- The total number of connected domains appears in the summary section—this total is what the badge count on the extension icon reflects.

<Callout type="tip">
A lower badge count means fewer distinct third-party connections, which can be a positive privacy indicator.
</Callout>


### Step 5: Differentiate Third-Party Domains vs. Hostnames
- uBO Scope aggregates data by domain for clarity but internally also tracks specific hostnames.
- This helps discern connections at different subdomain levels (e.g., `ads.example.com` vs. `cdn.example.com`).


### Step 6: Use These Insights to Inform Decisions About Blockers
- Domains classified as 'Allowed' may indicate harmless third-partyCDNs or essential services.
- Domains under 'Blocked' or 'Stealth-blocked' may correspond to trackers or unwanted third-party services.

**Decision Guidance:**
Consider using this information to adjust your content blocking settings or report suspicious third-party trackers.


### Step 7: Refresh and Re-audit as Needed
- Reload the webpage to capture a fresh snapshot of third-party connections.
- Close and reopen the uBO Scope popup to see updated data reflecting new connection events.

## Examples & Scenarios

### Example 1: Detecting Excessive Third-Party Connections

Imagine visiting a news website that connects to many tracking domains under the 'Allowed' and 'Stealth-blocked' categories. You notice domains like `trackingservice.com` and `analyticsprovider.net` appearing with high connection counts.

- Outcome: You realize your current content blocker is not fully effective.
- Next Action: You may consider tighter blocking rules or blacklist additions.


### Example 2: Confirming Legitimate CDN Connections

You're on an e-commerce site and see domains like `cdn.shopify.com` or `cdn.cloudflare.net` under 'Allowed'. These are content delivery networks ensuring quick content load.

- Outcome: These are typically safe and necessary connections.
- Interpretation: Not all third parties are harmful; common CDNs are generally acceptable.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty lists:**
  - Verify that you have permissions set correctly.
  - Refresh the current tab to trigger new connection tracking.
  - Restart the browser if the problem persists.

- **Unexpectedly high number of allowed connections:**
  - This might indicate incomplete blocking; review your content blocker settings.

- **Stealth-blocked or blocked categories missing:**
  - Some sites or browsers may limit visibility to this information.
  - Confirm you are using a supported browser version.


### Best Practices

- Regularly audit sites you frequent to spot changes in third-party connections.
- Use the extension alongside other privacy tools for a layered defense.
- Pay attention to stealth-blocked counts—these reveal hidden tracking attempts not shown by other tools.

### Performance Considerations
- uBO Scope batches connection data efficiently but excessive network activity on very complex sites may delay updates briefly.
- Wait a few seconds after page load for full data capture.

### Alternative Approaches
- Combine uBO Scope audits with in-depth filter list diagnostics if you maintain custom blocker rules.
- Use the popup summary alongside badge count explanations for deeper insight.

## Visual Reference

The uBO Scope popup displays a structure like:

```text
[HOSTNAME]

Summary: domains connected: [COUNT]

--- Not Blocked ---
Domain1.com     [count]
Domain2.net     [count]
...

--- Stealth Blocked ---
Domain3.org     [count]
...

--- Blocked ---
Domain4.io      [count]
...
```

This clarity helps make quick privacy-based evaluations.
