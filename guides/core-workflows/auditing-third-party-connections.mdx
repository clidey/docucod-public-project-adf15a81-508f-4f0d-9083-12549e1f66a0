# Auditing Third-Party and Remote Server Connections with uBO Scope

## Overview

This guide walks you through using the uBO Scope browser extension to audit and analyze all third-party and remote server connections your browser makes when visiting websites. You will learn how to interpret the toolbar badge counts, read connection outcomes in the popup, and categorize servers to uncover potential privacy exposures.

### What This Guide Accomplishes
- Discover all network connections initiated by your browser for a given webpage.
- Understand how uBO Scope classifies connections into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- Gain insight into the significance of third-party domains and their impact on privacy.
- Use the extension’s interface effectively to pinpoint connection details.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and enabled in a compatible browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with browsing and accessing browser extensions.
- Active tab visited with network traffic to analyze.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will confidently audit the network connections your browser attempts, interpret the results displayed in the uBO Scope popup, and assess third-party exposure for any visited webpage.

### Time Estimate
About 5-10 minutes to perform an audit and review results in the popup.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser.
- The popup will display the summary and categorized list of domains connected by the active tab.

#### What You Should See
- The domain of the current website you are auditing at the top.
- A badge count showing the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- Three sections indicating connection outcomes:
  - **not blocked (allowed)**
  - **stealth-blocked**
  - **blocked**
- Each section contains rows listing domains and the number of requests sent or blocked.

### Step 2: Understand the Badge Count
- The badge number on the toolbar icon represents the count of unique third-party domains for which connections were allowed by the browser.
- A **lower number means fewer third-party connections** and generally better privacy exposure.

### Step 3: Analyze Domain Lists by Outcome
- **Allowed Domains**: These are third-party servers your browser successfully connected to while loading the current page.
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains**: Domains that were connection attempted but silently redirected or stealthily blocked. This could indicate third-party trackers blocked without disturbing page functionality.
- **Blocked Domains**: Connections that were blocked outright by content blockers or network policies.

### Step 4: Examine Counts and Domains in Each Section
- Within each section, domains appear alongside a count badge reflecting how many requests were made to that domain.
- Domains are sorted alphabetically to ease scanning.
- Use this information to identify unusual third-party domains or unexpected network activity.

### Step 5: Use Domain Names for Deeper Investigation
- The domain names are normalized and presented in Unicode for clarity—including internationalized domains.
- Recognize familiar third-party providers like CDNs, analytics, or known trackers.
- Compare domains in the **allowed** list with your expected trusted services to assess exposure.

### Step 6: Correlate with Your Content Blocker Behavior
- Remember uBO Scope reports all requests captured by the browser, regardless of any content blocker in use.
- A domain in the **blocked** or **stealth** list indicates your blocker or network has interfered with connections to that domain.
- Use this insight to verify the effectiveness of your content blocking setup.

### Step 7: Refresh the Audit after Page Navigations
- The connection data refreshes with each new page load or tab navigation.
- Reopen the popup or click the icon again after navigating to a new site to view updated audit results.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Auditing a News Website
- Visit a news website.
- Open the uBO Scope popup.
- Observe the badge count of third-party domains: e.g., 5.
- In the allowed section, identify CDNs or advertising domains.
- Confirm stealth-blocked domains are trackers hidden by your blocker.
- Understand the balance between necessary third-party services and potential privacy risks.

### Example 2: Confirming Blocker Efficacy
- Visit a website known for embedded trackers.
- Open the popup and note the difference between allowed and blocked domains.
- Use the stealth-blocked list to identify trackers your blocker handles quietly.
- This reassures that your content blocker is working beyond visible blocking.

---

## Tips and Best Practices

- Always interpret the badge count as a raw count of allowed distinct third-party domains; a higher count generally means higher privacy risk.
- Don’t assume all third-party domains are inherently malicious—recognize important services like CDN providers.
- Use the domain categorization to cross-reference with known tracker or advertising domain lists.
- Regularly audit your browsing sessions to maintain awareness of third-party exposure.
- Understand that stealth-blocked domains may not show up as blocked by conventional blockers but are still mitigated.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Popup Shows 'NO DATA'
- Ensure you have active network traffic in the current browser tab (try refreshing).
- Confirm uBO Scope has the required permissions and is enabled.
- Check your browser version meets minimum requirements.

### Issue: Badge Count Does Not Update
- Reload the current page to generate fresh network requests.
- Check for extension conflicts affecting webRequest API availability.
- Verify network filtering policies are not preventing request monitoring.

### Issue: Unexpected Domains Appearing as Allowed
- Investigate whether these belong to legitimate third-party services used by the site.
- Consider using the stealth-blocked and blocked lists to see if there are policy triggers.
- Use external resources like the Public Suffix List or domain reputation services.

# FAQ

**Q:** Are all third-party connections risky?

**A:** Not necessarily. Many third-party domains are legitimate services like CDNs or analytics providers. uBO Scope simply informs you which domains are contacted to let you make informed privacy judgments.

**Q:** Can uBO Scope see connections blocked by all types of blockers?

**A:** uBO Scope reports requests monitored via the browser’s webRequest API, including those altered by content blockers or DNS filtering. However, requests made entirely outside the API are not visible.

**Q:** How often is the data refreshed?

**A:** The popup reflects network activity for the active tab in near real-time, updating after navigations or reloads.
