# Getting Started: Revealing All Remote Server Connections

Welcome to uBO Scope—a powerful browser extension that instantly exposes all remote server connections initiated by the webpages you visit. This guide walks you through the fundamental steps to install the extension, open its popup to visualize remote connections made by your current browser tab, understand the badge icon on the toolbar, and grasp the core flows that power the extension’s real-time insights.

---

## 1. What This Guide Helps You Accomplish

This guide empowers you to:

- Install and launch uBO Scope in supported browsers.
- Access and interpret the extension popup to see all remote server connections in your current tab.
- Understand what the badge icon represents and how it relates to your browsing activity.
- Gain a clear picture of how uBO Scope monitors and categorizes network requests behind the scenes.


## 2. Prerequisites Before You Begin

- A compatible web browser installed:
  - Chromium-based: Google Chrome ≥ 122
  - Mozilla Firefox ≥ 128
  - Safari ≥ 18.5
- Network permissions granted to uBO Scope during installation (the extension requests `webRequest` access).
- Basic familiarity with browser extension installation and toolbar controls.


## 3. What You Will Achieve

After following this guide, you will have uBO Scope installed and actively monitoring your browsing session. You will be able to open its popup on any active tab and instantly view distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to, categorized by their connection status:

- **Allowed connections** (not blocked)
- **Stealth-blocked connections**
- **Blocked connections**

You will also understand the real meaning behind the badge number displayed on the extension icon.


## 4. Time Commitment & Skill Level

- **Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes
- **Skill Level:** Beginner – No advanced configuration needed

## 5. Installing and Launching uBO Scope

Follow these steps to get uBO Scope running:

### Step 1: Install the Extension

1. Visit the official installation page for your browser:
   - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
   - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
   - Safari Extensions gallery (via your Mac App Store or Safari settings)

2. Click **Add to Browser** and permit requested permissions, especially access to network requests.

3. Wait for the extension icon (a shield with a small graph) to appear in your browser toolbar.

### Step 2: Open the uBO Scope Popup

1. Navigate to any webpage you want to inspect.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar. This opens the popup panel.
3. The popup will automatically display the remote server connections made during this tab’s session.


## 6. Understanding the Popup Interface

The popup is designed to provide clear, real-time insight into your tab’s network activity.

### Key Sections of the Popup

- **Header:** Displays the current tab's hostname and domain in a split view.
- **Summary:** Shows the total count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Outcome Sections:** Three categorized groups showing domains:
  - **Not blocked (Allowed):** Connections successfully made.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Connections that were redirected or intercepted stealthily.
  - **Blocked:** Connections prevented due to errors or blocking.

### What You See and What It Means

For each category, the popup lists:
- The remote domain name.
- The count of distinct hostnames associated with that domain.

This lets you grasp at a glance which third-party servers your browsing session relied on or tried to contact.


<Callout type="info">
Note: The counts in the popup reflect unique third-party domains, not individual network requests. Fewer domains usually indicate better privacy.
</Callout>


## 7. Decoding the Toolbar Badge Icon

- The badge number indicates how many distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to **successfully and were allowed** by your system (content blocker or otherwise).
- A **lower badge number is better** for privacy, indicating fewer third-party connections.
- The badge updates dynamically as you browse, reflecting the current tab’s cumulative allowed domains.


## 8. How uBO Scope Works Behind the Scenes (What Powers the Popup)

1. **Monitoring Network Requests:**
   - The extension uses browser `webRequest` API listeners to track all outgoing requests.
2. **Categorizing Connections:**
   - Requests are processed and sorted into **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked** categories based on their outcomes (success, redirect, error).
3. **Maintaining Session Data:**
   - Data is maintained per tab, tracking all remote server domains encountered.
4. **Populating Popup:**
   - When you open the popup, it fetches the session data for the active tab, deserializes it, and renders a clear, categorized domain list with counts.


## 9. Step-by-Step User Flow Example

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install uBO Scope">
    Complete installation from the official store following browser prompts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to a Website">
    Open any website in a new tab (e.g., https://example.com).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
    Click the extension icon in the toolbar to reveal the popup panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Remote Connections">
    See the list of connected remote server domains grouped by their connection outcome.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Interpret the Badge Icon">
    Check the badge count on the toolbar to know how many allowed third-party domains are active.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## 10. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Refresh the website or switch tabs** to update the popup’s data for the selected tab.
- **Use uBO Scope alongside content blockers** to verify actual blocking at the network connection level.
- **Interpret stealth-blocked results carefully:** These connections were redirected or handled subtly and merit further investigation.
- **Lower your allowed domains count** by using privacy tools or stricter content blockers.


## 11. Troubleshooting Common Initial Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Initialization and Popup Data">
  <Accordion title="Popup shows NO DATA or empty results">
    - Ensure the tab is active and has loaded content.
    - Verify that the uBO Scope extension has permissions to read network requests.
    - Confirm your browser version meets extension requirements.
    - Try reinstalling or restarting your browser.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Badge count does not appear or remains zero">
    - The badge reflects allowed third-party domains; browse sites that load third-party content.
    - Check extension permissions and network connectivity.
    - Restart browser if necessary.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Popup does not open or extension not visible">
    - Confirm extension installed correctly from the official source.
    - Pin the extension icon to the toolbar if hidden.
    - Check browser compatibility.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
