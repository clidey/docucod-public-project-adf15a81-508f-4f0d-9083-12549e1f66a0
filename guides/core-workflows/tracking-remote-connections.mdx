# Tracking All Remote Connections on a Webpage

Discover every connection your browser attempts or completes to third-party servers when you visit any website. This guide walks you through opening the uBO Scope popup, refreshing connection data, and understanding the distinct types of network outcomes shown in the dashboard.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Achieve
- See in real time all distinct remote server connections initiated by the webpage you are visiting.
- Understand which connections were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Learn to interact with the popup dashboard to analyze these connections effectively.

### Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and active in your browser.
- You should be on a website tab with active network requests.

### Expected Outcome
- A clear view of all third-party domains contacted by the current webpage.
- Insight into which connections are blocked or stealth-blocked, helping you assess privacy exposure.

### Typical Time Commitment
- 5–10 minutes to open, refresh, and interpret data for a webpage.

### Difficulty Level
- Beginner to Intermediate. Suitable for users comfortable with basic browser extension interfaces.

## 2. How to Track Remote Connections Step-by-Step

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope extension icon on your browser toolbar. This opens the popup dashboard that summarizes network connection data for the active tab.

<Check>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA', try refreshing the webpage or ensure uBO Scope has required permissions and is properly installed.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Understand the Tab Hostname and Domain Information">
At the top of the popup, you will see the hostname and domain of the current webpage. This information helps confirm which site’s connections you are analyzing.

<Info>
The hostname is the complete host (e.g., 'www.example.com'), while the domain is the base domain (e.g., 'example.com').
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Connections Summary">
Below the hostname, a summary shows the total number of distinct remote domains connected.

<Note>
This number counts unique third-party domains, meaning repeat connections to the same domain are counted once here.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Explore Domain Outcome Categories">
The dashboard groups connected domains into three categories:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains from which the browser successfully fetched resources.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected in a way that is purposely hidden or blocked without explicit errors.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts failed or were explicitly blocked.

Each category lists domains and a count of connection attempts.
</Step>

<Step title="Refresh the Data">
To get updated connection statistics:

1. Reload the webpage in the browser tab.
2. Re-open the uBO Scope popup or close and open it again.

This mechanism ensures you see the latest network requests for your analysis.

<Tip>
The popup fetches data from the background script each time it opens, reflecting connection details captured by the webRequest API.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Domain Counts and Identify Exposure">
Review the count badges next to each domain name which indicate how many connection attempts occurred.

Focus on the **Not Blocked** count — a higher number here means more third-party servers the site connected to, indicating higher privacy exposure.

Remember, a lower badge count on the toolbar typically signals fewer third-party connections, which usually implies better privacy.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Real-World Usage Example

Imagine you visit a major news website. Opening the uBO Scope popup:

- Under **Not Blocked**, you see domains such as 'cdn.news.com' and 'analytics.tracker.net', each with a count showing multiple connections.
- In the **Stealth-Blocked** category, you might spot domains that were redirected silently to mitigate tracking.
- The **Blocked** section lists domains that were explicitly denied by your content blocker.

This view gives you transparent insight into what servers your browser talks to — far beyond what basic block counts or ad blocker test pages reveal.

## 4. Tips and Best Practices

- **Reload Pages Cautiously:** Frequently reload the tab to capture fresh data especially when dynamic content loads (e.g., infinite scroll sites).
- **Use Domain Lists to Supplement:** Use known lists of trackers if needed to identify privacy-sensitive domains.
- **Understand Stealth Blocking:** This technique hides blocking actions and appears in its own category. Recognize that these are neither plainly allowed nor obviously blocked.
- **Consider Badge Count Meaning:** A lower distinct third-party domain count is better; higher counts signal increased privacy exposure.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Connection Tracking">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA'">
- Confirm uBO Scope permissions are granted (activeTab, webRequest).
- Reload the webpage to ensure network requests are captured.
- Check if other extensions interfere with uBO Scope.
- Refer to 'Troubleshooting Installation & Setup' guide for detailed instructions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Toolbar Badge Does Not Update">
- The badge only updates after the background script processes data, which batches updates roughly every second.
- Closing and reopening the popup can force fresh data retrieval.
- Verify uBO Scope is enabled and running in the browser's extension manager.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Domain Counts Seem Higher or Lower Than Expected">
- Keep in mind the badge count shows distinct third-party domains, not total requests.
- Some repeated connections to the same domain count once.
- Different browsers and content blockers may expose different network requests.
- See 'Debunking Badge Count Myths' guide for more context.
</Accordion>

## Appendix: Understanding Connection Outcome Categories

| Category         | Meaning                                                                                      | User Takeaway                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked      | Connections to third-party servers completed successfully without being blocked.              | Indicates active connections and privacy exposure. |
| Stealth-Blocked  | Requests redirected or blocked silently to avoid detection without explicit errors shown.     | Subtle blocking; contributes to privacy but can be overlooked. |
| Blocked          | Connections that failed or were explicitly denied by content blockers or network policies.    | Confirmed blocked connections.                 |

## Reference: Popup Dashboard Structure

The popup (accessed by the extension icon) contains:

- Header with current tab's hostname and domain.
- Summary section showing distinct connected domains count.
- Sections listing domains under each connection outcome.
- Each domain entry shows the domain name and the number of connection attempts.

This layout provides a concise but comprehensive at-a-glance insight about third-party network connections.
