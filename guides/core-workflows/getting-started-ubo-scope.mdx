## 4. Activating and Accessing uBO Scope

### Step 1: Verify Extension Activation

- Locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser’s toolbar.
- If not visible:
  - Click the Extensions menu (puzzle icon on Chromium/Firefox).
  - Pin uBO Scope to keep it always visible.
- Click the icon to open the popup interface.

### Step 2: First Use Experience

When you open the popup for the first time after visiting a website:

- The extension will collect and display the number of distinct third-party domains it has observed your browser connect to.
- The badge on the extension icon shows the count of unique allowed third-party domains detected for the active tab.

<Tip>
The badge count reflects distinct third-party connections your browser successfully reached, **not** just blocked requests. A lower badge count typically indicates fewer third-party connections, which is generally better for privacy.
</Tip>

## 5. Understanding the Toolbar Badge and Popup Interface

### Toolbar Badge

- Displays a numerical count of unique third-party domains your browser connected to from the current tab.
- A **blank** badge means no third-party connections detected yet.

### Popup Interface Overview

The popup window is divided into three sections:

| Section           | Meaning                                     | What You See                             |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**   | Third-party connections successfully allowed | List of domains and request counts     |
| **Stealth Blocked** | Connections blocked stealthily via redirects | Domains with stealth-blocked counts    |
| **Blocked**       | Connections explicitly blocked by content blockers | Blocked third-party domains and counts |

Below the header, the domain of the active tab is shown clearly to provide context.

### Example View

```
Active tab domain: example.com

domains connected: 5

not blocked
 - cdn.example.net (3)
 - fonts.google.com (2)

stealth-blocked
 - tracker.stealthblock.org (1)

blocked
 - ads.example.com (4)
```

## 6. Verifying Your Setup: Quick Validation

To ensure uBO Scope is correctly installed and functioning:

1. Visit a frequently visited website like your favorite news outlet.
2. Observe the badge count on the uBO Scope icon. It should update to a number greater than zero representing third-party domains.
3. Click the icon to open the popup.
4. Confirm that the popup lists domains under the 'not blocked', 'stealth blocked', and 'blocked' sections.
5. Navigate to a different website and observe the badge count and popup contents update accordingly.

<Tip>
If the badge remains empty or the popup shows no data after browsing several sites, verify that the extension has the 'webRequest' permission enabled and your browser meets the minimum required version.
</Tip>
