## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Install uBO Scope Extension

1. Open your browser’s extension/add-on store.
2. Search for "uBO Scope" or use the official links:
   - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
   - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
3. Click **Add to Browser** and confirm the installation.
4. Verify that the uBO Scope icon appears in your toolbar.

<Note>
Supported browsers and versions align with the official prerequisites documented at the System Requirements page. Ensure your browser meets these to prevent compatibility issues.
</Note>

### Step 2: Open uBO Scope Popup Interface

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup window will open and start displaying real-time data about network requests.

### Step 3: Understand the Icon Badge

- The badge number shows the total count of **distinct third-party remote servers** the current tab has connected to.
- Remember: a lower badge count indicates improved privacy exposure as fewer third-party connections were made.

### Step 4: Explore the Popup Sections

The popup interface divides connected domains into three outcome categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which connections were successfully established.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were intercepted without explicit blocking notification.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were actively blocked or failed.

Within each section, you’ll see:
- The list of domains with counts indicating how many times connections were made.

### Step 5: Navigate the Popup Data

- Each domain entry displays the domain name and the number of connection attempts.
- Domains shown reflect the current active tab’s remote connections.
- The summary at the top aggregates the count of connected domains.

<Tip>
Domains in different outcome sections help you understand which third parties your browser actually contacted and which were prevented from connecting, providing a clear picture of your real-time privacy exposure.
</Tip>

### Step 6: Verify Real-Time Updates

- Navigate to various websites in your browser.
- Open the uBO Scope popup to watch domain connection counts update live.
- Notice the badge count on the toolbar icon adjusts to reflect third-party connections for the active tab.

<Check>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or no updates occur, please refer to troubleshooting guides to verify correct installation and permissions.

## 3. Examples & Practical Scenarios

### Example: Tracking Connections on a News Website

1. Open a news website with many third-party resources.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
3. Observe the **not blocked** domains (e.g., CDN providers delivering images or scripts).
4. Check if stealth-blocked or blocked domains appear, indicating that content was restricted.
5. Use this insight to gauge privacy exposure beyond what common ad blockers display.

### Example: Comparing Two Tabs

- Open two tabs: one with a simple site, one with a complex ad-heavy site.
- Switch between tabs and watch how the badge count and popup domains differ.
- This real-time perspective reveals the actual third-party connection footprint per tab.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **No data shown in popup:** Ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled. Confirm that the browser permissions include `webRequest` and `activeTab`.
- **Badge count remains empty:** Visit a website that triggers network connections. If issues persist, restart the browser or reinstall the extension.
- **Popup displays incorrect or stale data:** Refresh the page or close/reopen the popup to trigger updated data.

### Best Practices

- Always test on real websites instead of synthetic "ad blocker test" pages for accurate privacy exposure assessment.
- Use the popup alongside your content blocker to see exact connection outcomes.
- Regularly monitor third-party connection counts to better understand how browsing environments change.

### Performance Considerations

- uBO Scope processes network events efficiently but relies on browser APIs that may impose some limitations.
- The popup updates asynchronously in batches to avoid excessive UI updates.

### Alternative Approaches

- For advanced users, consider examining the background service logs or diving into uBO Scope's GitHub repository for deeper understanding or custom workflows.
