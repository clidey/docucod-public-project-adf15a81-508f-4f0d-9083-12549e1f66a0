# Using uBO Scope for Webpage Analysis

uBO Scope empowers you to investigate and understand the network activity of webpages in real-world scenarios. This guide helps you apply uBO Scope to uncover common advertising and tracking behaviors, assess how well your content blockers perform, and explore the network footprint of unknown or suspicious webpages. With practical walkthroughs and interpretation tips, you will gain the skills needed to audit your online browsing environment effectively.

---

## 1. What You Will Achieve

By following this guide, you will learn how to:

- Analyze the third-party connections initiated by any webpage.
- Differentiate between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked network requests.
- Audit your content blocking setup to confirm its effectiveness.
- Interpret the network footprint to identify potential privacy risks.
- Use example investigations to contextualize practical application.

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and active on your compatible browser.
- Basic familiarity with opening and interacting with the uBO Scope popup UI.
- An understanding of what "third-party connections" and "content blockers" are (see [Core Concepts & Terminology](/overview/introduction-core-concepts/core-terminology) for definitions).

### Expected Outcome

You will confidently interpret uBO Scope data to make informed decisions about your browsing privacy and content blocker performance.

### Estimated Time

Approximate time to apply the guide’s workflows: 15-30 minutes per investigative session, depending on complexity.

### Difficulty Level

Intermediate — assumes some knowledge of browser extensions and network requests.

## 2. Step-by-Step Webpage Analysis with uBO Scope

### Step 1: Initiate Network Monitoring on a Target Webpage

1. Open your browser and navigate to the webpage you want to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
3. The popup will display the top-level page's hostname and domain at the header.
4. Observe the summary showing the number of distinct third-party domains connected.

**Expected Result:** The popup shows categories of domains with counts sorted as `not blocked`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked`.

---

### Step 2: Understand Network Request Outcomes

- **Not Blocked:** Connections that succeeded or were allowed by your content blocker.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests blocked silently to prevent webpage breakage or detection.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly prevented from connecting.

Each category includes domains with the number of requests recorded.

**Decision Point:** Use this understanding to evaluate which third parties are active and whether they are potentially intrusive.

---

### Step 3: Identify Common Ad/Tracker Behaviors

1. Scan the `not blocked` and `stealth-blocked` lists for domains known to serve ads or trackers.
2. Use domain names and counts as clues about persistent connections or high request volumes.
3. Refer to reputable online sources or filter list documentation to identify suspicious entries.

**Example:** Seeing domains like `doubleclick.net` or `google-analytics.com` appearing multiple times indicates tracking.

---

### Step 4: Audit Content Blocker Performance

1. Compare the number of domains in each category.
2. A high count in `not blocked` could imply lesser privacy protection or legitimate CDN use.
3. Significant entries in `stealth-blocked` and `blocked` reflect active content blocking.

**Best Practice:** Focus on distinct third-party domains rather than sheer block counts, which can be misleading.

---

### Step 5: Research the Network Footprint of Unknown Pages

1. When visiting unfamiliar pages, watch for surprising third-party domains.
2. Notice if a page connects to many domains unrelated to its primary service.
3. Use uBO Scope popup data to understand the risks before trusting or bookmarking the site.

**Tip:** Look up unknown domains to check their reputation and trustworthiness.

---

### Step 6: Document and Repeat for Other Pages

1. Use the popup interface to record domain data.
2. Revisit and compare results across multiple websites and sessions.
3. Gain a pattern-based understanding of network behaviors tied to genres or providers.

---

## 3. Practical Example Walkthrough

Imagine you are analyzing a news website. After loading the site:

- The uBO Scope popup shows 20 third-party domains under `not blocked`, including many CDN entries.
- You spot `adservice.google.com` in the `stealth-blocked` section with multiple requests.
- The `blocked` section lists trackers like `tracking.example.com`.

### Interpretation:

- The site uses legitimate CDNs and content delivery services actively.
- Your content blocker is stealth-blocking Google's ad service requests to reduce tracking without breaking page layout.
- Some trackers are explicitly blocked, indicating your filter list is effective.

This insight helps you balance privacy with usability.

## 4. Tips and Common Pitfalls

- **Don’t Rely Solely on Block Counts:** The number of blocked requests does not equal better protection; focus on distinct unblocked domains.
- **Beware of Stealth Blocking:** Some content blockers block silently; these domains appear in `stealth-blocked` and can be critical to understanding exposure.
- **Use the Domain Counts:** High counts in domains often indicate persistent or important connections.
- **Refresh and Rescan:** Some resources load asynchronously; refreshing the page and revisiting the popup ensures accuracy.
- **Check for False Positives:** Not all third-party domains are harmful; some are CDNs serving essential content.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Popup Shows No Data:** Ensure you have an active tab loaded with a webpage and try reopening the popup.
- **Badge Count Not Updating:** uBO Scope updates badges asynchronously; wait a moment or reload the page.
- **Unexpected Domains Appear:** Cross-check domain names; some may belong to legitimate services.
- **No Stealth/Blocked Sections Visible:** This could mean no blocked requests or a problem with permissions. Verify extension permissions and reinstall if necessary.
