# Getting Started: Reveal All Remote Server Connections

Welcome to the first step in uncovering every network connection your browser’s webpages make—whether these connections succeed, get blocked openly, or are stealthily blocked without your page knowing. This guide walks you through installing the uBO Scope extension, opening its popup interface, and interpreting the network connection data it reveals.

## 1. What You Will Accomplish
- **Install uBO Scope** on supported browsers (Chromium-based, Firefox, Safari).
- **Open the uBO Scope popup panel** to review the active tab’s network connections.
- **Understand the connection summaries** including allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.

This hands-on introduction puts full network connection visibility at your fingertips.

---

## 2. Prerequisites
- You must have one of the following supported browsers installed:
  - Chromium-based browsers (Chrome 122+, Edge, Brave, etc.)
  - Mozilla Firefox 128+
  - Safari 18.5+
- Internet access to install the extension from your browser’s official extension marketplace.
- Basic familiarity with browser extensions and how to open extension popup panels.

<Tip>
Ensure your browser version meets the minimum requirement to avoid compatibility issues during installation.
</Tip>

## 3. Installation Steps

### For Chromium-Based Browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)
1. Open the [Chrome Web Store uBO Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
2. Click **Add to Chrome** and confirm installation.
3. After installation, uBO Scope’s icon will appear on the browser toolbar.

### For Mozilla Firefox
1. Go to the [Firefox Add-ons uBO Scope page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Approve permissions and finish the installation.
4. The uBO Scope icon will appear in the toolbar or overflow menu.

### For Safari
1. Open Safari Extensions (Safari > Settings/Preferences > Extensions).
2. Locate uBO Scope in the list and enable it.
3. The uBO Scope icon should appear in Safari’s toolbar.

<Note>
Permissions requested by uBO Scope include access to your active tab, storage, and monitoring of network requests (`webRequest`). These permissions are essential for the extension to reveal the true state of remote connections.
</Note>

## 4. Opening the Popup Interface

Once installed, you can open uBO Scope’s popup interface by:
- Clicking the **uBO Scope icon** in your browser’s toolbar.
- The popup panel loads and displays information about the current active tab’s network activity.

### What You See in the Popup Panel:
- **Top header:** Shows the tab’s full hostname and domain (using Unicode display for international domains).
- **Summary section:** Displays the total count of distinct third-party domains that successfully connected.
- **Three categorized lists:**
  - **Not blocked:** Domains with allowed connections.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains with requests that were silently blocked by a content blocker.
  - **Blocked:** Domains with requests explicitly blocked due to errors or prevented connections.

<Tip>
Refresh the popup by closing and reopening it if you navigate to a new page or want to update data.
</Tip>

## 5. Interpreting the Summary and Domain Lists

### Domain Counts
- The number displayed in the summary indicates how many **distinct third-party domains** made successful connections.
- A lower number typically means fewer external connections and potentially better privacy.

### Connection Outcomes Explained
- **Not Blocked:** The domains listed here successfully completed their network requests.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** These are network requests that were prevented by content blockers in a way that webpages cannot detect.
- **Blocked:** These domains correspond to network requests that failed or were blocked explicitly and are reported as errors.

Each listed domain is accompanied by a count which represents how many requests were made to that domain's hostnames.

<Info>
The extension uses the Public Suffix List to accurately group hostnames under their registered domains, including internationalized domain names, ensuring reliable domain classification.

## 7. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Check the Badge Icon:** The toolbar icon badge number reflects the count of distinct allowed third-party remote server domains.
- **Use uBO Scope for Privacy Audits:** Identify unwanted or unexpected third-party connections silently allowed.
- **Cross-check Blocked Domains:** Blocked and stealth domain lists help verify if your content blockers are effectively preventing requests.
- **Regularly Update the Extension:** Though uBO Scope is low-maintenance, ensure you have the latest version for best compatibility.

<Warning>
uBO Scope cannot report network requests initiated outside the browser’s webRequest API scope, such as some local network traffic or browser-native background processes.
</Warning>

## 8. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### The Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Is Empty
- Ensure that you have opened a webpage (not a browser internal page).
- Refresh the popup by closing and reopening after webpage load completes.
- Verify permissions are granted during installation.

### Badge Count Remains Blank
- The extension counts distinct third-party domains with allowed connections only.
- If your browsing session has no third-party connections, the badge will be empty.
- Confirm the extension’s permissions under your browser settings.

### The Extension Is Not Tracking WebSocket Connections (Browser-specific)
- Firefox supports WebSocket monitoring fully.
- Chromium-based browsers may support only HTTP/HTTPS; some protocols may be excluded.

### Extension Installation Fails
- Confirm your browser is a supported version (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Restart the browser and retry installation.
- For Safari, ensure you enable the extension in Safari’s extension preferences.
