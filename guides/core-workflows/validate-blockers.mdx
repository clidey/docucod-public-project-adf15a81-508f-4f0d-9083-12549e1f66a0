# Validate Content Blockers with uBO Scope

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you objectively compare and validate the effectiveness of various content blockers using uBO Scope. You will learn how to interpret connection data to verify which blockers successfully prevent or allow third-party network connections and debunk common misconceptions based on block counts alone.

### Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and activated in your compatible browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with the uBO Scope popup interface and the meaning of its connection outcome categories (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).
- At least one content blocker installed in your browser for comparison.

### Expected Outcome
By the end of this workflow, you will confidently use uBO Scope to:
- Identify the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected to per browser tab.
- Analyze which domains are allowed or blocked by different content blockers.
- Avoid pitfalls stemming from relying on block count badges alone to assess content blocker effectiveness.

### Time Estimate
10–15 minutes per content blocker tested.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate — Requires understanding of network connections and content blocker behaviors.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Install and Launch uBO Scope
- Ensure uBO Scope is properly installed and active in your browser.
- Locate the uBO Scope toolbar icon near the browser address bar.
- Click the icon to open the popup interface displaying connection data for the active tab.

#### Expected Result:
You see real-time counts of third-party domains, divided into 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' sections.

### 2. Navigate to a Test Website
- Open a webpage where you want to validate content blocking (preferably one with typical network activity).
- Refresh the page to generate network connections while uBO Scope monitors.

#### Expected Result:
The popup updates with fresh connection data reflecting resources requested during page load.

### 3. Review uBO Scope's Domain Outcome Counts
- In the popup, note the count of distinct domains shown under:
  - **Not Blocked**: connections allowed by your content blocker.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: connections blocked but hidden from the page (a stealth blocking mechanism).
  - **Blocked**: connections directly blocked and visible as such.

#### Decision Point:
Verify if the count of allowed third-party domains matches your privacy expectations or the blocker's claims.

### 4. Compare Across Different Content Blockers
- Disable your current content blocker and enable another one.
- Reload the webpage and observe changes in uBO Scope's reported domains.
- Repeat for each content blocker you want to validate.

#### Expected Result:
You obtain direct, empirical data on which third-party domains each blocker allows or blocks.

### 5. Interpret the Results Correctly
- Focus on the number of distinct **allowed** third-party domains. A **lower count means better blocking effectiveness**.
- Do **not** rely on the block badge count alone; a high block count sometimes correlates with more third-party connections allowed.
- Use the domain lists in the popup to identify which hosts are reaching your browser.

### 6. Use Domain Lists to Investigate Further
- Click or refer to the domain names in the popup interface to understand if the connections are expected or problematic.
- Use this information to fine-tune your content blocker’s filter lists if desired.

### 7. Confirm Blocking Consistency Over Multiple Pages
- Repeat the above steps on multiple sites with varied content.
- Track whether your content blocker consistently reduces allowed third-party domains.

### Verification Steps
- Verify badge counts reduce when a more effective blocker is enabled.
- Confirm the popup lists fewer allowed domains for stronger blockers.
- Confirm stealth-blocked domains appear when applicable.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Comparing Content Blockers on a News Website
- Open a news site.
- With Content Blocker A enabled, note the allowed domain count as 10.
- Switch to Content Blocker B and reload.
- Allowed domain count drops to 5, indicating more effective blocking.

This data confirms Content Blocker B better prevents third-party connections.

### Example 2: Debunking the Myth of Block Count Badges
- Content Blocker C shows a block badge of 100.
- Content Blocker D shows a block badge of 50.
- However, uBO Scope reveals Content Blocker D only allows 3 third-party domains, whereas Content Blocker C allows 8.

This example illustrates how a higher block count badge does not guarantee superior blocking.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **No data shown in popup:** Ensure uBO Scope is active and page is reloaded after blocker change.
- **Unexpected high allowed domain count:** Check if another extension or setting is interfering.
- **Popup stale or not updating:** Close and reopen the popup or refresh the page.

### Best Practices
- Always test multiple sites to get a comprehensive view.
- Use the domain list to identify false positives or necessary exceptions.
- Combine uBO Scope data with your content blocker’s logs if available.

### Performance Considerations
Using uBO Scope incurs minimal overhead as it listens passively to browser webRequest events.

### Alternative Approaches
There are no built-in APIs or alternative interfaces; rely on the popup interface for verification.
