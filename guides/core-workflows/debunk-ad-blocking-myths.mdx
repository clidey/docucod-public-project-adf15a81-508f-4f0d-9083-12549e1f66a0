# Debunking 'Ad Blocker Test' Results with uBO Scope

## Overview

Many users rely on 'ad blocker test' web pages to assess how well their content blockers perform. However, these tests can be misleading and often don't reflect real-world blocking behavior. This guide shows you how to use uBO Scope to critically assess such test results and understand what truly happens when browsing regular websites.

uBO Scope empowers you to:

- Detect the actual remote server connections your browser attempts.
- Understand the difference between fake test domains and real third-party domains.
- Avoid being misled by fabricated network requests designed for simplistic testing.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- Install uBO Scope in your browser. Refer to [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) or the guide '/getting-started/quick-setup/installing-extension' for detailed installation instructions.
- Familiarize yourself with how uBO Scope displays connection outcomes in its popup. See the guide [Understanding the Popup UI and Badge](https://yourdocs.example.com/guides/getting-started/understanding-the-popup).
- Ensure that your browser supports the `webRequest` API utilized by uBO Scope (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

## Expected Outcome

After completing this guide, you will:

- Recognize why ad blocker test pages do not provide reliable feedback.
- Use uBO Scope to observe real-world network request patterns.
- Interpret uBO Scope's allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domain outcomes with confidence.

## Time Estimate

Approximately 10 minutes.

## Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate

## Why Ad Blocker Test Pages Are Misleading

### Understanding the Myth

Many users see a high block count reported by test pages and assume their blocker is effective. Conversely, it might show little or no blocking, leading to doubts. But such metrics don't capture the bigger picture: a content blocker might stealthily allow legitimate connections to prevent breakage or detection.

### Key Issues with Ad Blocker Test Pages

- **Unrealistic Tests:** These sites request resources from domains that do not exist in the real browsing world.
- **No Stealth Detection:** Many blockers, including uBlock Origin, employ stealth techniques that these pages cannot detect.
- **Event Fabrication:** Test domains often simulate blocking scenarios without real network behavior, leading to false positives or negatives.

<Tip>
Avoid relying on "ad blocker test" pages as your sole measure of content blocker effectiveness. Use uBO Scope to get an accurate view of network connections during real browsing sessions.
</Tip>

## How uBO Scope Reveals the Truth

uBO Scope works by monitoring your browser's network requests via the `webRequest` API. It:

- Records every remote server connection attempted by web pages, regardless of the content blocker behavior.
- Differentiates between requests that were allowed, stealth-blocked (requests silently blocked without page breakage), and outright blocked.
- Displays a badge count indicating the number of distinct third-party domains accessed by the current tab.

This comprehensive approach shines light on the *real* connections, beyond what fake test environments mimic.

## Step-by-Step: Using uBO Scope to Debunk Test Page Results

<Steps>
<Step title="Open an 'Ad Blocker Test' Page">
Visit your favorite ad blocker test webpage that claims to show your content blocker's blocking efficiency.
</Step>

<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon near your browser's toolbar to open its popup.

Expected: The popup loads with a summary of domains involved in the current tab’s network activity.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Domains and Counts">
Look through the "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked" sections in the popup.

Expected: You'll see a realistic list of domains connected or blocked during the test page load.
</Step>

<Step title="Compare Test Page Results to uBO Scope">
Note discrepancies between the ad blocker test outcomes and uBO Scope’s real network data.

Decision: If the test page shows many blocked items but uBO Scope shows many allowed domains, understand that the test page is not reliable.
</Step>

<Step title="Perform Real-World Browsing Checks">
Visit real websites you trust and repeat viewing uBO Scope popup.

Expected: You will notice the number and nature of third-party domains differ significantly versus the ad blocker test page.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Results Confidently">
Use the popup data to assess your content blocker's effectiveness accurately.
Check how many third-party remote servers were truly blocked or allowed.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Example

Suppose you visit a typical news site with uBO Scope active. You open the popup and observe:

- 5 domains in "not blocked" (mostly content delivery networks and essential third-party services).
- 2 domains in "stealth-blocked" (blocked silently to preserve site functionality).
- 3 domains in "blocked" (explicitly blocked ad or tracking domains).

Meanwhile, an ad blocker test page may have shown a 100% block rate on dozens of test domains, which are irrelevant in real use. uBO Scope's data reflects what is meaningful and actually happening.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope Data Interpretation">
<Accordion title="I see no data or popup says 'NO DATA'">
- Ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Confirm you are viewing the popup for the active tab that you visited.
- Reload the target page to trigger network request logging.
- Confirm your browser supports necessary APIs (`webRequest`).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge count is zero but I see ads or trackers">
- Some connections may occur outside the webRequest API scope.
- Some network requests may be cached or pre-loaded before uBO Scope activates.

Reload the page to reset counts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I don't understand domain groupings in the popup">
- Domains are grouped per their exact domain names, normalized using the Public Suffix List (PSL).
- This avoids counting subdomains separately unless they belong to distinct registrable domains.

See the guide on [Interpreting Request Details](https://yourdocs.example.com/guides/advanced-tips/interpreting-request-details).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Remember, uBO Scope counts distinct domains, not total requests. Lower badge number means fewer third-party connections, which typically translates to better privacy.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to monitor actual network activity rather than relying on test pages.
- Perform audits on real websites you trust to understand typical connection patterns.
- Familiarize yourself with "allowed", "blocked", and "stealth-blocked" categories for insightful interpretation.
- If you are a filter list maintainer, leverage uBO Scope's transparency to optimize your rules.
