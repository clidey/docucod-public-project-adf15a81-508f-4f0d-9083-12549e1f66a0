# Analyzing Third-Party Connections with uBO Scope

Discover how to interpret uBO Scope's popup domain lists—allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked—to gain clear insights into which third-party domains your browser contacts while browsing. This guide takes you through a real-world browsing example with actionable steps to visualize and understand third-party connections, helping you make sense of privacy and tracking implications.

---

## 1. Understanding the Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked Domains

When you open the uBO Scope popup for an active tab, it categorizes remote servers contacted during your browsing session into three distinct groups:

- **Allowed Domains**: Domains from which network requests were successful and not blocked by your content blocker or network settings.
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains**: Domains related to network requests that were redirected or intercepted stealthily (often blocked before the request fully initiated), typically by your blocker.
- **Blocked Domains**: Domains explicitly blocked as errors, where network requests failed due to content blocking or DNS-level restrictions.

Each category helps you understand the network activity landscape and highlights third-party connections impacting privacy.

<Info>
Remember, the number shown on the toolbar badge reflects the count of unique allowed third-party domains contacted for that tab. A lower badge count usually indicates fewer third-party connections.

## 2. Step-by-Step: Analyzing Connections for a Website Visit

Follow this workflow to analyze third-party connections using uBO Scope’s popup after visiting a new webpage.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Permissions granted for network and tab access.
- The webpage to analyze is loaded in an active tab.

### Time Estimate
~3-5 minutes per site analysis.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner

---

### Step 1: Visit the Website

Navigate to any website of interest in your browser window.


### Step 2: Observe the Toolbar Badge

Check the uBO Scope icon badge near your browser’s address bar. The number displayed indicates the total distinct third-party domains contacted and allowed.


### Step 3: Open the uBO Scope Popup

Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup window displaying the breakdown of connections for the active tab.


### Step 4: Review the Domain Lists

Inside the popup, review each section:

- **Not Blocked**: Shows allowed domains with how many times each was contacted.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Lists domains involved in redirected or stealth-blocked connections.
- **Blocked**: Lists domains from which connection attempts failed.

Each domain line includes a count badge showing the number of requests related to that domain.


### Step 5: Interpret the Data

- Domains in "Not Blocked" represent third-parties your browser actually contacted successfully.
- Domains in "Stealth-Blocked" show entries that were silently blocked or redirected, relevant for understanding tracker evasion.
- Domains in "Blocked" highlight explicit failures, useful to know which third parties didn’t connect due to blocking.

Compare these lists to gauge the website's third-party footprint and your content blocker's effectiveness.


### Step 6: Assess Privacy and Tracking Implications

- Multiple allowed domains might mean many third-party services are active, which could raise privacy concerns.
- A high stealth-blocked or blocked domain count suggests strong blocking, but remember this does not always increase privacy if many allowed domains remain.

## 3. Real-World Example: Analyzing ExampleSite.com

Imagine you visit `https://examplesite.com`:

1. You load the site and notice the uBO Scope badge shows "5".
2. Opening the popup reveals:
   - Allowed Domains: `cdn.examplesite.com`, `analytics.thirdparty.com`, `fonts.examplecdn.net`, etc.
   - Stealth-Blocked Domains: `tracker.adsprovider.com`.
   - Blocked Domains: `malicious.domain.fake`.

You realize the site loads fonts and content from a few CDNs (allowed), attempts tracking from a known ads provider (stealth-blocked), and failed connections to suspicious domains (blocked).

This detailed view helps you understand what third-party connections are active or blocked on this webpage.

## 4. Tips for Effective Connection Analysis

- **Reload Pages**: Reload the webpage to update the popup data and badge counts.
- **Use Multiple Sites**: Compare different sites to develop a baseline of common allowed domains versus trackers.
- **Observe Patterns**: Frequent stealth-blocked domains might indicate ads or trackers your blocker is actively preventing.
- **Beware of False Positives**: Not all third-party connections are trackers; sometimes legitimate content and CDN providers appear.


---

## 5. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Empty or No Data in Popup**: Ensure the page is fully loaded and uBO Scope has permission to access network requests.
- **Badge Count Mismatch**: The badge reflects allowed domains; stealth-blocked and blocked do not add to this count.
- **Relying Solely on Block Counts**: Remember, a higher block count may indicate more network requests and potentially more tracking attempts, not better blocking.

<Warning>
If you encounter issues with no data appearing, verify that the extension has the needed host permissions and your browser version is supported.
</Warning>

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Problem: No Domains Listed in Popup
- Confirm uBO Scope is installed and active.
- Reload the tab and re-open the popup.
- Check extension permissions for "webRequest" and "storage".
- Ensure you navigated to a web page with network activity.

### Problem: Badge Not Updating
- Wait a few seconds; updates happen shortly after requests complete.
- Reload the page.
- Restart your browser to clear issues.

### Problem: Unexpected Domains in Allowed List
- Use reversible punycode conversion if domains look encoded.
- Understand some domains are necessary CDNs or essential service domains.
