# Analyzing Third-Party Connections on a Website

Discovering how a website interacts with remote servers is crucial to assess your privacy risks and understand its network behavior. uBO Scope empowers you to reveal every third-party connection attempt—whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked—directly from your browser.

This guide walks you through using uBO Scope’s popup interface and toolbar badge count, links these insights concretely to real browsing activity, and equips you to identify patterns in third-party traffic for informed privacy decisions.

---

## 1. Understanding the Workflow

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
- Reveal *all* third-party servers that a website tries to connect to during your browsing session.
- Interpret connection outcomes categorized as **Allowed**, **Stealth Blocked**, and **Blocked**.
- Use uBO Scope’s badge count as a meaningful indicator of third-party network activity.
- Recognize common patterns of third-party connections to differentiate benign resources from privacy risks.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled in a supported browser (Chromium, Firefox, Safari).
- Browsing a website tab you want to analyze.
- Basic familiarity with browsing network activity through browser extensions.

### Expected Outcome
- A clear, categorized list of third-party domains connected or blocked by uBO Scope.
- Understand the significance of badge counts and per-domain connection frequencies.
- Practical insight into how websites interact with external servers, enhancing your ability to protect your privacy.

### Time Estimate
About 5-10 minutes to analyze a website and become comfortable with the popup UI and interpretation.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate – no technical knowledge required, but good observation is beneficial.

## 2. Step-by-Step Analysis Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Navigate to the Website You Want to Analyze">
Open the browser tab for the website whose third-party connections you wish to inspect. Ensure the page is fully loaded, as network activity is detected during browsing.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Click the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon">
Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup panel. This opens a snapshot of third-party connections reported for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Read the Badge Count on the Toolbar Icon">
Observe the number displayed on the toolbar icon badge. This number represents the count of distinct third-party domains for which network requests were allowed (connected).

- A **higher count** means the page connects to more distinct servers.
- A **lower count** is generally preferable from a privacy standpoint.

Use this as a quick privacy risk indicator.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: Examine the Hostname Heading">
At the top of the popup, you see the website's hostname and domain:

- The **right part** shows the registered domain of the active tab.
- The **left part** shows the subdomain (if any).

This helps confirm you’re analyzing the correct site.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 5: Review the Connection Outcome Sections">
The main content area divides third-party connections into three categories:

### Allowed (Not Blocked)
- Domains listed here have network requests that succeeded.
- These connections mean resources were loaded or accessed.

### Stealth-Blocked
- Connections that were redirected or altered stealthily by content blockers.
- These don’t always show as outright blocked but are effectively restricted.

### Blocked
- Domains where network requests failed or were fully blocked.
- Usually indicates effective blocking by browser settings or extensions.

Within each section, domains are listed with a count badge indicating the number of requests made to that domain.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 6: Interpret Domain Frequency Counts">
Pay attention to the *count badges* beside each domain:

- High counts for a domain can indicate heavy use (e.g., CDN providers).
- Spot unexpected or unfamiliar domains with counts that suggest persistent connections.

This insight helps pinpoint domains that contribute most to your third-party exposure.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 7: Analyze Patterns and Make Privacy Decisions">
Use the connection categories and counts to understand the website’s network behavior:

- If many domains are allowed, assess if they are trustworthy or typical (e.g., major CDNs).
- If stealth-blocked or blocked domains are numerous, this may indicate aggressive content blocking.
- Large numbers of third-party connections might indicate greater privacy risk.

Based on this, you can decide if you want to adjust blocking settings or use the data to inform broader blocking rules.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Practical Example

Suppose you visit a news website and run uBO Scope:

- **Badge count shows 15**: The site connects successfully to 15 unique third-party domains.
- Under **Allowed**, you notice domains like `cdn.fastly.net` or `google-analytics.com` with high counts.
- The **Stealth-blocked** section lists a few tracking domains, indicating some blocking activity.
- **Blocked** domains include some ad-related domains you recognize.

From this, you learn that while some trackers are stealth-blocked and ads mostly blocked, the site still connects to many analytics and CDN providers, highlighting your exposure to those third parties.

## 4. Tips & Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Tips & Pitfalls">
<Accordion title="Tip: Use Badge Count as Privacy Estimate">
The badge count represents distinct third-party domains with allowed connections. Use it as a proxy for how many external servers the website reaches. Fewer allowed domains generally mean better privacy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tip: Watch for Unfamiliar Domains">
Investigate unknown domains, especially in the allowed list, which could be tracking or advertising services. This practice helps you identify & reduce unwanted data exposure.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Pitfall: Not All Requests Are Equal">
A high request count to benign domains (e.g., cloud provider CDNs) is less risky than fewer requests to tracking servers. Focus on domain identity over request volume alone.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Pitfall: Badge Count Does Not Show Blocked Domains">
The toolbar badge only counts allowed domains. For full context, always open the popup to review stealth-blocked and blocked domains too.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tip: Refresh Page to See Updated Results">
Network requests are logged per page load. Reload the tab and re-open the popup to get current data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tip: Use Unicode Domain Names for Clarity">
uBO Scope converts punycode to Unicode display names for you, making internationalized domain names easier to recognize.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists
- Ensure you have an active tab with a valid webpage loaded.
- The extension requires permissions to access web requests; verify installation and permissions.
- Reload the tab and open the popup again to refresh the data.

### Badge Count Does Not Update
- Some browser permissions or restrictions may prevent real-time updates.
- Try restarting the browser.
- Check for extension conflicts or update to the latest version.

### Connection Outcomes Seem Inaccurate
- uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API which some browsers limit in certain modes or contexts.
- Confirm you are testing in a supported, standard browsing environment (not incognito/private mode unless extension is enabled there).

For detailed troubleshooting, see the 'Troubleshooting Installation & Setup' guide.

This structure helps you quickly pinpoint domain connection categories and volumes.

## How to Interpret the Toolbar Badge

The number on the extension icon badge represents the number of *distinct domains* with allowed connections for the current tab:

- If it reads `0`, no allowed third-party connections were detected.
- Counts above zero indicate the extent of external server contact.

This count is a practical privacy metric that summarizes third-party exposure at a glance.
