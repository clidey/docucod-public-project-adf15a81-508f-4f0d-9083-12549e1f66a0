# Analyzing Third-Party Connections

## Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
uBO Scope's core value lies in revealing the network footprint of the browsing session within each browser tab. This guide leads you through understanding how to interpret the badge counts shown on the toolbar and the classification of third-party domains in the popup panel. You’ll learn how to distinguish between desirable connections (often necessary resources or CDNs) and unnecessary or potentially privacy-invasive third-party connections.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and properly set up in your browser.
- Browsing activity generating network connection data.
- Familiarity with the uBO Scope popup panel to view connection categorizations.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will become proficient at:
- Interpreting the badge count representing unique third-party domains connected per tab.
- Understanding domain classification into allowed (fetched), blocked, and stealth-blocked.
- Tracking which third-party servers have observed your traffic.
- Identifying possibly unwanted or unnecessary connections from real-world browsing.

### Estimated Time
10–15 minutes to review and practice with actual browsing sessions.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate — designed for any user interested in network transparency.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Understand the Badge Count on the Toolbar Icon

- The number displayed on uBO Scope's toolbar icon badge corresponds to the **count of distinct third-party domains for which the browser established successful connections** during the current tab's browsing session.
- A **lower badge count is preferred**, indicating fewer external servers were contacted.

#### What Counts Toward This Number?
- Unique domains of third-party servers that delivered resources (images, scripts, etc.) or otherwise responded successfully.
- Only domains that didn’t get blocked or failed count here.

#### What Does Not Affect the Badge?
- Blocked domains where requests were prevented.
- Domains related to stealth-blocked requests (requests that redirected or failed silently).

<Tip>
If you see a high badge count, it means many distinct third-party domains loaded resources. This may be normal for complex sites but also signals a bigger external network footprint to consider.
</Tip>

### 2. Access the Popup Panel for Detailed Domain Data

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon while on a webpage to open the popup panel.
- The panel displays the current browsing tab’s domain split into three key categories:

| Category          | Meaning                                   | What It Shows                               |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked       | Allowed domains with successful connections | Domains that delivered resources or data  |
| Stealth-Blocked   | Redirected or silently handled connections | Domains that attempted connections but got stealth-blocked |
| Blocked           | Failed or prevented connections           | Domains where network requests were blocked |

### 3. Interpret Domain Classifications

- Domains are grouped by public suffix-enabled "domain" level (e.g., `example.com`).
- These domains come from real network events and are tallied alongside counts of connections observed.

#### Allowed Domains
- These are the domains that successfully served resources or communicated with the tab.
- Often include content delivery networks (CDNs) or necessary services.
- Legitimate domains here are generally expected; verify if you recognize them or trust their origins.

#### Stealth-Blocked Domains
- Requests that tried redirecting or otherwise were implicitly blocked without user-visible failure.
- These events help uncover hidden trackers or unwanted redirects.

#### Blocked Domains
- Explicitly blocked domain connections, indicating content blocking took effect.
- Useful to verify your content blocking configuration and effectiveness.

### 4. Identify Desirable vs. Unnecessary Connections Using Real-World Examples

- Compare the counted domains to the main browsing site’s domain. Third-party domains (not your visited domain’s) may be trackers or ads.
- Examples:
  - A news site loading images from a well-known CDN would show that CDN domain under Not Blocked — usually acceptable.
  - Multiple advertising or analytics domains — these may appear in stealth-blocked or blocked if you have filters active.
  - Unexpected or unknown domains appearing here merit investigation.

<Tip>
Regularly review the Not Blocked list to spot new third parties introduced by sites and consider if they align with your privacy preferences.
</Tip>

### 5. Use the Domain Counts for Context

- The count badges next to each domain show how many distinct requests were made for resources from that domain.
- High counts for a domain may indicate heavy dependency or intensive tracking.

### 6. Refresh Data and Confirm Accuracy

- The badge and popup data update as network requests are made.
- Reload the tab or revisit pages to ensure the list reflects current browsing connections.

<Check>
When the popup accurately lists domains, the badge count matches the number of Not Blocked domains. This alignment is a good success indicator for accurate monitoring.
</Check>

## Examples & Scenarios

### Example: News Website Browsing

- Load a well-known news site.
- Badge might show 4 third-party connections.
- Popup’s Not Blocked section lists domains such as:
  - cdn.newswebsite.com
  - analytics.service.com
- Stealth-blocked might show some tracking domains silently prevented.
- Blocked section empty or listing known ad domains.

### Example: Video Streaming Site

- Badge count could be higher (e.g., 10+).
- Not Blocked shows multiple CDN providers.
- Blocked includes ad networks.
- Use this information to understand your browsing surface.

### Interpreting Counts

- A count of “5” means exactly 5 distinct third-party domains delivered resources.
- Even if thousands of requests happened, only unique domains are counted.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Badge Count Missing or Not Updating:** Verify the extension has appropriate permissions and the browser supports the webRequest API fully.
- **Popup Empty or Showing "NO DATA":** Ensure you have active network requests in the current tab, and try refreshing the tab.

### Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker for complementary insights.
- If unfamiliar domains appear frequently in Not Blocked, consider adjusting your filtering rules.
- Regularly clear browser data to keep session monitoring fresh.

### Performance Considerations

- uBO Scope's data gathering is efficient and runs in the background without significant browser impact.
- Heavy browsing activity with many requests might introduce slight delays in badge updates (typically under a second).

### Alternative Approaches

- Explore the Stealth-Blocked category to identify stealth trackers invisible to many other blockers.
- Cross-reference domain names online to check their reputation or organizational ownership.
