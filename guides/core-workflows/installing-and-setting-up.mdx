# Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope

## Overview

This guide walks you through installing uBO Scope on supported browsers—Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Edge, Brave), Mozilla Firefox, and Safari—and performing the initial setup to ensure the extension functions correctly. You will learn how to add the extension from official stores, verify its installation, complete the initial configuration, and confirm the extension is actively monitoring your browser's network connections.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, verify the following:

- **Supported Browsers and Versions:**
  - Chromium browsers (minimum version 122)
  - Firefox (minimum version 128)
  - Safari (minimum version 18.5)
- **Required Permissions:** The extension needs `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` permissions for full network monitoring.
- **Network Access:** Ensure your browser is allowed to access network requests as this extension monitors all remote server connections.

For detailed requirements, see [Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/prerequisites-requirements).

3. Click **Add to Firefox**.
4. Confirm by clicking **Add** when prompted.

## Step 2: Initial Configuration

Once uBO Scope is installed, some configuration is necessary to allow the extension to monitor your network connections effectively.

1. **Grant Permissions:** During installation, you will be prompted to grant network and tab access permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`). Approve these permissions to ensure full functionality.

2. **First Launch:** Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup panel. This panel provides an overview of network connections per active tab.

3. **Verify Active Monitoring:** The badge on the toolbar icon shows a count of distinct third-party domains connected. Initially, this may be zero or low as you begin browsing.

4. **Permission Settings Check:** If the extension’s popup panel shows 'NO DATA' or appears inactive, check browser extension settings to confirm that all required permissions are enabled.

For detailed guidance on permissions and configuration options, see [Initial Configuration & Permissions](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/initial-configuration).

## Step 3: Confirm uBO Scope is Working Correctly

After installation and initial setup, ensure uBO Scope is actively monitoring:

1. Open a few websites, especially those with diverse content and third-party resources.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
3. Check the domains listed under the categories **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
4. Confirm the badge count updates to reflect distinct allowed third-party remote servers.

### Example Validation:
- Visit a popular news or social media site.
- Open uBO Scope popup.
- Observe a non-zero badge count indicating detected distinct third-party domains.

If you see data in the popup and the badge count updates, uBO Scope is functioning correctly.

For quick validation instructions, refer to [Quick Validation: Is uBO Scope Working?](/getting-started/using-and-validating/validating-extension).

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Extension Not Monitoring Connections:** Ensure all permissions were accepted. Revisit browser extension settings and re-enable permissions if needed.
- **No Badge Count or Popup Data:** Try refreshing tabs or restarting the browser. Some browsers require restart after extension installation.
- **Conflicts with Other Extensions:** uBO Scope works independently but can coexist with other blockers. If issues arise, try disabling other extensions temporarily.
- **Browser Version Compatibility:** If the extension fails to install or behaves unexpectedly, verify your browser version meets minimum requirements.

Consult [Troubleshooting Installation & First Run](/getting-started/using-and-validating/troubleshooting-setup) for comprehensive troubleshooting guidance.

## Additional Tips & Best Practices

- Keep your browser updated for best extension compatibility and security.
- Use uBO Scope alongside content blockers to get transparency on connections beyond blocked requests.
- Regularly check the popup panel to monitor third-party connections to understand your web activity.

## Summary

Installing and setting up uBO Scope efficiently equips you with a transparent view of your browser’s network connections. By following this guide, you will install the extension from your browser’s official store, configure required permissions, and verify that the extension actively monitors and reports network connections with real-time badge and popup insights.
