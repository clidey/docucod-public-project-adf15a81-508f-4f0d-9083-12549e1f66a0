# Debunking Badge Count Myths

Learn why raw block and badge counts can mislead your understanding of content blocking effectiveness, and how uBO Scope’s unique approach provides a reliable view of your true privacy exposure.

---

## 1. Understanding the Badge Count

uBO Scope’s toolbar badge displays the number of **distinct third-party remote servers** your browser successfully connects to on the active webpage. This count represents the **unique domains** from which resources are loaded and is a direct indicator of your privacy exposure — fewer unique remote servers mean reduced tracking surface.

### Why This Matters

- **Not all blocks are equal:** Simply counting blocked requests or domains does not reveal how many unique third parties your browser contacted successfully.
- **True privacy depends on connections allowed:** Even if many requests are blocked, if your browser connects to many unique domains, your privacy exposure is higher.


## 2. Common Misconceptions About Block Counts

### Myth 1: "A Higher Block Count Means Better Blocking"

Many assume that an extension showing a higher number of blocked requests or domains provides superior protection. This is false because:

- Blocking many individual requests to the same third-party domain does **not** reduce the number of unique third-party connections.
- A high block count could mean that the content blocker misses some connections or triggers many redundant blocks, but still allows connections to many unique third parties.

### Myth 2: "Ad Blocker Test Pages Accurately Reflect Blocking Performance"

Popular ad blocker test pages are commonly used as benchmarks but are misleading:

- They often create **artificial network requests** to domains not commonly used in real browsing scenarios.
- Many content blockers use stealth blocking techniques to hide their presence from such test pages.
- Test page results do not reflect real-world browsing privacy or filtering efficiency.


## 3. How uBO Scope Provides a Better Measurement

uBO Scope bypasses these pitfalls by reporting the **true number of distinct third-party servers contacted**, regardless of what content blocker or DNS filter is active. It uses the browser's `webRequest` API to observe network requests and categorizes domains as:

- **Allowed (not blocked):** Connections that succeeded.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that failed silently with redirected or stealth techniques.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked or that encountered errors.

This approach ensures you see the **actual privacy exposure** by focusing on **distinct third-party connections**, not just the number of blocked requests.


## 4. Practical User Scenarios

To make these concepts actionable, consider the following:

### Scenario: Comparing Two Content Blockers

- Blocker A shows 200 blocked requests but has 50 unique third-party domains allowed.
- Blocker B shows 100 blocked requests but has 80 unique third-party domains allowed.

uBO Scope reveals that despite Blocker A blocking more requests, Blocker B actually allows more unique third-party connections, meaning **Blocker A provides better privacy in this case.**

### Scenario: Evaluating Your Browsing Privacy

By regularly checking uBO Scope's badge and popup dashboard, you can:

- Monitor how many distinct third-party servers each visited page connects to.
- Identify if your content blocker configuration effectively limits unique connections.
- Detect potential privacy leaks not obvious from block counts alone.


## 5. Step-by-Step Guide to Using uBO Scope for Accurate Privacy Insight

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup dashboard that shows detailed domain connection data for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Badge Count">
Observe the badge number on the toolbar. This number represents unique third-party domains contacted by the current webpage.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze Domain Outcomes">
In the popup, examine the categories:
- **Not Blocked:** Domains your browser connected to.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were silently blocked.
- **Blocked:** Domains with failed requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Real Privacy Exposure">
Focus on the size of the “not blocked” list to understand how much the page exposes your browser to third parties.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 6. Best Practices

- **Ignore raw block counts alone:** Use the badge count in uBO Scope as your primary metric.
- **Regularly check varied sites:** Measure privacy exposure not just on test pages but on everyday browsing to get realistic insights.
- **Be cautious with stealth-blocked domains:** These indicate blocking that tries to go undetected but still reflects privacy exposure.


## 7. Troubleshooting Common Misinterpretations

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Badge Count Myths">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
Ensure uBO Scope is installed and active. Refresh the webpage and open the popup to verify fresh data. Missing badge counts often result from inactive sessions or disabled permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="High Block Count but Still High Badge Number">
Understand that blocking many requests does not prevent connecting to distinct domains. Verify with uBO Scope’s domain lists to see the actual distinct third parties.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mismatch Between Ad Blocker Test Pages and uBO Scope Reporting">
Trust uBO Scope’s real traffic analysis over synthetic test pages, as the latter can be easily gamed or fail to represent real browsing scenarios.
