# Making Sense of the Toolbar Badge Count

Understanding the small number displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon is key to effectively monitoring your online privacy. This guide breaks down what the badge count means, why a lower number signals better privacy, and how it reflects distinct third-party remote servers detected during your browsing.

---

## 1. What the Toolbar Badge Represents

- **Badge Number Meaning:** The badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains with which your browser has successfully connected or attempted to connect on the current browser tab.
- **Third-Party Domains:** These are remote servers different from the main page's domain, typically including advertisers, content delivery networks (CDNs), trackers, and other external services.
- **Real-Time Indicator:** The badge updates dynamically as network requests occur, providing you with live feedback on the range of external domains involved in loading a webpage.

<Tip>
The badge is not a count of blocked requests, but rather the *number of distinct allowed third-party connections*. This subtle but critical distinction helps you understand your actual privacy exposure.
</Tip>

## 2. Why a Lower Badge Count Is Preferable

- **Privacy Implications:** Fewer connected third parties mean less data shared across multiple domains, reducing potential privacy leaks.
- **Browser Efficiency:** Connecting to fewer remote domains can improve page load speed and reduce background network activity.
- **Content Blockers Context:** Even if a content blocker reports blocked requests, what truly matters is how many distinct third-party domains your browser *did* connect to and fetch resources from.

<Warning>
Do not assume that a higher badge number indicates better blocking. It actually signals that more third-party connections were made, which might mean less effective privacy protection.
</Warning>

## 3. How Badge Counts Relate to Tab Network Activity

### User Browsing Session Flow

1. When you open or navigate a tab, uBO Scope’s background script starts tracking network requests.
2. For every request, it determines the request’s domain and categorizes it as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
3. It maintains counts of distinct domains in each category and updates the badge with the current allowed count.
4. When a tab is closed, session data linked to that tab is cleared to keep counts accurate and relevant.

### Badge Update Mechanics

- The badge count shown on the toolbar corresponds to the **number of unique allowed third-party domains** detected for that specific tab.
- It excludes first-party domains (the main site you are visiting) and domains that were only stealth-blocked or blocked.
- Updates occur shortly after network request events conclude, ensuring you see a close-to-real-time value.

## 4. Monitoring Your Privacy Footprint with the Badge

- **Quick Visual Feedback:** At any point, glance at the badge to assess how many distinct third-party entities a webpage is contacting.
- **Identify Websites with Heavy Third-Party Use:** High badge counts usually indicate many external domains involved, a common trait of ads-heavy or tracker-heavy websites.
- **Compare Across Sites:** Use the badge count to compare how different sites load resources and expose you to third parties.

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Regularly Monitor Badge Counts:** When visiting new or sensitive sites, watch the badge to get clues on tracking or resource loading behaviour.
- **Use in Combination with the Popup:** For deeper insight, open the uBO Scope popup window to see detailed lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains per tab.
- **Don’t Use Badge Count Alone:** Combine badge count insights with other privacy tools, site reputation checks, and your own browsing habits for comprehensive protection.

<Note>
The badge count reflects network activity as reported by the browser’s webRequest API. Network requests invisible to this API (e.g., DNS-level blocking or other OS-level interceptions) are not counted.
</Note>

## 6. Common Questions and Troubleshooting

### Q: Why does the badge sometimes show zero?
- This means no third-party connections have been allowed yet or the page has not loaded any external resources.
- Sometimes it occurs on newly opened blank tabs or pages fully cached without external requests.

### Q: Why does the badge not increase when a request is blocked?
- The badge counts only allowed third-party domains. Blocked or stealth-blocked domains do not increase the badge count.

### Q: The badge count seems inconsistent across reloads.
- Network activity varies by page content, ads served, and dynamic resources. Changes in content blockers or network conditions can also impact counts.

### Q: My badge count is high on what seems a simple site.
- Some sites rely heavily on third-party CDNs or trackers that may inflate the count. Use the popup to explore which domains are involved.

## 7. Summary

- The toolbar badge number reflects the count of unique allowed third-party domains contacted by your browser tab.
- Lower badge counts signal fewer external connections and generally better privacy.
- The count updates dynamically with your browsing activity and offers an at-a-glance privacy indicator.
- Combine badge monitoring with the detailed popup interface for best results.
