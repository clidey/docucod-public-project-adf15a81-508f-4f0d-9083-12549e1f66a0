# Using uBO Scope as a Tool for Filter List Maintenance

## Overview

This guide helps filter list maintainers leverage uBO Scope to identify complicated third-party behaviors, validate the effectiveness of blocking rules, and collect detailed evidence—all in environments where direct developer tools or deeper browser inspection might be limited or unavailable.

### What You Will Achieve
- Efficiently identify third-party domains related to tracking or advertising
- Assess which network connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked
- Collect actionable data to refine filter lists and improve blocking rules

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and activated in a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Basic understanding of content blocker terminology: allowed, blocked, stealth
- Target webpage loaded within an active browser tab

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15 to 30 minutes to complete initial inspection and gather data

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate — best suited for filter list developers or privacy researchers familiar with blocking rules and network request inspection

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope on the Target Webpage
1. Visit the webpage you want to inspect.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
3. The uBO Scope popup panel will open, displaying the domain currently inspected (top-level site) and counts of connected third-party domains.

**Outcome:** You see the number of third-party remote servers contacted from this tab, segmented by:
- **Not blocked:** Domains that successfully loaded resources
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where requests were silently blocked or redirected
- **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked with error results


### Step 2: Analyze Domain Connection Lists
- Each category shows domains along with the count of distinct connection hostnames observed during page load.
- Domain names are displayed in decoded Unicode for clarity.

**Action:** Sort through these lists to identify any suspicious or unexpected third-party domains.

**Tip:** Pay special attention to 'stealth-blocked' domains; these indicate attempts that were silently prevented but provide clues about new or unhandled tracking vectors.

### Step 3: Cross-Validate Blocking Effectiveness
1. Identify domains in the 'allowed' category that might need blocking.
2. Identify domains in 'stealth' or 'blocked' to verify existing filter list coverage.
3. Note counts to gauge the frequency and spread of connections per domain.

**Outcome:** Confirm that important trackers or advertisers are effectively blocked or stealth-blocked, and that no domains slip through unnoticed.

### Step 4: Gather Evidence for Filter List Updates
- Use the domain and count data as a foundation for creating or refining blocking rules.
- Since uBO Scope works independently of browser devtools, it is practical on devices where such developer access is restricted.

**Tip:** Document the findings by copying domain lists or taking snapshots of the popup. This data aids collaboration within filter list communities.

### Step 5: Repeat Testing After Filter Adjustments
- Reload the webpage after filter list tweaks.
- Open uBO Scope again to verify that changes reduce allowed connections from targeted domains.

**Outcome:** Reduction in 'allowed' domain counts and shifts toward more stealth or blocked outcomes indicate successful filter improvement.

## Practical Example

Suppose you maintain a filter list targeting ad networks on a news website:

1. Visit the news website with uBO Scope active.
2. Inspect the 'allowed' list—notice domains such as `tracker.adnet.com` still appear.
3. Check the 'stealth' section and find domains like `analytics.newtracker.net` occasionally blocked without error.
4. Add or refine filter rules to block `*.adnet.com` and `*.newtracker.net`.
5. Reload and verify via uBO Scope popup that these domains move to 'blocked' or 'stealth'.

This iterative process ensures your filter list stays current and effective.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Use Unicode Domain Names:** uBO Scope shows punycode-decoded domain names for easier recognition.
- **Focus on Domain Level:** Blocking should target domains rather than individual hostnames for broad coverage.
- **Watch the Silent Blockers:** Stealth-blocked entries provide hints about evasive scripts or trackers.
- **Leverage Environments with Limited Tools:** Use uBO Scope on devices where browser developer tools may be disabled or inaccessible.
- **Keep Public Suffix List Updated:** uBO Scope depends on the public suffix list for accurate domain grouping; ensure your extension refreshes this data periodically.

## Common Pitfalls

<Warning>
- Misinterpreting the badge count: It reflects the number of *distinct third-party domains allowed*, not total requests or blocked counts.
- Overblocking legitimate CDN domains can break site functionality.
- Assuming all stealth-blocked domains are malicious—these may include necessary redirects.
- Neglecting to test after updating filter lists can lead to unnoticed regressions.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Filter List Maintenance with uBO Scope">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or 'NO DATA'">
- Ensure the extension is enabled and has permissions for current webpages.
- Reload the tab to trigger fresh data capture.
- Confirm the active tab is correctly detected in uBO Scope.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Counts Seem Unrealistically Low or High">
- Verify you are viewing the popup on the correct tab.
- Consider that some network requests may occur after initial page load, requiring page interaction or wait time.
- Stealth or blocked domain counts may vary depending on other active content blockers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth Blocked Domains Are Empty">
- This may indicate your current content blocker setup does not use stealth blocks.
- Test with different filter lists or blocker settings for contrasting results.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Filtering Does Not Seem to Affect uBO Scope Results">
- Check if the changed filter list is active and applied in your main content blocker.
- Remember uBO Scope passively reports network requests and outcomes; some requests may bypass certain APIs.
