## Step 2: Confirm Extension Activation

1. After installation, locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser’s toolbar.
2. Pin it to your toolbar if your browser supports a pinning feature (Chrome & Firefox) for quick access.
3. Hover over the icon to confirm it shows the tooltip ‘uBO Scope’. This confirms the extension is active.

<Check>
If the icon does not appear:
- Restart your browser.
- Check the browser’s extensions page to ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
- Consult the Troubleshooting section at the end of this guide.
</Check>

## Step 3: Basic Configuration

uBO Scope works effectively with minimal or no user configuration after installation. The core setup happens automatically.

### What happens under the hood:
- The extension requests essential permissions to monitor network requests (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).
- It initializes with a public suffix list to determine domain boundaries.
- Enables real-time tracking of third-party remote server connections in your browsing sessions.

### What you should do:
- There is no mandatory manual configuration needed.
- Simply ensure uBO Scope has the required permissions when prompted by your browser.

<Note>
If you want to know more about the extension’s permissions and why they are necessary, see the "Supported Browsers & Prerequisites" page in the Getting Started section.

## Step 4: Verify uBO Scope is Working

After installation and activation, verify that uBO Scope is correctly monitoring your browsing activity.

### How to verify:

1. Navigate to a website (for example, https://example.com).
2. Look at the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge:
   - The badge number shows how many distinct third-party domains the page connects to that are **not blocked**.
   - A non-zero badge number means the extension is detecting outgoing connections.
3. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
4. Observe the breakdown of domains:
   - **Not blocked:** Domains the page successfully connected to.
   - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where connections were redirected or hidden.
   - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were actively blocked or failed.

<Tip>
If the popup says 'NO DATA', try reloading the page or verifying that the browser permissions are granted.
</Tip>

---

## Step 5: Using the Popup Panel

The popup panel provides a real-time domain connection summary per tab:

- **Domains connected:** Total unique domains contacted.
- Domains are categorized for clarity, helping you understand the network requests the page triggered.

This immediate feedback helps you quickly evaluate privacy exposure and third-party traffic on any webpage.
