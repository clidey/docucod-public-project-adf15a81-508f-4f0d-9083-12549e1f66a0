# Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope

Welcome to the first step in leveraging uBO Scope — a simple yet powerful browser extension that reveals third-party remote server connections your browser makes. This guide walks you through installing and setting up uBO Scope in Chromium-based browsers (such as Google Chrome, Edge) and Firefox to ensure you're fully prepared to monitor your browsing network activity within minutes.

## 2. Step-by-Step Installation and Setup

Follow these concise steps tailored for Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.

### Step 1: Choose and Open the Correct Browser Store

- **For Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.):**
  - Visit the [Chrome Web Store page for uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).

- **For Mozilla Firefox:**
  - Visit the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).

<Tip>
Ensure you are logged into your browser with the necessary permissions to install extensions, especially on managed or corporate devices.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Install the Extension

- Click the **Add to Browser** or **Add to Chrome/Firefox** button on the respective store page.
- Confirm any permission prompts that appear. uBO Scope requires permissions like `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` to function properly.
- Wait a moment for the extension to download and install.

### Step 3: Confirm the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon Appears

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar area (typically top right).
- The icon uses the extension’s logo and its badge will dynamically update to show connection counts once browsing activity begins.

<Note>
If you do not immediately see the icon:
- In Chromium: click the puzzle-piece extensions icon and pin uBO Scope for quick access.
- In Firefox: check the overflow menu or customize the toolbar to make the icon visible.
</Note>

### Step 4: (Optional) Verify Extension Permissions

- Go to your browser’s extension management page:
  - Chromium: `chrome://extensions/`
  - Firefox: `about:addons`
- Find uBO Scope and click **Details**.
- Ensure that the requested host permissions (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*` depending on browser) are granted.

<Warning>
Without these permissions, uBO Scope cannot monitor all remote connections effectively.
</Warning>

### Step 5: Begin Using uBO Scope

- Visit any website and then click the uBO Scope icon.
- The popup panel will appear (covered in detail in the 'Understanding the Popup Panel' guide).
- The badge count on the toolbar icon will display the number of distinct third-party remote domains your current page connects to.

## 3. Tips & Best Practices

- **Pin the Toolbar Icon:** Prevent losing quick access by pinning uBO Scope to your main toolbar.
- **Regular Browsing Sessions:** Let uBO Scope collect meaningful data by browsing as you normally would.
- **Understand Badge Meaning:** A lower badge count means fewer third-party connections; not all third parties are harmful.

<Warning>
The extension can report network requests only when browsers expose them through the `webRequest` API; very limited or restricted browsing modes may reduce accuracy.
</Warning>

## 4. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation Issues">

<Accordion title="uBO Scope Icon Does Not Appear After Installation">
- Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extension manager.
- Refresh or restart your browser.
- Check the extensions overflow menu.
- In Chromium browsers, pin the extension from the puzzle icon dropdown.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Stays Empty or Does Not Update">
- Confirm that the extension has appropriate permissions, especially host permissions.
- Make sure you visit web pages with active network connections; internal browser pages or some sites might yield no data.
- Wait a few minutes if just installed; data collection happens as network events are observed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Installation Blocked by Browser or System">
- Verify your browser version meets minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+).
- Check for security settings or policies that may disallow extension installs.
- Try installing from official stores rather than side loading.
</Accordion>
