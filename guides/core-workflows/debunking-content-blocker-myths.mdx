# Debunking Myths About Content Blockers with uBO Scope

**uBO Scope** empowers you with irrefutable insights into your browser's network activity, allowing you to separate fact from fiction regarding content blocker effectiveness. This guide will walk you through practical strategies and scenarios to use uBO Scope to verify claims about blocking power and reveal the true behavior of ad blocker test websites.

---

## 1. Understanding the Goal: Why Debunk Content Blocker Myths?

Content blockers are often compared by block counts or test page results, but these methods can be misleading. uBO Scope reveals actual network connections — including those stealthily allowed despite block claims — empowering you to make informed judgments:

- **Reveal the number of distinct 3rd-party domains contacted.**
- **Distinguish truly blocked domains from stealth-avoided or allowed domains.**
- **Investigate ad blocker test sites critically, avoiding their pitfalls.**

**uBO Scope** debunks myths by making raw network connections transparent.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- Have uBO Scope installed and activated for your browser. See [Browser Installation Guide](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) if not.
- Confirm the extension has permissions for webRequest API and activeTab.
- Familiarize yourself with the popup UI basics: understanding allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domain lists.

---

## 3. Workflow: Using uBO Scope to Fact-Check Content Blockers

### Step 1: Navigate to a Site or Test Page

- Open a website where you want to verify content blocking.
- Alternatively, cautiously use an ad-blocker test page with the knowledge that these pages are often unrealistic.

### Step 2: Observe the Extension Badge

- The toolbar icon badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains from which at least one network request succeeded.
- Remember: a **lower count means fewer distinct 3rd-party domains contacted and stronger privacy**.

### Step 3: Open uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup panel.
- Review domains categorized under:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains active and allowed through.
  - **Stealth Blocked:** Domains where connection was prevented stealthily (not visible to websites).
  - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked, with network errors or failed requests.

### Step 4: Analyze Domain Lists

- Compare the counts and domain names to claims you’ve encountered about your content blocker.
- Look for unexpected or suspicious third parties in the allowed section.
- Use these insights to challenge assumptions based solely on block counts reported elsewhere.

### Step 5: Repeat with Different Content Blockers or Settings

- Change content blocker settings or switch extensions.
- Repeat steps 1-4 to see how network behaviors differ.
- Use uBO Scope to confirm if a higher block count corresponds to better privacy (it often does not).

## 4. Practical Scenario Examples

### Example 1: Testing a Popular Ad Blocker's Claim of High Blocking

1. Enable the ad blocker claiming it blocks the most ads.
2. Visit your favorite popular news website.
3. Open uBO Scope popup.
4. Notice the **Allowed domain count might be high**, indicating many third parties still load resources.
5. Inspect which domains are in each category and confirm if blocking claims match reality.

### Example 2: Investigating an Ad Blocker Test Website

1. Open a well-known "ad blocker test" website.
2. Open uBO Scope popup while the page loads.
3. Observe "Blocked" vs. "Stealth Blocked" domains.
4. Recognize that these sites often use fabricated URLs or resources not used by real web pages.
5. Understand the test results do not reflect real-world protection.

<Tip>
Ad blocker test websites create artificial scenarios that do not reflect actual browsing. Rely on uBO Scope's real connections analysis for truthful insights.
</Tip>

## 5. Best Practices & Tips

- Always rely on distinct domain counts as your primary privacy metric — not just raw block counts.
- Use the popup UI regularly during browsing sessions to get a live assessment.
- Cross-reference domains against known trackers or legitimate CDNs to understand the nature of connections.
- Refrain from trusting ad-blocker test pages as absolute benchmarks.
- Leverage uBO Scope alongside your content blocker for transparent network visibility.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Assuming high block count means better privacy:** This is often false, as more blocks can mean more failed attempts but more allowed connections.
- **Trusting ad blocker test pages blindly:** They often generate unrealistic connections that don't represent typical browsing.
- **Ignoring stealth-blocked domains:** These represent domains blocked silently to avoid detection or page breakage — important to understand.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

- If no data appears in the popup, verify uBO Scope has permissions for `webRequest` and appropriate host access.
- If the badge count does not update:
  - Reload the page.
  - Confirm the extension is active.
- For detailed troubleshooting, consult [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting/common-issues.mdx).
