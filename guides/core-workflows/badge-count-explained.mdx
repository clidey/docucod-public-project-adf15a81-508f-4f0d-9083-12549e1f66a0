# Interpreting the Badge Count

## Overview
The toolbar badge in uBO Scope is a powerful, immediate indicator representing the **number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to on the current tab**. This guide explains what the badge measures, how to interpret its values, and why understanding it is essential for assessing your browsing privacy and third-party exposure.


---

## What the Badge Count Measures

- **Distinct third-party domains:** The badge shows how many unique third-party domains your browser successfully connected to from the active tab.
- **Successes only:** It counts only network connections that were allowed (not blocked). This includes domains where content was fetched without error.
- **Third-party scope:** uBO Scope excludes first-party domains (the site you are visiting) and focuses solely on third-party connections, which may involve advertisers, trackers, content delivery networks (CDNs), or other external resources.

This count is updated continuously as you browse, reflecting real-time network activity on a per-tab basis.


## Why the Badge Count Matters

- **Privacy Insight:** A high badge count reveals that a webpage is connecting to many external domains, indicating considerable third-party exposure and potentially reduced privacy.
- **Quality Indicator:** Lower badge values often indicate a cleaner, more privacy-focused browsing experience, with fewer third parties involved.
- **Real metric beyond blocks:** Unlike block counts from content blockers—which can be misleading—the badge count tracks successful third-party connections, giving you a clearer picture of actual remote server connections.


## How to Interpret Badge Values

| Badge Count Value | Meaning                                  | User Implications                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **0 or Blank**     | No third-party connections detected      | Excellent privacy for the page; no external resources connected.
| **1 - Low Number** | Few distinct third-party connections      | Typical for sites using minimal third-party services, often limited to legitimate CDNs.
| **Moderate Number**| Multiple third-party connections          | Indicates average reliance on external services; consider if this matches your privacy expectations.
| **High Number**    | Numerous distinct third-party connections | Suggests heavy third-party content, including ads and trackers; potentially more invasive.

## Practical Tips for Using the Badge Count

- **When browsing:** Use the badge count as a quick privacy barometer for every website.
- **Comparing sites:** Notice which sites have unexpectedly high badge values and consider using stronger blockers or additional privacy measures.
- **Validating content blockers:** Use the badge count to validate that your blocker effectively limits connections to third parties—not just counting blocked requests.
- **Avoid false metrics:** Do not confuse badge count with block count badges from other blockers. uBO Scope’s badge reflects **allowed third-party connections**, the true measure of remote exposure.
- **Whitelist awareness:** If you whitelist domains in your content blocker, expect the badge to reflect connections to those domains.

## Step-by-Step: Using the Badge to Assess a Webpage

1. **Open uBO Scope and navigate to the desired tab.**
2. **Look at the toolbar badge number:**
   - If blank or zero, the page made no third-party connections.
   - If a number is shown, this is the count of unique third-party domains.
3. **Open the popup interface for details:** Clicking the badge opens a breakdown of connected domains in three categories:
   - *Allowed:* Third-party domains where requests succeeded.
   - *Stealth-blocked:* Domains that tried to redirect but were stopped stealthily.
   - *Blocked:* Domains whose requests were explicitly blocked.
4. **Compare badge counts across different pages:** See how changes in blocker settings affect third-party exposure.
5. **Use this information to improve privacy:** Adjust content blockers or browsing habits based on the badge insights.

## Common Questions and Pitfalls

### Why does the badge count sometimes change rapidly?
Network requests happen dynamically. The badge updates as third-party connections succeed or are blocked, reflecting ongoing network activity.

### Can the badge count be zero but still have third-party requests?
No. The badge count represents successful connections. Pending or blocked requests do not contribute.

### Is a high badge count always bad?
Not necessarily. Some content delivery or functional third-party domains might be critical for site performance or features.

### Why do some connections appear under “Stealth-blocked” instead of blocked?
Stealth-blocked means redirections or attempts were stopped silently, without fully blocking the request but hiding it. These do not count toward the badge.

### How does this differ from block counts in other blockers?
Block counts show how many requests are blocked, but high block counts can correlate with more third-party connections in total. The badge count here focuses on allowed, successful connections—reflecting actual exposure.

## Best Practices

- Rely on the badge count to measure **real third-party exposure**, not the number of blocked requests.
- Use the popup interface alongside the badge to see which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- Combine badge interpretation with content blocker settings for optimal privacy tuning.
- Regularly monitor badge counts on frequently visited sites to detect unwanted third-party expansions or privacy regressions.

## Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Badge Count">
  <Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Appear or Update">
    1. Ensure the extension is installed and enabled in your browser.
    2. Verify that the extension has necessary permissions to monitor network requests.
    3. Reload the tab and observe network activity—wait a few seconds for the badge to update.
    4. Confirm there is active third-party network activity on the webpage.
    5. Check your content blocker settings and whitelist rules which might influence connections.

    If issues persist, consult the [Troubleshooting Installation Issues](https://your-docs-link/guides/getting-started/troubleshooting-installation-issues) guide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Badge Count is Unexpectedly High or Low">
    1. Open the popup for the tab you’re on and review the detailed domain lists.
    2. Look for any unexpected domains or categories dominating the count.
    3. Confirm the current content blocker status; some blockers may allow more connections under certain profiles.
    4. Test other sites to verify if it’s site-specific.

    Consider using the [Audit Third-Party Network Connections](https://your-docs-link/guides/core-workflows/audit-network-connections) guide for a detailed approach to analyze.

## Summary
The badge count on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon is your real-time privacy barometer, showing how many unique third-party domains your browser connected to on the active tab. A lower badge count indicates fewer external network connections and typically better privacy. Understanding and leveraging this number helps you gauge the actual third-party exposure of web pages more effectively than traditional block counts. Use this metric wisely alongside detailed domain outcomes in the popup to optimize your browsing privacy and content blocker settings.
