## 4. Opening and Using uBO Scope After Installation

Once installed, follow these easy steps to start seeing network connection data.

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
- The popup will open with a header showing the hostname of the active tab.

### Step 2: Interpreting the Popup Interface

The popup shows domains categorized by their connection status:

- **Not Blocked**: Connections allowed by the browser.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Requests stealthily blocked by content blockers.
- **Blocked**: Requests fully blocked and failed.

At the top, you see the domain of the current webpage and a count of unique domains connected.

### Step 3: Visit a Resource-Rich Website

Open a website that loads many resources (e.g., news sites, blogs, or multimedia-heavy pages) to generate network activity.

### Step 4: Refresh the Popup Panel

- Close and reopen the uBO Scope popup or click the toolbar icon again.
- The counts and domain lists should now reflect the domains contacted by that page.

### Step 5: Understanding the Badge Count

The small number on the extension icon indicates the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** contacted by the active tab. Lower counts mean fewer unique third-party connections.

This is your first indicator of the network footprint of the webpage you’re visiting.

## 5. Practical Example

Imagine visiting a popular website. After refreshing the page, open uBO Scope's popup. You might see:

- **Not Blocked:** `cdn.example.com`, `fonts.gstatic.com`
- **Stealth-Blocked:** `tracking.example.net`
- **Blocked:** `ads.example.org`

The extension badge may display “3” indicating three unique remote servers notably contacted.

This insight empowers you to evaluate what third-party servers your browsing triggers.

## 6. Tips for Getting the Best Experience

- **Refresh the popup after browsing** to see the latest data.
- **Browse sites rich in third-party content** to observe full capabilities.
- Keep uBO Scope enabled alongside your favorite content blockers to verify their effectiveness.
- Remember that the badge count is independent of block counts; it reflects the number of allowed distinct remote hosts.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Popup Shows “NO DATA” or Empty Lists

- Ensure you have navigated to a website with network activity.
- Refresh the popup panel after the webpage loads fully.
- Verify that the extension has required permissions (webRequest, activeTab).

### Issue: Badge Count Does Not Update

- Try refreshing the tab or visiting another website.
- Restart the browser.
- Confirm the extension is enabled and not disabled by browser policies.

<Warning>
uBO Scope relies on browser network APIs. Network activity outside this scope (e.g., external apps) cannot be tracked.
</Warning>

Refer to the "Troubleshooting Installation & First Use" guide for an in-depth solutions checklist.
