## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Installing uBO Scope

1. **Choose your browser:**
    - For **Chromium-based browsers**, visit the [Chrome Web Store page for uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
    - For **Firefox**, go to [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
    - For **Safari**, ensure your macOS version supports Safari 18.5+, then obtain uBO Scope from the Mac App Store or official sources.

2. **Install the extension:**
    - Click **Add to Browser** or **Install** as prompted.
    - Confirm any permission requests from your browser during installation.

3. **Verify installation:**
    - Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar:
        - The icon appears as a shield or badge reading 'uBO Scope'.

<Tip>
Always install uBO Scope from the official browser extension stores to ensure you get the authentic, latest, and most secure version.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Enabling and Granting Permissions

1. Upon installation, uBO Scope may request permissions to access network data and active tab information:
    - Permissions include `webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab`.
    - It also requests host access to URLs matching http(s) and ws(s) schemes.

2. Grant these permissions when prompted. Without them, uBO Scope cannot detect network connections.

3. If your browser requires additional steps to enable the extension (such as toggling it on in `chrome://extensions` or `about:addons`), follow those instructions carefully.

### Step 3: Accessing the Extension Popup and Understanding the UI

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup interface.
2. The UI displays the following key sections:
    - **Domains Connected:** The total number of distinct third-party domains your current tab connected with.
    - **Not Blocked:** Domains that successfully connected.
    - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were attempted but stealth-blocked by the browser or content blockers.
    - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.

3. Each section lists domains with a count reflecting connection attempts or successes.

### Step 4: Using uBO Scope for Your First Network Analysis

1. Open any website you want to analyze (ideally one with multiple third-party connections).
2. Refresh the page to allow uBO Scope to capture network activity.
3. Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon to see the updated popup data.
4. Review the listed domains to understand how many third-party connections are being made.

<Tip>
The toolbar badge number reflects the count of unique third-party domains with active connections for the current tab, providing you a quick snapshot of your exposure.
</Tip>

### Step 5: Basic Configuration

Currently, uBO Scope has minimal user-configurable settings, focusing instead on delivering immediate insights without complicated setup. The popup interface is your primary interaction point.

## 3. Real-World Example: Analyzing Your First Website

Imagine you're visiting `https://www.newswebsite.com`:

- You refresh the page while uBO Scope is active.
- The extension observes multiple connections to various third-party servers:
  - Ad networks
  - Content delivery networks (CDNs)
  - Analytics providers

In the popup, you see:
- **Not Blocked:** CDN domains (e.g., `cdn.newswebsite.com`)
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Some third-party domains that tried to load but were stealth-blocked by your content blocker.
- **Blocked:** Domains fully blocked by your content blocker.

From here, you can assess the privacy footprint of your browsing and adjust your broader content blocker if desired.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and How to Fix Them">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Icon Not Visible After Installation">
- Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extension/add-ons page.
- Pin the uBO Scope icon to your toolbar if your browser allows hiding extensions.
- Restart the browser if the icon doesn't appear immediately.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Data Not Showing in Popup">
- Reload the web page after installing uBO Scope to capture network connections.
- Confirm you granted the required permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).
- Check that your browser version is supported.
- Disable conflicting extensions temporarily to isolate interference.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Stays at Zero">
- The webpage may not be making third-party network connections.
- Try opening a different website that loads external resources.
- Review browser privacy settings or other network restrictions that might block monitoring.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Remember, the badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party domains connected, **not** total requests or blocked requests.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Some network requests made outside the browser’s webRequest API scope (e.g., certain WebSocket connections on Safari) may not appear in uBO Scope.
</Warning>
