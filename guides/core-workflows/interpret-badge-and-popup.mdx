# Interpreting the Badge Count and Popup Results

## Overview

This guide helps you understand exactly what the badge number on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon represents and how to interpret the detailed connection data shown in the extension’s popup. You will learn how to read the categorized outcomes of network requests—allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked—and how to distinguish which third-party connections are typical and which might indicate privacy concerns.

By mastering these insights, you will better appreciate your browsing privacy exposure and make informed decisions about any need for additional content blocking.

## What the Badge Number Truly Represents

The badge number displayed on the uBO Scope icon reflects the **count of distinct third-party remote server domains** from which your active browser tab has successfully fetched resources.

### Key Points:

- The badge **does not count blocked or stealth connections**; only allowed (successful) third-party domains are counted.
- A **lower badge count implies fewer third-party connections**, generally indicating a smaller privacy footprint for that webpage.
- The number refers to **distinct domains** (e.g., `cdn.example.com` counted as one), not the total number of requests.
- The badge updates in real time as connections succeed or fail.

<Tip>
Remember, the badge count reflects your current tab’s network connections, enabling you to quickly gauge how many unique third-party domains actively serve content.
</Tip>

## Understanding the Popup Interface

Clicking the uBO Scope icon opens the popup window, which categorizes and lists the remote domains related to your current tab. This popup provides a granular view of all domains grouped by the outcome of their network requests.

### Popup Sections Explained

| Section           | Meaning                               | Domains Included                      |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Allowed**       | Successful (not blocked) requests   | Third-party domains from which resources loaded
|
| **Stealth-blocked** | Redirected requests blocked stealthily | Third-party domains where requests were redirected stealthily (concealed blocking)
|
| **Blocked**       | Explicitly blocked requests          | Third-party domains where requests failed due to blocking
|

Each section lists domains along with a small badge number indicating how many requests were made to that domain.

### What You See in the Popup

- **Hostname Bar:** Displays the current tab’s hostname at the top.
- **Domains Connected:** Shows a summary count of all distinct connected third-party domains.
- **Outcome Sections:** Divided into Allowed, Stealth-blocked, and Blocked, showing domains and their request counts.

#### Example Scenario:

Suppose you visit `https://example.com`. The popup might show:

- Allowed domains: `cdn.example.net (3)`, `analytics.tracker.com (2)`
- Stealth-blocked domains: `ads.malicious.com (1)`
- Blocked domains: `trackers.badsite.org (4)`

This means your browser successfully loaded content from two third-party domains, stealth blocked one (redirected invisibly), and blocked another explicitly.

<Tip>
Pay attention to stealth-blocked domains as these indicate connections your content blocker concealed. While these are blocked, they may reveal attempts to invisibly track or redirect.
</Tip>

## Practical Ways to Distinguish Necessary vs. Questionable Third-party Connections

### Identifying Legitimate Third Parties

- CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) for static resources like images, scripts, and fonts.
- Domains related to popular services or integrations you trust.
- Domains appearing in the **allowed** section with reasonable small counts.

### Spotting Questionable or Privacy-risk Domains

- Domains in **stealth-blocked** and **blocked** sections indicate attempts to load content you or your blocker blocked.
- High counts in blocked or stealth-blocked may signal aggressive trackers or malicious servers.
- Unfamiliar or suspicious domains with no clear affiliation to the site visited.

<Tip>
Use the popup as an investigative tool: if a domain appears repeatedly across sites or never in allowed, it may warrant blocking or further research.
</Tip>

## Common Network Request Outcomes and Their Meaning

| Outcome       | What It Means                                                               |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Allowed**   | Network requests successfully completed; resource fetched and loaded.       |
| **Stealth-blocked** | Requests were redirected in a way that conceals the blocking action; effectively blocked but silently. |
| **Blocked**   | Requests explicitly blocked by your content blocker or network rules.      |

Understanding these outcomes allows you to assess how much your content blocker is protecting you and what content actually loads.

## Step-by-Step: How to Use the Badge and Popup to Assess Privacy

1. **Check the badge on the toolbar icon:** A high number signals many third-party connections.
2. **Open the popup:** Review the domains and counts in all three categories.
3. **Focus on the Allowed section:** 
   - Confirm whether these domains are legitimate or expected third parties.
4. **Examine Stealth-blocked and Blocked sections:**
   - Identify domains that your content blocker has prevented accessing.
   - Recognize stealth-blocked as less visible but still prevented connections.
5. **Decide if further action is needed:**
   - If many unknown or suspicious domains appear in Allowed, consider applying stricter blocking.
   - If stealth or blocked domains are few and expected, your protection is working well.

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

### Common Issues

- **Badge showing 0 or empty when browsing:**
  - Ensure uBO Scope has permission to monitor web requests.
  - Verify that the page is fully loaded and network requests recorded.

- **Popup shows NO DATA:**
  - The active tab may not have initiated network requests yet.
  - Reload the page or navigate to a site with remote connections.

- **Unexpectedly high allowed domain count:**
  - Check if many third-party tracking domains are loaded.
  - Consider enhancing your content blocker or adjusting filters.

### Best Practices

- Regularly review the popup output when visiting sensitive sites.
- Use the badge count to quickly assess whether third-party exposure is reasonable.
- Combine uBO Scope with a content blocker to visualize and verify blocking effectiveness.
- Remember that some third-party connections are necessary for site functionality.

<Tip>
Use the badge count and popup insights as a practical window into your browsing privacy, enabling informed decisions rather than relying on vague ad blocker claims or test sites.
</Tip>

## Summary

Interpreting the toolbar badge and popup in uBO Scope empowers you to discern the real third-party connection landscape per tab, understand network request outcomes, and assess the effectiveness of your content blocking setup. By differentiating between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains, you gain transparent, actionable insights about your online privacy.
