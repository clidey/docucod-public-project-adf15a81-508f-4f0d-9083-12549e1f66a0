# Interpreting Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Domains

## Overview

This guide helps you understand how uBO Scope detects and categorizes network requests into three key outcomes: **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth-blocked** domains. You will learn how to read these categories in the extension’s popup interface and interpret what each means in terms of your browser’s network activity and privacy exposure.

## Prerequisites

- You have installed uBO Scope in your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser.
- You have opened the extension popup while browsing a webpage.
- You are familiar with basic concepts of third-party connections (see the [Core Concepts and Terminology](overview/core-concepts-architecture/core-concepts-terminology) guide).

## Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Distinguish between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains shown by uBO Scope.
- Understand how each category reflects actual network request outcomes.
- Use real-world examples to relate uBO Scope’s categorization to common browsing scenarios.

## Time Estimate

10–15 minutes to read and review examples.

## Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate.

## Understanding the Three Domain Categories

uBO Scope organizes observed third-party network requests into the following three categories displayed in the extension popup:

### 1. Allowed Domains ("not blocked")

- **What it means:** These are domains from which your browser successfully fetched resources during the current browsing session.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Requests reached their destination and returned a response (such as images, scripts, or API data).
  - These domains contribute directly to the page’s rendered content or functionality.
  - The count badge next to each domain shows how many requests were made to it.
- **User Value:** Understanding allowed domains shows the extent of third-party exposure and the actual endpoints your browser communicated with.

### 2. Blocked Domains ("blocked")

- **What it means:** These are domains whose network requests your content blocker or DNS filter prevented from completing.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Requests failed with errors or were actively canceled.
  - Blocked domains may correspond to trackers, ads, or other unwanted network endpoints.
- **User Value:** Identifies domains prevented from initiating connections and helps validate your blocking settings.

### 3. Stealth-Blocked Domains ("stealth-blocked")

- **What it means:** This category represents network requests that were interrupted or manipulated during HTTP redirects, typically to avoid detection by the webpage.
- **Characteristics:**
  - These requests showed initial network activity but were redirected or canceled stealthily before final resolution.
  - Stealth blocking often involves extensions transparently stripping or altering requests to prevent tracking without breaking page functionality.
- **User Value:** Shows domains involved in subtle blocking that tools or webpages may not easily detect.


## How uBO Scope Distinguishes These Outcomes

uBO Scope captures network requests via the browser’s `webRequest` API and examines their lifecycle:

- **Allowed:** Requests completing successfully (status code > 0, IP resolved).
- **Blocked:** Requests that fail or error out without reaching the destination.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests caught during redirects or covert cancellation before a full connection.

This functionality means uBO Scope provides a complete and honest view of network connection attempts, beyond what typical blocklists and counters disclose.

## Using the Popup Interface

When you open the uBO Scope popup for the active tab, you see sections labeled:

- **not blocked** — Allowed domains
- **stealth-blocked** — Stealth-blocked domains
- **blocked** — Blocked domains

Each domain listed shows how many times the tab connected or tried to connect to it.


## Examples: Real Site Scenarios

### Example 1: News Website

- **Allowed:** CDN domains hosting images, videos, or scripts load with normal requests.
- **Blocked:** Tracking ad servers prevented, so their requests never complete.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Redirect trackers (e.g., link trackers) intercepted during navigation.

This gives you a clear picture of what third-party content is allowed vs. suppressed silently or overtly.

### Example 2: Social Media Platform

- **Allowed:** Core domains enabling chat, feed content, and user media.
- **Blocked:** Ad-related domains or third-party analytics blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Redirect chains to tracking domains.

This helps audit privacy exposure on complex interactive sites.


## Tips for Reading the Data

- **Focus on Allowed Domains:** The most direct indication of privacy exposure and third-party reach.
- **Consider Stealth Blocking:** It may indicate sophisticated privacy defenses in place.
- **Blocked Domains Are No Guarantee:** Blocking might only be partial or ineffective; combining this insight with allowed counts is key.
- **Use Domain Counts:** High numbers indicate heavy reliance or exposure to a domain.


## Common Pitfalls & Considerations

- **Not All Allowed Domains Are Malicious:** Many allowed domains are legitimate CDNs or essential services.
- **Stealth-Blocked May Not Appear in Other Logs:** uBO Scope reveals hidden blocking that regular block counters omit.
- **Blocked Domains Could Include False Positives:** Some legitimate domains may get blocked inadvertently; review blocklists accordingly.


## Troubleshooting

- If your popup shows no data or incorrect lists:
  - Ensure uBO Scope extension permissions are enabled.
  - Verify you are viewing the popup on a tab with network activity.
  - Check for browser compatibility issues (see Installation guides).


## Next Steps

- Explore auditing actual third-party connections with the [Auditing Third-Party and Remote Server Connections](guides/core-workflows/auditing-third-party-connections) guide.
- Learn terminology and concepts in detail via [Core Concepts and Terminology](overview/core-concepts-architecture/core-concepts-terminology).
- Validate your installation with [Validating Your Installation](getting-started/first-use-and-troubleshooting/validating-installation).

## Appendix: How uBO Scope Processes Request Outcomes (Technical Insight)

(For users interested in deeper understanding—this reflects detection behavior relevant to the domain categorization.)

- The extension listens to network events: redirects, errors, and successful responses.
- Redirects are flagged as stealth blocking.
- Errors mark blocked status.
- Success is confirmed via valid IP or HTTP status code and counted as allowed.

This complete observation ensures you see all network attempts and their effective outcomes.
