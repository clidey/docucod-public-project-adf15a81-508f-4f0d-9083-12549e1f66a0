# Best Practices for Content Blocking and Privacy Testing with uBO Scope

## 1. Introduction
This guide empowers you to leverage uBO Scope’s detailed network connection insights to refine your content blocking strategy and accurately assess privacy exposure. It helps you debunk common misconceptions related to ad blocker badge counts and test site results, enabling more informed decisions and effective privacy protection.

### What You Will Learn
- How to interpret uBO Scope’s reports compared to conventional ad blocker metrics
- Practical steps to audit and refine your blocking rules
- Why popular "ad blocker test" webpages can be misleading
- Techniques to identify overreported or underreported metrics in badge counts

## 2. Understanding uBO Scope’s Privacy Value

### The True Meaning of the Toolbar Badge
The badge number shown on uBO Scope's toolbar icon represents the **number of distinct third-party remote domains your browser connected to during a browsing session**. A lower count signals fewer third-party connections, which generally translates to better privacy as fewer external servers receive your data.

<u><b>Key Point:</b></u> This badge is about **unique third-party domains actually contacted**, not about how many requests were blocked or allowed.

### Why Block Count Metrics Can Be Misleading
Many ad blockers display a block count on their badge. However, this count alone is unreliable as a quality indicator because:

- A higher block count can coexist with browser requests contacting **more third-party servers** ultimately exposing your browsing more, not less.
- Extensions might block many small requests but still allow connections to multiple third parties.
- Block count does not reflect the aggregate privacy exposure; distinct domains contacted matter more.

By contrast, uBO Scope focuses on **which distinct third-party domains are contacted**, giving a more meaningful privacy metric.

## 3. Auditing Your Content Blocking Strategy Using uBO Scope

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup and view the domains connected for the currently active tab.

### Step 2: Review the Categorized Domain Outcomes
You will see three domain lists:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains your browser successfully connected to.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or suppressed stealthily by your content blocker.
- **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked by request failures.

### Step 3: Identify Privacy Exposure
Focus primarily on the **Allowed** domains list for assessing privacy exposure. Legitimate sites can involve a few trusted third parties (like CDNs, fonts, analytics). Excessive diverse third-party connections may indicate privacy risks.

### Step 4: Analyze Badge Count vs. Actual Connections
The badge count equals the number of distinct allowed third-party domains. Compare this badge with your expectations:

- If the badge count is high but your block count is high too, verify if your blocker is allowing many third-party servers despite blocking many requests.
- If the badge count is unexpectedly low, check if the blocker might be stealth-blocking (hidden from normal reports).

### Step 5: Refine Blocking Rules Based on Findings
Use uBO Scope’s output to:

- Identify domains that repeatedly appear in the allowed list that you might want to block.
- Detect stealth-blocked domains to fine-tune your blocking rules or filters.
- Understand if some allowed domains are necessary (trusted vendors) or candidates for blocking.

> **Tip:**  
> Maintain a balance — over-aggressive blocking might break websites; under-blocking risks privacy.

## 4. Debunking Common Myths in Privacy Testing

### Myth: "Higher Block Counts Mean Better Protection"
As explained, many blocked requests can coexist with more unique third-party connections. uBO Scope clarifies this by showing **distinct domains connected** rather than just block numbers.

### Myth: "Ad Blocker Test Websites Are Reliable"
<u>uBO Scope considers these unreliable tests for these reasons:</u>
- Such sites try to detect ad blockers using artificial scenarios.
- They do not represent real-world web traffic or domain diversity.
- Extension stealth mechanisms evade detection, causing misleading test outcomes.

Focus on real browsing with uBO Scope to audit actual third-party network exposure.

## 5. Practical Example: Evaluating a News Website

1. Navigate to the news site and open uBO Scope popup.
2. Observe 10 allowed third-party domains, including CDNs and analytics.
3. One stealth-blocked domain appears—investigate it to decide if blocking it explicitly is needed.
4. Badge shows 10—matches allowed third parties.
5. You adjust rules to block a specific ad domain appearing repeatedly, then reload.
6. Badge count drops to 8; allowed domains list reflects fewer ads, confirming success.

## 6. Tips and Best Practices

- **Use uBO Scope Regularly:** Periodic audits reveal new third parties after site updates.
- **Cross-Reference with Filter Lists:** Use domain names shown to refine or add custom filters.
- **Beware of Stealth Blocking:** Domains reported only in the stealth section might still transmit data or be partially blocked. Adjust rules carefully.
- **Compare Across Sessions:** Check badge counts relative to different browsing contexts (e.g., incognito, different sites).

> **Warning:**  
> Do not rely solely on block counts or test sites; always validate with real-world, session-level data like uBO Scope reports.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Missing or Unexpected Badge Counts
- Confirm uBO Scope is active and matches permissions outlined in installation guides.
- Ensure browser version supports `webRequest` APIs properly (see system requirements).

### Domains Not Appearing as Expected
- Some browser APIs might miss certain requests (e.g., non-HTTP protocols).
- Review stealth-blocked domains for hidden connections.

### Badge Counts Seem Inconsistent
- Badge updates slightly delayed due to batch processing—wait a moment after page load.
- Different tabs have independent counts; ensure you are looking at the active tab.
