# Analyzing Badge Counts: How to Interpret Server Connection Numbers

## Overview
The badge count on uBO Scope's toolbar icon provides a dynamic snapshot of your browsing privacy by showing the number of distinct third-party remote servers your active browser tab connects to. Understanding how this count is determined and what it represents empowers you to accurately assess your web exposure to external servers.

This guide walks you through interpreting the badge count, clarifying its real-world significance, addressing common misconceptions, and sharing best practices for leveraging this information effectively.

## What the Badge Count Represents

- **Count Meaning**: The badge shows the total number of *unique third-party domains* from which your current tab has successfully loaded resources without being blocked.
- **Third-Party Domains**: These are domains different from the one in your browser's address bar, typically belonging to advertisers, analytics providers, or content delivery networks (CDNs).
- **Connection Outcomes Considered**: Only domains with *allowed* (not blocked or stealth-blocked) network requests contribute to the badge count.

<u>Example:</u> On a news website, the badge shows "12" meaning twelve distinct third-party domains that served allowed resources to that page.

<Tip>
A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, which often correlates with better privacy exposure. However, some third parties (like CDNs or essential service providers) are expected and usually benign.
</Tip>

## How uBO Scope Calculates the Badge Count

1. **Tracking Network Requests:** The extension monitors all web requests initiated by the active tab using browser webRequest listeners.
2. **Classification:** Each network request is classified into one of three outcomes:
   - Allowed (successful connection)
   - Blocked (request denied)
   - Stealth-blocked (blocked silently by stealth mechanisms)
3. **Domain and Hostname Resolution:** The extension extracts the hostname and reduces it to its registered domain using the Public Suffix List (e.g., `cdn.example.net` → `example.net`).
4. **Domain Deduplication:** Each unique allowed domain is counted once, regardless of how many resources are loaded from it.
5. **Badge Update:** The toolbar badge updates to the count of these unique allowed third-party domains.

<Note>
Connections to the main domain of the webpage (first-party) do NOT affect the badge count.
</Note>

## Real-World Significance of Badge Counts

- **True Exposure**: The number reflects how many distinct external services your browser talks to actively, giving a realistic view of your third-party exposure.
- **Better Than Block Counts**: Unlike block counters, the badge focuses on successful connections, which more directly impact privacy.
- **Visibility into Stealth Blocking**: uBO Scope shows stealth-blocked domains separately in the popup, but they don't reduce the badge count -- they help you understand hidden blocking layers.

## Common Misconceptions and Clarifications

<AccordionGroup title="Common Misconceptions about Badge Counts">
<Accordion title="Higher Block Count Means Better Blocking">
Higher block counts can coincide with higher numbers of allowed third-party domains, indicating that more resources are allowed overall despite blocking more requests. The badge count clarifies actual allowed connections, which is the real privacy metric.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Reflects Only Ad or Tracking Domains">
The badge counts all third-party domains with allowed connections, including benign services such as CDNs or legitimate APIs. Not all counted domains are necessarily harmful.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Ad Blocker Test Sites Accurately Reflect Badge Counts">
Test websites often make fabricated or unrealistic requests, which do not match real-world browsing activity. Badge counts reflect actual browsing connections, providing a realistic measurement.

## How to Use Badge Count Data Effectively

### Step 1: Interpret the Number
- Understand that the badge shows the *current* count for the active tab only.
- Use the count as an indicator of how many unique external domains serve content on the page.

### Step 2: Explore Detailed Domain Data
- Click the toolbar icon to open uBO Scope’s popup, revealing the breakdown of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.
- Investigate domains contributing to the badge to determine their relevance and trustworthiness.

### Step 3: Assess Privacy Impact
- Identify if the badge count aligns with your privacy expectations.
- Note if the count spikes unexpectedly on certain sites, which may indicate excessive third-party tracking.

### Step 4: Tune Your Blocking
- Use the detailed domain lists to consider adding custom filters to block unwanted third parties.
- Confirm through rereading the badge count and popup that blocking reduces allowed domain count without breaking site functionality.

### Step 5: Use Badge Counts Over Time
- Pay attention to how badge counts change with browsing behavior, giving insight into sites that expose you to many third parties.

<Tip>
Regularly monitor badge counts on your frequently visited sites to maintain awareness of your privacy surface. The badge is a real-time barometer of your web exposure.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Do Not Rely Solely on Badge Count:** Use badge counts combined with the detailed popup to get a full picture.
- **Remember Context Matters:** Some websites naturally require many third-party connections (e.g., news or social media platforms).
- **Expect Variation:** Badge counts vary by page and time, especially on dynamic sites.
- **Avoid Untrusted Sources:** Avoid comparing badge counts to unreliable ad-block test sites.

## Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues

### Badge Does Not Update or Shows Zero
- Ensure uBO Scope is installed and active.
- Verify you're viewing a supported tab (HTTP(S), WebSocket URLs).
- Refresh the page or reload the tab.
- Confirm no browser permission issues prevent network request monitoring.

### Badge Shows Unexpectedly High Counts
- Check for multiple third-party services on the site.
- Visit the popup and review domains to identify potentially unwanted services.

### Badge Count Does Not Match Popup Summary
- The badge count shows only allowed domains; the popup displays all outcomes.
- Verify no delay in updating UI; wait a few seconds after page load.

<Warning>
uBO Scope relies on browser network APIs; network requests made outside of these APIs (e.g., certain internal browser requests) are not tracked.
</Warning>

## Summary
The badge count on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon is your real-time window into how many distinct third-party server domains your browser successfully connects to on each webpage. By focusing on successful connections rather than blocks alone, it offers a trustworthy, practical measurement of your actual privacy exposure online.

Interpret the badge with nuance, use the popup for deep inspection, and apply your findings to make informed decisions about content blocking and privacy maintenance.

## Example Scenario

Imagine you're visiting a popular news site:

1. You see the badge count at “15.”
2. You open the popup to see which domains are connected.
3. The allowed list includes domains like `cdn.newsnetwork.com`, `analytics.provider.com`, and `ads.tracker.com`.
4. You notice stealth-blocked and blocked lists as well.
5. You realize there are several trackers allowed, so you add custom filters to block them.
6. Reload the page; the badge now reads “8,” confirming a reduced exposure.

This workflow helps you responsibly reduce unwanted third-party connections based on precise badge count data.
