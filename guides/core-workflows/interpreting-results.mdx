# Interpreting uBO Scope Results and Badges

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you master how to read and understand the information presented by the uBO Scope extension's toolbar badge and popup. You will learn what the displayed numbers mean, how to differentiate between first-party and third-party connections, and how to identify potentially privacy-invasive domains. The guide also clarifies common misunderstandings around block counts and ad blocker test pages.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and active in your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser.
- Browser tab open with loaded web pages generating network connections.
- Basic familiarity with browser extensions and network requests (recommended).

### Expected Outcome
- Ability to interpret the numeric badge on the toolbar icon accurately.
- Understand the popup categorization: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Confidently distinguish first-party versus third-party requests.
- Recognize privacy implications of domain connections.
- Awareness of common myths and pitfalls concerning block counts and test pages.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10-15 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate.

## Understanding the Toolbar Badge and Popup Interface

### What the Badge Number Represents
The badge count on the uBO Scope toolbar icon reports **the number of distinct third-party remote servers (domains) for which there was a connection** in the active tab. 

- A **lower badge count** is more desirable as it indicates fewer external third-party connections.
- The count includes only distinct third-party domains; multiple requests to the same domain count as one.
- First-party domains (the domain of the active webpage) are **not counted**.

<Tip>
This badge is a privacy indicator — it reflects how many unrelated third-party entities your browser connected to while loading the page, regardless of whether those connections were allowed or blocked by other content blockers.
</Tip>

### Why Third-Party Domains Matter
Third-party connections are requests your browser makes to domains other than the website you are visiting. These connections are the vector for:
- Advertising, tracking, and analytics services.
- Content delivery networks (CDNs) used legitimately.
- Potential privacy-invasive or malicious servers.

Typically, a legitimate website will have a **low count of third-party domains**, often limited to essential CDNs or APIs.

### Myths about Block Counts Versus Domain Counts
Many users assume that "block count" numbers on ad blockers indicate their effectiveness. uBO Scope clarifies this misconception:

- A **higher block count** does not necessarily mean better blocking.
- Sometimes, an extension that blocks more requests by number might still allow connections to _more distinct third parties_.
- What truly matters is the count of distinct third-party domains that resources are fetched from, i.e., connections actually allowed.

<Warning>
Do not judge content blockers solely by their block counts or by results shown on ad blocker test webpages, which often use unrealistic networking scenarios.
</Warning>

## Popup Display: Sections and Domain Lists

When you click the uBO Scope icon, a popup opens with detailed categorized information of the network connections by the active tab:

| Section            | Meaning                                               | What You See                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Not Blocked**    | Third-party domains from which network requests succeeded (allowed). | List of domains and connection counts.           |
| **Stealth-Blocked**| Connections redirected or stealthily blocked by the browser or content blockers (requests were attempted but circumvented). | List of domains with counts indicating stealth blocking. |
| **Blocked**        | Requests that were explicitly blocked by the extension or other blockers. | Domains where requests failed due to blocking.   |

### Understanding Domain Counts
Each domain is shown with the number of requests made during the tab session, giving insight into request volume per domain.

### Distinguishing First-Party and Third-Party Requests
- First-party requests originate from the domain of the currently active webpage.
- Third-party requests come from any other domain.

In the popup:
- First-party domains are **not listed** explicitly.
- All domains shown are third-party domains categorized by their request outcome.

## Step-by-Step: Interpreting Your uBO Scope Popup

<Steps>
<Step title='Open the uBO Scope Popup'>
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon while browsing any website. The popup will display the hostname and domain of the current tab at the top.
</Step>
<Step title='Read the Badge Numbers'>
Observe the toolbar badge (a number over the icon). It shows how many distinct third-party domains issued connection attempts in your current tab.
</Step>
<Step title='Review the Not Blocked Section'>
See which third-party domains made successful connections. Verify if these domains are expected CDNs or services.
</Step>
<Step title='Check the Stealth-Blocked and Blocked Sections'>
Identify domains where connections were blocked or stealthily redirected. These might indicate active content blocking or potential tracking attempts.
</Step>
<Step title='Analyze Domain Counts'>
Look at the count beside each domain to understand the volume of requests to that domain.
</Step>
<Step title='Spot Potential Privacy Concerns'>
Domains you do not recognize or commonly trust could be privacy-invasive. Consider investigation or blocking.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the badge count is unexpectedly high, investigate the Not Blocked section to identify unknown third parties.
</Tip>

## Practical Examples

### Example: A Typical News Website
- Badge shows "5".
- Popup shows 3 allowed domains: cdn.example.com, ads.tracker.com, analytics.service.net.
- 1 stealth-blocked domain: ad.doubleclick.net.
- 1 blocked domain: badtracker.example.org.

Interpretation:
- The site uses a few external services, including an ad tracker.
- One known advertising domain is stealth-blocked.
- One domain is explicitly blocked.

### Example: A Privacy-Conscious Minimal Site
- Badge shows "1" or "0".
- Only CDN domains shown in Not Blocked.
- No stealth or blocked domains.

Interpretation:
- Minimal third-party connections, mostly essential resources.
- High privacy respect.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Use the badge as a privacy signal:** Lower counts mean fewer third-party exposures.
- **Review popup domains regularly:** Helps discover new or suspicious connections.
- **Don’t trust block counts alone:** uBO Scope focuses on distinct domains contacted, which gives better privacy insight.
- **Avoid relying on ad blocker test pages:** They don’t mimic real-world browsing and often produce misleading results.
- **Remember legitimate services:** Some third parties are necessary, like CDNs or authentication services.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope Badge and Popup Issues">
<Accordion title="Badge count not updating or showing zero constantly">
- Ensure uBO Scope has necessary permissions (webRequest).
- Verify browser version supports required APIs.
- Confirm network requests in active tab exist.
- Refer to 'Troubleshooting: No Connections Being Reported' guide for detailed diagnostic.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup shows no domain lists or outdated data">
- Refresh the active tab to generate new requests.
- Close and reopen the popup.
- Reload the browser if data persists.
- Confirm the extension is active and not disabled.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Confusion about first-party vs third-party domains">
- Remember the popup only reports third-party connections.
- The current page domain is shown as context but not counted.
- Use domain knowledge or tools to verify domain ownership.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
