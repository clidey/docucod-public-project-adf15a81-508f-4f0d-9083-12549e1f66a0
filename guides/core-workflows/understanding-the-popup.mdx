# Understanding the Popup Panel

## Overview
The popup panel in uBO Scope provides a real-time, detailed snapshot of the network connections occurring within your active browser tab. It categorizes remote connections into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains, offering clear insight into the behavior and privacy footprint of webpages you visit. This guide explains how to use the popup interface, interpret the badge count, and understand the domain categorizations to quickly assess third-party activity.

## What You Will Learn
- How to open and navigate the popup panel
- The meaning behind each domain category displayed
- Understanding the badge count on the toolbar icon
- How to read domain counts and what they represent

---

## Accessing the Popup Panel
1. Click the uBO Scope extension icon on your browser toolbar to open the popup panel.
2. The panel will load data for the currently active tab.
3. If no data is available, the popup will indicate 'NO DATA'. This can happen if the page is still loading or no network connections have been registered yet.

<Check>
Ensure you are on an active tab where you want to inspect network connections before opening the popup.

## Understanding the Popup Panel Sections
The popup is divided into several parts, each reporting domains under distinct categories:

### 1. Tab Hostname Display
- Shows the hostname and domain of the currently active tab.
- The hostname (e.g., `subdomain.example.com`) appears first, followed by the base domain (`example.com`).
- Domains are displayed in Unicode format for readability, decoding punycode when necessary.

### 2. Summary Section
- Displays "domains connected:" followed by a count.
- This count reflects the number of **distinct third-party domains** from which connections were allowed.
- A lower count is generally preferable, indicating fewer third parties are connected.

### 3. Domains Categorized by Outcome
The main content is separated into three domain outcome categories:

| Category          | Description                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**   | Domains for which network connections were allowed during the page load. These are third parties that successfully received requests from the page. |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains where the extension detected stealth blocking, typically network redirects or subrequests that were intercepted silently.                    |
| **Blocked**        | Domains with network requests that failed or were explicitly blocked, indicating the extension or other blocking mechanism prevented connection.    |

Each category lists individual domains alongside the number of network connections attempted or recorded.

<Info>
"Stealth-blocked" indicates connections redirected or blocked without notifying the webpage, a tactic used to minimize webpage breakage or detection.
</Info>

## Interpreting Domain Counts
- Each domain listed has an associated count, denoting the number of network requests to that domain from the active tab during the session.
- Counts reflect both the frequency and distinct hostnames within those domains.
- The summary count at the top represents the number of distinct **domains** successfully connected (i.e., in the "not blocked" category).

---

## The Toolbar Badge Count Explained
- The extension icon badge displays the number of distinct third-party domains that were allowed to connect.
- This count excludes the first-party domain of the page.
- The badge gives you an at-a-glance privacy metric; fewer third parties usually mean a smaller surface for tracking or surveillance.

<Note>
A zero or empty badge means no third-party connections were detected or all were blocked.
</Note>

## Practical Use Cases
Consider the following scenarios when using the popup panel:

- **Privacy auditing:** Quickly identify how many and which third-party domains are contacted by a webpage.
- **Content blocker evaluation:** Verify if your content blocker is effectively blocking unwanted connections.
- **Troubleshooting:** Identify unexpected allowed domains that may require additional filtering rules.

---

## Best Practices
- Regularly monitor both the allowed and stealth-blocked sections to get a fuller picture of third-party activity.
- Use the Unicode domain names to recognize familiar or suspicious domains.
- Keep browser and extension up-to-date for accurate and consistent reporting.

<Warning>
Interpreting the "blocked" section requires understanding that some blocked connections are legitimate protections, while others may cause webpage features to fail if over-blocked.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Popup Panel Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA'">
- The tab may not have loaded network requests yet.
- Try refreshing the page and reopening the popup.
- Confirm that uBO Scope is installed and active.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
- Make sure you have granted all necessary permissions.
- The extension needs the `webRequest` permission to monitor connections.
- Check for browser compatibility issues (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Domains Appear Unexpectedly Allowed">
- Some CDNs and legitimate third-party services may appear here.
- Review your content blocker rules if you want to block additional domains.
- Reminder: uBO Scope reports actual connections, not filter list rules.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary
The uBO Scope popup panel is your window into the network activity of each active tab, categorizing domains by their connection outcome. Understanding this information empowers you to assess privacy exposure and the effectiveness of content blocking. Use this knowledge to tailor your browsing experience and ensure visibility into third-party connections.
