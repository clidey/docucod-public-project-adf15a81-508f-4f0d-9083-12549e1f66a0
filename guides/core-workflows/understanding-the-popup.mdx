# Understanding the Popup: Reading Connection Insights

## 1. Introduction
The popup window of uBO Scope serves as your real-time dashboard to view detailed summaries of all network connections made by the active browser tab. This guide helps you navigate and interpret the popup interface, understand the significance of the domains listed, and distinguish between connection outcomes—allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked—to empower your browsing privacy decisions.

By mastering the popup, you gain practical visibility into third-party connections on any webpage, enabling you to audit network behavior and enhance your awareness of what resources are accessed during your browsing.

---

## 2. What You Will Achieve
- See a clear summary of all unique third-party domains connected from the current tab.
- Understand the difference between "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked" connections.
- Identify the domains contributing to each connection category with visit counts.
- Use the popup interface as a straightforward tool for immediate insight into web page network activity.


## 3. Prerequisites
Ensure you have uBO Scope successfully installed and activated in your compatible browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).

Visit the [First Launch & Verifying Installation guide](/getting-started/installation-basics/first-launch) if you need assistance confirming the extension is actively monitoring network connections.


## 4. Popup Interface Overview
When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup window opens with several sections:

- **Tab Hostname Header:** Shows the hostname of the current tab’s main document.
- **Domains Connected Summary:** Displays the count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Outcome Sections:** Three categorized lists showing domains by connection result:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains with allowed connections.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains detected to have stealth-blocked network requests.
  - **Blocked:** Domains with requests that were outright blocked.

Each listed domain includes a count representing the number of individual hostnames or requests observed.


## 5. Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Opening the Popup">
Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup window. This opens a panel summarizing the active tab’s network connections.

**Outcome:** The popup is populated with up-to-date connection data for the page currently open and active in your browser.
</Step>

<Step title="Understanding the Tab Hostname Header">
At the top, identify the main domain and hostname of the active tab.

- If the hostname and domain differ (e.g., a subdomain), both parts are displayed.
- This clarifies which site’s network activity you are analyzing.

**Outcome:** You know exactly which tab’s connections are being reported.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpreting Domains Connected Summary">
Below the header, observe the number next to "domains connected".

- This is the **count of distinct third-party domains** contacted from the page.
- Lower counts indicate fewer external third-party connections.

**Outcome:** You see a quick quantitative snapshot of third-party network exposure.
</Step>

<Step title="Reviewing Connection Outcome Sections">
The popup divides domain lists into three distinct outcome categories:

1. **Not Blocked:** Domains that the browser successfully connected to.
2. **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections appear to be redirected or obscured stealthily, typically by content blockers.
3. **Blocked:** Domains clearly prevented from loading resources.

Scan each section for domain names and their associated request counts. The counts indicate how many times requests involving that domain were observed.

**Decision Point:** Recognizing the category helps you infer what network activities are allowed or prevented by your current content blocking setup.

**Outcome:** You gain insight into which third-party domains are fully allowed, partially or stealthily blocked, or completely blocked.
</Step>

<Step title="Using the Domain Counts Effectively">
Each domain listing shows a numerical count next to it.

- This count totals requests or hostnames connected involving that domain.
- Higher counts indicate heavier interaction or more resources requested from that domain.

Pay close attention to domains with unexpectedly high counts which may affect privacy or performance.

**Outcome:** You not only see which domains connect but also the relative volume, helping prioritize further investigation if needed.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 6. Practical Examples
Imagine visiting a news website with embedded social media widgets and trackers.

- The popup header shows the site’s domain, e.g., `news.example.com`.
- Under **Not Blocked**, you find legitimate CDN domains delivering images or scripts with request counts.
- Under **Stealth-Blocked**, you see tracker domains that your content blocker partially hides.
- Under **Blocked**, overt ad servers and trackers are displayed with counts corresponding to blocked attempts.

This transparency helps you confirm that blocking rules are working and assess residual third-party connections.


## 7. Best Practices
- Regularly open the popup to audit network requests on sites you frequently visit.
- Cross-reference domains shown with known trackers or suspicious domains.
- Use domain counts to detect unexpected third-party connections that could be privacy risks.
- Remember that stealth-blocked domains reflect nuanced blocking and may still impact page behavior subtly.


## 8. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or No Connection Information">
This indicates the extension has no data for the current tab.

- Verify uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Confirm the active tab is fully loaded and is accessible (not in private/incognito mode without permissions).
- Reload the tab to generate fresh network request data.
- Check for browser compatibility and update if needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Domain Lists Remain Empty While Badge Shows Counts">
This can happen if connection data has not yet synchronized with the popup.

- Wait a few seconds and refresh the popup by closing and reopening.
- Make sure the tab id is properly communicated between background and popup scripts.
- Restart the browser if synchronization problems persist.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 9. Technical Insights (For Advanced Users)

- Hostnames and domains are decoded using the Punycode format for accurate internationalized domain representation.
- Domains are sorted alphabetically for orderly presentation.
- The popup consumes serialized session data provided via messages from the background script, reflecting real-time network outcomes.


## 10. Next Steps
- Proceed to the [Toolbar Badge Guide](/guides/core-workflows/toolbar-badge-guide) to understand how the badge count complements the popup data.
- Explore the [Core Concepts & Terminology page](/overview/product-architecture/core-concepts-terminology) for a deeper understanding of connection outcomes.
- Review the [Quick Usage Tour](/getting-started/core-usage-and-setup/quick-usage-tour) for live interaction with popup features.
