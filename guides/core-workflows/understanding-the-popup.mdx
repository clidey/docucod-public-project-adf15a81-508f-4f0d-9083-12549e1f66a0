# Understanding the Popup: Domains and Connection Types

## Overview

The popup interface in uBO Scope serves as your direct window into the web connections made by the active browser tab. It details the domains your browser interacts with, organizing them by connection status and visually encoding this information for quick comprehension. This guide will help you interpret exactly what you see in the popup, explaining the listing of domains, their color-coding, grouping into connection types, and how to read the counts shown.

By mastering this interface, you gain clear insight into which connections your current webpage makes — which are allowed, which are blocked by content blockers or other mechanisms, and which are stealth-blocked (requests that were redirected or otherwise hidden). This empowers you to understand your browsing exposure at a glance.

## What You Will Learn

- How domains are listed and grouped in the popup
- The meaning behind each connection type category: "Allowed", "Blocked", and "Stealth"
- How the popup counts and displays connections
- Practical examples on how to interpret the domain lists
- Tips to troubleshoot what you see and what it means

## 1. Popup Interface Structure and Workflow

### What the Popup Shows

When you open the uBO Scope popup while on an active webpage, it displays:

- **Current tab hostname/domain:** At the top, you see the domain from the current active tab, providing context.
- **Summary count:** The total number of unique domains contacted by the page.
- **Three connection type sections:**
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains where the browser successfully made network connections.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or hidden — these do not appear as successful requests but were attempted and modified behind the scenes.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were blocked outright by content blocking mechanisms or network errors.

### Key Prerequisites

Before using the popup effectively, ensure:

- uBO Scope is installed and active in your browser.
- You have navigated to a webpage with network connections.
- The extension has permission to read active tab information.

### Time Estimate

Reading and becoming comfortable with this popup and categories takes 5-10 minutes.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate — designed for any user curious about webpage network activity.

## 2. Step-by-Step Guide to Understanding the Popup

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup on an Active Tab">
Open the popup by clicking the extension icon in your browser toolbar while on the webpage you want to inspect.


You will see the hostname of the current tab displayed prominently at the top, split into subdomain(s) and main domain if applicable.

<Check>
If the display shows “NO DATA,” it means no network requests have been logged yet for this tab.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret the Summary Count">
Below the hostname is the summary section, showing the number of distinct domains the webpage has connected to or attempted to connect to.

This number counts only unique domains, giving you a sense of how many third-party or first-party servers the page communicated with.

<Info>
A lower domain count typically means fewer third-party connections, usually implying better privacy.
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Explore the Three Connection Type Sections">
The popup is divided into three vertically stacked sections:

- **Not Blocked:** Lists domains with successful connections.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Shows domains for connections that were attempted but redirected or hidden silently.
- **Blocked:** Lists domains where connections were blocked outright.

Each section contains:

- A heading with the connection type
- A dynamic list of domains observed under that category
- Next to each domain, a count of the number of requests made or attempted for that domain

The domains are sorted alphabetically for easy lookup.

<Tip>
Understanding where a domain falls among these categories helps to analyze the effectiveness of your content blockers and the true exposure of your browser to external servers.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Understand Color Coding and Visual Layout">
Each connection type section works as a color-coded status group:

- **Allowed:** Usually styled in neutral or greenish colors, indicating permitted connections.
- **Stealth:** Typically styled differently (e.g., orange or yellow) to highlight stealthy operations.
- **Blocked:** Styled in red tones to emphasize blocking.

These visual cues help you quickly identify the nature of connections.

<Note>
Color styles depend on your browser and extension theme but always emphasize the connection type distinction.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Read Domain Counts and Their Significance">
The count next to each domain shows how many requests or connection attempts were recorded for that domain under this connection type.

For example, if google-analytics.com has a count of 15 under "Not Blocked," it means 15 successful connections were made to that domain.

Cross-reference counts help determine which domains dominate your network traffic.

<Warning>
Some domains may appear in multiple categories if different requests vary in outcome.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Use Punycode Decoding to Read International Domains">
Domains with non-ASCII characters are converted from punycode to Unicode for readability.

For example, xn--bcher-kva.example might display as bücher.example.

This ensures clarity even with international domain names.

<Info>
This feature uses the Public Suffix List internally to classify and decode domains accurately.

</Step>

## 3. Practical Examples

### Example: Interpreting the Popup for a News Website

Imagine loading a news website, then opening the uBO Scope popup. You see:

- At the top: `news.example.com` split between `news.` and `example.com`.
- Summary count: 12 domains connected.
- Under **Not Blocked:**
  - `cdn.example.net`: 8
  - `analytics.google.com`: 3
- Under **Stealth:**
  - `ads.tracking.com`: 4
- Under **Blocked:**
  - `socialmedia.buttons`: 5

This tells you:

- The main site uses a CDN to load static content and Google Analytics for user tracking.
- Some ads or trackers were stealthily redirected.
- Some social media tracking buttons were fully blocked.

With this insight, you understand your exposure: which domains interact openly, which are stealth-blocked (remain hidden from webpage detection), and which you’ve successfully blocked.

### Example: When No Domains Appear in a Section

If the **Blocked** section is empty, it means no requests have been blocked for the page so far.

If the **Stealth** section is empty, no stealth operations occurred.

Use this information to calibrate your content blockers and adjust expectations.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Empty Lists**
  - Cause: The current tab might not have made any connections yet.
  - Solution: Reload the page to trigger network requests and open the popup again.

- **No Stealth-Blocked Domains Visible Despite Knowing Some Should Be Present**
  - Cause: Some stealth operations might not be detectable by the extension yet.
  - Solution: Ensure the extension is up to date; stealth-blocking detection relies on subtle network event tracking.

- **Counts Don't Match Expected Usage**
  - Cause: Counts reflect unique connection attempts counted per domain, which may differ from resource counts shown by other tools.
  - Solution: Use these counts as relative indicators, not absolute request logs.

### Best Practices

- Regularly check the popup while browsing different sites to familiarize yourself with typical domain patterns.
- Use the popup to validate your interest in minimizing third-party connections by watching the summary count.
- Combine this with badge count analysis (see the related guide on badge counts) for complete insight.

### Performance Considerations

- The popup updates asynchronously, so slight delays after page load are normal.
- The listing focuses on domains, not individual requests, for clarity and performance.

### Alternative Approaches

- For deeper analysis, access the background script logs if available, though the popup provides the essential overview for daily use.
