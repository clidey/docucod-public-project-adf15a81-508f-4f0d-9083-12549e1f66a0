# Debunking Content Blocking Myths with uBO Scope

Discover the realities behind common misunderstandings about content blocking metrics and how uBO Scope brings clarity to your web browsing experience. This guide walks you through the key myths around block counts and ad blocker test sites, helping you interpret what truly matters when evaluating content blockers.

---

## Understanding the True Measure of Content Blocking

Many users rely on raw block counts or popular ad blocker testing pages as indicators of content blocker effectiveness. However, these metrics are often misleading and fail to capture the broader picture of third-party connections and privacy.

### Why Block Counts Are Misleading

- **Block Count ≠ Effective Blocking:** A higher block count displayed on content blocker badges or reports does not necessarily mean better blocking. It can instead indicate that more requests are made to third-party servers before being blocked, or that the blocker allows connections to more unique third parties.

- **Focus on Distinct Third-Party Connections:** What really matters is how many distinct third-party servers your browser connects to during browsing. A lower number here means fewer external entities have access to your data.

- **Block Counts Can Create False Comfort:** If a blocker reports blocking many requests but still connects to numerous third-party servers, it may not be delivering the privacy protection you expect.

### What uBO Scope Does Differently

uBO Scope tracks all network connections per browser tab, regardless of which content blocker is active or if content is blocked at the DNS level. It reveals:

- The number of **unique third-party domains** connected to.
- The breakdown of domains that are **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked** (requests blocked silently without alerts).

This domain-focused visibility helps users understand their actual network footprint.

## Myth #1: “The Block Count in Toolbar Icon Shows Which Blocker is Best”

### Reality:

- The block count on a toolbar icon reflects the **number of blocked network requests**, not the number of distinct third-party domains blocked.

- A higher block count can mean the blocker is matching many fine-grained rules but may still allow connections to many unique third parties.

- uBO Scope’s badge, however, shows the **number of distinct third-party remote servers connected to**, offering a more meaningful metric.

#### What to Do:

1. Use uBO Scope to observe the badge count for your browsing session.
2. Favor maintaining a **lower total distinct third-party connection count** rather than the raw block count from any one blocker.
3. Interpret block counts alongside connection counts for a holistic understanding.

## Myth #2: “Ad Blocker Test Websites Accurately Reflect Blocking Performance”

### Reality:

- Test websites designed for ad blockers often use **artificial, fabricated network requests** that don’t represent typical real-world browsing.

- Many content blockers operate stealthily, selectively blocking requests without revealing their work to webpages to avoid breakage or detection.

- These test sites cannot detect stealth-blocked requests or DNS-level blocking, thus providing **incomplete or false results**.

#### How uBO Scope Helps:

- uBO Scope records **all connection attempts and outcomes** reported by the browser's `webRequest` API, capturing stealth-blocked connections.

- By reviewing the popup panel, users can see **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth-blocked** third-party domains as they occur during normal browsing.

#### Recommendation:

- Avoid relying on ad blocker test sites as the primary validation method.

- Use uBO Scope for **real-time, per-tab connection visibility** during actual web browsing.

- Validate your blocking effectiveness against real browsing patterns and multiple websites.

## Practical Steps with uBO Scope to Avoid Being Misled

<Steps>
<Step title="Install and Activate uBO Scope">
Follow the [Installation and Setup Guide](/guides/getting-started/installation-setup) to add uBO Scope to your browser and grant necessary permissions.
</Step>
<Step title="Browse Real Websites and Observe Badge">
Browse your favorite sites normally while watching uBO Scope’s toolbar badge, which shows the count of distinct third-party domains connected.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel for Details">
Click the badge icon to open the popup panel showing lists of:
- Not blocked domains
- Stealth-blocked domains
- Blocked domains

Analyze which third parties your browser connects to and their connection status.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Figures Intelligently">
Focus on the number of unique third-party connections rather than total blocked requests.
Lower distinct connections generally mean better privacy protection.
</Step>
<Step title="Ignore Misleading Test Sites">
Avoid making decisions based on ad blocker test sites, as they are designed to fail stealth blockers and do not reflect typical browsing traffic.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Example Scenario: Comparing Two Blockers

Suppose you use two content blockers, A and B:

- Blocker A shows a high block count but uBO Scope shows connections to 15 distinct third-party domains.
- Blocker B shows a lower block count but uBO Scope shows 25 distinct third-party connections.

What this means:
- Blocker A blocks many individual requests but effectively limits third-party servers.
- Blocker B blocks fewer requests but allows connections to more unique third-party servers.

**Outcome:** Blocker A likely offers better privacy protection even if its block count looks greater.

## Troubleshooting Misinterpretations

<AccordionGroup title="Common Misunderstandings and Fixes">
<Accordion title="Why Does My Blocker Show More Blocks but uBO Scope Shows More Connections?">
This happens because your blocker might be matching many filter rules blocking individual requests but allows connections to multiple distinct third-party servers. Focus on how many unique servers you are connecting to—as shown by uBO Scope—to gauge privacy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why Don’t Stealth-Blocked Connections Appear in Some Blocker Reports?">
Stealth blocking avoids alerting the webpage or the user interface of the blocker. uBO Scope detects these by monitoring actual network requests regardless of blocking method, showing them transparently in the 'stealth-blocked' category.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="My Ad Blocker Test Site Passes but uBO Scope Shows Many Connections">
Test sites are often simplistic and do not represent real-world traffic. A pass on these sites does not guarantee effective blocking. Use uBO Scope’s domain counts during natural browsing for accurate insight.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices for Maximizing uBO Scope’s Insight

- Rely on **real browsing scenarios** for assessing content blocker effectiveness.
- Regularly **review the popup panel** to understand domain-level connection outcomes.
- Use the badge count as a **quick indicator of third-party exposure**, aiming for the lowest count possible.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with block lists and blockers that **reduce unique third-party server connections**.
