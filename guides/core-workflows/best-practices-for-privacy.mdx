# Best Practices for Interpreting and Acting on Results

uBO Scope offers powerful real-time visibility into all third-party remote server connections your browser attempts during web browsing. This page guides you on how to leverage uBO Scope's detailed results effectively—in ways that help you correlate the extension data with actual website behavior, distinguish legitimate from suspicious third-party domains, and translate your findings into informed privacy decisions or actionable reports.

---

## 1. Understanding the Data You See

uBO Scope classifies network connections into three outcome categories:

- **Not Blocked** (`allowed`): Connections successfully made to third-party servers.
- **Stealth-Blocked** (`stealth`): Requests silently blocked by content blockers to prevent detection or web page breakage.
- **Blocked** (`blocked`): Network requests explicitly prevented by content blocking mechanisms.

The domain statistics in the popup group connections by domain name, showing counts indicating how many connection attempts were observed per domain. 

### Why This Matters

The extension's badge count reports the number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections—not the number of blocked requests. A lower badge count means fewer third-party connections and generally better privacy exposure.


## 2. Step-by-Step Guide to Interpreting Results

### Step 1: Open the Popup for the Active Tab

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
- Confirm the tab's hostname and domain displayed align with the website you are visiting.

### Step 2: Review Domain Lists by Outcome

- **Not blocked:** Check these domains first. Legitimate third parties typically include content delivery networks (CDNs), essential analytics providers (e.g., Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity), and first-party service partners.
- **Stealth-blocked:** These domains reflect the content blocker’s ability to hide blocking activity. They often include known trackers or ad servers prevented from loading.
- **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked by your content blocker or DNS filtering. These may be aggressive trackers, ad networks, or other unwanted domains.

### Step 3: Correlate Domains with Website Functionality

- Compare domains under “not blocked” to the features of the site you are using. For example, CDNs are often critical for fast delivery of images, scripts, or fonts.
- Check if blocking a domain causes visible breakage on the website (missing images, broken UI elements).
- Use this correlation to decide whether to whitelist certain domains or maintain blocking.

### Step 4: Identify Legitimate vs. Suspicious Third Parties

- Conduct quick searches on unknown domains to verify their legitimacy (company websites, tech blogs, domain registries).
- Watch for domains with random strings or uncommon TLDs; these may hint at tracking or malicious intent.
- Remember that some large platforms use multiple domains—for example, large cloud providers.

### Step 5: Use Data to Enhance Your Privacy

- If many third-party domains appear allowed, consider tightening your content blocker or reviewing filter lists.
- Stealth-blocked domains indicate blockers are working silently; a sudden shift to many allowed domains may signal blocker issues.
- Report suspicious or unexpected third-party domains to your blocker’s filter list maintainers or community forums.


## 3. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Start Simple:** Focus first on domains with the highest count in the "not blocked" category to understand their roles.
- **Leverage the Public Suffix List:** Remember uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List to normalize domains; top-level private domains aren’t split, providing consistent domain grouping.
- **Don’t Overreact:** Not all third-party domains are trackers or harmful; many are essential for website performance.
- **Keep Context in Mind:** Some sites vary their third-party connections based on features, so repeat checks as you interact.
- **Use Trusted Resources:** Use domain lookup tools or reputable online services to research unknown domains confidently.
- **Combine with Other Tools:** Use uBO Scope alongside your main content blocker popup or logs for a comprehensive understanding.


## 4. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Misinterpreting Badge Counts:** The badge shows allowed distinct third-party domains, not blocking strength or number of blocked requests.
- **Ignoring Stealth Blocking:** Blocking can be invisible to some tools; stealth-blocked counts in uBO Scope help you grasp this nuanced behavior.
- **Assuming All Third Parties Are Bad:** Content delivery providers and service partners often require network calls for legitimate reasons.
- **Overblocking Without Testing:** Removing or blocking domains blindly may break website functionality.


## 5. Troubleshooting and Reporting Issues

### If You See Unexpected Allowed Domains

- Ensure your content blocker and DNS filters are active and up to date.
- Review stealth-blocked lists; a drop could indicate stealth blocking is disabled or failing.
- Restart your browser or extension to clear stale session data.

### Reporting Suspicious Domains

- Use uBO Scope's domain names and connection counts as precise evidence.
- Include domain context and why you consider it suspicious (e.g., unrelated site, high connection count).
- Submit reports to filter list maintainers using official bug trackers or community channels.


## 6. Example User Scenario

_Jane is concerned about privacy when visiting news websites. She opens uBO Scope’s popup and notices multiple third-party domains under "not blocked" with high counts. Jane checks each domain’s reputation online and finds some are known ad servers. She adjusts her content blocker settings to block these domains and confirms via uBO Scope that subsequent visits no longer connect to them—improving her browsing privacy without breaking the site._
