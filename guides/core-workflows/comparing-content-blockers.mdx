# Comparing Content Blockers Accurately

## Workflow Overview

uBO Scope is your definitive tool to accurately compare the effectiveness of different content blockers by revealing the actual number and identity of remote server connections a browser tab initiates. This guide empowers you to interpret the extension's badge count and popup data meaningfully, avoiding common pitfalls and misleading conclusions based on superficial block metrics.

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and enabled on your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Basic familiarity with web browsing and extension usage.
- Access to at least two different content blockers installed for comparison.

### Expected Outcome

- Ability to objectively compare how many distinct third-party remote servers each content blocker allows.
- Understanding the true reliability beyond mere block count numbers.
- Skills to avoid common misconceptions and misleading benchmarks.

### Time Estimate

Approximately 10-15 minutes to gather and analyze data across blockers.

### Difficulty Level

Intermediate – requires awareness of content blocking principles and domain connection concepts.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Browsing Environment

- Ensure uBO Scope is installed and active.
- Install content blockers you want to compare (e.g., uBlock Origin, Adblock Plus).
- Restart your browser to ensure extensions load properly.

### 2. Open the Website to Test

- Navigate to a website you want to analyze.
- Allow the page to fully load.

### 3. Activate uBO Scope and Observe Badge Count

- Click the uBO Scope extension icon in the toolbar.
- Observe the badge number on the toolbar icon: this number represents the count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted.

### 4. Analyze Popup Interface Data

- In the popup, review three distinct sections:
  - **Not blocked:** Domains from which resources were successfully loaded.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains involved in redirects or stealth blocking (requests blocked silently).
  - **Blocked:** Domains whose requests were blocked outright.

- Note the number of distinct domains and request counts in each category.

### 5. Switch Content Blockers and Repeat the Process

- Disable the current content blocker.
- Enable the alternative content blocker.
- Reload the test webpage.
- Repeat the badge and popup examination.

### 6. Compare Results Objectively

- Contrast the badge count numbers between content blockers carefully:
  - A **lower badge count** indicates fewer distinct third-party connections, meaning better blocking effectiveness.
  - Beware that a **higher block count** in some blockers does not necessarily mean better blocking; it may reflect more allowed connections.
- Examine the actual domains in the popup lists to see which third parties are allowed or blocked.

### 7. Interpret Findings with Context

- Take into account the nature of allowed third parties; some content (like CDN domains) is typical and generally safe.
- Use uBO Scope to identify if a content blocker stealth blocks (silent blocking), which might not inflate block counts.
- Recognize that peak block count or test sites simulating synthetic ad calls are unreliable measures of real-world blocker performance.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Comparing Two Content Blockers on a News Site

- With Content Blocker A enabled, uBO Scope badge count shows 5 allowed third-party domains.
- Content Blocker B shows a badge count of 12 but blocks many via stealth mechanisms.
- Despite B's higher block count, more distinct domains are allowed; A provides stricter third-party control.

### Example 2: Avoiding Misleading "Ad Blocker Tests"

- Certain test sites intentionally create artificial ad domains that do not occur in normal browsing.
- uBO Scope reveals these test domains and their connection outcomes.
- Rely on real websites and the distinct third-party domains count instead of synthetic tests for assessment.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Why does the badge count differ from expected block counts?**
  - Badge shows distinct third-party domains, not the total number of blocked requests.
  - Some blocks might be stealth and don't add to badge count.

- **No data shown in the popup or zero badge count?**
  - Verify that the extension has proper permissions and is active.
  - Ensure the tested tab is active and a webpage is fully loaded.

- **Multiple content blockers show conflicting block counts?**
  - This can happen due to stealth blocking or implementation differences.
  - Use uBO Scope's distinct domain list for a clearer comparison.

- **Performance tip:**
  - Reloading the test page multiple times may show fluctuating counts; take an average for better assessment.
