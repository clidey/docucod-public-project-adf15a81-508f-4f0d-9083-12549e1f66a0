# Analyzing Third-Party Server Connections for Any Page

## Overview
This guide empowers you to assess third-party server connections made by any website using the uBO Scope browser extension. By understanding connection counts and the categorization into allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains, you will gain clear insights into your browsing privacy exposure. You'll learn why a lower number of connected third parties indicates better privacy and how to identify patterns that may reveal privacy risks or content blocker effectiveness.

---

## 1. Understanding the Workflow

### Task Description
Use uBO Scope to analyze the network behavior of any web page by observing all remote server connections attempted or completed by that page.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your web browser.
- Basic familiarity opening browser extensions and interacting with popups.

### Expected Outcome
- You will identify the number of third-party domains your active webpage connects to.
- You will understand how these connections are categorized (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).
- You can interpret these results to take action toward improving your privacy.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 5 minutes for initial assessment and interpretation.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner-friendly, with progressive detail to support intermediate users.

## 2. Using uBO Scope to Examine Third-Party Connections

Follow these actionable steps when visiting a website you want to inspect:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser. This opens the popup interface showing real-time network request summaries for the active tab.
- If the popup does not open or shows 'NO DATA', ensure the extension is enabled and the page was fully loaded.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Summary Count">
- At the top, observe the 'domains connected' count. This number represents how many unique third-party domains your current page connects to.
- Remember: **A lower count signals fewer third-parties involved, typically better for privacy.**
</Step>

<Step title="Explore the Categorized Domains">
- Scroll through the three main sections:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains from which connections were allowed and succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains whose connection attempts were suppressed or redirected silently.
  - **Blocked**: Domains from which connections were explicitly blocked due to errors or denials.
- Each domain line includes a count badge indicating the number of times resources were requested.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Domain Counts and Patterns">
- Domains with high request counts may indicate heavy third-party involvement.
- A high combined number of allowed + stealth-blocked third parties may reveal exposure or partial filtering.
- Investigate suspicious or unexpected domains potentially tracking or profiling.
</Step>

<Step title="Validate with Real Browsing Behavior">
- Navigate through various pages on the same website and observe how the domain lists and counts change.
- This dynamic inspection helps you identify persistent tracking domains versus situational third parties.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Verification
Confirm the popup updates instantly when navigating webpages, with the domain counts reflecting changes honestly.

## 3. Real-World Example
Imagine browsing a popular news site. When you open the uBO Scope popup:

- Summary shows **12 domains connected**.
- In **Not Blocked**, you see domains like `cdn.example-news.com` with 30 requests, and `fonts.provider.net` with 5 requests.
- Under **Stealth-Blocked**, domains such as `adtracker.example` appear, indicating some tracking attempts were silently stopped.
- The **Blocked** section contains domains like `malicious.ads.site` showing failed connection attempts.

This reveals your exposure footprint at a glance. You can then decide to add extra content blockers or adjust your settings to reduce allowed third parties.

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

- **Always interpret connection counts contextually**: Not all third parties are harmful; some provide essential services like CDNs.
- **Use stealth-block categories to spot subtle blocking**: Domains here could be trackers that have been silently circumvented or redirected.
- **Combine with content blockers**: Use uBO Scope alongside proven blockers for comprehensive privacy evaluation.
- **Reload pages fully** if domain counts seem stale or the popup shows no data.
- **Don’t rely solely on badge counts** on the toolbar; the detailed popup provides richer insight.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- **Popup shows NO DATA**: The page may not be fully loaded or background process delayed. Reload and wait a few seconds.
- **High domain counts on minimal sites**: Could be caused by background updates or extensions making requests. Cross-check by disabling other extensions.
- **Misinterpretation of blocked counts**: A higher block count does not always mean better blocking, as it may come from allowing more distinct third parties overall.

## 6. Troubleshooting

If you encounter problems viewing or interpreting third-party connections:

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Tips">
<Accordion title="Popup Not Showing Real-Time Data">
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled in your browser extension manager.
- Reload the active webpage to trigger fresh network capture.
- Check browser permissions allow webRequest access.
- For detailed help, see the [Troubleshooting Setup Guide](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/getting-started/first-run-validation/troubleshooting-setup.mdx).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Counts Seem Incorrect">
- Make sure you’re looking at the popup for the active tab.
- Close and reopen the browser to reset session data.
- Verify no conflicting extensions interfere with network request observation.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Next Steps

- **Deepen your understanding** by reviewing [Key Concepts & Terminology](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/overview/architecture-concepts/core-terms-concepts.mdx) to interpret domain categories precisely.
- **Explore installation and setup details** at [Installation: Step-by-Step](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/getting-started/intro-installation/install-instructions.mdx) if you have not installed uBO Scope yet.
- **Practice advanced workflows** by reading guides on [Comparing Content Blockers](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/guides/core-workflows/comparative-content-blocker-evaluation.mdx) and [Filterlist Verification](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/guides/core-workflows/filterlist-verification-workflow.mdx).
