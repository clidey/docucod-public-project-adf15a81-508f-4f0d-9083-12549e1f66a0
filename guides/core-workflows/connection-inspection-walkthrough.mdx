# Revealing Third-Party Connections on Any Page

Discover how uBO Scope helps you inspect all remote server connections from the active browser tab—both allowed and blocked. This guide walks you through interpreting the extension's popup interface, understanding the badge counts on the toolbar icon, and differentiating favorable from unwanted third-party domains encountered during everyday browsing.

---

## 1. What This Guide Helps You Accomplish

- **View detailed connection summaries** for the current active tab, showcasing all the third-party domains contacted by web pages.
- **Understand the badge count** on the extension icon as a measure of distinct allowed third-party domains.
- **Distinguish between connection outcomes**: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- **Interpret real-world browsing data** to identify necessary and potential privacy concerns.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, ensure:

- uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- You have granted required permissions, including `webRequest` and `activeTab`.
- The extension toolbar icon is visible and clickable.
- You have loaded the website/tab you want to analyze.

## 3. Understanding the Expected Outcome

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

- Open the uBO Scope popup and read the domain summary for any active tab.
- Know what the badge count represents and why lower is better.
- Differentiate allowed domains (connections made successfully), stealth-blocked domains (redirected connections detected but hidden), and blocked domains (connections blocked by content blockers or errors).

## 4. Quick Time and Difficulty Estimate

- Time: Approximately 5 minutes.
- Difficulty: Beginner to Intermediate.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup for the Active Tab

1. Navigate to the browser tab you want to inspect.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon near the address bar.
3. The popup window will open, displaying connection details for the active tab.

**Expected Result:** The popup interface appears with the domain summary and categorized connection lists.

---

### Step 2: Read the Domain Connected Summary

- At the top, observe the **domain header**, which shows the main site’s hostname along with its base domain.
- Below that, note the **summary count** displaying the number of distinct third-party domains connected to.

The badge count on the toolbar icon matches the number of unique third-party domains from which content was successfully loaded.

**Tip:** A smaller count indicates fewer external domains, improving privacy and reducing tracking exposure.

---

### Step 3: Interpret the Three Outcome Sections

The popup segregates connection domains into three categories:

1. **Not blocked (allowed)**
   - Domains that established connections successfully.
   - These represent allowed third-party servers from which your browser fetched resources.

2. **Stealth-blocked**
   - Domains where the connection was redirected or manipulated "silently" by content blockers.
   - These may not appear in other blocking statistics but indicate an interception occurred.

3. **Blocked**
   - Domains whose connections were actively blocked and failed to load resources.
   - Useful for verifying if your content blockers are effectively preventing unwanted connections.

Each domain entry shows the domain name and a count badge, indicating how many requests to that domain occurred.

---

### Step 4: Use the Badge Count Intelligently

- The toolbar icon badge number reflects the count of **allowed distinct third-party domains**.
- This is the most objective measure of third-party connections, unaffected by the number of blocked requests.

Understand that more requests or higher block counts do not necessarily mean better blocking efficacy. Aim for a **lower badge count** indicating fewer unique external domains contacted.

---

### Step 5: Explore Detailed Domain Information

You can visually scan the lists for domains you recognize as safe or potentially unwanted.

- Domains from major CDNs or first-party service providers are usually acceptable.
- Unknown or suspicious third-party domains may warrant further scrutiny or filter list additions.

---

## Practical Example

Suppose you visit a news website and open the uBO Scope popup:

- The summary shows “domains connected: 12.”
- In "Not Blocked," you see domains for common ad networks or analytics services.
- The "Stealth-blocked" list shows some questionable domains apparently prevented silently.
- "Blocked" contains domains your content blocker stopped outright, such as known trackers.

You decide to enhance your privacy by reviewing and possibly adding stealth-blocked or unknown domains into your filters.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or 'NO DATA' Message">
- Ensure the tab you are inspecting has completed loading.
- Check that uBO Scope has the required permissions, especially `webRequest`.
- Verify your browser supports the extension version installed.
- Reload the tab and reopen the popup.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
- Wait a few seconds; updates occur asynchronously with network activity.
- Confirm no browser restrictions or privacy settings block webRequest API usage.
- Restart the browser to refresh extension background scripts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Domain Counts or Results">
- Remember the count is third-party distinct domains, not individual requests.
- Some domains may appear multiple times under different sections due to redirects or errors.
- Consult the official GitHub repo issues for known bugs or updates.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Best Practices

- Regularly use uBO Scope to monitor sites you frequent.
- Pay special attention to stealth-blocked domains as they indicate silent content manipulation.
- Don't rely on block counts alone; focus on distinct allowed third-party domains.
- Combine observations with other privacy tools for comprehensive protection.
