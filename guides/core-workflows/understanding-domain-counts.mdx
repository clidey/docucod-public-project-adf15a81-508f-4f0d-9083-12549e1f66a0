# Understanding Connection and Domain Counts

This page explains how uBO Scope displays connection statistics through badge and popup counts, clarifies how the extension distinguishes successful from blocked network requests, and highlights why keeping the number of third-party servers low is key to privacy-focused browsing.

---

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
Understand how uBO Scope quantifies and reports third-party connections to remote servers for each browser tab, enabling you to interpret badge counts and popup summaries accurately for privacy insights.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your browser.
- Familiarity with opening the extension popup and observing the badge count.
- Active monitoring session with several websites loaded to generate connection data.

### Expected Outcome
- Clear understanding of what the badge number means.
- Ability to interpret the popup page's three outcome categories: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- Grasp why fewer third-party connections reflect better privacy practices.

### Time Estimate
~5 minutes to read and internalize concepts.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## Understanding Badge and Popup Counts

### Badge Counts
The badge number visible on the toolbar icon represents the total count of _distinct third-party domains_ that have had network connections _allowed_ for the current active browser tab.

- **Third-party domain** refers to any remote server domain different from the domain of the website you are visiting.
- Counting only domains with _allowed_ connections focuses your attention on the remote servers your browser actually communicated with, ignoring blocked or failing connections.

**Why is this important?**

A _lower badge count_ means fewer third-party servers successfully connected, generally indicating better privacy since fewer external entities are tracking or serving content.

### Popup Connection Summary
The popup interface categorizes connections to remote domains into three groups:

1. **Not blocked (Allowed)**
   - Domains contacted successfully.
   - Resources, such as images, scripts, or data, were fetched without interference.
2. **Stealth-blocked**
   - Connections that were silently redirected or modified in a way that prevents detection or access.
   - These are stealth-blocking events, often used by content blockers to avoid site breakage or detection.
3. **Blocked**
   - Connections that were explicitly blocked, either by uBO or other content blockers, generally resulting in errors.

In each section, uBO Scope lists _distinct domains_ and the count of requests made to each.

### How Counts Are Measured

- Upon each network request, uBO Scope extracts the hostname and derives the domain (top-level registered domain plus suffix) using the Public Suffix List.
- Counts track how many times each domain was contacted for _allowed_, _blocked_, or _stealth_ connections.
- The badge shows only the number of distinct allowed domains.

### Why Lower Third-Party Server Counts Are Desirable

- Every third-party connection represents a potential privacy risk through user tracking or data collection.
- Legitimate third parties (e.g., content delivery networks) are usually few.
- A high count implies more remote entities involved, possibly leading to invasions of privacy or unnecessary data leaks.

<Tip>
Aiming for a minimal number of third-party domains in the 'Allowed' category helps safeguard your privacy by reducing exposure to external servers.
</Tip>

## Step-by-Step Guide to Interpreting Counts

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar to open the popup.
- You should see the website's domain at the top and a summary with the total number of connected domains.
</Step>

<Step title="Read the Badge Count">
Observe the badge on the toolbar icon.
- This number equals the count of distinct third-party domains successfully connected on the current tab.
- An empty badge indicates no third-party connections allowed or data not yet collected.
</Step>

<Step title="Understand Popup Categories">
Explore the three sections: 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'.
- 'Not blocked' lists third-party domains from which content loaded successfully.
- 'Stealth-blocked' indicates connections suppressed in a subtle way to avoid detection or site breakage.
- 'Blocked' shows explicitly blocked domains.
</Step>

<Step title="Analyze Domain Counts">
Each domain in the sections shows how many network requests were made to it.
- Higher counts imply more interaction.
- Compare counts to assess which domains are most involved.
</Step>

<Step title="Make Privacy-Focused Decisions">
Use the insights to decide whether a website is making excessive third-party connections.
- Use uBO or other blockers to reduce unnecessary connections.
- Strive to keep the badge count low for better privacy.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Real-World Example

Imagine visiting an e-commerce site:

- The badge shows '12', indicating 12 distinct third-party domains have been connected.
- The popup lists domains in 'not blocked' including payment gateways and analytics providers.
- 'Stealth-blocked' may include trackers that the blocker suppressed invisibly.
- 'Blocked' might include ad servers.

This breakdown helps you assess how many external parties are interacting with your browser.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Issues

- **Badge not updating:** Reload the page or switch tabs, as count updates occur asynchronously.
- **No data in popup:** Ensure uBO Scope has necessary permissions (webRequest API access).
- **Unexpected high counts:** Check for browser tabs with heavy third-party resources, or temporarily disable other blockers to compare.

### Best Practices

- Regularly monitor your badge count to detect privacy regressions when visiting sites.
- Use the popup to identify which third parties are connected and consider blocking those not essential.
- Focus on reducing allowed third-party domains rather than only counting blocked connections.

---

## Summary

This page equips you to understand:

- The badge count as the number of allowed third-party domains connected.
- The categorization in the popup into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.
- The value of maintaining a low number of third-party server connections for privacy.

Use these insights to gain transparency over your web browsing network activity and take informed privacy-related actions.

## Additional Insights

uBO Scope relies on the browser's webRequest API to gather connections data, independent of any content blockers you have installed. It displays the _third-party domains_ that webpages attempt or succeed in connecting to, giving you a truthful picture of external network requests.

The notion of 'stealth-blocked' reflects more advanced, silent blocking techniques used by content blockers, often invisible to the website but tracked by uBO Scope for your awareness.

By carefully monitoring these counts, you take control over your privacy landscape.

Remember: a lower third-party connection count signals better privacy practices. Use uBO Scope as your transparent window into web network activity.
