# Understanding Toolbar Badge Counts

 uBO Scope's toolbar badge count presents a crucial, concise summary of your browser's third-party network connections for the active tab. This guide demystifies how this number is calculated, what it represents, and why a lower count signals better privacy and security.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### Task Description
Understand how uBO Scope computes and displays the toolbar badge count representing unique third-party domains contacted per browser tab.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and active on a supported browser (Chromium v122+, Firefox v128+, Safari v18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with how network requests work in browsers.
- Access to browse websites to observe badge changes in real-time.

### Expected Outcome
- Confident interpretation of the badge number on the extension toolbar icon.
- Ability to recognize what counts towards the badge and what does not.
- Understanding common exceptions and how to interpret edge cases.

### Time Estimate
5 to 10 minutes to read through with practical site checks.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate.

## 2. How uBO Scope Calculates the Badge Count

### What the Badge Represents
The badge count on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon is the **number of unique third-party domains** with which your current browser tab has established a network connection.

- **Third-party domain:** A domain different from the main website's domain currently open in the tab.
- Each unique domain is counted once regardless of multiple connections.

**Why does this matter?**
- Fewer third-party domains contacted generally indicate a smaller external footprint and greater privacy.
- The badge count shows only domains that were *actually contacted*, whether connections succeeded, were blocked stealthily, or otherwise.

### Determining Domain Counts from Network Requests
uBO Scope listens to your browser's network requests via the `webRequest` API and records:

- **Successful connections:** Network requests allowed and completed.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Requests silently blocked without breaking the page but reported by the browser.
- **Blocked connections:** Requests intercepted and blocked explicitly by content blockers or network interruptions.

It consolidates unique domains contacted according to these outcomes but **only counts domains from allowed (successful) connections toward the badge.**

### Key Calculation Rules
- The badge counts **only unique third-party domains contacted in the tab's lifetime**.
- The main page domain is excluded.
- Consecutive connections to the same domain count once.
- Redirects are attributed cautiously to avoid double counting.
- Domains contacted during sub-resource loading or scripts count if different from the main domain.

### Main Frame vs. Sub-Resource
- Network requests from the main page and embedded resources (scripts, images, frames) are tracked.
- Domains contacted in all these contexts update the badge count.

## 3. Interpreting the Toolbar Badge Count

### Why Lower Counts Are Better
- Lower badge counts mean fewer third-party connections and reduced tracking vectors.
- Popular websites often require some third-party domains (e.g., CDNs, analytics), so zero is rare.
- High counts often indicate numerous trackers or embedded ad networks.

### Common Misconceptions
- Badge count is **not** a block count. It reflects successful third-party domain connections.
- A lower block count on other extensions may not mean better blocking; the actual number of allowed domains reveals more about privacy impact.

<Tip>
Remember, the badge shows the **domains actually contacted**, not merely the ones requested or blocked. This gives a realistic picture of network exposure.
</Tip>

### Edge Scenarios and Clarifications

<AccordionGroup title="Understanding Edge Cases and Common Questions">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge sometimes show a number even if I use blockers?">
Because uBO Scope integrates with network reporting via the browser’s webRequest API, the badge counts domains for requests that passed through or were invisibly stealth-blocked by blockers. Some connections might be allowed for website functionality, resulting in nonzero counts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can the badge count show more domains than visible in the popup?">
Yes. The popup shows a detailed breakdown of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains, but the badge only reflects allowed domains. Some stealth-blocked domains may not appear in the badge count since they are not considered allowed connections.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why might the badge count differ from another extension's block count?">
Block counts indicate requests explicitly blocked by an extension, but do not reflect all network connections. uBO Scope’s badge reflects the unique domains with which the page successfully connected, providing a more direct and accurate privacy exposure measure.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if a domain redirects to a different third-party domain?">
Redirects count as stealth events internally and update connection records accordingly, ensuring the badge count reflects unique third-party domains actually contacted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are websocket connections counted?">
Yes. uBO Scope tracks network requests over HTTP(S) and WebSocket protocols, so websocket third-party domains contribute to the badge count.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 4. Practical Tips to Use the Badge Effectively

- **Monitor badge numbers when visiting different websites.** Lower numbers indicate tighter privacy.
- **Use alongside uBO Scope’s popup domain breakdown** for a detailed look into allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.
- **Reload pages to observe changes** in badge counts as you interact with the site.
- Use the badge count to **debunk common block count myths** by comparing with other blockers.

<Tip>
A rising badge count on a website may signal new third-party trackers or increased resource inclusion — keep awareness high.
</Tip>

## 5. Step-by-Step: Check and Interpret Badge Count on a Webpage

<Steps>
<Step title="Install and Enable uBO Scope">
Ensure uBO Scope is installed per instructions for your browser and activated with necessary permissions.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to a Website">
Browse to any website you want to analyze for third-party connections.
</Step>

<Step title="Observe Toolbar Badge">
Check the extension’s badge number on your browser’s toolbar. This shows how many unique third-party domains were contacted.
</Step>

<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup for Details">
Click the toolbar icon to open the popup showing detailed categorized lists of connected domains (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).
</Step>

<Step title="Compare Badge to Popup Summary">
Verify that the badge number matches the count of allowed domains in the popup’s summary.
</Step>

<Step title="Reload and Revalidate">
Refresh the webpage and watch the badge for any changes, confirming dynamic connection behavior.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### Badge Not Updating or Showing Empty
- Confirm uBO Scope has required permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).
- Ensure your browser version is supported.
- Reload the tab or restart the browser.
- Check for any conflicting extensions affecting network request reporting.

### Unexpectedly High Badge Count
- Some websites load many third-party services; check with uBO Scope popup to analyze which domains contribute.
- Consider that some services may operate as legitimate third parties (e.g., CDNs).

### Badge Count Remains Zero
- Verify the extension is active and permissions granted.
- Some local or offline sites may not trigger third-party connections.
- Web request visibility depends on browser APIs; some requests may not be detectable.

### Inconsistent Badge vs. Popup Data
- Popup data reflects categorized domains; badge shows only allowed unique domains.
- Reload the popup if stale data suspected.

<Warning>
The badge depends entirely on your browser’s `webRequest` API. Network requests outside this scope (e.g., browser internals, service workers outside scope) won’t be counted.
</Warning>
