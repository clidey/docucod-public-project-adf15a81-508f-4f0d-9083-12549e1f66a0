# Understanding Badge Counts and What They Mean

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide explains the logic behind the toolbar icon's badge count in uBO Scope. It clarifies how the badge reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connects to on the active tab, helping you understand your site exposure. It also debunks common misconceptions about interpreting block counts from content blockers.

### Prerequisites
- You must have uBO Scope installed and active in a supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- Familiarity with basic browsing and opening extension popups.
- Basic knowledge of what third-party connections mean in the context of web browsing.

### Expected Outcome
By the end of this guide, you will:
- Understand exactly what the badge count number on uBO Scope's toolbar icon represents.
- Be able to differentiate the badge count from generic "block counts" used by other blockers.
- Use this metric to evaluate your actual exposure to third-party servers during your browsing.
- Avoid common pitfalls and incorrect assumptions about content blockers’ reliability based on block numbers alone.

### Time Estimate
5–10 minutes

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## How Badge Counts Work in uBO Scope

The badge number shown on the uBO Scope toolbar icon represents the **count of distinct third-party remote servers** your browser has connected to during the current page load in the active tab.

### What Does "Distinct Third-Party Remote Servers" Mean?
- **Third-party**: Any server not belonging to the primary domain of the webpage you're visiting.
- **Remote server**: The hostnames grouped by their registered domain, determined using the Public Suffix List.
- **Distinct count**: The badge reflects how many unique third-party domains actually had network requests allowed (not blocked) or succeeded.

> This count is not simply the number of network requests but is a domain-level aggregation of connections.

### Why Domains and Not Requests?
Many web resources load multiple URLs from the same domain (e.g., multiple assets from `cdn.example.com`). Counting unique domains gives a clearer picture of external exposure rather than inflated numbers from repeated hits to a single domain.

### Example
If a visited page loads images, scripts, and stylesheets from these URLs:
- `https://cdn.fontawesome.com/icons.js`
- `https://cdn.fontawesome.com/styles.css`
- `https://analytics.trackersite.org/collect`

The badge count will be **2** because there are two distinct third-party domains involved:
- `fontawesome.com`
- `trackersite.org`

Even though the first domain hosts multiple files, it counts only once.

## Using the Badge Count to Evaluate Site Exposure

### What the Badge Count Tells You
- **Lower numbers are better**: Fewer third-party domains generally indicate less external tracking and potential exposure.
- **Higher numbers signal higher exposure**: Many third-party connections usually imply increased tracking, more potential privacy risk, or more extensive resource loading from external vendors.

### Practical Use Cases
- Quickly gauge how "clean" or private a website is regarding third-party connections.
- Monitor changes over time or across visits to identify third parties added or removed by site updates or blocked content.
- Compare different content blockers' impact on actual connected domains, not merely block event counts.

## Common Misconceptions Debunked

<u>**"More blocks mean a better content blocker."**</u>

This is false in the context of uBO Scope's badge count because:
- Block counts (number of requests blocked) can be misleading.
- A blocker with a high block count might still allow connections to more distinct third-party domains, increasing your exposure.
- The badge count in uBO Scope does **not** show blocks but the number of domains allowed (or contacted) — this reflects actual exposure and privacy risk.

<u>**"Ad blocker test pages reliably measure blocker effectiveness."**</u>

These test pages are often unrealistic:
- They don't represent real-world network behavior.
- They can't detect stealth blocking techniques employed by effective content blockers.
- Relying on them misleads users about true protection levels.

<u>**"The badge count reflects blocked connections or blocked domains."**</u>

- The badge count only shows distinct third-party domains **for which a network connection was allowed or successful.**
- Blocked or stealth-blocked network requests are not counted in the badge.
- Block counts should be reviewed separately in the popup interface.

## Step-by-Step: How to Use the Badge Count Effectively

<Steps>
<Step title="Observe the Toolbar Badge">
When you visit a website, look at the uBO Scope toolbar icon. The number displayed is the count of distinct third-party domains your browser communicated with on that page.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup for Details">
Click the toolbar icon to open the popup. Here, you view detailed summaries of domains grouped by outcome: not blocked (allowed), stealth-blocked, and blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Allowed Domains">
Focus on the 'not blocked' section to see which domains formed the basis of the badge count.
Each domain is listed with the number of requests (counts) from it.
</Step>
<Step title="Understand Stealth-blocked and Blocked Domains">
Review these to understand which third-party domains were prevented from connecting or stealth-blocked, but remember these do not affect the badge number.
</Step>
<Step title="Use the Badge Count to Evaluate Exposure">
Use the badge number as a quick, at-a-glance metric of your privacy exposure on each tab or site. Lower numbers generally mean fewer third-party connections.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Reload the page** if the badge count seems unexpectedly high or low to ensure all network requests are tracked accurately.
- **Don't compare badge counts across different sites** without context; some sites naturally use more third-party content.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your primary content blocker to gain visibility into what's actually connecting rather than just what's blocked.
- Pay attention to domains loading large counts of resources — they have outsized impact on site behavior and potential tracking.
- If the badge displays no number (blank), it means zero distinct third-party domains have connected, indicating minimal exposure.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues">
<Accordion title="Why is the badge count missing or not updating?">
- Ensure uBO Scope has the required permissions (see installation docs).
- Verify your browser version supports the extension.
- Reload tabs or restart the browser if needed.
- Check for conflicting extensions that block network requests before uBO Scope can observe.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count seem inconsistent with popup details?">
- The badge count only considers distinct allowed domains, not blocked or stealth-blocked.
- The popup shows detailed breakdowns—blocked domains won’t appear in the badge count.
- Differences can also occur if a site dynamically loads or unloads content during navigation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some legitimate third-party domains appear in the count?">
- CDNs and necessary third-party services often appear; this is normal.
- Focus on overall exposure rather than eliminating all third parties.
- Review domain lists to identify any unfamiliar or suspicious domains.

- Lower counts indicate fewer external connections and better privacy.
- Block counts and badge counts are fundamentally different metrics; the badge does not measure blocks.
- Use the popup interface to explore details behind the badge count.
