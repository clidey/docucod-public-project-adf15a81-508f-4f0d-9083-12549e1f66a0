# Revealing All Remote Server Connections

## Overview
This guide shows you how to use uBO-Scope to discover every domain and hostname a webpage connects to, whether the connection is attempted or successful. You will learn to differentiate between first-party and third-party servers, enabling you to assess your privacy exposure effectively.

---

## What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
- Understand how uBO-Scope collects and displays network connection data.
- Map all remote server connections made by a webpage.
- Identify which connections are first-party (same domain as the webpage) versus third-party (external domains).
- Use this knowledge to evaluate your privacy and security risks.

---

## Prerequisites
- uBO-Scope installed in your supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- A webpage/tab that you want to analyze actively loaded.
- No special configuration needed; uBO-Scope works automatically once installed.

## Expected Outcome
After following this guide, you will be able to open the uBO-Scope popup and see a comprehensive list of all domains and hostnames contacted by the current webpage, categorized by whether they were blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed.

You will be able to interpret:
- The total count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- The difference between requests to first-party domains (your site) and external servers.
- The types of requests and their outcomes, providing insight into potential privacy risks.

## Time Estimate
5–10 minutes to open and confidently interpret the uBO-Scope popup data for any page.

## Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate. No technical knowledge beyond basic browser usage is required.

# Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the Target Webpage
Ensure the webpage for which you want to see remote connections is fully loaded in your browser tab.

### Step 2: Open the uBO-Scope Popup
- Click the uBO-Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
- The popup will open, showing network connection data for the active tab.

### Step 3: Understand the Popup Layout
- At the top, the current tab's hostname and domain are displayed.
- Below, you see three sections:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains where network requests were allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were blocked stealthily (often to prevent detection).
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests were outright blocked.
- At the very top, a summary count shows the total number of distinct third-party domains contacted.

### Step 4: Identify First-Party vs Third-Party Connections
- The domain at the top represents the _first-party_ domain — typically the website you are visiting.
- Domains listed beneath are usually _third-party_ connections, external servers the page reached out to.
- A lower number of third-party domains generally means fewer external connections and better privacy.

### Step 5: Examine Each Category
- **Not Blocked:** These connections succeeded and were not intercepted by your content blockers.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** These connections were blocked without revealing the block to the webpage, which helps prevent anti-blocker techniques.
- **Blocked:** Connections that clearly failed due to blocking. These may include trackers or unwanted third parties.

### Step 6: Interpret Connection Details
- Each domain entry shows how many distinct requests were made.
- Larger counts highlight domains the page interacts with more frequently.

### Step 7: Use Insights for Privacy Assessment
- Frequent connection to many third-party domains can signal extensive tracking.
- Identifying which domains are third-party helps you decide if additional blocking or privacy actions are necessary.

# Practical Examples

### Example: Checking a News Website
1. Open a news home page.
2. Click the uBO-Scope icon.
3. Notice the main domain at the top, e.g., `news-site.com`.
4. See a list under “Not Blocked” that includes domains like `cdn.example.com` or `ads.network.com`.
5. Recognize `cdn.example.com` as a content delivery network (possibly first or related party).
6. Note `ads.network.com` is a third-party advertising domain — a privacy risk.
7. Look at stealth-blocked and blocked domains — these may be tracking servers your content blocker caught.

### Example: Comparing Connection Counts for Privacy Evaluation
You visit two e-commerce sites, opening uBO-Scope on each.
- Site A shows 3 third-party domains connected.
- Site B shows 15 third-party domains connected.

You can infer Site B exposes you to more external tracking and potential data sharing.

# Tips & Best Practices
- **Refresh the popup after page loads:** uBO-Scope updates connection data only after the page finishes loading.
- **Use the badge count as a quick privacy gauge:** The toolbar badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Remember a lower count is better:** Fewer third-party connections mean fewer opportunities for tracking.
- **Understand some third parties are legitimate:** Content delivery networks (CDNs) and analytics providers may be necessary for site functionality.
- **Combine with content blocker settings:** Use uBO-Scope insights to fine-tune your blocker configuration.

# Common Pitfalls
- **No data displayed:** Make sure you have loaded a webpage first; uBO-Scope collects data per tab.
- **Misinterpreting first-party as third-party:** The domain shown at the top is the first-party; everything else is third-party.
- **Expecting real-time updates:** uBO-Scope batches network request outcomes; some delay may occur.

# Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Remote Connections Analysis">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA">
- Confirm you have an active webpage loaded.
- Try refreshing the page to force network data capture.
- Verify uBO-Scope extension permissions are granted (storage, webRequest).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count is Empty or Unexpectedly High">
- Badge counts reflect distinct third-party domains with allowed connections.
- If no third-party connections exist, badge will be blank.
- A high number means many third-party servers were connected; check popup for details.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Results Seem Incomplete">
- Some network requests might be missed if browser does not report them via webRequest API.
- Network activity from service workers, WebSockets, or other protocols may vary by browser.
- Reload the page and wait a few seconds, then reopen the popup.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Understanding How uBO-Scope Maps Connections

Under the hood, uBO-Scope listens to every network request (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket) triggered by your webpage:
- It extracts the hostname from the request URL.
- Domains are normalized using a public suffix list to correctly determine registrable domains.
- Requests are categorized based on the request outcome: allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Data is stored and presented per browser tab.

This approach ensures you get an accurate map of all servers your browser attempts to connect to while loading a page.
