# Analyzing Allowed, Stealth, and Blocked Domains

## Overview

This guide explains how to use uBO Scope to identify and analyze the different categories of third-party domains connected by the current web page. You'll learn how to distinguish between **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** domains based on connection outcomes, and how these statuses reflect in the uBO Scope popup UI and badge count.

Understanding these domain categories empowers you to assess your privacy posture more accurately and investigate network requests made by websites you visit.

---

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Access to the browser toolbar extension icon to open the uBO Scope popup.
- An active browser tab with a loaded web page to analyze.

---

## Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will be able to:

- Interpret the categorization of third-party domains on the uBO Scope popup.
- Explore detailed counts and names of domains that were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- Use domain status to understand resource loading behavior and privacy implications.

## Understanding Domain Categories

### Allowed Domains
These are third-party domains from which your browser successfully fetched resources without blocking. The count of allowed domains drives the extension badge number and indicates how many distinct third-party domains are actively connected.

### Stealth-Blocked Domains
These represent domains where network requests were redirected in a way that evades detection by content blockers but are recognized by uBO Scope due to monitoring through the browser's `webRequest` API. These stealth connections indicate resources that might be circumventing your current content blocking filters.

### Blocked Domains
Domains for which requests were explicitly blocked or failed, intercepted by content blockers or the browser before completion. These show where potentially unwanted or restricted content requests occur.

<Tip>
Remember: A higher block count _does not_ necessarily mean better privacy protection. uBO Scope focuses on unique third-party domains connected, which is a more meaningful privacy indicator than block counts alone.
</Tip>

## Step-by-Step Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup panel will appear showing network connection data for the current active tab.
3. If the panel shows `NO DATA`, reload the web page and try again.

<Check>Data should load promptly; if not, verify extension activation and permissions.</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Review Domain Summary">
1. Locate the **domains connected** summary at the top.
2. This number corresponds to the count of **allowed** third-party domains.

<Info>The badge on the toolbar icon matches this count, representing actively connected third-party domains.</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Explore Allowed Domains">
1. Scroll to the section titled **not blocked**.
2. Review the list of domains from which resources were successfully fetched by the page.
3. Each domain shows a count representing how many requests succeeded.
</Step>
<Tip>Allowed domains typically include first-party services and legitimate third parties such as CDNs.</Tip>

<Step title="Explore Stealth-Blocked Domains">
1. Find the section labeled **stealth-blocked**.
2. Examine domains listed here; these involve redirect events caught by uBO Scope that might bypass normal blocker visibility.
3. Counts reflect how many requests fall into this stealth category.

<Warning>This often signals tricky or novel blocking circumvention methods; extra vigilance is advised.</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Explore Blocked Domains">
1. Go to the **blocked** section.
2. Review the domains whose requests were stopped or failed.
3. Counts indicate the number of blocked requests per domain.

<Note>Blocked domains may include trackers, ads, or unwanted content sources filtered by your browser or extensions.</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Results and Make Decisions">
1. Use the combined domain data to reason about your browsing privacy.
2. A lower count of allowed domains generally reflects better privacy hygiene.
3. Notice stealth-blocked domains as candidates for further inspection or filter list updates.

<Tip>For filter list maintainers, stealth and blocked domains offer valuable signals for rule tuning.</Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Typical News Website

- Allowed domains include the main site domain and trusted CDNs.
- A few stealth-blocked domains are present, suggesting some load balancing or proxy techniques.
- Several blocked domains correspond to ad servers.

### Example 2: Privacy-Focused Site

- Almost all third-party domains appear in the blocked or stealth-blocked lists.
- Allowed domain count is low or zero, indicating minimal external resource fetching.

### Viewing in Popup

The popup UI displays all three categories with counts and domain names, allowing quick inspection and comparison.

---

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Reload pages** before analysis to ensure all network events are captured.
- **Interpret counts** as distinct third-party domains, not simply total requests.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker for privacy auditing, not as a blocker itself.
- Investigate stealth-blocked domains carefully; these may signal bypasses or new tracking techniques.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **No data shown in popup**: Verify uBO Scope permissions (`webRequest`, host permissions) and that the extension is active.
- **Misunderstanding badge counts**: Badge shows allowed distinct third-party domains, _not_ blocked or total requests.
- **Expecting real-time updates instantly**: Network data processing batches requests with a short delay (~1 second).

---

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Confirm extension is enabled and has required permissions.
- Reload the web page and reopen the popup.
- Check browser console for errors related to uBO Scope.
- Visit the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](https://example.com/getting-started/troubleshooting/common-issues) guide.
