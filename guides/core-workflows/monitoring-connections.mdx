# Monitoring Third-party Connections: A Practical Guide

## Overview

This guide helps you monitor and understand network activity on any webpage using **uBO Scope**. By following practical examples and workflows, you'll learn how to reveal which third-party servers your browser contacts, which connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked, and how to interpret these insights to enhance your privacy understanding.

This guide is focused exclusively on using the uBO Scope extension’s monitoring capabilities as presented through its popup interface and badge, showing real-world scenarios and outcomes when browsing websites under various content-blocking conditions.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Installed the uBO Scope extension in your browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- Opened and accessed the extension popup panel on an active browser tab.
- Familiarity with basic browsing and navigating browser extension popups.


## What You Will Achieve

By following this guide, you will:

- Identify third-party domain connections initiated by websites you visit.
- Understand the difference between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.
- Interpret the badge count on the toolbar icon and relate it to third-party domain diversity.
- Use uBO Scope as a privacy auditing tool across different content blockers or DNS-level filtering.

Estimated time to complete: 5-10 minutes

Difficulty level: Beginner to Intermediate

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Open a Webpage and Access uBO Scope Popup

- Navigate to any webpage in your browser.
- Click the uBO Scope extension icon in the browser toolbar to open the popup panel.

**Expected Result:** The popup displays the hostname and domain of the current tab, along with summaries of domains contacted.


### 2. Interpret the Toolbar Badge

- Look at the badge count displayed on the uBO Scope icon.
- This number represents the **count of distinct third-party remote servers** contacted by the current webpage.

**Remember:** A lower number generally means fewer third-party connections, which is preferable for privacy.


### 3. Review Domain Categories in the Popup

The popup organizes domains into three categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains with network requests that were successful and not blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or stealthily blocked, typically by stealth methods used by some blockers.
- **Blocked:** Domains with requests explicitly blocked, including failures or errors.

Each domain shows how many times it was contacted.


### 4. Analyze the Domain Breakdown

- Pay attention to the **number of distinct domains** in each category.
- Compare allowed vs blocked domains to understand what kind of third-party connections get through.
- Identify if any stealth-blocked domains indicate subtle blocking methods in use by content blockers.


### 5. Use Real-World Examples

Try visiting different types of websites (news, e-commerce, social media) and observe:

- How many third-party servers they contact.
- Whether your content blocker is effectively reducing allowed third-party connections.
- If stealth-blocking is happening, hinting at more advanced blocking techniques.


### 6. Understanding Edge Cases

- If the badge count is zero but you expect third-party connections, verify if your content blocker or DNS filtering prevents the browser from reporting webRequests.
- Consider that some network calls made outside the browser's `webRequest` API cannot be tracked.


## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use the badge count as an overall privacy indicator rather than raw block counts shown by blockers.
- Repeatedly test across various sites to build intuition on typical third-party loads.
- Understand that some legitimate CDNs or services will always appear due to essential functionality.
- Utilize this tool to compare effectiveness of privacy tools by focusing on actual distinct third-party servers contacted.


## Common Pitfalls

- Confusing total block counts from other blockers with uBO Scope’s count of allowed connections.
- Expecting real-time updates instantly — uBO Scope processes requests in short batches (~1 second delay).
- Assuming zero badge count means no third-party tracking; certain network calls may not be visible due to browser API limitations.


## Troubleshooting

- **Popup shows NO DATA:** 
  - Ensure you have an active tab with networking activity.
  - Close and reopen the popup or refresh the page.
- **Badge not updating:** 
  - Check permissions and that the extension is enabled.
  - Try restarting the browser.
- **Unusual domain listings:**
  - Some domains may appear due to CDN services or third-party tools legitimately used by the website.


## Real-World Scenario

Imagine you visit a news website:

- You click the uBO Scope popup; it instantly shows:
  - 3 allowed third-party domains like CDN providers.
  - 1 stealth-blocked domain indicating some content is being silently blocked.
  - 2 blocked domains from ad servers.
- The badge count reads '3', reflecting allowed third-party servers.
- This indicates the content blocker is effectively reducing your exposure.

Using this insight, you can cross-reference with your content blocker’s block lists or experiment with different block lists to optimize privacy.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup title="FAQ">
<Accordion title="What does the badge number exactly represent?">
The badge shows the count of unique third-party remote domains that had requests allowed (successful connections). A lower number means fewer third parties were contacted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What are stealth-blocked domains?">
Stealth-blocked domains are those where requests were prevented or redirected using stealth mechanisms common in some content blockers, which may not be visible in typical block logs but are detected by uBO Scope.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why are some blocked domains still listed?">
uBO Scope reports all attempts, including those explicitly blocked or failed. This helps you see all the third parties your browser tried to connect to regardless of block success.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope depend on the content blocker I use?">
No. uBO Scope monitors network requests at the browser level via the `webRequest` API and reflects outcomes independently of any content blocker applied.
