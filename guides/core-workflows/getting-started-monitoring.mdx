# Getting Started: Monitoring Connections with uBO Scope

Welcome to your practical introduction to uBO Scope! This guide navigates you through installing the extension, using the popup UI, and understanding the real-time data it reveals about all remote server connections your browser attempts or successfully establishes on any webpage. You'll learn how to quickly interpret allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains displayed in the popup, empowering you to gain clear insights about third-party connections.

---

## 1. What You Will Achieve

- **Install uBO Scope** on your supported browser.
- **Open and use the popup UI** to view connection counts and domain categorizations.
- **Understand the meaning of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains** in the context of your browsing.
- **Interpret the badge count and details** to make informed decisions about your privacy exposure.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following:

- You are using a supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your browser. For installation instructions, see [Installing uBO Scope](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/installing-ubo-scope).
- The extension has the necessary permissions granted (activeTab, storage, webRequest).

---

## 3. Installing and Preparing uBO Scope

If you have not installed uBO Scope yet, please follow these steps first:

### Installing the Extension

1. Open your browser's official extension store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari Extensions Gallery).
2. Search for "uBO Scope".
3. Add the extension to your browser.
4. Confirm installation and check the toolbar icon for the uBO Scope logo.

### Initial Configuration

- Pin the extension to your toolbar for easy access.
- Ensure permissions are granted when prompted to enable network monitoring.
- For detailed installation and configuration, refer to [Initial Configuration](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/initial-configuration).

<Tip>
Pinning the extension icon to your toolbar ensures you can quickly see the badge count and access the popup at any time.
</Tip>

## 4. Using the Popup UI to Monitor Connections

The popup UI is your window into all the network connections your browser attempts on a particular tab. Here's how to get started:

### Opening the Popup

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- The popup will load and display data specific to the active tab.

### What You See in the Popup

The popup is split into several clear sections:

- **Domain Header:** Displays the hostname and domain of the tab you are monitoring.
- **Summary:** Shows the total count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Outcome Sections:** Divided into three vertical groups:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Third-party domains from which connections succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or intercepted stealthily.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were explicitly blocked.

Each domain entry in the outcome sections includes:

- The domain name (decoded to Unicode for readability).
- A count of how many connection attempts were observed for that domain during the tab’s lifetime.

## 5. Step-by-Step: Interpreting Popup Data

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a New Website Tab">

Navigate to any website you wish to inspect in your browser.

<center><strong>Outcome:</strong> The site loads as normal.

</center>
</Step>

<Step title="Click on the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon">

Click the extension icon to open the popup for the current tab.

<center><strong>Outcome:</strong> The popup displays the hostname at the top and connection data below.

</center>
</Step>

<Step title="Read the Badge Count">

Look at the badge number on the toolbar icon itself (outside the popup). This number represents the count of distinct third-party domains successfully connected (allowed).

<center><strong>Outcome:</strong> A numeric badge reflecting distinct allowed third-party connections.

</center>
</Step>

<Step title="Check the 'Not Blocked' Section">

Observe the list of domains under the 'not blocked' heading which shows domains your browser successfully connected to.

<center><strong>Outcome:</strong> You see domains like CDN providers or analytics servers that the site is loading resources from.

</center>
</Step>

<Step title="Review the 'Stealth-Blocked' Section">

Check domains listed under 'stealth-blocked' — these connections were redirected or implicitly blocked by stealth mechanisms (such as filters that avoid detection).

<center><strong>Outcome:</strong> Domains which remain hidden from normal detection but were intercepted.

</center>
</Step>

<Step title="Observe the 'Blocked' Section">

Review explicitly blocked domains that uBO Scope detected connections attempting but that were prevented.

<center><strong>Outcome:</strong> Domains representing known unwanted or filtered endpoints.

</center>
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Counts for Each Domain">

Note the count badges next to each domain indicating how many requests were made to that domain during your session.

<center><strong>Outcome:</strong> Better understanding of how heavily a given third party is involved in site activity.

</center>
</Step>

</Steps>

<Tip>
The popup dynamically updates as you browse. Opening the popup on different tabs will show data specific to each.
</Tip>

## 6. Practical Scenario

Imagine browsing a news website. Opening the uBO Scope popup reveals 7 allowed third-party domains — mostly CDN providers and trackers. You also see 3 stealth-blocked domains, indicating some connections were redirected or hidden by filters. Finally, 2 blocked domains show known ad servers were prevented. This clear breakdown reassures you about what is happening under the hood of your browsing.

---

## 7. Best Practices & Tips

- **Regularly check the badge count and popup:** It helps you track changes as you visit different sites.
- **Understand that not all third-party connections are bad:** Many are essential CDNs or legitimate services.
- **Use stealth-blocked and blocked sections to evaluate your content blockers:** If stealth-blocked domains grow, your filters may be redirecting more requests stealthily.
- **Reload tabs if the popup shows stale or 'no data' information.**

<Note>
The badge count reflects only distinct allowed third-party domains and does not count first-party or allowed same-domain connections.
</Note>

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Connection Monitoring">
<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty lists">
If the popup doesn't display connection data:

- Confirm the extension is installed and active.
- Reload the tab you are inspecting.
- Check if the extension has required permissions (see [Initial Configuration](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/initial-configuration)).
- Restart your browser if issues persist.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count does not update">
- Make sure you have the latest version of the extension.
- Verify your browser version is supported.
- Confirm other blockers or DNS filters are not interfering with permission reporting.
- Consult [Badge and Popup Troubleshooting](/getting-started/troubleshooting/ui-troubleshooting) for detailed steps.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains shown but counts look unexpected">
- Counts represent how many connection requests were observed; some high counts may result from repeated requests.
- Stealth-blocked and blocked domains are not included in the badge count; only allowed domains affect it.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Appendix: Popup UI Example

Below is a simplified conceptual view of the popup content on visiting a typical site:

```plaintext
Host: example.com

Domains connected: 5

Not Blocked:
- cdn.examplecdn.com (12)
- analytics.tracker.com (3)

Stealth-Blocked:
- stealth1.blocked.com (1)

Blocked:
- adserver.badads.net (2)
```

Each domain followed by a count shows how many connections uBO Scope detected during your page session.
