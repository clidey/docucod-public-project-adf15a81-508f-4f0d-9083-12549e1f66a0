## Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### 1. Choose Your Browser and Install uBO Scope

<u>Supported Browsers & Installation Sources:</u>

| Browser | Installation Source |
|---------|--------------------|
| Chrome  | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox | [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |
| Safari  | Safari Extensions Gallery or from the developer’s site as applicable |

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Action:</span> Navigate to the respective link and install the extension.


### 2. Confirm Extension Installation

- Upon successful installation, you will see the **uBO Scope** icon in your browser toolbar represented by the extension logo.
- If the icon is not immediately visible, check your browser’s extensions panel and pin the uBO Scope extension to your toolbar for easy access.


### 3. Understand Permissions Required

- uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor network traffic, including `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`.
- These permissions allow the extension to observe all outgoing web connections in real-time.


### 4. Open the Popup Interface

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- The popup window displays information broken down into sections reflecting the state of connection outcomes:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which connections were allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with network requests blocked stealthily.
  - **Blocked:** Domains with explicitly blocked network requests.


### 5. Recognize and Interpret the Badge Count

- The badge number on the toolbar icon represents the count of distinct third-party domains from which network connections were successfully established on the current tab.
- A lower badge count signals fewer third-party connections, typically indicating a higher degree of network privacy for the active tab.


### 6. Test the Extension

- Navigate to a webpage with diverse third-party resources, such as news sites or social media platforms.
- Observe the badge count updating dynamically to reflect third-party connections observed.
- Open the popup to see categorized domain lists based on network request outcomes.


## What to Expect in the Popup Interface

### Header Section

- Displays the hostname of the current active tab or 'NO DATA' if there is none.

### Summary Section

- Shows the total number of distinct domains connected.

### Outcome Sections

- Domains are grouped into three categories:
  1. **Not Blocked:** Domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
  2. **Stealth-Blocked:** Networks requests blocked in a manner designed to minimize detection.
  3. **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked network requests.

- Each domain listed includes a count badge indicating the number of requests to that domain.


## Practical Tips for Your First Use

- Visit websites with varied content to see how the badge count fluctuates with different third-party connections.
- Use the categorized domain lists to identify unexpected or unwanted third-party connections.
- Remember that some third-party domains like CDN providers are normal and not necessarily a privacy risk.

<Tip>
If the badge count is zero on pages you expect connections from, reload the tab or ensure the extension has the correct permissions granted.
</Tip>

<Note>
The badge updates per active tab—switching tabs will update the badge count accordingly.
</Note>

    - Your browser supports the required APIs and is updated to the minimum version.
    Reload the tab after confirming these points.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA'">
    This usually indicates no network requests tracked yet for the active tab.
    - Wait a few seconds for data to accumulate.
    - Reload the page.
    - Switch to another tab with network activity.
  </Accordion>
