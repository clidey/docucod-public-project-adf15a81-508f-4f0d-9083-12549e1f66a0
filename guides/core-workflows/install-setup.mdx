# Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope

Welcome to your definitive guide on installing and setting up **uBO Scope** — the browser extension designed to give you unparalleled visibility into network connections your browser makes. This guide walks you through every step: from locating the extension for your browser, installing it correctly, completing the initial setup, and verifying that uBO Scope is actively monitoring your browsing sessions.

---

## 1. What This Guide Covers

- How to install uBO Scope on supported browsers (Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, Safari)
- Initial setup details and automated configuration aspects
- Verifying that the extension is active and working properly
- Notes on platform-specific nuances and permissions


## 2. Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure the following:

- You are using one of the supported browsers:
  - **Chromium-based Browsers:** Chrome (version 122.0+), Edge, Brave, etc.
  - **Mozilla Firefox:** Version 128.0 or higher (including Firefox for Android)
  - **Apple Safari:** Version 18.5 or higher
- Your browser allows installing extensions from official stores
- You have internet connectivity to access the extension stores


## 3. Supported Browsers and Installation Sources

| Browser                 | Where to Install From                                      |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium (Chrome, Edge) | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox                 | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)          |
| Safari                  | Safari Extensions Gallery (via macOS Safari Extensions Preferences)


## 4. Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Open Your Browser’s Extension/Add-ons Store

- Open Chrome or any Chromium-based browser and navigate to the Chrome Web Store.
- Open Firefox and go to the Firefox Add-ons page.
- For Safari, access Safari Extensions preferences and search for uBO Scope.


### Step 2: Search for "uBO Scope"

Locate the official extension by Raymond Hill (author of uBlock Origin).


### Step 3: Add/Install the Extension

- Click **Add to Browser** (Chrome) or **Add to Firefox**.
- Confirm any permission requests prompted by the browser.


### Step 4: Confirm Installation

Once installed, you should see the uBO Scope icon appear near your address bar (toolbar).


## 5. Initial Setup and First Launch Behavior

Once installed, uBO Scope operates silently in the background monitoring network requests automatically—no manual configuration required.

- The extension requests access to **webRequest** API to observe network requests.
- It monitors all HTTP(S) and WebSocket network connections initiated by pages you visit.
- You can open the extension’s popup interface by clicking its icon to inspect connection summaries.


## 6. Verifying the Extension is Active

To ensure uBO Scope is correctly installed and monitoring network connections:

1. **Locate the Toolbar Icon:** Look for the uBO Scope logo (colorful shield-like icon).
2. **Badge Count:** The icon badge shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected to by the active tab; if browsing active websites, this number typically changes dynamically.
3. **Open the Popup Panel:** Click the icon. The popup displays tabs for "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" domains.

If the popup shows "NO DATA," this indicates no monitored connections yet for the current tab or the extension is not fully initialized.


## 7. Platform-Specific Notes

### Chromium-based Browsers

- Minimum Chrome version required is **122.0**.
- The extension runs a background service worker to track requests.
- Permissions include `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`. These are automatically requested by the browser.

### Firefox

- Requires Firefox version **128.0+** (including Firefox for Android).
- Background scripts run with module support.
- Permissions: `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
- Firefox handles background scripts differently but transparently.

### Safari

- Requires Safari version **18.5+**.
- The extension uses the Safari Web Extension framework with background scripts loaded as modules.
- Some network request events might be limited compared to Chromium or Firefox.


## 8. Practical Tips for a Smooth Setup

- Always install uBO Scope from official browser extension stores to ensure authenticity and automatic updates.
- Restart your browser after installation to make sure all background components initialize.
- On first use, avoid multiple conflicting extensions that also hook into webRequest or network events to prevent interference.
- If the extension icon or badge is missing, verify that it is enabled in the browser’s extension settings.


## 9. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues
