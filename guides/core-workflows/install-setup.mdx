3. Accept permissions and confirm installation.

### Step 3: Configure Browser Permissions

uBO Scope requires these permissions:
- Access to active tabs.
- Storage access for saving session data.
- Use of `webRequest` API to monitor network activity.

These permissions are requested automatically during installation.

**Verify permissions:**
- Chromium: `chrome://extensions/` > uBO Scope > Details > Permissions.
- Firefox: `about:addons` > Extensions > uBO Scope > Preferences or Permissions.
- Safari: Safari Preferences > Extensions > uBO Scope > check all boxes are enabled.

<Warning>
If any permission is disabled or missing, uBO Scope will not function correctly. Ensure all listed permissions are granted.
</Warning>

---

### Step 4: Confirm Installation and Extension Status

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar. It resembles the extension logo.
2. Click the icon to open the popup interface.
3. Observe that the badge either shows a number representing distinct third-party remote servers or is blank (0) if no network requests yet.
4. Refresh a website to observe dynamic badge updates and popup information.

<Check>
If the icon is missing:
- Confirm the extension is enabled in your browser's extension manager.
- Restart your browser.
- Refer to the troubleshooting guide "Solving Installation Problems" if problems persist.
</Check>

---

### Step 5: Understand the Toolbar Badge

- The badge displays the **number of distinct third-party domains** contacted by the current tab.
- A **lower number is better**, indicating fewer third-party connections which typically benefits privacy.
- The count updates dynamically as you browse.

<Info>
Not all third parties are harmful; common legitimate connections include CDNs and embedded services.
</Info>

## 3. Best Practices and Tips

- Install uBO Scope alongside content blockers to gain an independent view of active network connections.
- Regularly refresh pages after installation to trigger network activity and validate badge updates.
- Avoid relying on block counts alone for privacy assessment; uBO Scope focuses on distinct domain connections.
