# Troubleshooting Unexpected Server Connections

This guide provides a practical, step-by-step approach to identifying and resolving unexpected or suspicious third-party server connections reported by uBO Scope. By leveraging the data presented in the extension’s popup interface, you can diagnose privacy or security concerns and take informed actions to manage or mitigate unwanted network activity.

---

## 1. Understanding Why Unexpected Connections Appear

Before troubleshooting, it’s important to grasp why uBO Scope may show more third-party servers connected than you expect:

- **Legitimate third-party servers:** Many sites rely on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), analytics, fonts, or APIs hosted externally, increasing the count naturally.
- **Stealth-blocked vs Allowed:** Some connections are stealth-blocked by your content blocker or browser mechanisms, showing up in a separate category but still indicating attempted connections.
- **Dynamic Content:** Modern webpages dynamically load resources from various domains depending on user interactions, region, or ad campaigns.
- **Browser Extensions or Apps:** Other extensions or apps in your environment may trigger network requests unrelated to the webpage.

<u>This troubleshooting focuses on diagnosing and handling surprising allowed and stealth-blocked connections seen in the popup interface.</u>

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- You have uBO Scope installed and running on a supported browser (Chromium ≥122, Firefox ≥128, Safari ≥18.5).
- You understand the meaning of the popup interface categories: _allowed_, _stealth-blocked_, and _blocked_ (see [Understanding the Popup Interface](./understanding-the-popup)).
- You can access the extension popup while browsing the site where unexpected connections appear.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

Follow these practical steps to investigate and resolve unexpected server connections:

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup to Inspect Connections

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon while on the webpage exhibiting unexpected connections.
- Review the _domains connected_ count and the three categorized lists:
  - **Not blocked (Allowed):** Third-party domains your browser connected to successfully.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains with connection attempts quietly blocked or redirected.
  - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked by your content blocker or browser.

**Expected Result:** You see a detailed list of domains and counts that reflect real-time connections from the current tab.


### Step 2: Identify Suspicious or Unknown Domains

- Look for domains that you do not recognize or that seem unrelated to the website.
- Use the domain names shown in the popup; hover or copy them for external investigation.

<Tip>
Consider using a service like [whois.domaintools.com](https://whois.domaintools.com) or [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) to research unfamiliar domains.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Determine Connection Intent and Source

- Remember from the popup categorization that _allowed_ domains are active connections.
- _Stealth-blocked_ domains indicate connection attempts but blocked via stealth means (e.g., browser features or content blockers).

Check if the suspicious domain is in the allowed or stealth list — if allowed, it is notably a live connection.

### Step 4: Correlate Requests with Site Content or Extensions

- Inspect webpage content that might trigger the connection, such as embedded videos, ads, widgets, or third-party scripts.
- Temporarily disable other browser extensions to verify if the connection disappears.

### Step 5: Use the Badge Count as a Quick Signal

- The toolbar badge shows a count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- High badge counts indicate many third-party connections and warrant closer inspection.

<Check>
If the badge number is higher than expected for a familiar site, investigate popup domain lists for unusual entries.
</Check>

### Step 6: Take Action Based on Findings

- **If the connection is legitimate:** Acknowledge it as part of normal site functionality and monitor for changes.
- **If suspicious or unknown:** Consider adding custom filter rules in your content blocker or reviewing your extension setup.
- **If stealth-blocked:** Confirm your content blocker or security settings are working as intended.

### Step 7: Reload the Page and Observe Changes

- After changes (e.g., disabling extensions, updating filters), reload the site.
- Reopen uBO Scope popup to confirm if the unexpected connections have disappeared or decreased.

## 4. Practical Example Scenario

Imagine you visit a trusted news site but see a high number of connected domains in uBO Scope, including one you don’t recognize (e.g., `analytics-xyz.example`). Here’s how to handle it:

1. Open the popup to see it listed under _allowed_.
2. Research the domain using an online lookup tool.
3. Identify if the domain is linked to common analytics providers.
4. If unexpected, check if a browser extension injects scripts referencing this domain.
5. Disable suspicious extensions one at a time, reload, and recheck the popup.
6. If the domain disappears, you’ve isolated the issue.
7. If it remains, consider blocking it explicitly via your content blocker.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Misinterpreting Stealth-blocked Domains:** These are attempts blocked silently and not active connections; do not assume a privacy breach from their presence alone.
- **Expecting a Zero Badge Count:** Legitimate sites often load content from several third parties; a zero count is rare.
- **Ignoring Browser Updates:** Some webRequest API behaviors change with browser versions; ensure your browser is up to date.
- **Not Refreshing After Changes:** Always reload pages and popup after adjustments to see updated results.

## 6. Troubleshooting Checklist

| Issue                                     | Suggested Checkpoint                                     |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| No data or NO DATA message in popup       | Confirm permissions and browser version compatibility.  |
| Badge count much higher than expected     | Inspect popup domains; disable other extensions for test. |
| Unexpected allowed domains persist        | Research domain purpose; customize content blocker rules. |
| Stealth-blocked domains prominent         | Review content blocker settings and browser features.   |

## 7. Best Practices

- Regularly monitor the badge count and popup when browsing new sites.
- Familiarize yourself with common third-party domains used by trusted websites.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to validate effective blocking.
- Maintain your browser and extensions updated for best compatibility.
- Document and share suspicious connections when contributing to filter lists.
