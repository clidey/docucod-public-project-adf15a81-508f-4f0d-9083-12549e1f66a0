# Using uBO Scope When Browser Tools Are Limited

Optimize your network monitoring and analysis with uBO Scope in environments where native browser developer tools are unavailable or restricted, such as mobile devices, corporate managed setups, or locked-down browsers. This guide offers clear, actionable strategies to leverage uBO Scope's unique capabilities effectively when traditional browser tools cannot be used, empowering you to maintain visibility and control over third-party network connections.

---

## 1. Understanding the Challenge

When browser developer tools are limited or disabled, inspecting network activity becomes difficult or impossible. uBO Scope fills this gap by acting as a dedicated network request monitor, transparently revealing third-party connections and their outcomes directly from the extension's toolbar badge and popup interface — independent from usual browser devtools.

This is critical for:
- **Mobile browsing platforms** that restrict plugin capability or hide developer tools.
- **Managed desktops** with locked-down browser features.
- **Environments where advanced users or filter maintainers need to audit network connections without relying on built-in browser consoles.**

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:
- You have installed uBO Scope on your supported browser (Chromium, Firefox, or Safari).
- The extension has the necessary permissions (e.g., access to `webRequest` API, active tab permissions).
- You understand basic web browsing and how to access your browser's extension toolbar.

For installation instructions, see the [Installing uBO Scope guide](/guides/getting-started-with-ubo-scope/installation-on-chromium-firefox-safari) and the [Supported Browsers & System Requirements](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/supported-platforms).

## 3. How uBO Scope Works Without Developer Tools

uBO Scope tracks network requests per browser tab through the browser's `webRequest` API, categorizing requests into three groups:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** Successful requests to third-party domains that completed.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests that content blockers blocked invisibly to avoid webpage breakage.
- **Blocked:** Requests conclusively denied or failed, usually by blockers.

uBO Scope aggregates this data and displays:

- A **toolbar badge count** reflecting the number of unique allowed third-party domains connected.
- A **popup panel** listing domains by their outcome category and request counts.

This information is fully available without the need for browser developer tools and refreshes dynamically as you browse.

---

## 4. Step-by-Step Usage Workflow

### Step 1: Launch uBO Scope Popup
1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup opens, displaying the current active tab’s network data.

### Step 2: Interpret the Toolbar Badge
- The badge number reflects the count of distinct third-party domains allowed for the active tab.
- A lower badge count indicates fewer external connections, generally better for privacy.

### Step 3: Review Connection Categories in the Popup
- **Not Blocked:** Domains from which the page successfully loaded resources.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains blocked silently by content blockers.
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests were explicitly blocked or failed.

Domains are shown with counts of how many requests were made.

### Step 4: Investigate Suspicious or Unexpected Domains
- Use the domain lists to spot domains you do not recognize or want to allow.
- This is especially valuable on locked-down devices without developer consoles.

### Step 5: Act on Your Findings
- Adjust content blockers or privacy settings as needed based on exposure.
- Share findings with filter maintainers or IT administration when auditing environments.

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Regularly monitor different tabs:** Each tab has its own connection profile; switch tabs and open uBO Scope to inspect per-tab network exposure.
- **Refresh the popup as needed:** The popup updates on opening, so reopen it to refresh data.
- **Use in tandem with uBlock Origin:** For environments where you can, combine uBO Scope with content blockers to audit their effectiveness.
- **Remember badge count context:** Stop obsessing over block counts; focus on the number of allowed third-party domains to measure real exposure.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope in Restricted Environments">
<Accordion title='Popup Shows No Data or "NO DATA" Message'>
- Ensure you are viewing an active and fully loaded tab.
- If network activity is minimal (e.g., about:blank or static pages), data may be sparse.
- Verify permissions were granted during installation.
- Try disabling conflicting extensions that may interfere with webRequest API.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Toolbar Badge Is Blank or Not Updating">
- Badge updates only for active tabs with monitored network activity.
- Switching tabs or reloading the page triggers badge refresh.
- Check browser version compatibility as per [Supported Platforms](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/supported-platforms).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Data Seems Inconsistent Across Browsing Sessions">
- uBO Scope stores session data temporarily; restarting the browser clears the session.
- Long browsing sessions or browser shutdowns clear previous data.
- This is normal behavior; use it as real-time insight rather than historical logs.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Example Scenario: Monitoring Mobile Browsing

Imagine you are browsing a news website on a mobile browser without developer tools. You want to verify the number of third-party connections to assess privacy exposure.

- After installing uBO Scope on the mobile-compatible browser, tap the toolbar icon.
- The popup shows a badge count of '3' and lists domains like `cdn.example.com` under Not Blocked, with no stealth-blocked ones.
- From this, you understand only three distinct third-party domains are contacted, mostly content delivery networks.
- You decide your current blocker is effective, or you adjust filters accordingly.

This real-time window into network activity replaces the lack of developer tools.

## 10. Final Notes

uBO Scope empowers users to maintain transparency over network connections even when native browser developer tools are inaccessible. Use it proactively to safeguard privacy, audit third-party exposure, and support filter development in constrained environments.

Your ability to visualize and interpret connection outcomes through uBO Scope alone is a significant advantage in today's mobile-centric and managed-device world.
