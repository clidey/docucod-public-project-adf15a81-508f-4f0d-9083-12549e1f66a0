# Making the Most of Session Tracking

## Overview

This guide helps you understand how uBO Scope maintains detailed histories of network connection events on a per-tab and per-session basis. You'll learn how uBO Scope records outcomes of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked requests for each browser tab, and how you can leverage this data to analyze changes over time and gain deeper insights into browsing behavior and content blocking effectiveness.

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope extension installed and enabled in your supported browser (Chromium v122+, Firefox v128+, Safari v18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with browsing tabs and accessing the uBO Scope popup interface.
- Access to the browser's extension badge (toolbar icon) reflecting active session tracking.

## What You Will Achieve

By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Understand how uBO Scope tracks and categorizes network request outcomes for each tab.
- Explore the per-session and per-tab data maintained internally.
- Use the recorded data to analyze allowed and blocked domains over time.
- Apply these insights for long-term transparency and evaluation of content blocking.

## Estimated Time

Approximately 10-15 minutes to grasp concepts and practical usage.

## How Session Tracking Works in uBO Scope

uBO Scope continuously monitors network requests made by each browser tab, assigning each request into one of three categories based on its outcome:

- **Allowed:** Requests successfully made and not blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that were redirected or otherwise stealthily blocked (hidden from webpages).
- **Blocked:** Requests that encountered errors or were explicitly blocked.

This categorization happens in the background, where uBO Scope maintains an internal mapping of tab IDs to detailed tracking data structures.

<Accordion title="Understanding Tab Details Data Structure">
Each tab's tracking data includes:
- The main domain and hostname of the tab's active page.
- Maps of domains and hostnames categorized by outcome (allowed, stealth, blocked), each counting the number of connection attempts.

This allows uBO Scope to uniquely track how many distinct domains were connected or blocked per tab during the session.
</Accordion>

<Callout>
The badge count on the extension icon for each tab reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains found during the session for that tab.

## Step-by-Step: Tracking and Using Session Data

### 1. Data Collection per Tab

- When a main frame request is made in a tab, uBO Scope resets the tracking for that tab to ensure accuracy for the current page load.
- For every network request related to the tab (allowed, redirected, or blocked), uBO Scope updates counts in the corresponding category maps.
- All this data is kept live during the browsing session and saved periodically.

### 2. Data Persistence and Recovery

- uBO Scope stores session data using the browser's `storage.session` API.
- Upon extension startup, it loads this saved session data to resume accurate tracking without loss.

### 3. Viewing Session Data

- Open the uBO Scope popup for any active tab to see a breakdown of allowed, stealth, and blocked domains, including counts of how many times a domain was contacted.
- The popup UI dynamically renders this data, decoding internationalized domains properly.

### 4. Analyzing Domain Changes Over Time

- By observing tab data across browsing sessions, you can identify changes in which domains are allowed or blocked.
- High counts of allowed domains may indicate many third-party services are active for a page.
- Increases in blocked or stealth-blocked domains over time may signal changes in blocking rules or extensions.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Monitor Tabs Independently:** Session data is organized per tab, so analyze each tab separately for precise insights.
- **Interpret Badge Counts Carefully:** The badge shows allowed distinct domains only; complement this with popup details for blocked and stealth domains.
- **Use Data to Evaluate Content Blockers:** Changes in allowed/blocked domains across sessions can help confirm if content blockers are effectively limiting unwanted connections.
- **Leverage Internationalized Domain Handling:** uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List and punycode to accurately group domains and display them in user-friendly formats.

<Warning>
Session data is limited to the current browser session and may be reset when the browser or extension restarts, so capture any critical insights promptly.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Session Tracking Issues

### Common Issues

- **No data shown for active tab:** This usually means the tab has not made any network connections since uBO Scope started or data is still loading. Try refreshing the tab or waiting a moment.
- **Badge count not updating:** Ensure the extension has the necessary permissions and that the browser version supports session storage.
- **Data disappears after browser restart:** Session storage resets on browser restart; this is expected behavior. Consider exporting any important data externally if needed (currently unsupported in UI).

### Solutions

- Reload the uBO Scope extension or browser if session data seems stale.
- Verify active tab is selected when viewing popup data.
- Check for browser updates to ensure compatibility with uBO Scope’s use of the storage API.

## Advanced Insights

- By programmatically querying tab session data via extension messaging, developers or filter list maintainers can automate collection of domain outcome histories for analysis.
- Changes in stealth-blocked domain counts can help identify when stealth blocking tactics evolve or when blocking efficacy alters unnoticed.

## Example: Understanding Domain Tracking for a Tab

Suppose you open a tab on example.com and visit a site that loads resources from multiple third-party domains:

- uBO Scope initializes tab data on main frame load, clearing previous records.
- Allowed requests to cdn.example-cdn.com count toward the allowed domains map.
- Requests blocked by content blockers count in the blocked domains map.
- Redirected requests tracked in stealth-blocked.
- Over the session, you see the badge increment to show distinct allowed 3rd-party domains.
- Clicking the popup, you see detailed counts like:

  ```
  Allowed:
  - example-cdn.com: 5
  - analytics.com: 2

  Stealth-blocked:
  - tracking.net: 3

  Blocked:
  - ads.com: 4
  ```

This helps you identify who exactly your browser connected to, and which connections were blocked or stealthily handled.
