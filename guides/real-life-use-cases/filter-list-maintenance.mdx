# Supporting Filter List Maintenance

## Overview

This guide empowers filter list maintainers and power users to leverage **uBO Scope** as a powerful diagnostic tool to monitor and analyze network request outcomes. By understanding how to utilize the extension's data, maintainers can optimize filter rules effectively—especially on platforms where native browser developer tools or network inspectors are restricted or unavailable.

## Why Use uBO Scope for Filter Maintenance?

Filter list maintainers need accurate visibility into network requests to detect unwanted connections and ensure filters block undesired content without causing unnecessary breakage. uBO Scope provides:

- **Clear outcomes of network requests:** Distinguishes between allowed, stealth-blocked, and outright blocked connections.
- **Domain-level aggregation:** Shows distinct third-party domains involved.
- **Independence from browser tools:** Works even when browser network tools are limited or missing.

Together, these features create actionable insight to refine filters with confidence.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following before starting the workflow:

- **uBO Scope installed:** Installed on your supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
- **Basic familiarity with filter lists:** Understanding of filter syntax and behavior for content blockers.
- **Active browsing session:** Ideally, have a website open where you want to analyze third-party connections.

---

## Expected Outcome

By following this guide, filter list maintainers will:

- Use the uBO Scope popup to comprehensively view network requests in real-time.
- Identify which third-party domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- Detect anomalies or excessive connections that suggest filter improvements.
- Adapt and test filter rules more precisely to block unwanted requests while minimizing false positives.

## Time Estimate

This workflow typically takes **15–30 minutes** to become comfortable with the interface and start making filter adjustments.

---

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate: Requires familiarity with content blocking concepts and domain-level filtering.

## How to Use uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope Popup for the Active Tab

1. Navigate to the website or web application where you want to analyze network connections.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon on your browser toolbar to open the popup panel.
3. The popup will display the domain data for the current active tab automatically.

**Expected result:** You see three distinct sections titled **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**, each listing the domains involved along with the number of connections.

### Step 2: Interpret the Domain Lists and Connection Counts

- **Not blocked:** Domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains whose requests were blocked in a way meant to be invisible to the webpage (e.g., silently blocked).
- **Blocked:** Domains whose requests were outright blocked by content blocking.

Use the counts to evaluate the effectiveness of your filter list:

- A high number of allowed third-party domains may suggest gaps in your filter list.
- Domains appearing in stealth-blocked or blocked lists imply your filters are actively blocking those domains.

<Tip>
Pay special attention to legitimate third-party services (like CDNs) which are often allowed to avoid breakage.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Analyze Domains to Identify Filter Improvements

1. Review the domains in the **allowed** category to identify any third-party connections that should be blocked.
2. Check stealth-blocked domains to verify that expected requests are stealthily blocked without alerting the webpage.
3. Use the list of **blocked** domains to ensure your filters are not too aggressive and breaking essential resources.

<Tip>
Look for suspicious or unexpected domains in the allowed list that may require adding new filter rules.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Optimize Filter Rules Based on Insights

1. Use domain names observed in the popup to create or fine-tune filter rules in your list.
2. Ensure rules are precise and avoid overly broad blocking to prevent site breakage.
3. After adjusting filters, reload the website tab and observe changes in uBO Scope.

**Expected result:** Over time, you will see fewer unwanted allowed connections and a balanced count of stealth and blocked connections.

### Step 5: Use the Toolbar Badge for Quick Monitoring

- The extension icon badge shows the count of distinct allowed third-party domains on the active tab.
- Aim for a lower badge count reflecting fewer third-party connections.

**Tip:** Refresh the page or browse new sites to dynamically check filter impact through the badge count.

### Step 6: Repeat and Refine

- Continuously observe connection outcomes across different websites.
- Adjust filters and monitor their effects with uBO Scope’s real-time updates.
- Develop filter rules iteratively based on concrete connection data.

## Practical Example Scenario

Imagine you maintain a filter list aimed at blocking tracking and ad domains on an e-commerce website:

1. Use uBO Scope while browsing a product page.
2. Notice several suspicious third-party domains allowed under the **not blocked** section.
3. Add filter rules targeting these domains.
4. Reload the page and verify those domains shift to **blocked** or **stealth-blocked**.
5. Confirm the toolbar badge count decreases, indicating fewer allowed third-party connections.

Repeat this process over multiple sites to incrementally improve your filter list’s effectiveness.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- Regularly update your filter list to incorporate new domains discovered through uBO Scope.
- Use the extension on multiple browsers or platforms to identify platform-specific connection behaviors.
- Avoid making hasty sweeping blocks; always verify by testing site functionality after changes.
- Use the **stealth-blocked** list to detect potentially hidden or covert blocking mechanisms.
- Leverage the domain count badge as a quick privacy health check during browsing.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Popup Shows No Data

- Ensure you have an active tab with network activity.
- Reload the tab and open the popup again.
- Restart the browser if issues persist.

### Issue: Unexpected High Allowed Domain Count

- Confirm your filter list is enabled and correctly formatted.
- Verify that connection blocking is not bypassed by HTTPS exclusions or other browser exceptions.
- Use targeted filter rules rather than broad blocks.

### Issue: Blocked Essential Domains Break Site

- Identify domains in the **blocked** section critical for site functionality.
- Whitelist or allow these domains explicitly to restore site behavior.
- Consider using exception rules.

<Tip>
Always backup your filter list before major changes.

## Additional Information

uBO Scope is designed to use the browser’s `webRequest` API to detect the outcome of network requests regardless of the content blocking method, including stealth blocking by other filters or DNS level blocking. This makes it uniquely reliable when browser developer tools are restricted or unavailable.

The data is aggregated at the domain level based on the Public Suffix List (PSL) to ensure filters target relevant parent domains efficiently.
