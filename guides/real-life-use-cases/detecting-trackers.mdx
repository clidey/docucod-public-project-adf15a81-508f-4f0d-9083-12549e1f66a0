# Detecting Third-Party Trackers in Practice

This guide shows you how to identify unwanted or suspicious third-party network connections while browsing popular websites. It explains how to use the uBO Scope popup interface to interpret connection statuses categorized as 'allowed', 'blocked', and 'stealth', enabling effective privacy evaluation.

---

## 1. Understanding the Page Intent

This page focuses specifically on guiding you through practical steps to spot third-party trackers or connections on the sites you visit. It does not cover installation, configuration, or background technical architecture. Instead, it shows how to:

- Use uBO Scope to inspect the third-party connections for your current browser tab
- Recognize and understand the meaning of connection outcomes: allowed, blocked, stealth
- Evaluate these network activities to make privacy-informed decisions


## 2. Prerequisites

Before starting:

- You must have uBO Scope installed and active on your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser
- You should have granted the necessary permissions so uBO Scope can monitor network requests (see installation guides if unsure)
- You should be browsing a website where you want to investigate third-party connections


## 3. Expected Outcome

By the end of this guide, you will:

- Understand how to open and interpret the uBO Scope popup panel
- Be able to identify different types of third-party network connections and their privacy implications
- Learn to distinguish between benign and suspicious third-party trackers on popular sites


## 4. Time Estimate

5 to 10 minutes


## 5. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope Popup on the Website You Wish to Inspect

1. While on the webpage you want to analyze, click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
2. The popup panel will load and display connection information regarding that page's network activity.


### Step 2: Identify the Main Site Domain

- At the top of the popup, note the displayed domain name of the active tab, showing the main website you are inspecting.
- This helps confirm you are viewing connections related to the site you expect.


### Step 3: Review the Summary of Connected Domains

- The 'domains connected' count represents the number of distinct third-party domains your browser contacted.
- Lower counts typically indicate better privacy, as fewer external resources are loaded.


### Step 4: Examine the 'Not Blocked' Section

- This section lists third-party domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
- These are active connections allowed by the content blockers or networking policies.
- Consider whether these domains belong to trusted services:
  - Common legitimate third parties include CDNs or analytics providers used by the site.
  - Unknown or suspicious domains here could indicate trackers or unwanted third-party scripts.


### Step 5: Investigate the 'Blocked' Section

- Domains here represent third-party connections that were explicitly blocked.
- Blocking may be due to your content blocker, DNS filtering, or the browser's refusal of requests.
- While blocking is generally good for privacy, verify if any essential services are mistakenly blocked (false positives).


### Step 6: Explore the 'Stealth-Blocked' Section

- These domains correspond to connections blocked stealthily via redirection or other advanced blocking methods.
- uBO Scope reports these as stealth to highlight blockers that avoid detection by the webpage.
- Stealth blocking indicates a careful balance between privacy and site functionality.


### Step 7: Assess Connections with Context

- Use your knowledge about the site and domain reputations to assess risks.
- Frequent or numerous third-party tracking domains may warrant stronger blocking or alternative sites.
- Pay attention to domains that appear in 'allowed' but are unknown or suspicious.


## 6. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Check Domain Names Carefully:** Use domain lookup and reputation services to verify unknown third-party domains.
- **Understand Legitimate Third Parties:** Recognize frequent legitimate services like Google CDN, Cloudflare, or other well-known providers.
- **Watch for Surprising Domains:** Unexpected or foreign domains may be signals of tracking or data collection.
- **Combine with Content Blocker Settings:** Use uBO Scope data to adjust your content blocker or filter lists accordingly.
- **Repeat Across Popular Sites:** Build awareness by inspecting multiple sites you frequently visit.


## 7. Common Pitfalls

- **Assuming All Blocked Domains are Malicious:** Some blocked domains may be benign but blocked due to strict filter lists.
- **Relying Solely on Block Counts:** The toolbar badge count shows unique allowed third-party domains, not necessarily all tracking activity.
- **Ignoring Stealth Blocking:** Overlooking stealth-blocked connections can miss subtle trackers.
- **Trusting Ads-Blocker Test Pages:** As documented elsewhere, test pages artificially induce requests and may not reflect real-world privacy accurately.


## 8. Troubleshooting

- If the popup shows 'NO DATA': Ensure you have proper permissions and have navigated through a site that triggered third-party connections.
- If connection lists appear empty or incomplete: Refresh the page, make sure uBO Scope is running, and try different websites.
- If suspect connections keep appearing unexpectedly: Review your content blocker settings and update filter lists.


## 9. Example Scenario

Imagine you visit a popular news website:

- Open uBO Scope popup.
- You see 10 domains connected under 'not blocked', including expected domains like `cdn.examplecdn.com`.
- Under 'blocked', you find domains related to social media trackers you prefer to block.
- A few stealth-blocked domains correspond to ad networks that your content blocker cloaks.

This inspection reassures you about legitimate third parties and flags suspect trackers you want to block more aggressively.
