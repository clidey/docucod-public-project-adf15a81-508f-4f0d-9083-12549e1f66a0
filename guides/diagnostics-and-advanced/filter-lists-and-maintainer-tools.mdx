# Guidance for Filter List Maintainers

## Overview
This guide empowers filter list maintainers to harness uBO Scope effectively within their workflow, especially when working on browsers or systems that lack advanced developer tools. You will learn how to observe and analyze real browsing sessions, collect actionable data about remote connections, and avoid common pitfalls associated with synthetic 'ad blocker test' pages. The practical approach presented here reflects real-world usage that helps maintain the quality and reliability of filter lists.

---

## 1. Understanding the Context

### Why Use uBO Scope?
Filter list maintainers need a reliable way to observe actual third-party network activities generated by real websites, to verify filter efficacy and uncover stealthy connections that may bypass filters. uBO Scope provides a clear snapshot of network connections, categorizing them as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, independent of the content blocker used. This enables maintainers to capture precise and unbiased connection data.

### Key Challenges in Filter List Maintenance
- Limited access to browser developer tools, especially on mobile or constrained environments.
- Misleading results from synthetic "ad blocker test" pages that don’t reflect genuine browsing.
- Difficulty in identifying stealthy connections or understanding filtering outcomes.

---

## 2. Preparing Your Environment

### Prerequisites
- Install uBO Scope on a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) with permissions granted as outlined in the [Supported Browsers & Prerequisites](../getting-started/installation-setup/supported-browsers-prerequisites) guide.
- Familiarize yourself with the [Basic Configuration](../getting-started/installation-setup/basic-configuration) to ensure the extension is active and accessible.
- Understand core terminology and UI elements via [Core Concepts & Terminology](../overview/introduction-and-concepts/core-concepts-and-terminology) and [Understanding the UI](../getting-started/first-use-validation/understanding-the-ui).

<Tip>
Always validate that uBO Scope’s toolbar badge updates correctly and that the popup panel displays domain data after browsing a real site session. This confirms that the extension is functioning and ready for data collection.
</Tip>

## 3. Workflow: Using uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance

### Step 1: Conduct Real Browsing Sessions
1. Open the target website you want to evaluate in your browser.
2. Avoid using simplistic or fabricated "ad blocker test" pages, which often generate unrealistic or irrelevant network requests.
3. Interact with the site naturally to trigger all typical network activity (navigation, content loading, embedded media).

### Step 2: Open uBO Scope’s Popup Panel
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- Observe the displayed hostname and domain summary at the top.
- Review the three main outcome sections:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains that the browser successfully connected to.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where the connection was silently redirected or concealed by a content blocker.
  - **Blocked:** Domains outright blocked by the content blocker.

### Step 3: Analyze Domain Activity
- Use the domain listings and connection counts to determine which third parties are active.
- Focus on domains that should be blocked but appear as allowed or stealth-blocked.
- Identify potentially missing entries or outdated rules in filter lists based on this data.

### Step 4: Export and Record Findings
- Record the domain names and their connection counts.
- Use this data to update or refine filter lists accordingly.

<Tip>
uBO Scope lists domains using Unicode (decoded punycode), improving readability for international domains.
</Tip>

### Step 5: Avoid Common Pitfalls
- Do NOT rely on synthetic or test pages specifically designed to cheat or mislead ad blocker detection.
- Understand that stealth-blocked domains indicate subtle blocking mechanisms and may require deeper investigation.
- Remember that some allowed domains may be legitimate third-party services such as CDNs, so verify before blocking.

## 4. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Real-World Browsing is Essential:** Always validate filter effects on actual websites, not tests or placeholder pages.
- **Use Multi-Session Sampling:** Gather data across multiple browsing sessions to catch transient or conditional connections.
- **Understand Network Outcomes:** Familiarity with allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories helps prioritize which domains need filter updates.
- **Correlate with Filter Rules:** After gathering connection data, cross-reference with your filter list to identify gaps.
- **Leverage the Toolbar Badge:** Use the number of unique allowed third-party connections (shown on the badge) as a quick privacy metric during evaluation.

<Warning>
Be cautious not to block domains essential for legitimate site functionality; blindly blocking based on connection counts can break webpages.
</Warning>

## 5. Using uBO Scope Without Developer Tools

### Scenario
On mobile browsers or restricted systems, robust developer tools may be unavailable. uBO Scope offers a simple popup-based analysis without the need for console or network panels.

### How to Proceed
- Rely on the uBO Scope popup for detailed connection visibility.
- Use the domain counts and breakdowns as your primary data source.
- Combine uBO Scope data with known filter list knowledge for informed decisions.

<Tip>
Pair uBO Scope with other browser-based extensions or diagnostic tools for more comprehensive analysis when possible.
</Tip>

## 6. Sample Real-World Use Case

Suppose you maintain a filter list targeting trackers on an e-commerce site.

- You browse the site while uBO Scope is active.
- The popup shows multiple allowed domains from unexpected advertising networks not currently on your block list.
- Several domains show up under stealth-blocked, indicating filtered but potentially evasive trackers.
- You add these domains to your filter list, test again, and observe the site behavior and uBO Scope's domain outcomes to ensure correct blocking without breaking site functionality.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance">
<Accordion title="No Domains Showing in Popup">
- Ensure the extension is enabled and icon is visible.
- Verify the browser permissions include webRequest and activeTab.
- Check that browsing a site generates network activity; some pages may be cached or local.
- Reload the tab and popup panel to refresh data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected High Number of Allowed Domains">
- Real browsing sessions generate many third-party requests; identify which are necessary.
- Use uBO Scope’s stealth-blocked and blocked sections to spot bypassed trackers.
- Cross-verify with filter lists to identify missing rules.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth-Blocked Domains Are Empty">
- Some content blockers or browser configurations do not report stealth-blocked results consistently.
- Confirm your blocker and browser support the stealth-blocking mechanism.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Appendix: Summary of uBO Scope Popup Panel Output

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Not Blocked (Allowed) | Domains successfully contacted by the browser; often includes legitimate services and CDNs. |
| Stealth-Blocked | Domains where connections were modified or redirected to hide blocking. Valuable for spotting evasive trackers. |
| Blocked | Domains that were outright blocked by content blockers or filtering rules. |

Each domain entry shows the number of connections made, enabling you to prioritize investigation.
