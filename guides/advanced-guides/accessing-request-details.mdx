# Accessing Detailed Network Request Information

## Overview

This guide helps you delve deeper into the network connections reported by uBO Scope. While the extension surfaces a high-level summary in its popup interface, you can explore more granular details such as specific network request outcomes, stealth-blocked connections, and how network events are recorded and categorized per browser tab.

Understanding these details enables advanced users, filter list maintainers, and auditors to gain precise insights into how webpages interact with remote third-party servers.

---

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and actively monitoring in a supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with uBO Scope's popup interface and domain connection categories: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- Access to browser developer tools is helpful for advanced inspection.

---

## Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will:

- Know how uBO Scope records and categorizes network requests behind the scenes.
- Understand how to access and interpret stealth-blocked connection data.
- Gain insight into the network events that populate the popup interface.
- Be equipped to analyze network request patterns per active tab with precision.


---

## Understanding How Network Requests Are Recorded

uBO Scope captures network activity using browser `webRequest` APIs, listening for three key network events:

- **onBeforeRedirect**: Indicates a network request that is being redirected.
- **onErrorOccurred**: Indicates a network request that failed or was blocked.
- **onResponseStarted**: Indicates a network request that succeeded or began receiving a response.

These events are queued in a journal and processed periodically (every second) to update per-tab details.

### Data Categorization Per Tab

For each browser tab, network requests are organized into three outcome categories:

- **Allowed**: Network connections that succeeded (resources successfully fetched).
- **Stealth-blocked**: Connections that were redirected stealthily, often by content blockers that mask their activity.
- **Blocked**: Connections that were explicitly blocked or failed.

Each category holds:

- A map of domains with counts of occurrences.
- A map of hostnames with counts of occurrences.

This categorization drives the summary and detailed domain lists shown in the popup interface.

---

## Accessing Stealth-Blocked Connections

Stealth-blocked connections represent network requests that were intercepted and redirected in a subtle way, not visibly blocked by traditional means. Recognizing these is crucial for understanding how some content blockers operate stealthily.

You can view these connections directly in the uBO Scope popup under the “stealth-blocked” section. Here are practical tips:

1. Open the popup interface while visiting the tab you want to analyze.
2. Locate the "stealth-blocked" section, which lists domains that uBO Scope detected as stealth-blocked.
3. Use this list to evaluate potential hidden redirects or subtle filtering by other content blockers.

## Exploring Network Request Outcome Recording Process

The extension maintains detailed per-tab maps of remote server connections by tracking the outcomes of all network requests:

- When a webpage loads or a top-level navigation occurs (main frame), uBO Scope resets tab tracking details, recording the initial URL's hostname and domain.
- Each network request for subresources is then processed:
  - Redirect events add the hostname to stealth-blocked collections.
  - Error events add the hostname to blocked collections.
  - Successful responses add the hostname to allowed collections.

The extension extracts hostnames and domains using the public suffix list for accuracy, grouping requests accordingly.

## Step-by-Step: Viewing Detailed Domain Connection Data

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup for the Active Tab">
Open the extension by clicking its toolbar icon on the browser toolbar while on the tab you want to investigate.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Domain Categorization Sections">
In the popup, you will find three domain lists: "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked."
These lists show how remote server connections are classified.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Connection Counts Per Domain">
Each domain listed includes a count reflecting connection attempts observed during the active session in that tab.
Higher counts indicate more frequent connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze Stealth-Blocked Connections for Hidden Redirects">
Pay particular attention to the stealth-blocked section to uncover subtle content blocker activity or network redirects.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Public Suffix Processing for Domain Accuracy">
uBO Scope uses the public suffix list for precise domain extraction.
Understanding this helps you interpret domain entries correctly.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Regularly observe the popup** after loading new sites to see updated network connection patterns.
- Use **stealth-blocked data** to detect content blockers that redirect requests invisibly.
- **Keep session data fresh**: uBO Scope resets information when a tab reloads or navigates.
- Leverage the **domain count numbers** to prioritize which third-party servers to scrutinize.
- Consider using **browser developer tools** network monitors alongside uBO Scope for cross-reference.

## Common Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Detailed Network Request Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or Static Counts">
Ensure the tab is active and reloaded; uBO Scope only processes data for active tabs.
Verify that required permissions (`activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`) are granted.
Check the browser’s extension management page for possible errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth-Blocked Section Is Empty
">
Not all sites have stealth-blocked connections. This section will be empty when no redirects or stealth blocking occurs.
Consider visiting websites known for ad tracking to see this section in action.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Counts Appear Incorrect or Incomplete">
Network events sometimes may not be reported if the browser does not forward requests through the `webRequest` API (e.g., some WebSocket or non-standard protocols).
Make sure you are using a supported browser version.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Insights

- uBO Scope periodically serializes session data to local storage to persist tab connection details.
- It uses a public suffix list parser to extract registered domains accurately from hostnames, ensuring consistent grouping.
- Understanding the extension’s internal model can help filter list maintainers tune blocklists for better control.
- Request events like `redirect` are interpreted as stealth blocking rather than outright blocking to reflect realistic network behavior.
