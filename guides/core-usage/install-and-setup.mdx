## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Choose Your Browser">
Identify which browser you will use uBO Scope with. Supported browsers are Chrome (version 122+), Firefox (version 128+), and Safari (version 18.5+).

If you are unsure about your browser version, check the browser's "About" page.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Install uBO Scope from Official Store">
- For **Chrome** users, visit the [Chrome Web Store uBO Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
- For **Firefox** users, visit the [Firefox Add-ons uBO Scope page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
- For **Safari** users, wait for Safari 18.5 or later, and follow manual installation instructions when available.

Click "Add to Chrome/Firefox/Safari" and confirm the installation.


<Tip>
Installing via the official browser stores ensures automatic updates and optimal compatibility.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="3. Enable the Extension (if required)">
Most browsers enable extensions automatically upon installation. If uBO Scope does not appear:

1. Go to your browser's extensions or add-ons page.
2. Locate uBO Scope in the list.
3. Ensure the toggle is set to **Enabled/On**.


<Note>
On some browsers, permission prompts might appear during or after installation. Always accept required permissions for uBO Scope to function correctly.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="4. Verify the Toolbar Icon Appears">
Look at your browser's toolbar to find the uBO Scope icon. It resembles a square badge with the extension logo.

- If you do not see it immediately:
    - Check your browser’s overflow or extensions menu (e.g., puzzle icon in Chrome).
    - Pin or drag the icon to your toolbar.


<Warning>
Without the toolbar icon, you cannot access uBO Scope's popup interface or see the connection badge count.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="5. Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click on the uBO Scope icon on your toolbar to open the popup window.

- You should see:
    - The current tab's hostname.
    - A summary of connected domains.
    - Sections listing not blocked, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.


<Check>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or is empty, refresh your active tab or navigate to a website with network activity.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="6. Confirm the Badge Count Updates">
Observe the badge number on the uBO Scope toolbar icon. It displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers your current tab connected to.

- Refresh the current page to see the badge update.
- A non-zero number means uBO Scope is actively tracking network connections.


<Tip>
A lower badge count indicates fewer remote server connections, which generally implies better privacy.
</Tip>

</Step>

2. Run the build script for your platform (e.g., chromium, firefox, or safari):

   ./tools/make-package.sh chromium
   ```

3. Load the unpacked extension into your browser:
