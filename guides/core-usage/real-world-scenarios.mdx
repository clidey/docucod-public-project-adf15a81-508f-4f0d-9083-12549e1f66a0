# Example Scenarios: Legitimate vs. Excessive Third Parties

Explore how uBO Scope reveals typical third-party connection behaviors in real web environments. This hands-on guide walks you through comparing two websites: one with normal CDN usage and another with a high number of third-party connections, helping you differentiate between typical and potentially concerning network patterns.

---

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
Learn to interpret uBO Scope's popup and badge data by examining real-world examples. Understand what constitutes normal content delivery networks (CDNs) versus excessive or suspicious third-party trackers.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and active in your browser.
- Basic familiarity with the uBO Scope popup interface.
- Access to the two suggested example websites for testing.

### Expected Outcome
By completing this guide, you will:
- Recognize typical third-party domains associated with legitimate content delivery.
- Identify patterns of excessive third-party connections that might indicate privacy concerns.
- Develop confidence in using uBO Scope data to evaluate website network connections.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10-15 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare uBO Scope
1. Ensure the uBO Scope extension is installed and enabled in your browser (see [Installing uBO Scope](https://docs.example.com/guides/getting-started/installing-extension)).
2. Open a new browser tab.

### Step 2: Visit a Typical High-Quality Website
1. Navigate to a popular, well-known website such as https://www.wikipedia.org.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
3. Observe the `domains connected` count at the top summary.
4. Review the domains listed under the **not blocked** section.

> **Expected Results:**
- You should see a small number of distinct third-party domains, typically CDNs or analytics services such as `wikipedia.org`, `cloudflare.com`, or `googleapis.com`.
- The **blocked** and **stealth-blocked** sections may be empty or minimal.

### Step 3: Visit a Website with Numerous Third-Party Connections
1. Open a new tab and navigate to a content-rich, ad-heavy website such as a major news site (example: https://www.nytimes.com).
2. Open the uBO Scope popup.
3. Note the `domains connected` count — this is expected to be significantly higher than in Step 2.
4. Review the variety of domains listed, across **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** sections.

> **Expected Results:**
- A large number of distinct third-party domains, including multiple advertising, tracking, and data analytics providers.
- Some domains may be listed under **stealth-blocked** or **blocked**, reflecting content that uBO Scope or other blockers prevented.

### Step 4: Analyze and Compare the Results
1. Compare the domain counts and domain names between the two visits.
2. Consider the nature of each domain: Is it a well-known CDN like `cloudflare.com` or a tracking domain?
3. Reflect on your privacy exposure from loading these websites and the effectiveness of content blocking.

## Practical Examples

| Website Example            | Typical Domain Count | Typical Third Parties                                  |
|---------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| https://www.wikipedia.org | Low (1-5)           | CDNs like `cloudflare.com`, aggregate analytics        |
| https://www.nytimes.com   | High (20+)          | Ads, trackers, CDNs, content partners, analytics      |

### Sample Domain Highlights
- **Legitimate CDNs:** `cloudflare.com`, `akamai.net`, `googleapis.com`.
- **Common Trackers/Ads:** `doubleclick.net`, `googlesyndication.com`, `facebook.net`, `adservice.google.com`.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **No data appears in the popup:**
  - Make sure uBO Scope is enabled and the page has completed some network activity.
  - Refresh the page to trigger network requests.
- **Unexpectedly low or zero domain count:**
  - This may occur on pages that do not load third-party content or if the browser's webRequest API is restricted.
- **Popup shows duplicate or confusing domain names:**
  - Domains may be punycoded; uBO Scope converts these to unicode for better readability.
  - You can cross-check suspicious domains using web search or privacy-focused lookup tools.

### Best Practices
- Use well-known websites as baselines when evaluating domain counts and types.
- Combine uBO Scope observations with privacy extensions to maximize protection.
- Remember that some third parties (like CDNs) are necessary and not inherently privacy risks.

### Performance Considerations
- Opening the popup on pages with massive network activity might have a delay while data accumulates.
- The toolbar badge updates in near real time but batches some events for performance.

### Alternative Approaches
- Use browser developer tools’ Network panel to complement uBO Scope data.
- Explore uBO Scope’s upcoming features for deeper request insights.

<Tip>
Understanding typical third-party connections empowers you to make informed privacy choices and recognize when a website’s behavior might be cause for concern.
</Tip>

<Note>
Always validate findings with multiple websites and consider that not every third-party connection is harmful; some improve web performance or functionality.
