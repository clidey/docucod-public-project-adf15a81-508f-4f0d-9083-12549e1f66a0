# Interpreting the Toolbar Badge Count

## Overview
The toolbar badge count in uBO Scope represents a key privacy metric: the number of *distinct third-party remote servers* your browser has connected to on the active webpage. This guide explains what this count means, why a lower number is generally better for privacy, clarifies the concept of "distinct third-party remote servers," and offers practical tips for making sense of typical badge count values.

## What the Badge Count Represents

- The badge shows the total number of **unique third-party domains** your browser connected to as part of loading the current webpage.
- It reflects connections _allowed_ by content blockers in effect, regardless of which blocker you use.
- This count excludes first-party domains (the loaded webpage's own domain) and focuses on third parties.
- The distinction is based on domain-level grouping extracted using the public suffix list to correctly identify registrable domains.

<u>Why this matters:</u> The badge essentially reveals your exposure footprint to external domains while browsing.

> **A lower count is better:** Fewer third-party connections mean fewer external parties have the opportunity to track you or deliver unwanted content.


## Understanding "Distinct Third-Party Remote Servers"

The badge count is not simply the number of HTTP requests or network connections. Instead, it counts the *number of different third-party domains* your browser contacted. Here's what that means:

- **Third-party** means any domain other than the main website domain you are visiting. For example, if you visit `example.com`, a connection to `cdn.example.com` is first-party (subdomain), but connecting to `analytics-service.com` is third-party.

- **Distinct** means each unique domain is counted once, no matter how many requests are sent to it.

- The domains are resolved carefully to avoid counting subdomains separately by deriving the effective registered domain using the [public suffix list](https://publicsuffix.org/). For example, `ads.example.co.uk` and `media.example.co.uk` count as one domain: `example.co.uk`.

- The badge reflects the state after content blockers have filtered requests, so only allowed connections are counted.


## Why a Lower Badge Count Signals Better Content Blocking

It might be tempting to equate a higher badge count with better content blocking since it could mean more connections were blocked. However, uBO Scope encourages a more nuanced view:

- **High badge count** → your browser connected to more distinct third-party domains. This means the content blocker allowed more external domains.
- **Low badge count** → fewer third-party connections were allowed, indicating tighter blocking and less potential privacy exposure.

Therefore, **do not rely on block counts from extension badges to judge blocker effectiveness.** Instead, focus on the number of third-party domains your browser actually connected to.

> This counter-intuitive insight helps debunk myths like:
> - "A blocker with a higher block count is better."
> - "Ad blocker test websites accurately reflect actual network behavior."


## Typical Badge Count Values and What to Expect

- **Low-count websites:** Simple or privacy-friendly websites often result in badge counts below 5.
- **Average websites:** Many modern websites with CDNs, analytics, and embedded content lead to counts between 5 and 20.
- **High-count websites:** Complex sites with multiple trackers, ads, and third-party widgets can push counts above 20.

Keep in mind:

- Not all third parties are problematic; CDNs and essential services are often legitimate and necessary.
- Content blockers that are too aggressive might break functionality.


'typical' values vary based on the site, user settings, and content blocker configurations.


## How to Use the Toolbar Badge Count Effectively

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Webpage and Observe the Badge">
Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon after loading a webpage. Note the badge count displayed.

<Check>
If the badge is empty, it usually means no third-party connections were detected or the data is not available yet.
</Check>
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Count">
A larger number means more distinct third-party connections. Use this as an indicator of your privacy exposure on this site.

<Info>
Remember, a _lower_ badge count means fewer external domains are contacted and generally better privacy.
</Info>
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Popup for Details">
Click the toolbar icon to open the popup panel, revealing lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains. This gives context behind the badge count.

<Tip>
Seeing which domains are allowed helps you understand what services or trackers are still active.
</Tip>
</Step>
<Step title="Use Badge Count Trends to Compare Settings">
Try different content blockers or filter lists. Use the badge count as a quantitative measure of distinct third-party exposure.

<Warning>
Avoid relying solely on block counts shown on other extension badges — badge count in uBO Scope is a more reliable metric for real-world exposure.
</Warning>
</Step>
</Steps>


## Privacy Implications

- Every distinct third-party domain connected to represents a potential tracking or data leak vector.
- Fewer domains reduce the surface area for privacy compromise.
- The badge count helps users quickly gauge their real exposure without diving into complex network logs.


## Common User Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Asked Questions">
<Accordion title="Why doesn't the badge count equal the number of requests?">
The badge counts unique third-party domains, not the total requests or connections, which can number in the hundreds. Domains are grouped by registered domain to avoid inflating counts by many subdomains.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does 'stealth-blocked' mean compared to 'blocked'?">
Stealth-blocked connections are blocked in a way that attempts to prevent the webpage from detecting the block. Blocked connections are outright prevented, but the page might be able to detect the block attempt. The badge counts only allowed connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can trusted CDNs inflate my badge count?">
Yes, CDNs and legitimate third-party services contribute to the count. Low counts including a few trusted CDNs are normal and expected.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="If I see a high badge count, what should I do?">
Consider tightening your content blocker settings or using more aggressive filter lists. Alternatively, examine the popup details to identify unwanted domains and manually block them if needed.

## Troubleshooting the Badge Count

- **Badge count not updating or empty:**
  - Ensure uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled.
  - Confirm that the webpage has finished loading.
  - Try refreshing the tab to capture fresh data.

- **Badge shows unexpectedly high counts:**
  - Check if you have other content blockers interfering.
  - Review connections in the popup to see what domains are allowed.
  - Investigate if the website uses multiple trackers or third-party widgets.

- **No badge visible:**
  - Verify that the extension icon is pinned or visible in your browser toolbar.
  - Confirm browser permissions and that background scripts are running.

## Best Practices

- Use the badge count as a quick privacy health indicator but complement it with the detailed popup information.
- Regularly monitor high-traffic or privacy-sensitive sites.
- Don't rely on badges from content blockers claiming high block counts; instead, prioritize domains allowed by your browser.
- Familiarize yourself with the [Core Concepts & Terminology](https://example.com/overview/introduction-core-concepts/core-concepts-terminology) for a better understanding.
