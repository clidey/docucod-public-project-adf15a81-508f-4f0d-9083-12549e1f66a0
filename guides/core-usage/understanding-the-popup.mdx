# Understanding the Popup Interface

## Overview

The popup interface of uBO Scope serves as your immediate window into the network connections happening on the active browser tab. By clicking the toolbar icon, you open the popup panel to see a real-time categorized summary of remote server connections initiated by the current webpage.

This guide will help you navigate and understand the popup layout, interpret the categorized domain data, and grasp how uBO Scope visualizes network activity for enhanced privacy awareness and troubleshooting.

## What You Will Learn

- How to open and interpret the popup interface
- The meaning behind each connection category: Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked
- How domain counts and details are presented
- Practical tips on reading data presented in the popup
- Troubleshooting common scenarios when popup data appears empty or incomplete

---

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+)
- You have navigated to a webpage where network requests have occurred
- You have clicked the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup

## Popup Interface Sections Explained

### 1. Tab Hostname Header

At the top, you see the hostname of the active tab's loaded page, split into two parts for clarity:

- **Left part:** The subdomain(s) prefix (if different from the main domain)
- **Right part:** The main registered domain

If no data is available yet (e.g., page just loaded or no network activity), you will see ‘NO DATA’ in this area.

### 2. Summary Section

Below the hostname header is the summary section displaying:

- **'Domains connected:'** The total number of distinct remote domains contacted (allowed connections only) by the active webpage.

This count corresponds exactly to the number shown on the browser toolbar badge.

### 3. Outcomes Sections

The main body of the popup is divided into three outcome categories, each with a header and a scrollable list of domains:

#### a. Not Blocked (Allowed)

- Lists remote domains from which network requests **succeeded** and were **not blocked** by any content blocker or network filter.
- Represents legitimate or non-blocked third-party connections.
- Useful to verify what domains your browser actually connected to during page load.

#### b. Stealth-Blocked

- Contains domains for requests that were **redirected away or silently blocked** by stealth mechanisms in content blockers or browser privacy features.
- This means the connection attempt was hidden or altered so the page or scripts could not detect the block.
- Helps you understand invisible blocking that still affects connection behavior.

#### c. Blocked

- Shows domains for requests that were explicitly **blocked with an error or failure** during network request attempts.
- These are connections content blockers prevented outright.
- Useful for auditing which domains were completely isolated.

---

## How Domains Are Presented

Each domain in the outcome sections includes:

- The domain name (in Unicode format, supporting international domain names)
- A count badge showing how many network requests to this domain were observed under the given outcome

For example, the 'not blocked' section might show:

```
example-cdn.com    15
analytics.tracker.net    3
```

This means the page made 15 requests successfully to example-cdn.com and 3 to analytics.tracker.net.

## Step-by-Step: Using the Popup Interface

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup">
Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon to reveal the popup with network connection details for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Read the Tab Hostname">
Verify the hostname displayed to confirm you are viewing data for the page you expect.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Summary Count">
Look at the 'domains connected' count to get a quick overview of how many distinct third-party domains connected successfully.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
Scan the 'not blocked' section to see domains with successful network connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Examine the 'stealth-blocked' section to understand which connection attempts were silently redirected or stealthily blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Blocked Domains">
Look at the 'blocked' section for connections that were outright refused or failed due to content blocking.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## Practical Tips

- **Lower allowed domain counts generally indicate better privacy** since fewer third-party connections are being allowed.
- Use the popup while browsing privacy-sensitive sites to monitor unexpected third-party connections.
- Remember that stealth-blocked connections are often invisible to webpages and may not appear in the allowed or blocked lists.
- The popup updates live as you switch tabs or reload pages, reflecting current network activity.

## Troubleshooting Common Popup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Interface">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Blank">
- This usually means no network activity has been recorded for the active tab yet.
- Try reloading the webpage and then reopening the popup.
- Ensure your browser and uBO Scope extension have permissions to capture network requests (refer to installation and permissions documentation).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Count is Zero but Network Activity Expected">
- uBO Scope counts only distinct third-party remote domains contacted.
- First-party or same-domain connections do not affect the count.
- Some content blockers or browser privacy settings may prevent reporting of network requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains List Seems Out of Date">
- The popup reflects data from the currently active tab but caches information per page load.
- Reload the tab and open the popup again to see fresh data.
- Background extension processes may take a moment to aggregate results.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why are the domain names sometimes shown in parts (subdomain + domain)?
To improve readability, the hostname displays the subdomain separately from the base domain, helping you quickly identify the site root versus associated third parties.

### What does the count badge next to each domain represent?
It indicates the number of network requests made to that specific domain under the specified outcome category.

### Can I interact with the domains listed in the popup?
Currently, the popup is for viewing only. Future versions may offer clickable actions or deeper insights.
