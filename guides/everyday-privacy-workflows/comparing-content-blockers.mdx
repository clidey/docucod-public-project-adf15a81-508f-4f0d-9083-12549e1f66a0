# Comparing Content Blockers with uBO-Scope

## Overview

This guide empowers you to use uBO-Scope to compare different content blockers effectively, going beyond superficial block counts. By focusing on **the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connects to**, you gain objective insights into the real-world privacy impact of each blocker. This documentation helps you avoid common misinterpretations and teaches you how to evaluate content blockers in a meaningful, data-driven way.

---

## Why Compare Content Blockers with uBO-Scope?

Many users assume that a higher block count means a better content blocker, but this is misleading. uBO-Scope reveals **all network connections attempted or successful to remote servers**, categorizing them as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked. It focuses on **unique third-party domains actually contacted**, which is the ultimate indicator of your exposure.

### Key Points:
- **Block Counts Are Not Everything:** A content blocker showing more blocked requests may still allow connections to more third-party servers, increasing privacy risk.
- **Unique Third-Party Domains Matter:** Fewer distinct third-party connections correlate to stronger privacy protection.
- **Stealth Blocking Identification:** uBO-Scope detects stealth-blocked requests, invisible to web pages and some other tools.

---

## Prerequisites

- You have uBO-Scope installed on your browser. Follow the installation guide for your platform if needed.
- At least two different content blockers installed or enabled, so that you can switch between them for comparison.
- Basic familiarity with the uBO-Scope popup UI. Refer to the [Using the Popup: Viewing and Interpreting Results](https://docs.example.com/guides/getting-started-ubo-scope/popup-ui-overview) guide for details.

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this guide, you will:
- Understand how to interpret uBO-Scope's display of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked third-party connections.
- Be able to compare different content blockers side-by-side based on meaningful metrics.
- Avoid common pitfalls and myths related to block counts and ad blocker test sites.

## Time Estimate

Approximately 15–30 minutes depending on how many content blockers you want to compare.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Browsing Environment

- Ensure uBO-Scope is active in your browser and has the necessary permissions to monitor network requests.
- Install or enable the content blockers you wish to compare.
- Open a website (preferably one with known third-party content) in a new browser tab.

### 2. Record Baseline Connections with Content Blocker #1

- Activate Content Blocker #1.
- Refresh the webpage.
- Click the uBO-Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
- Review the summary:
  - The **domains connected** count shows how many unique third-party servers were allowed.
  - The **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** sections list domains and request counts.

<Tip>
A lower **domains connected** count means fewer third-party connections were permitted, indicating stronger privacy protection.
</Tip>

### 3. Switch to Content Blocker #2

- Disable Content Blocker #1.
- Enable Content Blocker #2.
- Refresh the same webpage.
- Open the uBO-Scope popup again.
- Compare the new results with the previous data:
  - **Domains connected** count.
  - Overlaps or differences in allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

### 4. Analyze the Differences

- Focus on the **total unique allowed domains** rather than how many were blocked.
- If Content Blocker #2 shows more blocked requests but also more allowed unique domains, it may be less effective at reducing exposure.
- Stealth-blocked domains are invisible to web pages but detected by uBO-Scope; differences here reveal blocker stealthiness.

### 5. Iterate and Confirm

- Repeat the process with additional content blockers or different websites.
- Take note of persistent third-party connections allowed by some blockers.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Use Realistic Websites:** Test on common sites you actually visit to see real-world connection patterns.
- **Avoid Ad Blocker Test Sites:** These sites often generate artificial network requests and do not reflect typical browsing.
- **Consider Stealth Blocking:** Some blockers stealth block by redirecting or canceling requests without page knowledge; uBO-Scope helps identify this.
- **Refresh Tabs:** Always reload the webpage after switching blockers to get accurate network data.
- **Monitor the Toolbar Badge:** The badge number reflects unique allowed third-party servers; a quick privacy health metric.

## Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Misconceptions and Issues">
<Accordion title="Higher Block Count Means Better Protection">
Block counts can be misleading since some content blockers might block many requests but still allow connections to more unique third-party domains. Focus instead on the total allowed unique third-party connections.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Relying on Ad Blocker Test Websites">
These test sites often create unrealistic network requests that do not represent actual browsing. Use typical websites to evaluate blockers.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ignoring Stealth Blocked Networks">
uBO-Scope identifies stealth-blocked connections that normal block counts miss. Failure to consider these can lead to incorrect assumptions of privacy levels.
</Accordion>

## Practical Example

Assume you want to compare uBlock Origin and AdGuard:

1. Enable uBlock Origin.
2. Visit your favorite news website.
3. Open uBO-Scope popup and note the **domains connected** count, e.g., 15.
4. Switch to AdGuard.
5. Refresh the same page.
6. Open uBO-Scope popup and note the count, e.g., 23.

Despite AdGuard blocking more individual requests, uBO-Scope reveals more distinct third-party connections allowed, suggesting uBlock Origin may offer better third-party blocking in this scenario.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **uBO-Scope Popup Shows NO DATA:** Ensure the extension has proper permissions and the page has fully loaded.
- **Empty Allowed or Blocked Lists:** The site might not load third-party resources on that visit or the content blocker might be in a different state.
- **Toolbar Badge Not Updating:** Refresh or reload the tab; ensure the extension is active.
- **Inconsistent Results Across Browsers:** Differences in browser APIs and content blocker implementation can cause this; test multiple times.

<u>Use uBO-Scope as your objective measure to choose content blockers that minimize your exposure to third-party network connections — because privacy is about the connections you allow, not just the requests you block.</u>
