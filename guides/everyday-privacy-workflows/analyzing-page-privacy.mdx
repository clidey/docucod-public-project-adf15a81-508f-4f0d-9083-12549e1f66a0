# Analyzing a Page’s Privacy Using uBO-Scope

## Overview
This guide walks you through using uBO-Scope to audit any webpage’s network connections. It enables you to identify all third-party servers contacted by the current tab, distinguish legitimate CDNs, and understand which requests your content blocker allows or blocks. By mastering this workflow, you will quickly perform privacy assessments of any webpage using uBO-Scope’s popup interface.

---

## Prerequisites
- **uBO-Scope installed and active** in your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser. Refer to the [Installing and Setting Up uBO-Scope](./installation-and-setup) guide if needed.
- **Basic familiarity with web browsing and browser extensions.**
- Recommended: Review the [Understanding the Toolbar Badge](../../overview/features-quickstart/badge-interpretation) page to interpret the badge effectively.

---

## What You Will Achieve
- Visualize all unique third-party remote servers a webpage tries to connect to.
- Understand the distinction between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.
- Identify legitimate Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to avoid false privacy concerns.
- Quickly interpret the privacy impact of third-party requests on any webpage.
- Use uBO-Scope as an independent tool to verify your content blocker’s effectiveness.

## Time Estimate
~5 minutes to analyze a webpage and interpret the results thoroughly.


# Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open the Webpage to Analyze
Navigate to the webpage whose privacy profile you want to inspect. Make sure the page fully loads, allowing all network requests to be initiated.

### 2. Activate uBO-Scope’s Popup Panel
Click the uBO-Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar. This opens the popup panel summarizing network connections detected for the active tab.

### 3. Review the Hostname and Domain Header
At the top, uBO-Scope displays the page’s hostname and domain, showing where the main frame content originates. This helps anchor your analysis around the first-party site.

### 4. Examine the Summary Count
Immediately below the header, note the number labeled **domains connected** — this is the count of distinct third-party domains from which resources were successfully fetched (allowed connections).

A lower number means fewer third-party connections and generally stronger privacy.

### 5. Understand the Three Outcome Sections
The popup breaks down connections into three categories:

- **Not blocked (Allowed):** Domains your browser successfully connected to.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains for which requests were redirected stealthily by the content blocker (not visible to the webpage).
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed or were explicitly blocked.

### 6. Review Each Outcome Section’s Domains
Each outcome section lists domains involved:

- These domains are sorted and displayed with the number of occurrences (requests made).
- Pay attention to domains under **allowed**: these are the servers currently contacted.
- Domains listed under **blocked** or **stealth-blocked** indicate your content blocker prevented resource loading from these servers.

### 7. Recognize Legitimate CDNs
Many allowed third-party domains are legitimate Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) providing essential resources (e.g., `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `fonts.gstatic.com`). Recognizing these helps avoid misjudging your privacy level—the presence of a few legitimate CDNs is normal and benign.

### 8. Form a Privacy Assessment

Use the information gathered to judge the page’s privacy impact:

- High count of allowed third-party domains typically means more tracking risk.
- Many stealth-blocked or blocked domains reflect stronger content blocking.
- Unexpected allowed connections from unknown or suspicious domains suggest privacy leaks.

### 9. Refresh Analysis After Page Changes
If you navigate to new pages or reload the tab, reopen the popup to refresh the connection summary and reassess.


# Practical Tips & Best Practices

- The badge count on the toolbar icon reflects total unique allowed third-party domains. Use it as a quick indicator.
- Don’t rely solely on the number of blocked requests; a larger block count doesn’t always mean better privacy.
- Use uBO-Scope together with your primary content blocker to verify its effectiveness independently.
- Ignore “ad blocker test” sites as they generate unrealistic network conditions.
- For filter list maintainers, use domain insights here to verify list efficacy.


# Example Scenario

Imagine you visit `https://example-news-site.com` and want to check its privacy profile:

- You open uBO-Scope. The header shows the main domain as `example-news-site.com`.
- The summary reads **domains connected: 12**.
- The **not blocked** section includes domains like `fonts.googleapis.com`, `cdn.example.net`, and `analytics.exampletracker.com`.
- **Blocked** shows several known tracker domains that your blocker prevented.
- You confirm that most allowed connections are CDNs (fonts, scripts) but notice one analytics domain that remains allowed.

From this, you conclude the site uses some trackers that are not blocked by your current settings, highlighting a privacy exposure.


# Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA or Empty Results">
  Ensure you have reloaded the page fully and the tab is active.
  Check if uBO-Scope has the necessary permissions.
  Try disabling and re-enabling the extension.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
  Confirm you are using a supported browser version.
  Refresh the tab or open a new tab for a fresh analysis.
  See the [Validating Extension is Working](../../getting-started/initial-setup/quick-validation) guide for more steps.

<Accordion title="Unfamiliar Domains Shown as Allowed">
  Some third-party domains may be legitimate CDNs or service providers.
  Research unknown domains before concluding privacy impact.
