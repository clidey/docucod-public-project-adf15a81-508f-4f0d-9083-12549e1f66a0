# Debunking Badge Myths: What Counts Really Mean

## Understanding Connection Counts vs. Raw Block Counts

When monitoring privacy and content blocking effectiveness, it is tempting to rely on raw block counts or numeric badges displayed by extensions. However, uBO Scope reveals that **connection counts**, which track distinct third-party remote servers contacted, provide a far more meaningful privacy metric than simple block counts.

### Why Connection Counts Matter More

- **Blocks Alone Don't Tell the Full Story:** A high block count might mean an extension is blocking many requests, but it does not clarify whether those blocks reduce the actual number of remote servers contacted. In some cases, a blocker with a high block count allows connections to more unique servers, which could mean less privacy.
- **Distinct Remote Servers Are Key:** Privacy is tied to limiting the number of unique third-party servers your browser communicates with. Each distinct server contacted can represent a potential privacy risk or tracking vector.
- **uBO Scope’s Badge Shows Unique Connections:** The toolbar badge count reflects the **number of distinct third-party servers contacted**, not how many requests were blocked. Lower badge numbers indicate better privacy protection.

## Real-World Browser Session Illustrations

uBO Scope uses actual browser sessions to demonstrate these concepts:

### Scenario: Comparing Two Content Blockers

| Content Blocker | Block Count | Distinct Connections | Privacy Level Indicator |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Blocker A       | 150         | 20                   | Better (lower unique count) |
| Blocker B       | 200         | 35                   | Worse (higher unique count) |

Although Blocker B blocks more requests, it allows connections to more unique third-party domains, exposing the user to more tracking surfaces.

### Interpreting Badge Numbers

- **Badge Number = Unique Allowed Connections:** This count includes only those third-party remote servers that actually received connections during the session.
- **Blocked and Stealth-Blocked Counts Are Separate:** The popup interface categorizes connections to help you identify which third parties were allowed, stealth-blocked (blocked without obvious indicators), or blocked outright.

## User Workflow: Evaluating Content Blockers Using uBO Scope

<Steps>
<Step title="Install and Launch uBO Scope">
Ensure uBO Scope is installed on your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+). Click the toolbar icon to open the popup interface.
</Step>
<Step title="Browse Real Websites">
Visit sites you usually use, such as news portals, social media, or e-commerce platforms, to generate realistic network activity.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe Badge Number">
Check the toolbar badge count—it reflects the number of unique third-party servers contacted during your browsing.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup for Details">
Click the badge to view detailed domain categorizations grouped as Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare Across Configurations">
If testing multiple content blockers or filter lists, compare the badge counts and popup domain lists for actual privacy impact, not just raw block numbers.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips to Interpret Badge Counts

- **Lower is Better:** Less unique third-party connections means better privacy management.
- **Beware of High Block Counts:** A high block count could be misleading; always check connection counts.
- **Use Real Browsing Data:** Avoid relying solely on synthetic 'ad blocker test' sites which do not represent real-world network behavior.
- **Understand Stealth Blocking:** uBO Scope reveals stealth-blocked connections to highlight often invisible blocking activities.

<Note>
The badge count does not measure the number of requests but the distinct third-party servers contacted. This metric offers a transparent, robust indicator of effective privacy protection.
</Note>

## Common Misconceptions Debunked

### Myth 1: "More Blocks Mean Better Blocking"

- Reality: Blocking many requests may not reduce the number of unique servers contacted; some blockers might only block requests superficially.

### Myth 2: "Ad Blocker Test Pages Give a True Picture"

- Reality: These pages use artificial scenarios and can't detect stealth blocking mechanisms, making them unreliable for evaluating real privacy impact.

### Myth 3: "Badge Count = Block Count"

- Reality: uBO Scope's badge shows unique allowed connections, not blocked requests, shifting the focus to meaningful privacy metrics.

## How uBO Scope Measures and Reports Connections

The extension listens to network activity via browser APIs and classifies each request based on its outcome:

- **Allowed:** Requests successfully connected.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed due to active blocking.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests blocked invisibly, often through redirects or network-level filtering.

Badge numbers summarize unique allowed domains observed during your session.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues with Badge Interpretation

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues">
<Accordion title="Badge Count is Missing or Always Zero">
- Ensure uBO Scope is installed with appropriate permissions (activeTab, storage, webRequest).
- Confirm browser version compatibility.
- Verify browsing activity generates network requests observable by the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Number Too High Compared to Expectations">
- It may indicate multiple distinct third-party connections allowed.
- Review the popup domain lists for detailed breakdown.
- Cross-compare with other blockers or filter lists in use.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Confusion Between Block Count and Badge Number">
- Remember, badge number is unique allowed connections, not block count.
- Use popup details to understand what was blocked versus allowed.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices to Maximize uBO Scope Insights

- Use uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blockers rather than as a replacement.
- Regularly check the popup interface to understand third-party relationships.
- Focus on lowering unique connection counts rather than obsessing over block counts.
- Avoid using artificial test sites as your privacy benchmark.
