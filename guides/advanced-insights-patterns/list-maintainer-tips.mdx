# Using uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance and Evaluation

## Overview

This guide empowers filter list maintainers to harness uBO Scope effectively for managing and validating filter lists. You will learn to spot CDN domains, identify and reduce unnecessary third-party requests, and confirm that your filter lists block unwanted connections without breaking legitimate websites.

---

## 1. Understanding the Purpose of uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance

As a filter list maintainer, your goal is to craft precise, effective lists that strike a balance between privacy, security, and usability. uBO Scope helps you achieve this by:

- Exposing all remote server connections, including allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked requests.
- Providing granular insights into third-party domains contacted by webpages.
- Detecting common CDN domains which often serve legitimate content.
- Validating filter behavior against real site interactions.

Using uBO Scope shifts your workflow from guesswork to empirical evidence, improving filter quality and reducing false positives.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Installed uBO Scope on a supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- Configured any necessary permissions as described in the Installation and Setup guides.
- Basic understanding of what constitutes first-party vs. third-party domains and CDNs.
- Access to filter list files and the ability to test them within the browser.

Refer to [Installing and Launching uBO Scope](/guides/getting-started-essentials/install-launch) and [Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/system-requirements) for detailed setup.

## 3. Workflow: Using uBO Scope to Maintain and Evaluate Filter Lists

Follow these steps to systematically evaluate and refine your filter lists.

### Step 1: Launch uBO Scope on Test Websites

1. Open a browser tab with a real website you want to evaluate.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon to open the popup panel.
3. Observe the badge count showing the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
4. In the popup, review the categorized lists:
   - **Not blocked:** Domains from which connections were allowed.
   - **Stealth-blocked:** Connections tactically blocked to avoid site breakage.
   - **Blocked:** Connections outright blocked by the filter.

---

### Step 2: Spot CDN Domains

CDNs tend to have well-known domains (e.g., `akamai.net`, `cloudfront.net`, `cdn.cloudflare.net`). Identifying these CDNs is crucial because:

- They commonly serve essential resources like scripts, images, or fonts.
- Such domains should generally not be over-blocked:

**Action:**

- Note CDN domains appearing in **Not blocked** or **Stealth-blocked** sections.
- Verify if any CDN domains are blocked and reassess rules if legitimate content is affected.

This prevents false positives that may degrade user experience.

---

### Step 3: Whittle Down Unnecessary Third-Party Requests

Overly broad or outdated filter rules can allow excessive third-party connections.

**Action:**

- Use uBO Scope to identify third-party domains that frequently appear unchecked.
- Investigate the role of these domains in site functionality.
- Update your filter lists to block truly unwanted domains without harming site usability.

This iterative process keeps filter lists lean and effective.

---

### Step 4: Validate That Blocking Does Not Break the Site

A core value is maintaining site functionality while improving privacy.

**Action:**

- Observe stealth-blocked connections — these represent requests blocked carefully to avoid page breakage.
- For any blocked domains, manually test the site behavior to confirm no critical features are lost.
- Use the detailed lists in the popup for focused troubleshooting.

If you find breakage:

- Adjust blocking strategies using more specific rules.
- Consider marking some connections as stealth-blocked if less intrusive blocking suffices.

---

## 4. Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Detecting Unexpected CDN Usage

You notice high counts of domains like `xyz.akamai.net` under "Not blocked".

**Steps:**

- Confirm if these domains are legitimate CDN endpoints.
- If yes, ensure your filter list does not block these to avoid breaking site resources.

### Scenario 2: Identifying Tracker Domains Leaking Through

A domain such as `tracker.example.com` repeatedly appears under "Not blocked".

**Steps:**

- Cross-reference with known tracker lists.
- Add or update blocking rules in your filter list.
- Re-test with uBO Scope to confirm blocking.

### Scenario 3: Troubleshooting Site Breakage After Updated Rules

After adding new rules, the site no longer loads images or scripts.

**Steps:**

- Look for important CDN or first-party domains mistakenly blocked.
- Use uBO Scope's "Blocked" and "Stealth-blocked" domain sections to identify culprits.
- Modify filters to whitelist or allow stealth-blocking.

---

## 5. Tips and Best Practices

- Always test filter lists across multiple sites to observe diverse network behaviors.
- Prioritize identifying public suffix and proper registrable domain matches using uBO Scope’s domain aggregation.
- Use the Public Suffix List to discern base domains from subdomains, avoiding over-blocking.
- Regularly review stealth-blocked entries to refine blocking precision.
- Avoid relying solely on block counts; focus on distinct third-party domains allowed.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Scenarios">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
Make sure uBO Scope is allowed permissions, and the background service worker is active. Reload the page and open the popup again.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Domains Listed in Popup">
- Check if the tab is active and loading real content.
- Confirm network requests are not bypassing the webRequest API.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Domains Always Appear Allowed">
- Confirm if these domains are truly first-party or essential CDN domains.
- If not, update your filter list to target these more specifically.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Blocked Domains Causing Site Breakage">
- Use the stealth-block feature to block less intrusively.
- Whitelist necessary domains temporarily while refining your filters.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
