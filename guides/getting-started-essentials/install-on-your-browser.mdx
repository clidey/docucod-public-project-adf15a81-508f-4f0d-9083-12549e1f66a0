## Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### 1. Choose Your Browser's Extension Store
uBO Scope is available on:

### 2. Installing from the Chrome Web Store (Chromium Browsers)

1. Open your Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.).
2. Navigate to the official uBO Scope listing on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
3. Click **Add to Chrome**.
4. Confirm the permissions prompt:
   - uBO Scope requires access to monitor network connections via `webRequest` permissions.
   - It will request permission to access browsing data on all sites.
5. Wait for the extension to download and install.

### 3. Installing from Firefox Add-ons (Firefox Browser)

1. Open Firefox.
2. Visit the official uBO Scope page on [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
3. Click **Add to Firefox**.
4. Review the permissions requested:
   - uBO Scope needs access to monitor network requests (`webRequest` API).
   - Accept the permissions to proceed.
5. The extension will be downloaded and installed.

### 4. Verify the Installation

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. It resembles the uBlock Origin icon but may differ subtly.
2. Click the icon to open the popup panel.
3. Visit any website of your choice.
4. After the page loads, click the uBO Scope toolbar icon again.
5. You should see real-time counts of network connections categorized as:
   - Not blocked (allowed connections)
   - Stealth-blocked
   - Blocked

The toolbar badge will display the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.

<Tip>
If the icon does not appear after installation, check your browser’s extension management page and ensure uBO Scope is enabled. You may also need to pin the extension icon to your toolbar manually.
</Tip>

### 5. Pinning uBO Scope for Easy Access

- In Chromium browsers, click the puzzle-piece icon (Extensions menu), then click the pin icon next to uBO Scope.
- In Firefox, open the Add-ons Manager (`about:addons`), and make sure uBO Scope is marked as enabled in the toolbar.

### 6. Keep uBO Scope Up To Date
