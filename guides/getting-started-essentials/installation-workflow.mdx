## Step 2: Install uBO Scope from Official Sources

### Chrome/Chromium

1. Open the Chrome Web Store link above.
2. Click **Add to Chrome**.
3. When prompted, review the permissions, then click **Add extension**.
4. Wait for the installation confirmation.

### Firefox

1. Open the Mozilla Add-ons link above.
2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Review requested permissions and click **Add**.
4. Confirm the extension is installed by the notification.

### Safari

1. If available, find uBO Scope in the Safari Extensions Gallery.
2. If manual installation is required:
   - Visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
   - Follow the manual installation steps specific to Safari (refer to README). 
   - Enable the extension in Safari’s Preferences under Extensions.

---

## Step 3: Locate the uBO Scope Icon

After installation, the uBO Scope icon should appear in your browser’s toolbar where your extensions are displayed.

- **Chrome & Firefox:** Typically, the icon appears near the address bar.
- **Safari:** Check the extensions toolbar, enable if hidden.

If you do not see the icon:

- Click your browser’s extensions menu (e.g., puzzle piece in Chrome).
- Pin or enable uBO Scope to the toolbar.

---

## Step 4: Understand Permissions and Why They Are Required

uBO Scope requests the following key permissions:

| Permission | Purpose                                                   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `activeTab`| Access the currently active tab to monitor its network activity|
| `storage`  | Save session data and settings across browser sessions    |
| `webRequest` | Listen to network requests to collect connection info    |
| `host_permissions` | Monitor all http/https and websocket connections, critical for accurate reporting|

These permissions are essential to capture comprehensive and accurate connection data, enabling uBO Scope to:

- Track all outgoing network requests
- Differentiate between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections
- Update the toolbar badge to display the count of unique third-party domains connected

<Tip>
Granting these permissions ensures uBO Scope fully operates, providing precise insights into your browser's remote server connections.
</Tip>

---

## Step 5: Activate and Verify the Toolbar Badge

Once installed and permissions are granted, uBO Scope starts monitoring network connections automatically. The **toolbar badge** on the extension icon summarizes the number of distinct third-party domains from which resources were successfully loaded.

### How to verify if uBO Scope is active:

1. Browse to any commonly visited website.
2. Look at the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
3. The badge should display a number indicating connected third-party domains.
4. Click the icon to open the popup panel for detailed connection outcomes:
    - **Not Blocked:** Domains successfully connected
    - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains blocked via stealth (not visible to the site)
    - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked

### What to expect:

- A **non-zero number** on the badge represents active monitoring
- A **zero or empty badge** means no third-party connections detected or extension not functioning

<Check>
If the badge remains empty, try refreshing your current web page or opening a new tab to trigger network activity.
</Check>

## Step 6: Permissions Locations by Browser

| Browser | Where to Review Extension Permissions                               |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chrome  | `chrome://extensions/` > uBO Scope > Details                         |
| Firefox | `about:addons` > uBO Scope > Preferences or More > Permissions       |
| Safari  | `Safari > Preferences > Extensions` > uBO Scope                     |

Here you can confirm permissions and enable or disable the extension.

---

## Troubleshooting Setup

If uBO Scope does not seem to function correctly after installation:

- Confirm your browser version is supported.
- Verify the extension is enabled in the browser’s extension management page.
- Refresh tabs or restart the browser.
- Check for conflicting extensions that aggressively block network requests.

## Best Practices

- Always install uBO Scope from official browser stores or the trusted GitHub repository.
