---

## What You'll Achieve

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Choose Your Browser

uBO Scope supports three main browsers. Select your browser and proceed:

- **Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, etc.)**
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Apple Safari**


### Step 2: Install uBO Scope

1. Navigate to the official extension source:
    - For Chromium browsers, visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
    - For Firefox, visit the [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
    - For Safari, install via the Safari Extensions Gallery or through the App Store as per your system prompt

2. Click **Add to Browser** or **Install**.
3. Follow the browser prompts to grant necessary permissions:
   - `webRequest` — to monitor network requests
   - `activeTab` — to interact with the currently active tab
   - `storage` — to save session data

<Tip>
Granting these permissions is essential for uBO Scope to function correctly. Declining them will result in limited or no data collection.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Confirm Installation

After installation:

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. It appears as a circle badge with a stylized icon.
- If the icon is not visible, check your browser’s extensions menu or toolbar customization settings.

<Check>
If you cannot locate the icon, review the [Resolving Common Installation Problems](/getting-started/setup-troubleshooting/common-installation-issues) guide.

## Opening uBO Scope and Exploring the Interface

### Step 1: Open the Popup Panel

Click the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar. This action opens the popup window.

### Step 2: Understand the Popup Layout

The popup presents a straightforward summary of third-party connections for the active tab:

- **Hostname Display**: At the top, the domain of the current tab displays, split into subdomain and main domain for clarity.
- **Domains Connected Count**: Shows the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- **Three Sections Representing Connection Outcomes:**
   - **Not Blocked:** Domains that were allowed and connected successfully.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were blocked in a stealthy manner (invisible to the webpage).
   - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were definitively blocked.

Each section lists domains with the count of resource requests made to them.

### Step 3: Verify Data Loading

Upon opening, you’ll initially see "NO DATA" or a loading state. After a moment, the extension fetches data about the current tab and populates the interface.

<Tip>
This loading time is usually under a second. If the popup shows no data after a reasonable wait, try refreshing the tab or checking your browser permissions.
</Tip>

---

## Verifying uBO Scope is Working

### Step 1: Navigate to a Website

Open any website in the active tab (for example, https://example.com).

### Step 2: Observe the Toolbar Icon Badge

The badge will display a number representing the count of distinct third-party remote servers the page contacted successfully.

### Step 3: Open the Popup Panel

Click the extension icon to confirm that domains appear under the appropriate sections, and the connected count matches the badge.

<Check>
If the badge remains empty and the popup shows no domains:

- Refresh the webpage and wait a few seconds
- Ensure the extension has the required `webRequest` permission
- Confirm no conflicting extensions are interfering
</Check>

For detailed troubleshooting, see [Resolving Common Installation Problems](/getting-started/setup-troubleshooting/common-installation-issues).

## Practical Tips for Your First Look

- The **lowest connected domain count means better privacy**
- The **popup updates live** as you navigate across tabs
- Domains in **stealth-blocked** indicate blocking actions can be invisible to websites
- **Blocked domains** confirm where connections were prevented

Use this understanding to quickly assess third-party activity while browsing.
