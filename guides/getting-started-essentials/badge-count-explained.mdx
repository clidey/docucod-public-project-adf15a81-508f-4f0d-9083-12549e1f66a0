# Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count

## Overview

The toolbar badge count in uBO Scope is your immediate, at-a-glance indicator of how many distinct third-party remote servers your current browser tab is connecting to. This guide helps you understand what this badge count represents, why lower counts are preferable, and what insights you can draw about your privacy based on these numbers.

## What Does the Badge Count Represent?

The badge on the extension icon displays the **number of unique third-party remote server domains** your active tab connected to during the current browsing session. Here’s what this means in practice:

- **Third-party remote servers** are domains different from the website's own domain that your browser requests resources from.
- The count reflects **distinct domains**, not the total number of requests. Multiple requests to the same domain count as one.
- It includes connections that were allowed (successfully loaded) by your browser.


## Why a Lower Badge Count Is Desirable

A lower badge count typically indicates fewer third-party domains connected to by the webpage you are visiting. This is desirable because:

- It reflects **better privacy**; fewer third-party domains means less tracking and data sharing.
- Many third-party third-party servers are trackers, ad servers, or analytics tools that may infringe on your privacy.
- Legitimate third parties like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) usually have a low footprint and count.


## What Does the Badge Count Tell You About Your Privacy?

The badge count provides a direct window into your exposure to third-party connections on any webpage:

- **High counts** often mean many third-party scripts or resources, which can imply more tracking and data dissemination.
- **Moderate to low counts** suggest either well-curated content or effective blocking mechanisms that reduce external connections.
- It helps you assess the actual network activity beyond superficial block counts displayed by other extensions.


## Badge Count and Connection Outcomes

uBO Scope tracks all network connections your browser attempts or completes for the active tab, categorizing them as:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully established (counted in the badge).
- **Blocked:** Network requests stopped by your content blocker or browser.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Redirects or modified connections meant to block tracking stealthily.

The badge count focuses on the number of unique allowed third-party domains. This is crucial since it highlights your actual exposure rather than just how many requests or blocks occurred.


## Using the Badge Count Effectively

### Interpreting Badge Counts

| Badge Count Range | Likely Explanation                          | User Takeaway                   |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 0                 | No third-party connections                    | Strong privacy on this tab     |
| 1-5               | Few third-party domains, likely CDNs or minimal tracking | Generally good privacy         |
| 6-20              | Multiple third-party domains                   | Moderate tracking exposure; review if needed |
| 20+               | Many distinct third-party servers              | High tracking exposure; consider blocking or alternative browsing |


### Best Practices

- Monitor badge counts regularly to develop intuition about typical third-party exposure.
- When visiting sensitive sites, a low badge count confirms fewer remote servers are involved.
- Use the popup panel to inspect *which* third-party domains your browser connected to for more detailed privacy assessment.


## Step-by-Step: Checking Your Badge Count

1. **Open a webpage** in your browser.
2. **Observe the uBO Scope toolbar icon** — a number appears indicating unique third-party connections.
3. **Click the icon** to open the popup panel to see detailed lists of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.
4. **Compare badge counts across sites** to identify pages with high or low third-party exposure.


## Common Scenarios

- You visit a news website and see a badge count of 15 — many third-party connections are active, likely due to ads or trackers.
- On a banking website, you see a badge count of 1 or 0 — minimal third-party exposure, indicating better privacy.
- After enabling additional content blocking filters, you notice the badge count reduces, showing fewer connections.


## Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues

- **Badge count not updating:** Ensure uBO Scope has proper permissions and is active.
- **Unexpectedly high counts:** Open the popup panel to identify which domains are connected; some scripts could be embedded
- **No badge appears:** Confirm browser compatibility and extension installation status.

<Tip>
The badge count is a concise privacy score, but always use the popup for context and deeper domain insights.

## Next Steps

- Explore the guide [First Inspection: Viewing Third-Party Connections](/guides/getting-started-essentials/first-inspection) to learn how to interpret the detailed domain lists.
- Review [Detecting Third-Party Trackers in Practice](/guides/real-life-use-cases/detecting-trackers) to understand real-world privacy implications.
- If unfamiliar with terms, consult [Key Concepts & Terminology](/overview/architecture-concepts/key-concepts-terminology) for foundational knowledge.

## Summary

The toolbar badge count in uBO Scope is your real-time privacy meter showing the number of distinct third-party servers connected to on the current webpage. Lower counts correspond to better privacy with fewer external tracking connections. Use it alongside the popup interface to make informed decisions about your browsing privacy and blocker effectiveness.
