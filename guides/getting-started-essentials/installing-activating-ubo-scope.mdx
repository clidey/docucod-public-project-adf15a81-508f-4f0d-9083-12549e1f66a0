# Installing and Activating uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide walks you through installing uBO Scope in your preferred browser, ensuring the extension is properly activated, and understanding the toolbar badge displayed upon first launch. By following these precise steps, you'll be set up to start monitoring third-party remote server connections effectively.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms and Prerequisites

Before beginning the installation, ensure your environment meets the following:

- **Supported Browsers:** Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Chrome), Firefox, and Safari 18.5 or later.
- **Required Permissions:**
  - Access to the `webRequest` API to capture network activity
  - Host permissions for URLs matching `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` (and WebSocket protocols for Chromium/Firefox)
  - Storage permission for session data management
- **Network Connectivity:** Internet access to fetch the public suffix list during first run
- **User Privileges:** Ability to install browser extensions

<Tip>
Check your browser version and ensure it meets the minimum requirements listed above to avoid compatibility issues.
</Tip>

## 2. Installing uBO Scope

### Step 1: Access the Browser Extension Store

- **Chromium:** Visit the [Chrome Web Store - uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- **Firefox:** Visit the [Firefox Add-ons - uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- **Safari:** Use Safari Extension Gallery or relevant source to install; requires Safari 18.5 or above

### Step 2: Install the Extension

- Click **Add to Browser** or equivalent action.
- Confirm permissions requested by the browser prompt.
- Wait for installation to complete.

### Step 3: Verify Installation

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar.
- The icon should be visible and clickable.

<Check>
If the uBO Scope icon does not appear, verify installation in your browser's extensions management page and ensure it is enabled.
</Check>

## 3. Activating and First Launch

Upon installation, the extension runs automatically in the background:

- The background script starts monitoring network requests.
- The first load downloads the public suffix list necessary for domain parsing.
- Session data initializes or restores previous state if available.

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- The popup will load and display your current tab's connection insights.

### Step 2: Understand the Toolbar Badge

- The badge shows a **count of distinct third-party domains for which network connections have been allowed** on the active tab.
- A lower count is generally better, indicating fewer third-party remote connections.

<Info>
The badge updates dynamically as network requests are made and processed, reflecting live data.
</Info>

### Step 3: Confirm Data Display

- The popup lists domains categorized as **Not Blocked (allowed), Stealth-Blocked,** and **Blocked**.
- Each category shows the domain name and the number of network requests associated.

<Tip>
To see data, make sure you visit a website that loads external resources (typically any active site).
</Tip>

---

## 4. Troubleshooting First Activation

- **Popup shows NO DATA:**
  - Refresh the current tab to trigger network activity.
  - Ensure that uBO Scope has proper permissions to read network requests.
- **Badge count does not update:**
  - Switch to another tab and return to refresh the badge.
  - Restart the browser to reload the extension's background process.
- **Extension icon missing:**
  - Revisit extension management and enable visibility.
  - Check for conflicting extensions or browser restrictions.

<Warning>
Without appropriate permissions (especially `webRequest` and host permissions), uBO Scope cannot monitor network traffic or display accurate data.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Best Practices for a Smooth Start

- Ensure you provide all requested permissions during install.
- Keep your browser updated to the latest stable release.
- Use the extension on active web pages to generate meaningful network data.
- Periodically check the popup interface to understand network connection patterns.

## 6. Next Steps

- Learn to [Interpret Connection Insights](/guides/getting-started-essentials/interpreting-connection-insights) to derive privacy-relevant conclusions.
- Follow the [A Typical uBO Scope Investigation Workflow](/guides/getting-started-essentials/core-usage-workflow) for daily usage.
- If you run into setup issues, consult [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-run-validation/troubleshooting-setup).
