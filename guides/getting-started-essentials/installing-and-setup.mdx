## 2. Step-by-Step Installation and Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Browser Compatibility
- Ensure your browser version matches or exceeds the minimum supported versions listed above.
- Update your browser if necessary before proceeding.

### Step 2: Install uBO-Scope Extension
- Navigate to the official extension store for your browser:
  - **Chrome:** [Chrome Web Store uBO-Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - **Firefox:** [Mozilla Add-ons uBO-Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
  - **Safari:** Use the Mac App Store for Safari extensions, searching "uBO Scope" (requires Safari 18.5+)

- Click **Add to Browser** or **Install**.
- Confirm any permission prompts requesting access to tabs and network requests.

<Tip>
Always install uBO-Scope from official stores to ensure authenticity and security.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Confirm Extension is Enabled
- After installation, check the browser's extensions menu or toolbar:
  - The uBO-Scope icon (a distinct badge with the uBO logo) should appear.
  - If the icon is not visible, enable it from the browser’s extension management page.

### Step 4: Grant Required Permissions
- uBO-Scope requires permissions to access active tabs, network requests (via the `webRequest` API), and local storage.
- Most browsers will prompt for these automatically during installation.
- Verify permissions in your browser's extension settings.

<Warning>
Without these permissions, uBO-Scope cannot monitor network connections correctly.
</Warning>

### Step 5: Understand the Toolbar Badge
- Upon hitting a new webpage, the badge on the extension icon updates to show the number of unique third-party remote servers contacted.
- A lower count indicates fewer third-party connections, which is often preferred for privacy.

### Step 6: Open the uBO-Scope Popup
- Click the extension icon to open the popup.
- It dynamically displays the active tab’s connection summary, listing domains categorized as "allowed", "stealth-blocked", or "blocked".

### Step 7: Validate Installation and Monitoring
- Navigate to several websites to cause network requests.
- Monitor the badge number changing to reflect third-party connections.
- Open the popup to verify domains are listed appropriately.
