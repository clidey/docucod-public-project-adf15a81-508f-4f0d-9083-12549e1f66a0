# First Inspection: Viewing Third-Party Connections

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide walks you through using the popup panel of **uBO Scope** to inspect detailed information about remote server connections for the current browser tab. You will learn how to identify which third-party domains are connected, blocked, or stealth-blocked by your content blocking setup.

### Prerequisites
- You have successfully installed and activated uBO Scope in your browser.
- The extension has the necessary permissions (such as `webRequest` and `activeTab`).
- You are currently browsing a website in an active tab.

### Expected Outcome
By the end of this guide, you will be able to open the uBO Scope popup panel and understand the categorized list of third-party domains interacting with the webpage you are visiting. You will be comfortable interpreting the counts and statuses shown in the popup UI.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 5-10 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel
- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
- The popup panel appears, initially showing a loading message if data is being retrieved.

### 2. Understand the Header Information
- The top header shows the hostname of the current tab’s webpage:
  - If the hostname differs from its registered domain, it displays the hostname prefix and base domain separately for easier recognition.

### 3. Review the Summary Section
- Below the header is a summary showing the total number of unique third-party **domains connected** to this tab.
- This count represents the distinct remote third-party domains from which your browser fetched resources or attempted connections.

### 4. Inspect the Categories of Remote Connections
The popup divides the remote connections into three categories, each shown in a dedicated section:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
  - This green-highlighted section lists domains that made successful connections during the session.
  - Each domain has a count indicating how many times the browser connected.

- **Stealth-Blocked**
  - This red-highlighted section lists domains for which the requests were redirected, typically by stealth methods used by your content blocker.
  - These connections were prevented quietly to avoid detection or breakage on webpages.

- **Blocked**
  - Another red-highlighted section listing domains where network requests resulted in errors or explicit blocking.
  - This typically reflects direct blocking from your content blocker or network filtering.

### 5. Interpret Domain Names and Counts
- Domain names are normalized and shown in readable Unicode format, including internationalized domain names (IDNs).
- The count next to each domain shows how many connections uBO Scope observed for that domain during the current tab session.
  - Higher counts imply repeated resource requests.

### 6. Using the Information Practically
- Identify suspicious or unexpected third-party connections by reviewing the **allowed** domains.
- Verify if known trackers or ad servers appear in the **stealth-blocked** or **blocked** lists to confirm your content blockers are effective.
- Use this information to make informed decisions about your content blocking setup or to investigate unusual network activity.

### 7. Refreshing Data
- The popup automatically updates with new request data when you revisit the popup or navigate in the tab.
- If you see 'NO DATA' or empty sections, ensure the tab is active and has loaded content that makes network requests.

## Examples & Interpretation

### Example Scenario
You visit a news website. Opening uBO Scope’s popup, you see:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: `cdn.cloudflare.net` (5), `fonts.googleapis.com` (3)
- **Stealth-Blocked**: `tracker.example.com` (4)
- **Blocked**: `ads.exampleadserver.com` (2)

Interpretation:
- The website loads assets from Cloudflare CDN and Google Fonts without blocking.
- Your content blocker stealthily redirects requests from a known tracker.
- Some ad servers are explicitly blocked as errors.

This provides transparency on real third-party connections your browser makes and how blocking impacts them.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Popup shows 'NO DATA'**
  - Ensure the active tab is fully loaded and making network requests.
  - uBO Scope relies on the browser `webRequest` API; network activity outside its scope won't appear.

- **No domains show up despite browsing active sites**
  - Double-check permissions granted to the extension.
  - Verify no conflicts or restrictions prevent monitoring.

- **Counts seem low or empty**
  - Some pages load resources deferred or after interactions; try reloading the page or interacting.
  - Background sessions maintain data only for current tabs.

### Best Practices
- Regularly check uBO Scope after navigating to new sites to observe connection patterns.
- Use the categorized lists to assess privacy exposure quickly.

### Performance Considerations
- uBO Scope processes requests asynchronously and batches updates to avoid slowing down browsing.
- The popup only loads data for the active tab to maintain responsiveness.

### Alternative Approaches
- Combine uBO Scope inspection with other tools like content blocker UIs or browser developer network tabs for deeper analysis.
