# First Use: Viewing and Interpreting Connections

Welcome to your first journey with uBO Scope. This guide walks you through opening the uBO Scope popup interface for the first time, understanding the connection summary displayed, and interpreting the toolbar badge count. By following this guide, you'll confidently distinguish between first-party and third-party connections and grasp what each connection outcome means for your privacy.

---

## 1. What This Guide Helps You Achieve

- **Task Description:** Learn how to open the uBO Scope popup, read its data presentation, and understand the real meaning behind the toolbar badge count.
- **Prerequisites:** uBO Scope installed and active in your browser, browsing a webpage with network activity.
- **Expected Outcome:** Ability to view detailed third-party connections per tab, interpret connection categories, and evaluate network activity related to privacy.
- **Time Estimate:** 5 to 10 minutes.
- **Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

## 2. Accessing the uBO Scope Popup

Your first step is to open the popup interface which visually displays all third-party network connections for the current browser tab.

### Steps:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar. (It usually looks like a shield or globe icon labeled 'uBO Scope.')
2. Click the icon to open the popup. The popup will load data relevant to the currently active tab.

### What to Expect:

- The popup header will show the main hostname of the page you are visiting.
- The summary section will display the total number of distinct connected domains.
- Three categorized sections list domains based on their connection outcomes: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

### Verification:

- If the popup says 'NO DATA' or remains empty, refresh the current tab or verify installation and permissions.

<Tip>
If you do not see the uBO Scope icon, consult the 'Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues' guide to ensure the extension is installed correctly and permissions are granted.
</Tip>

## 3. Understanding the Connection Summary

The popup groups third-party connections into three distinct outcomes:

### Connection Categories Explained

| Category           | Meaning                                                                                  | Privacy Implications                                         |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**    | Domains and hosts to which requests were allowed and successfully connected.             | Indicates active third-party connections possibly used by the webpage or trackers.
|
| **Stealth-Blocked**| Requests redirected or silently blocked without user-visible failure.                    | These connections were prevented stealthily by a content blocker or network control.
|
| **Blocked**        | Requests that explicitly failed or were blocked, often by content blockers or errors.   | These connections did not succeed, reducing third-party exposure.
|

### What You See in Each Section

- Each domain is listed with the count of requests made.
- Domains are sorted alphabetically for easy lookup.
- Counts help evaluate frequency or intensity of connection attempts.

### Practical Interpretation

- A high count in **Not Blocked** means many third-party resources were fetched — this might decrease privacy.
- **Stealth-Blocked** connections show the effectiveness of blocking without impacting site functionality.
- **Blocked** indicates visible failed attempts to load third-party content.

<Info>
Remember: The extension reports all network requests observed via the browser’s webRequest API, including those blocked by other content blockers or DNS filtering.
</Info>

## 4. Decoding the Toolbar Badge Count

The number you see on the uBO Scope icon badge is a crucial privacy indicator.

### What the Badge Indicates

- It shows the **number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections** for the current tab.
- The count excludes first-party domain connections (the website you are visiting).

### Why It Matters

- Lower badge count correlates to fewer third-party data fetches – a positive privacy signal.
- A high badge count suggests your browser connected to many external servers.

### Confirming the Badge With the Popup

- The badge’s count should match the number of domains listed under the **Not Blocked** section in the popup.
- Discrepancies could indicate timing delays or issues with data collection.

<Tip>
Use the badge count as your quick privacy gauge. Opening the popup gives you deeper context for understanding which domains contribute to it.
</Tip>

## 5. Differentiating First-Party and Third-Party Requests

- **First-party**: The domain of the page you are currently viewing.
- **Third-party**: Any external domain that the page contacts.

uBO Scope captures and segregates these automatically:

- The header identifies the first-party hostname and domain.
- The listed domains under the outcomes are third-party domains.

This distinction is critical because first-party requests are usually necessary for the site to work, while third-party requests often relate to ads, trackers, or embedded content.

---

## 6. Practical Tips for Your First Analysis

- After visiting a webpage, open uBO Scope and check the badge count and popup for third-party domains.
- Identify familiar third-party services (e.g., CDNs, analytics providers).
- Use the stealth-blocked list to appreciate silently blocked requests avoiding potential tracking without breaking the site.
- Remember that some legitimate third-party connections are normal (e.g., CDN resources).

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting First Use Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or is Empty">
- Refresh the active tab to trigger fresh network requests.
- Verify uBO Scope is enabled and has the correct permissions.
- Ensure you have an active network connection.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
- Close and reopen the popup.
- Reload the browser tab.
- Check permissions for uBO Scope, especially access to webRequest API.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Confusion About Domains Listed">
- Use the popup header to confirm the first-party domain.
- Domains in the lists are always third-party.
- Some requests may come from subdomains or different subservices.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Regularly consulting the 'Accessing the Popup & Verifying Installation' guide will help reinforce your understanding and swiftly resolve common setup obstacles.
