# Using the Popup: Viewing and Interpreting Network Connections

## Overview
This guide takes you through the essential steps to open, navigate, and understand the uBO Scope popup interface. By the end, you’ll confidently read the domain categorization and connection counts revealed in real-time while browsing, empowering you to interpret allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked network connections with clarity.

## What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
- Open the uBO Scope popup from your browser.
- Understand each section and domain categorization presented.
- Interpret connection counts and domain names accurately.
- Use the popup to gain insights into your current tab’s network activity.

---

## Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension is installed and enabled in your supported browser (Chromium-based, Firefox, or Safari).
- Permissions for webRequest and storage are granted during installation.
- You have loaded a webpage with network activity in your current browser tab.

---

## Expected Outcome
After following the steps, you will see a detailed, categorized list of domains your current tab connects to, segmented into:

- **Allowed** (not blocked) — Domains from which connections were successful.
- **Blocked** — Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked** — Domains whose requests were stealthily blocked (e.g., via redirects).

You’ll understand the meaning behind the counts and the visual layout, enabling real-time network analysis via the popup.

# Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. It usually looks like a shield or the extension logo.
2. Click this icon to open the popup window.

<Check>Popup opens with network connection information for the active tab.</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Identify the Hostname Display">
- At the top of the popup is the hostname of the current tab.
- The hostname is displayed in two parts: the subdomain (faded) and the registered domain (stronger font). If the hostname and domain are identical, only the domain is shown.

Example:

- For `news.example.com`, `news.` appears faint and `example.com` appears prominent.
- For `example.com` alone, only `example.com` shows.

<Check>The hostname matches what is shown in your browser’s address bar for the active tab.</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Read the Summary of Connected Domains">
- Just below the hostname, a summary section shows the **number of distinct third-party domains your current tab connected to**.
- This number reflects the unique domains counted as allowed connections (not blocked).

<Info>The number here is the same as the badge count on the toolbar icon when viewed for this tab.</Info>

<Check>You see a numeric count labeled “domains connected”.</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Understand Domain Categorization Sections">
The popup categorizes third-party domains into three sections, each showing domains with their connection counts:

- **Not blocked (allowed)**: Domains from which resources were successfully loaded.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Domains where requests were blocked indirectly (e.g., via redirects or stealth techniques).
- **Blocked**: Domains explicitly blocked by filters or content blockers.

Each section shows a list of domains sorted alphabetically. Next to each domain is the number of connection attempts or requests logged from that domain.

<Note>Sections with no domains (empty) will not appear to keep the interface clean.</Note>

<Check>Each visible section should have a heading and a list of domain rows with counts.</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Domain Names and Counts">
- **Domain names** may appear in Unicode or punycode form. The popup ensures you see readable domain names.
- **Counts** indicate how many times the current tab requested resources from each domain.

This allows you to quickly spot which third-party domains are most active.

<Example>If you see `cdn.example.com - 15`, this means 15 distinct requests were made to that domain during the tab session.</Example>

<Check>Reviewed domain list shows plausible domain names and counts that correspond with your browsing activity.</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Use the Popup During Browsing">
- While browsing, open and refresh the popup anytime to monitor domains as they are allowed or blocked.
- Observe changes in the summary and domain lists in real-time.

This helps you identify potential privacy risks, unexpected third-party connections, or the effectiveness of your content blocking setup.

<Tip>Try visiting different websites to see the variation in connected domains and blocker behavior.</Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- The popup only reflects data for the **active tab** at the moment you open it.
- To reset data, simply reload the webpage. The popup updates accordingly.
- Use the domain counts to spot domains with suspiciously high request activity.
- Remember some third-party domains (e.g., CDNs) are normal and necessary.
- If the popup shows "NO DATA", reload the tab or confirm uBO Scope is active.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA or Is Empty">
- Ensure you have an active tab with a webpage loaded.
- Reload the tab page to trigger fresh connection data.
- Confirm the extension is enabled and permissions are granted.
- If problem persists, check the [Troubleshooting Installation](../getting-started/installation-basics/troubleshooting-install) guide.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Domain Counts Don’t Match Expected Traffic">
- Some domains might be stealth-blocked, appearing in that category instead of allowed.
- Cross-check with the [Core Concepts & Terminology](../overview/about-ubo-scope/core-concepts-terminology) page for how outcomes are classified.
- Other content blockers or DNS filtering might affect reported results.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup Not Opening">
- Try clicking the toolbar icon again.
- Check your browser extension permissions.
- Restart your browser if necessary.
- Refer to the [Opening the uBO Scope Popup](../getting-started/first-run-experience/opening-popup) guide.
</Accordion>
