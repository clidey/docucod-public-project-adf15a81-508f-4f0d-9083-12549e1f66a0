# Reading the Popup Panel: Interpreting Connection Data

## Overview
This guide walks you through the uBO Scope popup interface, explaining how to understand the real-time network connection data it presents for the active browser tab. You'll learn how to interpret badge counts, differentiate connection outcomes (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked), and read detailed domain-level statistics. This knowledge will enable you to quickly extract clear, actionable privacy insights from the popup panel.

## Understanding the Popup Panel

When you click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar, a popup appears, showing detailed information about network connections initiated by the current tab.

### Key Elements of the Popup

- **Hostname Header**
  - Displays the fully qualified hostname of the current tab.
  - If the hostname includes a subdomain, it shows the subdomain portion and the main domain separately for clarity.

- **Domains Connected Summary**
  - A count of distinct remote domains contacted by the webpage, reflecting the number of unique third-party domains.

- **Connection Outcomes Sections**
  The popup classifies connections into three outcome categories, shown in separate sections:
  
  1. **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
     - Domains from which network requests were allowed and completed successfully.
     - Shown with a green highlight.
     - Represents the distinct domains that the page successfully connected to.

  2. **Stealth-Blocked**
     - Domains where requests were silently redirected or stealthily blocked without raising errors.
     - Displayed with a red highlight.
     - These connections were prevented but in a way that attempts to avoid detection by the webpage.

  3. **Blocked**
     - Domains where requests failed due to errors or explicit blocking, clearly prevented from completing.
     - Also highlighted in red.
     - Reflects outright blocking events, such as network errors or explicit content blocker interference.

Each section lists the domains involved, along with a count of how many individual hostnames under that domain made requests.

## How to Read and Interpret the Data

### 1. Hostname and Domain Information

- The popup header always shows the exact domain of the site you are browsing.
- If the site includes subdomains (e.g., `api.example.com`), the subdomain and main domain (`example.com`) are visually separated.
- This distinction helps identify the main website versus third-party domains.

### 2. Domain Count and Badge Number

- The badge on the toolbar icon shows the count of distinct third-party domains successfully connected to (`Allowed` domains).
- This count is a critical privacy metric: fewer distinct third-party domains generally implies fewer external parties tracking or interacting with the webpage.
- The summary at the top of the popup mirrors this badge count for easy cross-checking.

### 3. Outcome Sections Explained

Each domain listed is accompanied by a numeric count indicating how many hostnames (subdomains or related sub-resources) were involved with that domain:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked)**
  - These are domains from which resources were fully loaded.
  - For example, loading images or scripts from a CDN or analytics domain.
  - A high number here means more external network connections.

- **Stealth-Blocked**
  - These are connections stopped in ways to avoid detection by web pages.
  - Often used to minimize webpage breakage or reduce anti-adblock detection.

- **Blocked**
  - These connections failed or were stopped outright.
  - Examples include DNS-level blocks or browser-enforced blocks.

Pay attention to these counts to understand the effectiveness of your filters or blockers and to spot unexpected third parties.

## Step-by-Step: Using the Popup Panel Effectively

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar while on any webpage.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the Current Site">
Look at the top header displaying the hostname and domain of the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Connected Domains Count">
Note the number shown under “domains connected”—this reflects distinct third-party domains contacted.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Allowed Domains">
Expand the 'not blocked' section to see which domains successfully loaded resources.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Review the 'stealth-blocked' section to detect silently blocked connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Blocked Domains">
Look at the 'blocked' section for clearly prevented network requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze Counts for Insights">
Compare the counts per domain to assess which third parties are most active or frequently contacted.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Validate with Badge Count**: The toolbar badge reflects the number of allowed third-party domains; use this as your quick privacy indicator.
- **Watch for Unexpected Domains**: Unexpected domains in 'allowed' may indicate third-party trackers or advertisers.
- **Stealth-Blocking Awareness**: Stealth-blocked entries show the subtle action of blocking; check this if you suspect some content is being blocked silently.
- **Use During Filtering Tuning**: When adjusting filter or content blocking rules, monitor changes in these sections to verify impact.
- **Remember Domain Grouping**: Domains are grouped based on the Public Suffix List logic; subdomains count under their parent domain.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Misreading Counts**: The counts show distinct domains, not total requests—for example, multiple resources from a single domain count once here.
- **Assuming All Blocked are Third Parties**: Sometimes the main site can appear under 'allowed' or 'blocked'; focus on understanding domain roles.
- **Ignoring Stealth Blocking**: Stealth blocks can be overlooked but are important to recognizing subtle network filtering.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty**
  - This usually means no network data has been captured for the current tab.
  - Reload the page and try again.
  - Confirm uBO Scope is properly installed and permissions are granted.

- **Counts Not Updating**
  - Network activity happens in real time but may have slight delay.
  - Wait a moment or reload the page.

- **Unexpected Domains Present**
  - Some third-party domains are normal (like CDNs).
  - If concerned, cross-check the domain in a web threat or privacy resource.

## Next Steps

- Combine this reading with the [Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope](/guides/getting-started-essentials/install-and-setup) guide to ensure correct installation.
- Explore [Basic Workflow: Analyzing Third-Party Connections](/guides/getting-started-essentials/workflow-basic-analysis) for practical use cases.
- Deepen your understanding by reading [What Do 'Allowed', 'Blocked', and 'Stealth' Mean?](/guides/interpreting-advanced-insights/understanding-outcomes).

```

This snapshot shows 5 connected domains, broken down into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories, with counts representing the number of active hostnames under each domain.
