# Understanding the Popup and Badge

Explore how to interpret uBO Scope's popup interface and toolbar badge to gain clear, actionable insights into your browser’s network activity. This guide walks you through each panel, what the badge number means, and how to read domain lists categorized by request outcomes.

---

## 1. Overview

uBO Scope displays real-time information about remote server connections made by your browser tabs using two main UI elements:

- **Toolbar Badge**: A number indicating the count of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections in the active tab.
- **Popup Interface**: An expanded view showing detailed breakdown of connections grouped by outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).

Understanding these elements empowers you to assess your browsing exposure effectively and spot potential privacy or security concerns.

---

## 2. Toolbar Badge: What It Represents

The badge on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon shows a **count of distinct third-party domains with connections allowed** on the current active tab.

### Key Points:

- **Lower badge counts indicate fewer third-party connections, which usually means better privacy.**
- The count excludes first-party domains; it only reflects third-party domains your browser connected to.
- The badge number updates dynamically as you browse and new network activity occurs.

### Practical Interpretation:

- A badge showing `5` means your browser connected successfully to five distinct third-party domains for that tab.
- If the badge is empty, it means no third-party allowed connections were detected or data is not available.

<Tip>
Always interpret the badge as the number of distinct allowed third-party connections, **not** the number of blocked connections. The badge count focuses on measuring your actual network exposure rather than what the blocker stopped.
</Tip>

## 3. Popup Interface: Exploring Connection Details

Clicking the toolbar icon opens the popup, revealing detailed data per active browser tab.

### Popup Layout Breakdown:

### 3.1 Header Section

- Displays the **host name** and **registered domain** of the current tab.
- The domain shown helps you identify the main site you are browsing.

### 3.2 Summary Panel

- Indicates the **total number of distinct third-party domains connected** during the tab's lifetime.

### 3.3 Outcome Sections

The popup categorizes domains into three outcome groups, each in its own panel:

| Outcome       | Description                                   | What You See                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------| ---------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**  | Connections allowed by the browser/content blocker | List of domains your browser connected to normally.|
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Requests attempted but silently redirected or intercepted | Domains where connection attempts were stealthily blocked (hidden from the page).|
| **Blocked**       | Requests that were explicitly blocked (e.g., by content blockers) | Domains actively denied connections.         |

Each section lists domains with:

- The **domain name** (decoded to Unicode if IDN).
- A **count badge** representing how many network requests were made or blocked for that domain.

### Understanding Domain Rows

Each row shows the domain and how many times it appeared in network request outcomes, helping identify more frequently accessed or problematic servers.

## 4. How to Interpret and Use This Information

1. **Identify your first-party domain in the header** to confirm which site’s connections you are examining.
2. **Check the summary count** of distinct third-party domains to gauge the overall network exposure.
3. **Review the 'Not Blocked' panel** to see which third-party domains are actively allowed and possibly delivering resources.
4. **Look at 'Stealth-Blocked' connections** for blocked redirects or hidden trackers that the extension detected but did not openly block.
5. **Examine the 'Blocked' list** for domains explicitly prevented from loading.

This breakdown enables you to:

- Pinpoint sources of trackers or unwanted third parties.
- Verify effectiveness of content blockers.
- Compare privacy exposure across sites.

<Tip>
Frequent or unexpected domains in the allowed section may warrant further investigation or additional blocking rules.
</Tip>

## 5. Step-by-Step: Using the Popup and Badge Together

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope on an Active Tab">
Click the extension icon next to your browser's address bar to open the popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Read the Badge Number">
Note the number on the toolbar badge: it signals how many distinct third-party domains you are connected to on this page.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Header Information">
Confirm the primary domain or hostname at the top matches your expected current site.
</Step>
<Step title="Review 'Not Blocked' Domains">
Assess third parties your browser connected to without restrictions; these form your actual exposure.
</Step>
<Step title="Check 'Stealth-Blocked' and 'Blocked' Sections">
Look for domains that were redirected away or outright blocked. High numbers may indicate aggressive blocking or many trackers.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Domain Counts to Prioritize Action">
Focus on domains with higher counts in allowed or blocked lists to prioritize privacy improvements.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Practical Example

Suppose you visit `example.com` and see:

- Badge shows `3` — you are connected to three third-party domains.
- Popup header shows `example.com` and an empty hostname portion.
- 'Not Blocked' panel lists `cdn.example.net` (count 12) and `analytics.thirdparty.com` (count 5).
- 'Stealth-Blocked' panel lists `tracker.silentblok.com` (count 2).
- 'Blocked' panel lists no domains.

**Interpretation:**

- Your browsing on example.com resulted in successful connections primarily to two third parties.
- Two attempts to connect to a stealth-blocked tracker were detected and silently prevented.
- No outright blocked domains are shown.

This insight helps evaluate exposure and potential privacy risks.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup and Badge Issues">
<Accordion title="Badge Shows No Number or Is Empty">
If you see no badge number:
- Ensure you have an active tab with network connections.
- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled and permitted to monitor web requests.
- Visit a page known to load third-party content and try again.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Data Shows 'NO DATA' or Blank Sections">
- This indicates no data was collected yet for the current tab.
- Reload the tab or open a new page with network activity.
- Check your content blocker or browser settings to confirm webRequest monitoring is enabled.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Counts Not Updating as Expected">
- Waiting a few seconds can help as uBO Scope batches network data.
- Some connections outside webRequest API reach will not appear.
- Certain browser restrictions or privacy modes may limit data collection.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Tips and Best Practices

- Refresh pages to update connection data after installing the extension.
- Use the badge and popup in combination for a quick, detailed view.
- Frequent large badge counts might indicate many third parties, which can degrade privacy.
- Use information from stealth and blocked lists to tune your content blocking filters.
- Remember some third-party connections are legitimate (e.g., CDN providers).
