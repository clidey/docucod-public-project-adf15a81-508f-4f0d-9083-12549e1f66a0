# Understanding the uBO Scope Popup

Discover how to read and interpret the uBO Scope popup interface, which provides real-time insights into third-party server connections made by the active browser tab. This guide breaks down the meanings behind the categories of connected domains—sanctioned (allowed), stealth-blocked, and blocked—and explains how to understand the summary data presented.

---

## 1. Popup Interface Overview

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup appears to display detailed network connection data for the currently active browser tab. The interface is designed to help you quickly understand which remote servers your browser is interacting with and how content filtering impacts those connections.

### Key Visual Elements

- **Hostname Header**: At the top, the extension shows the current tab's hostname split into two parts:
  - The subdomain portion (if any), shown mildly faded.
  - The main domain, displayed prominently.
- **Summary Section**: Displays the total count of distinct connected domains for the active tab.
- **Connection Outcome Sections**: The popup segregates domains into three outcome groups:
  - **Not blocked (Allowed)**
  - **Stealth-blocked**
  - **Blocked**

Each section lists connected domains along with a count representing the number of distinct network requests made to each.

## 2. Understanding Domain Categories

The popup categorizes third-party domains based on the outcome of their network requests, reflecting the connection status as observed by the extension.

### 2.1. Not Blocked (Allowed)

- These domains represent servers your browser connected to successfully.
- Requests to these domains were permitted by your content blocker or were inherently allowed.
- Seeing familiar CDN domains (e.g., known content delivery networks) under this category is normal and expected.

### 2.2. Stealth-Blocked

- These domains represent connections that were silently blocked using a stealth approach.
- Stealth-blocking means the requests did not complete but the browser or webpage has limited visibility into the block, preserving stealth.
- These entries indicate the content blocker intervened without triggering obvious errors.

### 2.3. Blocked

- Domains listed here had their requests explicitly blocked.
- Blocked connections are those that either errored out or were redirected away due to filtering rules.
- This category helps you see which remote servers were prevented from loading.

---

## 3. How to Read the Summary Data

The summary section below the hostname provides a quick numeric overview labeled "domains connected". This count reflects the number of unique third-party domains contacted (allowed connections) by the current tab.

- **Lower count is better**: A smaller number suggests fewer third-party servers being contacted, improving privacy and performance.
- **Not a block count**: The badge count on the toolbar icon matches this domains connected count rather than blocked connections.

### Example Interpretation

> If your summary says "domains connected: 12" and the allowed section lists 12 domains, the extension indicates these distinct third-party servers successfully responded to your requests.

## 4. Step-by-Step: Interpreting the Popup

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon next to your browser's address bar to launch the popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the Tab Hostname">
At the top, note the hostname for the active tab, split if a subdomain exists. This anchors the context of reported connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Domains Connected Summary">
See how many unique third-party domains your browser connected to for this tab. This helps gauge tracking surface or exposure.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Allowed Domains Section">
Browse through listed domains to see which servers were connected without blocking. Consider if you recognize legitimate services.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore the Stealth-Blocked and Blocked Sections">
Understand what domains had connections that were blocked, either stealthily or explicitly, informing you of active filtering coverage.
</Step>
<Step title="Consider the Counts per Domain">
Observe the connection count next to each domain to comprehend volume and frequency of requests.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Focus on Allowed Domains**: A handful of allowed third-party domains is expected. Excessive connections may indicate riskier privacy exposure.
- **Use the Stealth-Blocked Info**: Stealth-blocked domains reveal filtering without page breakage, useful to gauge silent protections.
- **Blocked Domains Inform Debugging**: If important content breaks on a site, check if required domains are blocked.
- **Regularly Monitor Badge Count**: The icon badge always reflects the count of allowed distinct domains, providing at-a-glance insight.

<Tip>
Remember that not all third-party connections are bad—common CDNs and analytics services often form part of normal browsing.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or '?' in Summary">
This means no network data is currently tracked for the active tab.

- Ensure the tab is fully loaded and active.
- Verify the extension has necessary permissions granted.
- Check that your browser is compatible and up to date.

Reload the tab or switch tabs to trigger data collection.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Domain Counts Are Larger Than Expected">

- Extensions or sites may be connecting to many third-party services.
- Consider reviewing filter lists and adjusting content blocking settings.
- Some domains may resolve to multiple subdomains; uBO Scope aggregates by domain to help reduce confusion.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Domains Appearing Under Blocked or Stealth-Blocked">

- This means the extension has not observed any blocked connections for the active tab.
- Confirm content blocker settings and test on sites known for trackers or advertisements to verify blocking.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unicode Domains Are Hard to Read">

- The popup converts internationalized domain names to Unicode for readability.
- If the domain appears unfamiliar, it may use punycode encoding for special characters.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Appendix: Popup Layout Explanation

The popup's HTML structure underpins its visual presentation:

- `#tabHostname` header contains two spans for subdomain and main domain.
- `#summary` section shows the connected domains count.
- Three `.outcome` sections (`allowed`, `stealth`, and `blocked`) each list domains with counts using the `.domains` container.

This clean structure enables quick comprehension of your browsing tab's network footprint.
