## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Choose Your Browser and Access Installation Source

uBO Scope is compatible with the three main browsers:
- **Chromium-based Browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Edge)
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Safari** (version 18.5 or later)

Access the official extension stores to install uBO Scope:

| Browser        | Installation Link                                    |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium       | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox        | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |
| Safari         | Safari Extensions Gallery or Apple App Store (ensure Safari 18.5+)

> <Note>Always install uBO Scope from these official sources to guarantee you have the authentic and latest version.</Note>

### 2. Install uBO Scope Extension

- Navigate to the appropriate store link for your browser.
- Click **Add to Browser** (or equivalent) to start the installation.
- Approve permissions requested by the extension.

Permissions include:
- `webRequest` — to observe network requests.
- `storage` — to save session data.
- `activeTab` — to monitor the currently active tab.

> <Tip>If you have multiple browser profiles, verify you are installing in the desired profile or user account.</Tip>

### 3. Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

- After installation, look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar area.
   - It appears with the uBO Scope logo, typically sized 16x16 or 32x32 pixels.
- If not visible:
  - On Chromium, click the puzzle piece icon to open the extensions menu and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.
  - On Firefox, click the puzzle icon and customize your toolbar to display uBO Scope.
  - On Safari, enable uBO Scope in Safari Extensions preferences if not immediately visible.

### 4. Verify Extension Activation

- The uBO Scope icon’s badge begins showing a number once network connections are detected.
- Open the extension popup by clicking the icon:
  - Confirm popup shows information about third-party domain connections.
  - If it shows “NO DATA” immediately, reload or navigate to a popular website to generate network activity.

> <Check> A badge displaying a number indicates uBO Scope is tracking connections. No badge or errors may indicate extension is not active or has insufficient permissions.</Check>

### 5. Adjust Basic Settings (Optional)

- While uBO Scope’s functionality is mostly automatic, you may want to review browser extension settings:
  - Check if uBO Scope has all necessary permissions enabled.
  - In the browser extensions or add-ons page, remove conflicting extensions that may block webRequest API access.

> <Note> Detailed settings or filtering options are limited by design; this keeps uBO Scope lightweight and focused on its core task.</Note>

### 6. Ready to Analyze Network Connections

- After installation and verification, uBO Scope immediately begins monitoring all network connections made by your browser.
- The toolbar icon badge always reflects the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** connected by the active tab.
