## Step-by-Step Installation and Activation

Follow these steps carefully to ensure uBO Scope is installed and running correctly.

### Step 1: Choose Your Browser’s Extension Store

#### Chrome
1. Visit the [Chrome Web Store uBO Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).

#### Firefox
1. Visit the [Firefox Add-ons uBO Scope page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).

#### Safari
1. Access the Safari Extensions Gallery for uBO Scope or install via the App Store following official Apple instructions.

### Step 2: Install the Extension

1. Click "Add to Chrome" / "Add to Firefox" / "Install" depending on your browser.
2. When prompted, review the permissions carefully—uBO Scope requests access to monitor network requests to provide accurate connection reporting.
3. Confirm installation by selecting "Add Extension".

### Step 3: Granting Necessary Permissions

- Upon installation, the extension requires the following permissions to function properly:
  - **Active Tab**: to access data from the tab you are browsing.
  - **Storage**: to save session data that helps track network requests.
  - **webRequest**: to monitor and evaluate network activity across sites.

These permissions enable uBO Scope to observe all connections attempted by webpages and categorize their outcomes.

### Step 4: Confirm Extension Activation

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. Depending on your browser and setup, it may be a small shield or logo resembling the uBO Scope icon.
2. After browsing a webpage for a few seconds, observe the icon badge. It reflects the number of distinct third-party domains connected — a number indicating uBO Scope is actively monitoring network requests.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup:
   - You will see a summary listing domains categorized as "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked," confirming activity.

<Tip>
If the toolbar icon is not immediately visible, check your browser’s extension menu or pin uBO Scope to the toolbar for easy access.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Keep Your Browser Updated:** Ensure your browser is on a minimum version supporting the required webRequest permissions to avoid functional limitations.
- **Allow Time for Data Collection:** The badge and popup update as you browse different sites. Give it a few seconds to accumulate data.
- **Watch Permissions Carefully:** Only install from official stores to guarantee secure, trusted permissions.
