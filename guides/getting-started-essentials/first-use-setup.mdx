# Setting Up and Installing uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide walks you through the process of installing uBO Scope, a browser extension designed to transparently report all network connections — both attempted and successful — to remote servers during your browsing sessions. Whether you use Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, or Safari, this guide will help you add the extension, enable it, and locate its toolbar icon to start monitoring third-party connections immediately.

---

## 1. Prerequisites
Before installing uBO Scope, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Supported Browser:** Use one of the supported browsers:
  - **Chromium:** Version 122.0 or later
  - **Firefox:** Version 128.0 or later
  - **Safari:** Version 18.5 or later
- **Manifest V3 Support:** Your browser must support Manifest Version 3 extensions.
- **Permissions:** uBO Scope requires the following permissions in your browser:
  - `activeTab` — to monitor the active browsing tab.
  - `storage` — to save session data.
  - `webRequest` — to listen to network requests.
- **Ensure WebRequest API Availability:** The browser’s `webRequest` API must expose enough detail for uBO Scope to observe network connections.

Follow these platform-specific steps to install uBO Scope.

### 2.1 Installation via Official Browser Stores

#### Chromium (Google Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)

#### Firefox
1. Visit the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Confirm any prompts and wait for the extension to install.
4. The icon will appear in the Firefox toolbar.

#### Safari
1. Access the Safari Extensions Gallery and look for uBO Scope or [install from developer's site](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) if it's not yet available in the gallery.
2. Download and add the extension.
3. Enable uBO Scope in Safari's extension preferences.
4. The toolbar icon will appear once enabled.

### 2.2 Manual Installation (for Developers or Advanced Users)
1. Clone or download the uBO Scope repository from GitHub: `https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope`
2. Load the unpacked extension in your browser's developer mode:
   - Chromium: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable **Developer mode**, click **Load unpacked**, then select the extension folder.
   - Firefox: Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click **Load Temporary Add-on**, choose `manifest.json`.

## 3. Verifying Installation
After installation, confirm uBO Scope is correctly installed and active:

1. **Locate Toolbar Icon:** Look for the uBO Scope icon (depicted with the uBO logo) on the browser’s toolbar.
2. **Enable the Extension:** Ensure it is enabled in your browser’s extensions or add-ons manager.
3. **Initial Badge Check:** When browsing, the icon badge will show a number representing the number of distinct third-party domains with successful connections.
4. **Opening the Popup:** Click the icon to open the popup interface and view detailed connection statistics for the active tab.

<Check>
If the icon does not appear:
- Verify the extension was installed successfully.
- Restart the browser and check again.
- Confirm the extension is not hidden (some browsers hide icons in overflow menus).
</Check>

## 4. Getting Started After Installation
Once installed and verified, follow these steps to start using uBO Scope effectively:

1. Navigate to any webpage.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. Observe the popup displaying:
   - The total number of distinct remote domains connected.
   - Categories showing domains that were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
4. Use this information to understand your real-time third-party connection landscape.

<Info>
A lower badge count corresponds to fewer third-party connections, which aligns with better privacy.
