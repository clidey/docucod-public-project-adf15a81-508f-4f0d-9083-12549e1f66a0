## 2. Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Select Your Browser
uBO Scope supports the three major browsers. Choose your browser to proceed with the specific installation steps.

### Step 2: Installing uBO Scope

- **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave):**
  1. Go to the [Chrome Web Store uBO Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
  2. Click **Add to Chrome**.
  3. Confirm the permissions requested, including `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` access.

- **Firefox:**
  1. Visit the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
  2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
  3. Review requested permissions and approve installation.

- **Safari:**
  1. Ensure your Safari browser is version 18.5 or above.
  2. Install via the App Store or by a developer-provided install package (check the official repository for Safari installation instructions).
  3. Permissions include similar access as Chromium and Firefox, essential to observe network events.

### Step 3: Confirm Installation
Once installed, you should see the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. This icon resembles the uBO Scope logo.

<Tip>
If the icon does not appear immediately, check the browser’s extension management page to ensure the add-on is enabled.

## 3. Launching and Exploring the uBO Scope Popup

### Step 1: Open the Popup

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
- The popup window will open and display real-time connection details related to the active tab.

### Step 2: Understand the Popup UI Elements

The popup is designed for clarity and quick insight:

- **Hostname Display:** Shows the current tab’s hostname and domain in Unicode format (handles international domain names).
- **Domains Connected:** Shows the total count of distinct domains contacted by web requests.
- **Connection Categories:** The connections are broken into three categories:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains for which network requests were successful.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains blocked by stealth methods such as redirects.
  - **Blocked:** Domains blocked outright (network errors or extensions blocked).
- **Domain Rows:** Under each category, each domain name is listed along with how many requests (count) were made.

### Step 3: Navigate the Popup

- Scroll through the domain lists to understand which third-party servers are contacted.
- Use this information to get instant visibility into your network exposure per tab.

### Step 4: Popup Behavior Tips

- The popup refreshes automatically with each tab change or page reload.
- If no data appears, ensure the page has loaded network requests, and the extension has proper permissions.

<Tip>
The badge on the toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains for the current tab. Fewer domains generally indicate a more private browsing session.
</Tip>

## 4. Practical Example

Imagine visiting a news website. By opening the uBO Scope popup:
- You see the site’s main domain at the top.
- Under "Not Blocked", domains like `cdn.example.com` and `analytics.net` might appear with counts representing their individual request numbers.
- The "Blocked" category may list ad servers your content blocker has prevented.

This immediate feedback lets you gauge network activity transparency and helps understand the reach of third parties across websites.

## 6. Best Practices for Smooth Start

- Always keep your browser updated to ensure compatibility.
- Review and allow all requested permissions during installation for full functionality.
- Open the popup shortly after page load to view the most relevant data.
- Use this tool alongside traditional content blockers for comprehensive privacy monitoring.

## 7. Next Steps

Once installed and familiar with the popup UI, proceed to:

- Explore [Reading the Popup: Interpreting Connection Summaries](https://docs.example.com/guides/getting-started-essentials/reading-popup) to deepen your understanding of the reported data.
- Configure optional settings as described in [Post-Installation Configuration](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/installation-and-setup/configuring-ubo-scope).
- Validate your installation with the [Quick Validation Checklist](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/first-use-and-troubleshooting/quick-validation).

## Appendix: Technical Notes

- uBO Scope uniquely reports on all connections including those allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked by your browser or content blockers.
- The popup UI is built from a straightforward HTML structure, enhanced by JavaScript (`popup.js`) which fetches live data from background processes.
- The extension uses browser APIs like `webRequest` and `activeTab` to collect and present connection data in real time.

<Check>
For developers curious about the interaction between popup UI and background scripts, check out the extension source files under `/js/popup.js` and `/js/background.js` in the official repository.
