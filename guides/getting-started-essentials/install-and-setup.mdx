### Step 2: Pin the uBO Scope Icon to Your Browser Toolbar

After installation, pinning the icon improves accessibility:

- **Chromium-based browsers:**
  - Click the extensions puzzle icon next to the address bar.
  - Find uBO Scope and click the pin icon to keep it visible.

- **Firefox:**
  - Click the toolbar overflow menu (three horizontal lines).
  - Find and drag the uBO Scope icon to your toolbar or use “Customize” to add it.

- **Safari:**
  - Navigate to Safari Preferences > Extensions.
  - Enable the extension and ensure the toolbar icon is visible.

<Check>
The extension icon should be visible and clickable on your browser toolbar after this step.
</Check>

### Step 3: Grant Required Permissions

uBO Scope relies on browser permissions for network monitoring:

- Upon first click of the uBO Scope icon, the browser may request permission to access browsing data.
- Accept all permission requests to enable proper functionality.

<Warning>
Failure to grant permissions will prevent uBO Scope from reporting network connections correctly.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Verify Installation and Functionality

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup interface.
2. Open a new tab and navigate to a website you frequently use.
3. Return to the uBO Scope popup. It should display the hostname of the current tab and categorize connections as **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked**.
4. The toolbar badge will show the number of distinct third-party domains your current tab connected to.

<Tip>
If no data appears immediately, reload the webpage or try visiting a different site.
