## Step 3: Confirm Permissions Are Granted
uBO Scope requires certain permissions to function fully, primarily access to the `webRequest` API and storage capabilities.

1. After installation, check if the extension requests permissions.
2. Approve permissions for:
    - Monitoring network requests (`webRequest`).
    - Access to storage for session data.
    - Access to active tabs for dynamic monitoring.

3. If permission prompts are missed or denied, re-install the extension or modify permissions via your browser's extension management page.

> <Note>
> The extension uses host permissions for URLs such as https://*/* and http://*/* to observe network requests across websites.
> </Note>

---

## Step 4: Enable and Verify uBO Scope Activation
Once installed and permissions are confirmed:

1. Ensure the uBO Scope icon is visible in your browser's toolbar.
2. Click the icon to open the popup for the first time. This initializes monitoring.
3. Open a new browser tab and visit a website with typical web activity.
4. Observe the toolbar badge count update, showing the number of distinct third-party domains connected.

> <Check>
> If the badge count appears and updates as you browse, uBO Scope is active and monitoring.
> </Check>

## Step 5: Handling Common Setup Issues
If uBO Scope does not appear to be working properly, consider the following:

- **No badge count on browsing:**
  - Confirm the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions/settings.
  - Refresh or reload the tab to kickstart network observation.
  - Verify permissions are properly granted.

- **Extension icon missing:**
  - Check if the extension is hidden behind overflow menus (browser-specific).
  - Restart the browser.
  - Reinstall if necessary.

- **Conflicts with other extensions:**
  - Disable other content blockers temporarily to isolate issues.

- **Browser version compatibility:**
  - Verify browser version meets minimum requirements.
  
For detailed troubleshooting, refer to the [Troubleshooting Installation](../getting-started/installation-basics/troubleshooting-install) guide.

## Step 6: Prepare to Use uBO Scope Popup Interface
With uBO Scope installed and running, your next step is to explore the popup interface:

- Click the toolbar icon to see categorized network connections:
  - Allowed (not blocked) domains
  - Stealth-blocked domains
  - Blocked domains

- Use this information to audit your browsing third-party network footprint.
