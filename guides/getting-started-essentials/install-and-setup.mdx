## Step-by-Step Installation and Setup

### 1. Install the Extension from the Official Browser Store

- **Chromium Browsers:**
  1. Go to the [Chrome Web Store page for uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
  2. Click **Add to Chrome** and confirm the installation.

- **Firefox:**
  1. Visit the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
  2. Click **Add to Firefox** and accept any prompts.

- **Safari:**
  1. Open the Mac App Store or Safari Extensions Gallery.
  2. Search for "uBO Scope" and follow installation instructions (Safari requires version 18.5 or higher).


### 2. Locate the uBO Scope Extension Icon

- After installation, look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
  - In Chromium and Firefox, this is usually top-right.
  - In Safari, it appears alongside other extensions in the toolbar.

<Tip>
If you do not see the icon immediately, check your browser’s extensions or add-ons menu and pin the uBO Scope icon to the toolbar.
</Tip>


### 3. Confirm Extension Permissions

uBO Scope requires permissions to operate fully:

- **Active Tab Access:** To monitor network activity on your current tab.
- **Storage:** To save session data temporarily.
- **WebRequest API Access:** To listen to network requests and categorize them.

Most browser stores request these permissions during installation. To verify:

- Go to your browser’s extension management page.
- Select uBO Scope.
- Ensure the permissions above are granted.

<Warning>
Denying required permissions will prevent uBO Scope from tracking network connections correctly.
</Warning>


### 4. Open the uBO Scope Popup to Verify Initial Setup

- Click the extension’s toolbar icon.
- The popup should display the page hostname or tab domain at the top.
- A "domains connected" count displays the number of unique third-party domains contacted.
- Initially, this may show "NO DATA" or "?" if no network connections have been recorded for the active tab.


### 5. Verify Network Monitoring is Active

- Visit a website that loads external resources.
- Open the uBO Scope popup again.
- You should see domains categorized under three sections:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains fully contacted.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests were explicitly blocked or resulted in errors.


### 6. Check the Toolbar Badge Count

- For each active tab, the uBO Scope icon badge displays the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- A lower count means fewer third parties connected, which typically indicates better privacy.

<Tip>
You can use this count as a quick indicator of your browsing privacy on a per-tab basis.
</Tip>
