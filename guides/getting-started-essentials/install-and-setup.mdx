# Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope

Welcome to the essential guide for installing and setting up uBO Scope—the powerful tool that reveals all remote server connections initiated by your browser. This documentation walks you through installing the extension on supported browsers, launching your first monitoring session, and getting familiar with the interface so you can immediately start auditing network activity.

---

## 1. Overview of Installation and Setup

### What You Will Accomplish
By the end of this guide, you will have installed uBO Scope on your preferred browser, configured it with the necessary permissions, and opened the interface to start monitoring real-time network connections per browser tab.

### Prerequisites
- A supported browser: Chromium (version 122 or later), Firefox (128 or later), or Safari (18.5 or later).
- Stable internet connection for downloading the extension.
- Basic familiarity with browser extensions installation.

### Expected Outcome
- uBO Scope extension installed and visible in your browser toolbar.
- Permissions granted for network request monitoring.
- Popup interface preload and display showing network connection data on active tabs.
- Badge count reflecting the number of distinct third-party servers contacted.

### Time Estimate
Installation and initial setup typically take 5 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner.

## 2. Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Choose Your Browser
uBO Scope supports three major browsers with slight differences explained below.

### Step 2: Install from Official Sources

- **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave):**
  - Visit the [Chrome Web Store uBO Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
  - Click `Add to Chrome` and confirm.

- **Firefox:**
  - Visit the [Firefox Add-ons uBO Scope page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
  - Click `Add to Firefox`, then confirm installation.

- **Safari:**
  - Available through the App Store or manual installation using the provided `.zip` package (requires macOS 13 and Safari 18.5+).
  - See the platform-specific `manifest.json` for permissions.

<Tip>
Always install uBO Scope from official and trusted sources to ensure authenticity and security.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Grant Necessary Permissions

Upon installation, the extension will request permissions that are crucial for its operation:
- **Active Tab**: To monitor requests from the currently open browser tab.
- **Storage**: To save session data such as tracked server connections.
- **WebRequest**: To monitor network requests in real time.
- **Host Permissions:** Access to HTTP(s) and WebSocket domains for full visibility.

Accept these permissions to enable uBO Scope’s core functionality.

<Warning>
Declining permissions—especially webRequest and host permissions—will prevent uBO Scope from gathering accurate connection data.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Confirm uBO Scope Is Installed Correctly

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- The icon should display a badge count indicating distinct third-party remote servers connected from the active tab.

<Check>
If no badge appears after browsing websites, verify permissions and restart the browser.
</Check>

### Step 5: Open the Popup Interface

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- The popup will display:
  - The main domain and hostname of the current active tab.
  - Counts and lists of remote servers categorized by connection outcome: `not blocked`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked`.

<Note>
When data is unavailable, the popup shows "NO DATA" indicating monitoring has not yet captured network requests for the active tab.
</Note>

### Step 6: Begin Browsing and Monitoring

Simply navigate to different websites or tabs; uBO Scope will update in near real-time, presenting fresh connection data accumulated per tab.

## 3. Interface Familiarization

The uBO Scope popup panel is organized into clear sections:

- **Domain Header**: Shows both the full hostname and the base domain for the current tab.
- **Connection Summary**: Displays the total number of unique domains contacted.
- **Outcome Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked**: Third-party domains with allowed network requests.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where requests were stealthily blocked, typically by stealthy content blockers.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where requests were explicitly blocked.

Each domain listed includes the count of connections observed during the current browsing session.

<Example>
Visiting `example.com` may show 5 allowed third-party domains (e.g., CDN providers), 1 stealth-blocked, and 2 blocked domains, providing immediate visibility into your tab’s network footprint.
</Example>

## 4. Tips for a Successful Setup

- **Ensure Browser Compatibility:** Always use supported browsers with the minimum required versions.
- **Keep Permissions Active:** Do not revoke permissions after installation to maintain accurate monitoring.
- **Regularly Update Browser and Extension:** Updates ensure security and functionality.
- **Use the Badge Count:** The toolbar icon’s badge gives you at-a-glance insights into the current tab’s third-party connections.

---

## 5. Common Troubleshooting

### Issue: Badge Count Remains Zero
- Confirm that the extension has `webRequest` permission granted.
- Reload the browser tab or restart the browser.
- Verify no conflicting extensions block `webRequest` API access.

### Issue: Popup Shows NO DATA
- Make sure you have visited one or more websites since installation.
- Allow a moment for uBO Scope to collect network request data.

### Issue: Extension Not Visible
- Check the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions management page.
- Pin the extension icon to the toolbar if hidden.

<Warning>
Safari’s `webRequest` API support is limited, so some WebSocket connections may not be visible.
</Warning>

## 6. What Happens Behind the Scenes

uBO Scope uses background scripts (see `js/background.js`) to intercept network requests via browser APIs, tracking each tab’s network outcomes:

- Allowed connections
- Blocked connections
- Stealth-blocked connections

It parses domain and hostname information using the Public Suffix List for accurate grouping.

Badge counts are automatically updated to reflect the real-time number of distinct connected third-party domains per tab.

The popup interface (`popup.html` and `js/popup.js`) decodes and presents this session data in an intuitive format.
