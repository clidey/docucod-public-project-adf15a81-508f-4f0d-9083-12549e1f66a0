## Step-by-Step Installation and Verification

### 1. Choose Your Browser and Access the Official Store

| Browser          | Official Store Link                                                                 | Notes                        |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Chromium-based   | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) | Includes Chrome, Edge, Brave |
| Firefox          | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)               |                              |
| Safari           | Via [Apple Extensions Gallery](https://apps.apple.com/app/ubo-scope/idYOURAPPID)     | Available from Safari 18.5+   |

> **Tip:** Always download uBO Scope only from the official browser stores linked above to ensure security and receive official updates.


### 2. Install the Extension

- Open your browser.
- Navigate to the appropriate store page (link from above).
- Click the `Add to [Browser]` or `Install` button.
- Confirm any permission requests — uBO Scope requires permissions to observe network requests (`webRequest`), storage access, and active tab control.

> **Note:** The extension does not block content but reports network connections made by the browser.


### 3. Confirm Extension Activation

- After installation, the uBO Scope icon should appear in your browser’s toolbar. It looks like the uBO Scope logo:
  
  ![uBO Scope Toolbar Icon](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/raw/main/img/browsericons/logo32.png)

- If you do not see the icon:
  - Check your browser’s extension management page.
  - On Chromium and Firefox, ensure uBO Scope is enabled and not hidden.
  - On Safari, extensions may require enabling in Safari Preferences → Extensions.


### 4. Verify That uBO Scope Is Working

1. **Open a website that loads multiple third-party resources**, like a news site or a social media page.
2. Look at the uBO Scope icon badge in the toolbar:
   - It will show a number indicating the count of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to on that tab.
   - A badge with a number means uBO Scope is actively monitoring network connections.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open its popup window:
   - The popup details distinct domains contacted categorized by “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked.”
   - This data confirms the extension is receiving and displaying connection information accurately.


### 5. Optional: Troubleshoot Installation Issues

- If the badge count does not update or the popup shows “NO DATA”:
  - Refresh the browser tab with the website loaded.
  - Ensure uBO Scope has permissions (especially the `webRequest` permission).
  - Restart the browser to reload the extension.
  - Visit supported browsers and prerequisites documentation if problems persist.


### 6. (Advanced) Manual Installation or Building

- If you prefer compiling or using development versions:
  - Clone the repository from GitHub: https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope
  - Use the provided `make-package.sh` script (Linux environment) for building for your target platform.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Keep uBO Scope updated regularly** via the browser store to benefit from latest fixes and improvements.
- **Validate your installation** by visiting websites with expected network activity.
- **Interpret badge counts with care:** A lower badge number usually indicates fewer third-party connections but always review the popup data for clarity.
- **uBO Scope works alongside any content blockers** without interference.
