# Analyzing Webpage Activity: Practical Use Cases

Discover how to leverage uBO Scope in your everyday browsing to gain clear insights into the network activity of different types of websites. This guide walks you through typical scenarios—news portals, e-commerce platforms, and social networking sites—showing how to interpret connection data, identify privacy risks, and understand third-party behavior.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

- **Task Description**  
  Learn to use uBO Scope to monitor and analyze the distinct remote server connections made by websites you visit, helping you spot potential privacy concerns and understand third-party network behavior in realistic browsing situations.

- **Prerequisites**  
  - uBO Scope installed and running in your browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).  
  - Basic understanding of the popup interface and badge counts (see [Understanding the Popup: Interpreting Connection Summaries](/guides/getting-started-essentials/reading-popup)).

- **Expected Outcome**  
  You will confidently interpret the reported domains categorized as ‘allowed’, ‘stealth-blocked’, and ‘blocked’, correlating these to your browsing activity to uncover third-party trackers and request patterns.

- **Time Estimate**  
  10-15 minutes per website category for initial exploration.

- **Difficulty Level**  
  Beginner to Intermediate.

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Scenario A: Analyzing a News Website

1. **Open your browser and visit a popular news website** (e.g., https://www.nytimes.com).

2. **Activate uBO Scope’s popup:** Click the extension icon in your toolbar to open the popup interface.

3. **Observe the badge count:** This displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to during the page load.

4. **Review the categorized domains:**  
   - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains your browser successfully connected to for page content or resources. Look here for legitimate CDNs, analytics, or known trackers.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where the extension detected network redirects or subtle blocking behaviors.
   - **Blocked:** Domains where requests were blocked outright, indicating possible trackers or unwanted content sources.

5. **Assess privacy implications:**  
   - Are there many allowed third-party domains? High numbers can mean aggressive tracking.
   - Are key trackers stealth-blocked or outright blocked? This reveals your content blockers' effectiveness.

6. **Close the popup and clear your browser cache** if you want to repeat the test with different settings or content blockers.

### Scenario B: Visiting an E-Commerce Site (e.g., https://www.amazon.com)

1. Repeat Steps 1-3 from Scenario A.

2. Focus on counting domains related to advertising networks and payment providers.

3. Analyze whether many requests are allowed to these third parties and note any stealth-blocked connections, which could indicate the extension or browser attempting to hide certain blocks.

4. Consider the legitimacy of allowed third parties; large e-commerce sites often connect to multiple payment gateways, CDNs, and tracking domains.

5. Cross-reference domains with known tracker lists if you want to dive deeper.

### Scenario C: Social Networking Platforms (e.g., https://www.facebook.com)

1. Repeat Steps 1-3.

2. Social networks typically connect to many domains, including their own sibling services.

3. Observe how many third-party domains are allowed versus blocked.

4. Identify stealth-blocked domains, which may represent techniques used by sites to circumvent blocking.

5. Use this insight to gauge how pervasive tracking is on social platforms and adjust blocklists accordingly.

## 3. Examples & Outputs

### News Site Example: Connection Summary Snapshot

| Outcome Category | Domains (Example)                  | Common Types       |
|------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Not Blocked      | cdn.nytimes.com, googlesyndication.com | CDN, advertising    |
| Stealth-Blocked  | doubleclick.net                   | Tracker redirects   |
| Blocked          | tracking-example.com              | Known trackers     |

### E-commerce Site Example: Key Observations

- Multiple allowed domains include payment gateways and logistics services.
- Stealth-blocked domains tend to be advertising trackers that use redirects.
- Blocked domains can represent aggressive trackers or suspicious ad servers.

### Practical Tip

To see these connections live: open uBO Scope after visiting the site, observe the real-time counts and domain entries in the categorized sections, then refresh the page to see how changes affect new connections.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Empty popup or no data shown:** Make sure the tab is active and the popup opened while on the target website. Data collection works per active tab.

- **Low or no badge counts:** Check if you have other content blockers or privacy tools interfering with uBO Scope.

- **Unexpected domains not showing:** Some browser network requests may be invisible to `webRequest` API if made outside its scope.

### Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope regularly to build an understanding of trackers in the wild, which aids privacy decisions.

- Combine with commonly used filter lists and your own observations to refine blocking strategy.

- Pay special attention to stealth-blocked entries—they indicate subtle network behaviors worthy of closer inspection.

By following these practical use cases, you empower yourself to spot privacy risks and excessive third-party connections firsthand, transforming how you understand and control your web browsing experience with uBO Scope.

<Info>
Remember: a lower count of allowed third-party domains generally reflects better privacy, but it's essential to understand the nature of these domains rather than focusing on raw counts alone.
