### Step 1: Check Browser Compatibility

Ensure your browser version meets the minimum requirements:

- **Chrome:** Version 122 or later

</Tip>

### Step 2: Install uBO Scope Extension

Choose your browser below and follow the respective installation instructions:

#### Chrome

1. Navigate to the [Chrome Web Store uBO Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
2. Click **Add to Chrome**.
3. Confirm by clicking **Add extension** when prompted.

#### Firefox

1. Open the [Firefox Add-ons uBO Scope page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Approve permissions and confirm installation.

#### Safari

1. Access the App Store or Safari Extensions Gallery supporting Safari 18.5+.
2. Search for "uBO Scope" and install.

<Note>
Permissions required include `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` for uBO Scope to fully monitor network requests.
</Note>

---

### Step 3: Grant Required Permissions

On installation, the browser will prompt you to grant several permissions vital for uBO Scope's operation:

- **Active Tab Access:** Allows uBO Scope to monitor network requests for the active browser tab.
- **Storage:** Enables saving session and domain details locally.
- **Web Request Monitoring:** Essential for detecting all remote server connection attempts.

Grant these permissions without restrictions to ensure accurate and comprehensive reporting.

---

### Step 4: Confirm Installation and Startup

After installation, confirm uBO Scope is enabled and active:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar — it uses a distinctive badge with the label "uBO Scope".
2. Click the toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
3. The popup should show data categorized as "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" domains, along with a count of connected domains.

<Check>
If you see "NO DATA" or the panel remains empty, ensure you've granted all permissions and have visited a web page with active network requests.
</Check>

---

### Step 5: Verify uBO Scope is Reporting

To validate that uBO Scope is recording remote servers correctly:

1. Open any website with multiple third-party resources, such as a news or shopping site.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. Observe the toolbar badge count increasing—this number represents distinct third-party servers connected.
4. Review the breakdown in the popup for domains labeled under "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked."

<Info>
A lower count on the badge represents fewer distinct third-party connections, which is typically preferable for privacy.
</Info>

## 3. Practical Example: Installing and Testing on Chrome

1. Navigate to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
2. Click **Add to Chrome** and confirm.
3. After installation, open https://example.com.
4. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
5. In the popup, verify you see connected domains and the badge shows a number.

This process confirms the extension works and tracks remote connections.
