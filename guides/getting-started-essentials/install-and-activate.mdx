# Install and Activate uBO Scope

This guide walks you through the process of installing uBO Scope on major browsers, activating the extension, and verifying that it is functioning correctly. Follow these steps to ensure a smooth onboarding experience and start monitoring your browser's network connections effectively.

---

## 1. Overview

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to reveal all remote server connections your browser tabs make, including those allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked. The key to an effective installation is ensuring your browser supports uBO Scope and that you have enabled the necessary permissions.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before installing uBO Scope, make sure you meet the following conditions:

- **Supported Browsers and Versions:**
  - Google Chrome version 122 or later
  - Mozilla Firefox version 128 or later
  - Safari version 18.5 or later
- **Permissions:** uBO Scope requires permission to access webpages (`webRequest`), active tabs, and storage in your browser.
- **Internet Connection:** Needed to download the extension from official stores.

> Ensure your browser is updated to the required minimum version to avoid compatibility issues.

## 3. Installation Steps

### Google Chrome (≥122)

### Mozilla Firefox (≥128)
1. Open the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Confirm any permissions the extension requests.
4. Once installed, the uBO Scope icon should be visible near the toolbar.

### Safari (≥18.5)

## 4. Activating uBO Scope

After installation:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The first time you open it, the popup will load and display initial network connection data.
3. If no data appears, try reloading the active webpage or navigating to a new site.

<u>Note:</u> uBO Scope begins monitoring network requests immediately upon activation, but you may need to refresh a page to populate initial data.

---

## 5. Quick Verification

Validate that uBO Scope is operating as expected:

1. **Open a tab with an active webpage** (e.g., https://example.com).
2. Observe the **badge count** on the uBO Scope toolbar icon, indicating the number of distinct third-party connections.
   - A lower badge count suggests fewer third-party connections.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
4. Check the listed domains under the three categories:
   - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which connections succeeded.
   - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where requests were stealthily blocked.
   - **Blocked:** Domains where requests were blocked outright.

<Tip>
The badge count reflects distinct third-party domains contacted. Use it as an indicator of your browsing exposure.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Installation and Activation

If uBO Scope does not behave as expected after installation:

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation and Activation Issues">
<Accordion title="Missing Toolbar Icon">
- Verify the extension was installed correctly.
- In browser extension settings, ensure uBO Scope is enabled and visible on the toolbar.
- Restart the browser if necessary.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Badge Count or Popup Data">
- Confirm you are visiting pages over HTTP(S) or WebSocket protocols.
- Reload the page after installation to trigger network monitoring.
- Ensure browser permissions for webRequest and activeTab are granted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Denied Messages">
- Check your browser's extension permissions.
- Reinstall uBO Scope if permissions were denied during installation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Incorrect or Zero Domain Counts">
- uBO Scope requires the browser webRequest API to monitor network requests.
- Some private browsers or restrictive environments may block this API, limiting functionality.
- Try in a different supported browser or user profile to isolate issues.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
Refer to the dedicated Troubleshooting Installation & Setup guide for detailed issue resolution steps.
</Note>

## 7. Best Practices for First Use

- After installation, open several websites to observe different connection profiles.
- Regularly check the badge count to understand your exposure to third-party domains.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker but do not rely solely on apparent block counts.

---

## 8. Next Steps

After you have successfully installed and activated uBO Scope:

- Explore the [Understanding the Popup and Badge](/guides/getting-started-essentials/understanding-the-popup) guide to interpret data meaningfully.
- Learn how to analyze third-party connections with [Analyzing Third-Party Connections on Any Page](/guides/practical-analysis-workflows/analyze-page-connections).
- Review troubleshooting tips in [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/troubleshooting) for support.

## Appendix: Manual Packaging (Advanced Users)

For users wishing to build the extension package manually (e.g., for development or platforms not supporting web store installs), use the following shell script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Script to create the uBO-Scope extension package for a specified platform.
# Usage: ./tools/make-package.sh <platform> [version]

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "*** Error: need platform name"
    exit 1
fi

PLATFORM="$1"
DES=build/uBO-Scope."$PLATFORM"

echo "*** uBO-Scope: creating extension in $DES"

rm -rf "$DES"
mkdir -p "$DES"

echo "*** uBO-Scope: copying files"

cp -R assets                       "$DES"/
cp -R css                          "$DES"/
cp -R img                          "$DES"/
cp -R js                           "$DES"/
cp ./*.html                        "$DES"/
cp platform/"$PLATFORM"/manifest.json "$DES"/
cp LICENSE.txt                     "$DES"/
cp README.md                       "$DES"/

mkdir -p "$DES"/js/lib
cp node_modules/punycode/punycode.es6.js "$DES"/js/lib/

# Version provided as argument
if [ -n "$2" ]; then
    echo "*** uBO-Scope: setting version to $2 in manifest.json"
    tmp=$(mktemp)
    jq --arg a "$2" '.version = $a' "$DES/manifest.json" > "$tmp" && \
        mv "$tmp" "$DES/manifest.json"
fi
```

This script assumes a Linux environment and requires `jq` for JSON manipulation.
