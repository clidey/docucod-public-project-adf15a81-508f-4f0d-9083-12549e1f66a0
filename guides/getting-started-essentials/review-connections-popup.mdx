# Reviewing Third-Party Connections with the Popup

## Overview
The popup panel in uBO Scope offers a concise, real-time view into all remote server connections made by the currently active browser tab. It categorizes network requests into three clear groups:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** Domains from which network connections were successfully made.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where connections were redirected or stealthily blocked by content blockers, meaning the request was suppressed without a visible block.
- **Blocked:** Domains from which requests were actively blocked or failed.

This guide walks you through interpreting these categories within the popup, helping you understand the privacy implications and network activity for each active webpage.

## What You Will Learn
- How to open and navigate the popup panel
- Understanding the meaning of allowed, stealth, and blocked connections
- Interpreting domain lists and counts for privacy insights
- Practical tips to use the popup for privacy awareness
- Troubleshooting common display issues

---

## Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and activated in a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- A webpage open in an active browser tab with network activity
- Basic understanding that the popup reports third-party network connections

---

## Opening and Navigating the Popup Panel

1. **Access the Popup:** Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser's toolbar. This opens the popup panel showing network connection details for the active tab.

2. **Hostname Display:** At the top, you’ll see the fully qualified hostname of the current tab, split into subdomain and main domain parts for clarity.

3. **Summary Section:** Below the hostname, a summary indicates the total number of distinct third-party domains connected by the active tab. This number reflects allowed (not blocked) connections only.

4. **Connection Categories:** Scroll through the distinct sections:
   - **Not Blocked:** Lists all domains from which connections were allowed.
   - **Stealth-blocked:** Lists domains whose requests were redirected or suppressed stealthily.
   - **Blocked:** Lists domains where connections failed or were actively blocked.

5. **Domain Rows and Counts:** Each domain entry shows the domain name (converted to Unicode for internationalized domains) and the count of requests made to that domain.

## Detailed Interpretation of Connection Categories

### Allowed (Not Blocked)
- These are domains your browser successfully made network connections to during the browsing session on the active tab.
- The count of domains here shows your actual exposure to third-party servers.
- Fewer distinct allowed domains generally indicate a lower third-party network exposure.

### Stealth-blocked
- Domains appear here if requests were intercepted or redirected by content blockers transparently.
- Such stealth blocking prevents webpage detection of the block and protects privacy without causing breakage.
- These domains are not included in the allowed count, reducing visible connections.

### Blocked
- Shows domains where requests encountered errors or were explicitly blocked.
- This section helps identify domains and requests filtered out by content blockers or resulting in errors.

## Practical User Scenario

Imagine visiting a news website. By opening the uBO Scope popup, you can:

- See how many distinct third-party domains the page tries to contact.
- Check if any suspicious domains appear blocked or stealth-blocked.
- Gauge your privacy exposure by the total allowed third parties.
- Use this insight to adjust your content blocker or filters for better privacy.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup panel.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify Current Tab Hostname">
At the top, note the active tab’s hostname and domain for context.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Summary Count">
Look at the 'domains connected' number. This reflects the distinct third-party domains contacted successfully.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Not Blocked Section">
Review the list of domains not blocked, noting domains you recognize and any unfamiliar ones.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Stealth-blocked Domains">
Expand the stealth-blocked section to see which requests content blockers handled silently.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Blocked Domains">
Look through blocked domains to understand what connections were prevented or failed.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Refresh the Popup:** The popup updates automatically as you navigate or reload pages, but reopening it provides the latest data.
- **Interpret Counts Carefully:** High counts in the allowed section suggest more third-party exposure; a lower count is generally preferable for privacy.
- **Stealth Blocking Is Good:** Seeing domains in stealth-blocked means your content blocker is actively protecting you without breaking pages.
- **Investigate Unknown Domains:** If suspicious domains appear in allowed connections, consider enhancing your filters.
- **Combine with Badge Count:** Use this popup alongside the toolbar icon badge for at-a-glance monitoring.

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Display Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or No Domains">
- Ensure that the tab you are viewing has loaded content and has network connections.
- Refresh the tab or navigate to a site with active network requests.
- Verify that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions; see installation and initial configuration guides.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Counts Seem Incorrect">
- The popup reports distinct third-party domains, not individual requests; counts reflect domains.
- Stealth blocking or browser limitations may affect numbers visible here.
- Refer to the troubleshooting setup guide for permission or API-related issues.

## Advanced Insights

Understanding the popup panel helps debunk misconceptions such as:

- A higher block count in a content blocker does not guarantee better privacy; exposure depends on allowed distinct third-party domains.
- Stealth blocking helps reduce visible network connections without alerting webpages.

By analyzing network connections via the popup, privacy-conscious users verify what actually loads, bypassing misleading claims or superficial blocker metrics.

## Summary
The uBO Scope popup is your direct window into the third-party domains contacted by the active browser tab. It helps you clearly see what network connections occur, which are blocked silently, and which fail outright, empowering you to make informed privacy decisions.

## Screenshots & Visuals

The popup layout is straightforward:

- **Top Header:** Shows the current tab’s hostname in two parts (subdomain and main domain).
- **Summary Section:** Displays the count of connected domains.
- **Three Sections:** Allowed (green), Stealth-blocked (red), and Blocked (red), each listing domains with request counts.

This information is dynamically loaded and updated whenever you open the popup, reflecting the current tab’s network activity.

## Code Insight

The popup UI script fetches and renders connection data grouped by outcome:

```javascript
// Fetch current tab info, send message to background script
sendMessage({ what: 'getTabData', tabId: currentTab.id })
  .then(response => {
    const data = deserialize(response);
    renderPanel(data);
  });

// RenderPanel populates the allowed, stealth, and blocked sections
function renderPanel(data) {
  const { allowed, blocked, stealth } = data;
  // Populate each domain list with domain names and counts
  // Converts punycode domains to Unicode for display
}
```

This ensures users see accurate, Unicode-converted domain names along with request counts for informed analysis.
