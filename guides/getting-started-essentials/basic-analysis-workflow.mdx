# Performing a Basic Domain Analysis

Discovering which third-party servers a webpage connects to reveals vital insights into your web browsing privacy and security. This guide walks you through using uBO Scope to analyze active tab connections, distinguish legitimate services like CDNs from possible trackers, and validate how well your filtering is working.

---

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This hands-on walkthrough helps you analyze and interpret the third-party remote domains associated with the active webpage. You'll learn how to identify common patterns of benign versus undesirable domains and validate your content blocking effectiveness.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and active in your browser
- Familiarity with opening the extension popup (see [Interpreting the Toolbar Badge and Popup](./guides/getting-started-essentials/interpreting-badge-and-popup))
- Basic understanding of web browsing and domain concepts

### Expected Outcome
- A clear breakdown of the third-party domains your current tab connects to
- The ability to recognize legitimate service providers (such as CDN domains) versus tracking or advertising networks
- Insights into stealth-blocked and blocked domains to evaluate filtering quality

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10-15 minutes for initial analysis and understanding.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup for Your Active Tab
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup.
- Confirm the popup displays the hostname of the current webpage.
- Observe the summary number indicating unique third-party domains connected.

#### Outcome
The popup loads three main sections: "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked", listing domains categorized by their connection outcome.


### 2. Review the 'Not Blocked' Section
- Examine the listed domains under "not blocked" — these are third-party domains successfully connected.
- Look for familiar and legitimate domains such as content delivery networks (e.g., `cloudfront.net`, `akamai.net`, or your website’s CDN provider).

#### Tips
- CDNs and essential service domains usually have higher counts but are generally safe.
- A low count of domains here generally means fewer third-party connections, which is preferable.


### 3. Inspect the 'Stealth-Blocked' Domains
- This section shows domains where uBO Scope detected requests that were redirected or otherwise stealth-blocked.
- These connections might be blocked silently by other filters or techniques, so they don't appear as normal blocked entries.

#### What to Consider
- Stealth-blocked domains can indicate tracking domains that got silently neutralized.
- High stealth-block counts might reveal aggressive anti-tracking measures.


### 4. Analyze the 'Blocked' Domains
- These are third-party domains whose connections were explicitly blocked by your content blocking rules or browser extensions.
- Reviewing this list helps confirm if your filters are catching known trackers or unwanted domains.

#### Checklist
- Check for obvious tracking or advertising domains.
- Absence of these domains in the "not blocked" list indicates effective blocking.


### 5. Identify Patterns and Validate Filtering Effectiveness
- Compare domain names with prior knowledge or public lists to differentiate legitimate from undesired entities.
- Use domain suffix clues and registry knowledge (e.g., `.cdn.` domains tend to be legitimate, while ad network domains often have distinct brand names).

#### Practical Tips
- Use online resources or filter list documentation to research unfamiliar domains.
- Recognize common tracker domains like those from major ad platforms (Google Analytics, Facebook, etc.).
- You may want to adjust your filter lists based on this analysis.


### 6. Refresh and Repeat as You Navigate
- As you browse to different sites, open the popup again to see evolving third-party connections.
- Observe how the badge count updates in real-time, reflecting the count of unique third-party domains.

#### Verification
- The badge number matches the "not blocked" domain count in the popup.
- Ensure no unusual or unexpected domains repeatedly appear unblocked.

## Examples & Practical Scenarios

### Example Scenario: Analyzing a News Website
1. Open a popular news website.
2. Open uBO Scope popup.
3. Notice domains like `akamai.net` or `cloudflare.net` under "not blocked" — these are CDNs serving content.
4. Spot domains such as `google-analytics.com` under "blocked" or "stealth-blocked" indicating blocked trackers.
5. This analysis confirms the site loads legitimate CDNs and that trackers are filtered effectively.


### Example Scenario: Shopping Website Analysis
1. Visit a shopping site.
2. Identify multiple third-party domains in "not blocked" like payment gateways, CDNs, or chat support services.
3. See advertising domain entries under "blocked" corroborating active ad blocking.
4. If suspicious or repeated domains appear unblocked, consider enhancing filter rules.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **No data showing in the popup:** Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and has appropriate permissions. Try refreshing the page or restarting the browser.
- **Badge count mismatches domain count:** Sometimes the popup may lag in updating; closing and reopening the popup usually resolves this.
- **Unfamiliar domains listed as 'not blocked':** Use external lookup tools (e.g., [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com)) to verify domain legitimacy.


### Best Practices
- Regularly revisit and analyze third-party connections, especially on frequently visited sites.
- Use this analysis to fine-tune blocking filters alongside uBO Scope’s continuous monitoring.
- Keep your uBO Scope and filter lists updated to improve detection accuracy.


### Performance Considerations
- uBO Scope's monitoring operates efficiently in the background with minimal browser impact.
- Excessive third-party calls may slow down page loading; identifying and blocking redundant domains can improve performance.

### Alternative Approaches
- Complement uBO Scope analysis with dedicated privacy tools (e.g., uBlock Origin blocking logs).
- Familiarize yourself with the Public Suffix List for better domain interpretation (handled internally by uBO Scope).
