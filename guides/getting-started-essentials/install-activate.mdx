## 2. Step-by-Step Installation and Activation Instructions

### Step 1: Find the Extension in the Official Store

- **Chromium Browsers:**
  1. Open the Chrome Web Store at [uBO Scope in Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  2. Search for "uBO Scope" or "uBlock Origin Scope"
- **Firefox:**
  1. Go to [uBO Scope Add-on on Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
  2. Search for "uBO Scope"
- **Safari:**
  1. Open the Mac App Store or Safari Extensions Gallery
  2. Search for "uBO Scope" or "uBlock Origin Scope"

<Tip>
Only install uBO Scope from official browser stores or the trusted repository link: https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope to avoid malicious copies.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Install the Extension

- Click on the **Add to Browser** (or Install) button
- Grant required permissions when prompted:
  - Access to the current active tab
  - Permission to monitor network requests (`webRequest`)
  - Storage permissions for saving session data

> These permissions enable uBO Scope to monitor remote connections effectively.

### Step 3: Confirm the Extension is Active

- Look for the uBO Scope icon appearing in your browser’s toolbar near the address bar
- Confirm the icon’s tooltip shows 'uBO Scope' or 'uBlock Origin Scope'

### Step 4: Access the Popup UI

- Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar
- The popup window should open and display network connection data for the current tab

### Step 5: Verify the Extension is Monitoring Connections

- Browse to a website with multiple third-party resources (e.g., news sites or online retailers)
- Click the uBO Scope icon again to open the popup
- Observe the lists under “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked” sections showing domains connected
- Check the **domains connected** summary count updates accordingly

<Check>
If the popup displays **NO DATA**, try refreshing the current browser tab or restarting the browser.
</Check>

## 3. Understanding the Popup UI

When activated, the popup UI categorizes third-party remote servers based on connection outcomes:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains with successful connections
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where redirects happened silently
- **Blocked:** Domains for which requests were explicitly blocked

All domain names are decoded to their readable format, even for internationalized domains.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Installation and Activation Issues

### Problem: Extension Icon Does Not Appear
- Verify your browser version meets the minimum requirement
- Ensure extension permissions were granted fully
- Reinstall the extension if necessary

### Problem: Popup Shows "NO DATA"
- The current tab may not have data yet; reload the page
- Ensure uBO Scope has permission to access that tab
- Restart the browser to reset extension state

### Problem: Permissions Not Granted
- Manually check extension settings in your browser and enable all required permissions
- Some browsers require approval after installation

<Tip>
Consult the [Troubleshooting Installation Issues](../getting-started/first-steps-and-validation/troubleshooting-setup) guide for detailed resolutions.
</Tip>

## 5. Best Practices and Tips

- Always install from official sources to ensure updates and security
- Use uBO Scope alongside content blockers for enhanced privacy insights
- Regularly check the popup UI after loading new pages to monitor network activity
- Understand that a **lower badge count is preferable**, indicating fewer distinct third-party connections

---

## 6. Next Steps

After confirming installation and activation:

- Explore [First Run: Using uBO Scope](../getting-started/first-steps-and-validation/using-the-extension) to learn how to interpret results effectively
- Review [Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count](../guides/getting-started-essentials/badge-count-explained) for insights on what the badge number represents
