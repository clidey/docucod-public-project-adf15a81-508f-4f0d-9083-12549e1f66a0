## Step-by-Step Installation and Activation

### 1. Choose Your Browser

uBO Scope supports the following browsers:
- **Google Chrome** (minimum version 122.0)
- **Mozilla Firefox** (minimum version 128.0)
- **Safari** (minimum version 18.5)

Make sure your browser is updated to at least the supported version to guarantee full functionality.

### 2. Access the Extension Store

Install uBO Scope from your browser’s official extension marketplace:

| Browser | Installation Link |
|---------|------------------|
| Chrome  | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |

For Safari, installation instructions are often available through the App Store or Apple Developer resources.

### 3. Install the Extension

- Click **Add to Browser** or equivalent button to start installation.
- Review the permissions request popup carefully.

<u>uBO Scope requires the following core permissions:</u>

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `activeTab` | Allows the extension to interact with your active browser tab. |
| `storage`  | Enables the extension to save session and configuration data. |
| `webRequest` | Monitors and observes network requests made by webpages. |
| Host permissions | Grants access to capture requests for HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket protocols on all URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`). |

Grant these permissions to allow uBO Scope to monitor network connections accurately.

### 4. Verify Extension Activation

Once installed, confirmation that uBO Scope is active includes:

- The **uBO Scope toolbar icon** appears near your browser's address bar.
- The icon displays a **badge** number representing the count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by web pages.

<Tip>
The badge count reflects the number of unique third-party domains connecting through your current tab. A lower number generally means fewer third-party connections, which is preferred.
</Tip>

### 5. Open the uBO Scope Popup

Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup interface. It will display:

- The current tab’s hostname.
- A summary count of third-party domains connected.
- Lists categorizing connections into **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

This detailed view helps you understand the network activity happening behind the scenes.

### 6. Confirm Permissions and Data Flow

During initial activation, the extension may require a moment to gather data. Refresh your active tab or navigate to a new page to trigger network request monitoring.

Wait a few seconds and observe that:
- The badge updates with counts matching the domains listed in the popup.
- Domain lists populate under the appropriate sections.

If the toolbar icon or badge does not appear or update, permissions may not have been granted correctly or the extension may not be fully activated. Refer to troubleshooting guides for assistance.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Updating Browsers:** Keep your browser updated to leverage the latest APIs and security patches essential for the extension.

- **Refreshing Tabs:** After installation or permission changes, always refresh tabs to start capturing network data immediately.

- **Interpreting the Badge:** Remember the badge shows distinct third-party remote servers contacted, not request counts. Focus on understanding the quality of connections rather than the quantity.

- **Browser-Specific Differences:** Some permissions or behaviors might differ slightly between Chrome, Firefox, and Safari due to their internal extensions API variants.
