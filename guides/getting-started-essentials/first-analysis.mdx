# Your First Network Connection Analysis

Discover how to get started with uBO Scope by exploring your browser's current tab network connections. This guide walks you through opening the popup user interface, interpreting the toolbar badge, and understanding how connections are categorized into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains. By the end, you will confidently read and interpret what uBO Scope reveals about your active webpage.

---

## 1. What This Guide Helps You Accomplish

When you install uBO Scope, it begins monitoring all network connections initiated by browser tabs. This guide focuses specifically on how to use the extension's popup interface to analyze these connections for the current tab:

- Open the popup UI to view network data
- Understand the toolbar badge count
- Interpret allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domain sections
- Gain insight into the network behavior of your current webpage

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and active in your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser
- At least one webpage loaded in an active tab
- Basic familiarity with browser extensions and tab navigation

### Expected Outcome

- You will open the uBO Scope popup and see a live summary of network connections for your current tab
- You will interpret the badge count on the toolbar as the number of allowed third-party domains
- You will learn how to identify domains that were blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed

### Estimated Time

About 5 minutes to complete this initial walkthrough.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner-friendly, designed for first-time uBO Scope users.

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions to Analyze Your First Tab Connections

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate and Click the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon">
Open your browser and find the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar near the address bar. It looks like a small shield or the uBO Scope logo.

Click on the icon to open the popup UI.

**Expected Result:** The popup window should appear, showing your current tab’s hostname at the top and a breakdown of network connections below.
</Step>

<Step title="Understand the Badge Count on the Toolbar Icon">
Look at the small number shown on the uBO Scope icon badge.

This count indicates the number of unique third-party domains that your current tab successfully connected to ("allowed" domains).

**Tip:** A lower count often means fewer third-party connections, which can correlate with better privacy.

**Expected Result:** You should see a number or no number if no allowed connections are currently detected.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Hostname Display">
At the top of the popup, notice two spans:

- The first span (optional) shows the hostname prefix if your page uses subdomains.
- The second span displays the main domain of the current tab in Unicode (human-readable) form.

This helps confirm which webpage’s connection data you are viewing.

**Expected Result:** The displayed domain matches the active tab’s URL.
</Step>

<Step title="Explore the Domains Categorized as Allowed">
Under the section titled "not blocked," you will see a list of domains and a small badge number next to each.

Each domain here corresponds to a remote server your browser connected to during page load.

The badge number shows how many network requests were made to that domain.

**Expected Result:** A list of allowed domains sorted alphabetically with connection counts.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify Domains Marked as Stealth-Blocked">
The "stealth-blocked" section lists domains where network requests were redirected in a way that blocks direct observation but prevents the connection.

These stealth-blocked connections are attempts silently interrupted by your content blocker or browser features.

The presence of entries here can indicate hidden blocking actions.

**Expected Result:** A possibly empty or populated list showing stealth-blocked domains with counts.
</Step>

<Step title="Check the Blocked Domains Section">
The final section titled "blocked" lists domains where connections failed or were actively blocked.

The counts next to domains indicate how many connection attempts were blocked.

Seeing domains here helps validate which third parties your browser prevented connecting to.

**Expected Result:** A list of blocked domains with request counts or no entries if no blocks occurred.
</Step>

<Step title="Read the Summary of Connected Domains">
Above the categorized lists, a summary shows the total number of distinct domains that your current tab connected to (only counting allowed ones).

This provides a quick overview of your tab’s network reach.

**Expected Result:** A clear count at the top showing the total active third-party domains.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Real-World Example

Suppose you are visiting `https://example.com`. After opening uBO Scope's popup, you might see:

- Badge on the toolbar icon: **7**
- Hostname section: shows "example.com"
- Allowed domains:
  - `cdn.example.com` (5 requests)
  - `fonts.gstatic.com` (3 requests)
  - `analytics.thirdparty.net` (1 request)
- Stealth-blocked domains:
  - `tracker.hiddenads.com` (2 requests)
- Blocked domains:
  - `malicious.examplebad.com` (1 request)
- Summary shows "domains connected: 7"

This indicates that your browser allowed connections to 7 distinct third-party domains, while blocking attempts to malicious domains and silently preventing some tracking requests.

## 4. Tips & Best Practices

- **Refresh your tab and reopen the popup** after navigating sites to get updated connection insights.
- If the popup shows "NO DATA," confirm you are on an active tab where uBO Scope can monitor network activity.
- Use the badge count to quickly assess the network footprint of each page you visit.
- Remember that not all third-party connections are harmful; some are essential services like CDNs or font providers.
- Combine this analysis with other uBO Scope features or content blockers for deeper inspection.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Popup and Badge Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA'">
- Confirm uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Check that you have an active tab with a loaded webpage that can generate network requests.
- Try refreshing the tab and reopening the popup.
- See the "Validating uBO Scope Operation" guide for further checks.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Remains Empty or Incorrect">
- Verify the extension has the necessary permissions: activeTab, storage, webRequest.
- Ensure the tab is not private/incognito if your extension settings restrict monitoring there.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions that may interfere with network monitoring.
- Refer to the "Troubleshooting Common Issues" guide for step-by-step solutions.
