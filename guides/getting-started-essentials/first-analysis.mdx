# Performing Your First Network Connection Analysis

## Overview
This guide walks you through a hands-on scenario to analyze network connections made by a webpage using uBO Scope. By opening a sample website and reviewing the connections reported by uBO Scope, you will learn to identify which third-party domains are contacted, how to interpret the different categories of connections, and assess the effectiveness of content blockers irrespective of which blocker is installed.

## Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension is installed and properly configured in your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser.
- You have verified the extension is functioning by seeing its icon in the toolbar and observing its badge update with network activity.
- Basic familiarity with browser tabs and extension popup access.

## What You Will Achieve
- View and interpret live network requests triggered by a page.
- Identify allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains against the page's own domain.
- Understand how uBO Scope reveals connections regardless of content blocker presence or type.

## Estimated Time
Approximately 5–10 minutes for a first analysis.

## Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Select a Sample Webpage
Choose a well-known or representative webpage to analyze. For example, a popular news site or e-commerce homepage.

### Step 2: Open the Webpage in Your Browser
Navigate to the site in a new browser tab. This triggers network requests that uBO Scope will monitor.

### Step 3: Click the uBO Scope Icon
Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar and click it to open the popup panel.

### Step 4: Review the Domain Details
Within the popup, observe the following:
- **Domain Header:** Shows the domain of the active tab’s website.
- **Domains Connected:** Displays the count of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- **Sections for Each Outcome:** 
  - *Not Blocked* — domains with allowed connections
  - *Stealth-Blocked* — domains where connections were stealth-blocked (redirected/blocking techniques masked from page scripts)
  - *Blocked* — domains where connections failed or were explicitly blocked

### Step 5: Analyze Third-Party Domains
In each section, review the list of domains and associated counts. These represent how many requests were made to each domain.

#### Pro Tips:
- Domains listed under **allowed** indicate third parties from which content was successfully loaded.
- **Stealth-blocked** domains reveal blockers’ hidden effectiveness even if the page does not detect blocking.
- **Blocked** domains represent network requests that were conclusively prevented.

### Step 6: Compare to Content Blockers
If you have a content blocker enabled (uBlock Origin, uBO Lite, etc.), note how uBO Scope reports connections independently:
- It reflects network requests whether or not your ad blocker or privacy tool is active.
- Some domains may appear in stealth-blocked because blockers operate invisibly.

### Step 7: Interpret the Badge Count
Return to the browser toolbar and note the uBO Scope badge number for the tab:
- This number shows the count of distinct allowed third-party domains contacting the page.
- A lower badge number generally indicates fewer third-party connections.

### Step 8: Close the Popup
Close the uBO Scope popup and continue browsing or repeat analysis with other pages as needed.

## Example Scenario
You open example-news-site.com. Clicking the uBO Scope icon opens a popup showing 15 connected domains:
- `cdn.static-delivery.com` (allowed)
- `tracking-analytics.net` (stealth-blocked)
- `ads.adnetwork.com` (blocked)

This indicates the page successfully fetched resources from the CDN, the analytics requests were quietly blocked, and ad network requests were outright prevented. The badge count shows “10” meaning 10 distinct allowed third-party domains.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues Encountered During First Analysis">
<Accordion title="No Data in Popup">
- Refresh the webpage and open the popup again.
- Verify uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (see installation and initial configuration guides).
- Ensure you are on an active tab making network requests (not a blank or internal page).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Appear or Update">
- Confirm browser compatibility as per supported versions.
- Check that background scripts in the extension are running (via extension debugging tools).
- Restart the browser if the badge remains stuck.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Remember, the badge count is **not** a measure of blocker efficacy. It shows how many distinct third-party domains were contacted successfully.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Stealth-blocking may cause connections to appear allowed to the page script while actually being filtered by your blocker unseen.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Avoid relying on ad blocker test webpages as they often do not simulate real-world network activity accurately. Use uBO Scope to see actual live connections.
</Warning>
