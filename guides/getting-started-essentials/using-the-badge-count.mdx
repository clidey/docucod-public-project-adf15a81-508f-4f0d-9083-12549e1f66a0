# Using the Toolbar Badge Count Effectively

## Overview

The toolbar badge count in uBO Scope represents the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** your browser has connected to or attempted to connect to while browsing a specific tab. Understanding what this number truly means is crucial for accurately assessing your browsing privacy and the effectiveness of your content blockers.

This guide will explain:

- What the badge count signifies
- Why a lower badge count is a better indicator of browsing privacy
- Common misconceptions about interpreting badge counts and block numbers

## What the Badge Count Represents

The number displayed on the toolbar badge reflects **the count of unique third-party domains** from which your browser loaded or attempted to load resources during a browsing session in the active tab.

<u>Key points:</u>

- It counts **distinct remote third-party domains**, not the total number of requests.
- Only third-party domains are counted — first-party domains (the website you are visiting) are excluded.
- The badge tracks domains that were either allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, but this count specifically reflects those domains **allowed** (connected).

A **lower count means fewer distinct third-party servers are contacted**, which implies fewer external connections and potentially less tracking exposure.

## Why a Lower Count Is More Desirable

Every third-party domain your browser connects to represents a remote server that can potentially collect information about your browsing activity. Minimizing these distinct third-party connections reduces your exposure to tracking, advertising, and data leakage.

For example:

- A count showing **2** means your browser connected to two unique third-party domains during that tab’s session.
- A count of **10** means connections to ten different third-party domains, which increases the risk surface.

By focusing on reducing this number, you prioritize **less network exposure over just counting blocked requests**.

## Clearing Up Common Misconceptions

### Myth 1: "A Higher Block Count Means a Better Content Blocker"

The intuition that a content blocker with a higher block count is superior is flawed. Here's why:

- A higher block count only indicates how many requests *were blocked*, not how many unique third-party servers were ultimately contacted.
- It's possible for a content blocker to report a high block count **but still allow connections to more distinct third-party servers**, thus resulting in a higher badge count.
- Conversely, a blocker with a lower block count could block *more distinct domains* at a higher level, reducing your actual exposure.

<u>What ultimately matters</u> is the number of distinct connected third-party domains — the badge count — not the number of blocked requests.

### Myth 2: "Ad Blocker Test Pages Provide Reliable Blocker Effectiveness Results"

“Ad blocker test” webpages are unreliable for assessing real-world content blocker effectiveness because:

- They rely on contrived scenarios and artificial network requests that do not represent how websites operate in practice.
- Many blockers operate stealthily, avoiding detection or web page breakage, which test sites cannot detect.
- These test pages can mislead users into believing a blocker performs better or worse than it does on genuine sites.

<u>Takeaway:</u> Trusting the badge count in real browsing sessions is more valuable than relying on artificial test pages.

## How to Use the Badge Count in Practice

### Step 1: Monitor Your Badge Count

Watch the badge number as you browse different sites or after applying new filter lists or blockers.

- A consistently low number indicates fewer distinct third-party network communications.
- A sudden spike can reveal a site loading many third-party resources.

### Step 2: Investigate High Counts Using the Popup

Click the toolbar icon to open uBO Scope’s popup. Here you can see the detailed breakdown of connected domains categorized by whether they were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

- Focus on the **allowed** section to identify which third parties are actively contacted.
- Use this insight to decide if more aggressive blocking or new filters would reduce unwanted connections.

### Step 3: Adjust Your Configuration or Filters

Based on the popup details, consider:

- Adding problematic third-party domains to your block lists.
- Enabling stricter privacy or content blocking modes where appropriate.

### Step 4: Reassess and Validate

After changes, revisit browsing the same sites and observe the badge count.

- Effective adjustments should reduce the badge count, indicating fewer distinct third-party connections.

### Tips for Filter List Maintainers

uBO Scope’s badge count and domain breakdown provide valuable data beyond typical content blocker block count metrics. Maintaining lists that reduce distinct connected domains is a stronger privacy strategy.

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Badge Count Interpretation">
<Accordion title="Why is my badge count high even though I have a blocker enabled?">
Your content blocker may allow connections to multiple distinct third-party servers despite blocking many individual requests. The badge reflects distinct domains connected, so some allowed third-party servers might be essential CDNs or scripts.

Review the popup details and decide if those allowed domains are necessary or should be blocked.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why does the block count differ from the badge count?">
Block count measures individual requests blocked; badge count measures unique third-party domains connected.

A blocker can block many requests from few domains or few requests from many domains — these metrics track different aspects.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why don’t ad blocker test sites align with my badge count?">
These test sites simulate fake conditions and cannot detect stealth blocking or real-world nuances.

The badge count is derived from real network events reported by the browser and is more trustworthy.

## Summary

| Badge Count Aspect                  | What It Means                                |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Numerical Displayed Number         | Number of distinct third-party domains connected (allowed) in the active tab |
| Higher Number                     | More distinct third-party connections, higher potential exposure             |
| Lower Number                      | Fewer distinct third parties, better privacy                                   |
