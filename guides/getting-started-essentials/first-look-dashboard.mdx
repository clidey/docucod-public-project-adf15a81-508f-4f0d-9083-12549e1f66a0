# Understanding the Dashboard & Badge Counts

## Overview
This guide provides a clear, step-by-step explanation of the uBO Scope popup interface. It helps you understand how to read the badge count on the browser toolbar icon and interpret the categorized list of domains in the extension’s popup. You will learn what each count means and how to use this information to better assess your privacy by monitoring allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked network connections made by your browser.

---

## 1. What You Will Achieve
- **Understand the badge count** on the toolbar icon and its significance.
- **Navigate the popup panel** effectively, reading the categorized domain lists.
- **Interpret the meaning** of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- **Relate connection outcomes** to your privacy and content blocking setup.

## 2. How to Use the Dashboard & Badge Counts

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup
- Click the uBO Scope icon next to your browser’s address bar.
- The popup panel will open, displaying network connection details related to the active tab.

### Step 2: Read the Hostname Header
- At the top, see the website’s hostname you are currently browsing.
- The hostname is split into two spans for clarity (e.g., subdomain and main domain).
- If no data is available yet, the header displays "NO DATA".

### Step 3: Understand the Summary Section
- Just below the header, a summary shows the total number of distinct remote domains connected during your browsing session.
- This number reflects **third-party remote servers** your browser contacted.

### Step 4: Review Connection Outcomes Sections
The main body of the popup shows three categorized sections listing domains:

#### a. Not Blocked (Allowed)
- These domains represent remote servers that were contacted successfully and not blocked.
- A lower count here typically indicates fewer third-party connections, suggesting better privacy or fewer external resources.

#### b. Stealth-Blocked
- Domains here correspond to network requests that were stealth-blocked.
- Stealth blocking means the content blocker prevented the request quietly, without triggering typical blocking signals.
- This category helps identify requests blocked silently to prevent detection or page breakage.

#### c. Blocked
- Domains listed here represent remote servers for which connections were explicitly blocked and failed.
- These blocked connections are visible to the browser and reported by uBO Scope.


### Step 5: Interpret Domain Counts
- Each domain entry shows a count badge representing the number of requests made to that domain.
- These counts help you understand how frequently your browser interacts with each third-party server.

## 3. Practical Tips and Best Practices
- **Watch the Badge Count:** The toolbar icon badge shows the number of *distinct* third-party domains allowed during browsing. A lower number usually reflects better privacy.
- **Don’t Rely Solely on Block Counts:** High block counts may indicate more requests attempted, but fewer unique domains actually connected.
- **Use the Popup for Context:** The categorized domains give practical insight into what your browser allows, blocks, or stealth-blocks, helping you refine filter rules if needed.
- **Reload Pages to Refresh Data:** To get current network connection data, refresh the webpage before viewing the popup.

## 4. Common Questions

### What does it mean if the badge count is zero?
- No third-party connections were allowed or detected for the active tab. This can indicate strong blocking or simple pages.

### Why do some domains appear in stealth-blocked but not blocked?
- Stealth-blocking is a quiet blocking technique to avoid detection by webpages, meaning the request was prevented without obvious browser errors.

### Why is the domain count important instead of the number of requests?
- Counting distinct domains highlights third-party exposure, which is more relevant to privacy than sheer request volume, which may include multiple requests to the same server.

### Can external factors affect these counts?
- Yes, different content blockers, browser DNS-level blocking, or network conditions may influence which requests are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

## 5. Verifying Your Understanding
- Open a popular website known to use third-party resources.
- Click the uBO Scope icon and observe the badge count.
- Open the popup and review domains in each section.
- Confirm that the domain lists update when you navigate to different websites.

If you see domains changing appropriately and counts aligning with your content blockers, uBO Scope is working as expected.

## 6. Troubleshooting Popup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Dashboard & Badge Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup shows NO DATA or empty lists">
- Ensure you are viewing the popup on an active tab with network activity.
- Reload the page to generate fresh network request data.
- Check that uBO Scope has the required browser permissions (activeTab, webRequest).
- Verify you have not disabled the extension or blocked its access.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count does not update">
- The badge updates only when new network request data is processed.
- Close and reopen the popup to refresh data.
- Reload the current tab to force a network refresh.
- Confirm other extensions do not interfere with uBO Scope messaging.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Confusing counts or unexpected domains">
- Remember that all network requests, including third parties, are counted.
- Some domains may be CDN providers or content delivery networks used legitimately.
- Use the categorized lists to differentiate allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked servers.
</Accordion>
