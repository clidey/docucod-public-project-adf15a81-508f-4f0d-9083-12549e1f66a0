# Your First Website Analysis: Step-by-Step

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide walks you through analyzing a real website with uBO Scope by opening the extension's popup panel while browsing, exploring the categorized list of detected domains connecting to the current site, and interpreting what these connections reveal about privacy and control.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and enabled in your browser.
- Have visited or be currently on the website you want to analyze.
- Basic familiarity with browser tabs and extension popups.

### Expected Outcome
After completing this guide, you will confidently open uBO Scope’s popup interface for any website, understand how to interpret the categorized domain lists (allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked), and start drawing meaningful conclusions about third-party connections from the website.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 5-10 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup for Your Current Website

1. While browsing your target website, locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser's toolbar.
2. Click the icon to open the popup panel.

> **Expected Result:** The popup panel opens and loads data relevant to the currently active tab.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Hostname Display

- At the top of the popup, observe two parts of the hostname:
  - The first part (if any) shows the subdomain portion (e.g., 'www.' or another subdomain).
  - The second part shows the main domain (registered domain portion).

> **Example:** For the address 'www.example.com', 'www.' appears on the left, and 'example.com' on the right.

---

### Step 3: Review the Summary of Connected Domains

- Under the hostname, locate the count labeled 'domains connected:'. This number reflects the distinct third-party domains that made network connections when the website loaded.

> **Tip:** A lower number generally means fewer third-party connections, which often translates to more privacy.

---

### Step 4: Explore Each Domain Category Section

The popup separates domains into three clear categories:

- **Not Blocked (allowed):** Domains from which connections were allowed to load.
- **Stealth-Blocked (stealth):** Domains whose requests were redirected or blocked in a stealthy manner to avoid detection by websites.
- **Blocked:** Domains whose requests were blocked outright.

Within each category:
- Domains are listed with their Unicode representation.
- Each domain shows a count badge indicating how many network requests involved that domain.

> **Expected Result:** You see categorized, sorted lists of domains making connections.

---

### Step 5: Interpret Domain Lists

- **Allowed domains:** These servers were actually contacted and served content or resources.
- **Stealth-blocked domains:** These were intercepted or redirected silently, preventing their content from loading without alerting the website.
- **Blocked domains:** These attempts to connect were fully blocked by uBO Scope or the underlying content blocker.

> **Use Case:** By comparing allowed and blocked domains, you can gauge how much third-party content your browser actually loads and what is being filtered.

---

### Step 6: Refresh Analysis When Navigating to a New Page

- After navigating to a different website or reloading the page, open the popup panel again to view updated connections.
- uBO Scope automatically updates the domain lists to reflect the current tab's network activity.

> **Verification:** The domain lists and counts should change according to the new page’s connections.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope during real browsing sessions to observe actual third-party connections on popular sites.
- Pay attention to repeated domains across multiple websites; these often belong to widely used CDN providers or ad networks.
- The **allowed** list shows the domains websites rely on to load content.
- The **stealth-blocked** category reveals domains that would otherwise load but are hidden by stealth blocking techniques.
- The badge count on the toolbar icon corresponds to the number of distinct allowed third-party domains for the active tab.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### The Popup Shows 'NO DATA'

- Ensure the extension is properly enabled and the page has loaded fully.
- Check that your browser actively permits uBO Scope to monitor the active tab (browser and extension permissions).
- Try refreshing the page or reopening the popup.

### Unexpectedly High Counts of Connected Domains

- Remember some domains are essential third parties like content delivery networks (CDNs) and are usually harmless.
- Verify if stealth blocking is properly functioning by checking if the stealth category is populated.

### Domain Names Show as Punycode

- The popup automatically converts domain names from punycode to Unicode for easier reading.
- However, some unusual domain names or very new TLDs may still appear in punycode.

## Example Scenario

Imagine you are visiting a popular news website:

- Open uBO Scope popup.
- You see 'www.newswebsite.com' displayed with 15 connected domains.
- Categories show 'not blocked' with 10 domains, 'stealth-blocked' with 3, and 'blocked' with 2.
- By scanning the allowed list, you recognize common CDN providers delivering images and scripts.
- Stealth-blocked domains hint at trackers silently blocked.
- Blocked domains may include known ad servers filtered out.

This gives you clear insight into how many and which third parties the website interacts with, empowering you to understand privacy exposure.

---

## Summary

- Open the uBO Scope popup while on any website to start analysis.
- Observe the hostname and total connected domains count.
- Review the categorized lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains.
- Use this information to make informed decisions about privacy and content blockers.
