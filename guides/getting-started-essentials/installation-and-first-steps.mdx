# Installing and Launching uBO Scope

uBO Scope is a powerful browser extension designed to reveal all remote server connections made by your browser, whether allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked. This guide walks you through the seamless journey from installing the extension on supported browsers to launching it and verifying its proper operation by seeing your first domain connection badge in the browser toolbar.

- Internet connection to download the extension.
- Basic familiarity with installing browser extensions.

### Expected Outcome
By the end of this guide, you will have uBO Scope installed, visible as an icon in your browser toolbar, able to launch its popup panel, and confirm that it is actively monitoring your network connections by showing domain connection counts.

### Time Estimate
5–10 minutes

### Difficulty Level
Beginner

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Install uBO Scope Extension

#### For Chromium-Based Browsers

1. Open your Chromium-based browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge).
2. Navigate to the official Chrome Web Store page for uBO Scope: [Chrome Web Store – uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
3. Click the `Add to Chrome` button.
4. Confirm the installation by clicking `Add extension` when prompted.

#### For Firefox

1. Open Firefox (desktop version).
2. Navigate to the Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope: [Firefox Add-ons – uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
3. Click the `Add to Firefox` button.
4. Confirm the installation by clicking `Add`.

<Note>
Only recent versions of Firefox (version 128 and above) and Chromium (version 122 and above) support the necessary permissions and APIs uBO Scope uses.
</Note>

### 2. Confirm uBO Scope Icon in Toolbar

- After installation, look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It uses a distinct icon (usually featuring the uBO Scope logo).
- If you do not see the icon:
  - In Chromium browsers, click the puzzle piece (extensions icon) and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.
  - In Firefox, check the toolbar customize panel to add the icon.

<Check>
Having the icon visible ensures quick access to uBO Scope's popup panel and real-time badge updates.
</Check>

### 3. Launch the uBO Scope Popup

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your toolbar.
2. The popup panel will open, displaying network connection details for the active tab.
3. Initially, the panel may show "NO DATA" or a waiting state while connections are detected.

### 4. Verify Network Connection Badge

- The icon badge displays the number of distinct third-party domains contacted by the currently active tab.
- Visit any website with remote content (e.g., news site, shopping site).
- Observe the badge on the uBO Scope icon update with a numeric count representing distinct remote connections.

<Info>
A lower badge count is generally better as it indicates fewer third-party connections.
</Info>

### 5. Validate Data Shown in the Popup Panel

- The popup panel categorizes domains into three outcome groups:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which resources were successfully loaded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with connections silently redirected or modified.
  - **Blocked:** Domains for which connections were blocked.
- You will see a list of domain names and counts representing connection attempts.

<Check>
If you see domains listed and counts updating, uBO Scope is actively tracking connections as designed.
</Check>

---

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Refresh the active tab** after installation to initiate connection tracking.
- **Visit different websites** to observe varying domain connection counts.
- If the badge remains blank or zero despite visiting sites with expected remote content, **try restarting your browser** or reinstalling the extension.
- Pin the extension icon for easier access and continuous visibility.

<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Remains Empty">
- Wait a few moments after launching the popup; data collection starts asynchronously.
- Navigate between tabs to trigger fresh data gathering.
- Try disabling other extensions temporarily to rule out conflicts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Installation Fails or Is Blocked by Browser">
- Verify browser version compatibility and update if needed.
- Install from official sources (Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons) only.
- Check internet connectivity.
