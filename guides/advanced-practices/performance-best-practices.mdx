# Best Practices for Optimal Performance

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps users leverage uBO Scope efficiently without degrading browser performance or distorting privacy analysis. It explains when and how to reset session data, understand extension resource usage, and configure niche features for specific needs.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled in a supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with uBO Scope’s popup panel and toolbar badge (see [Interpreting the Popup Panel](../analyzing-connections/interpreting-popup-stats) and [Understanding the Badge Count](../analyzing-connections/understanding-badge-count)).

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, users will:
- Maintain accurate privacy measurement without performance bottlenecks.
- Know how to manage session data effectively.
- Adjust settings to balance performance with comprehensive monitoring.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10 to 15 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate — some understanding of browser extensions and session management is helpful.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Understand Session Data and Its Impact
uBO Scope tracks network requests and stores them as session data, mapping tab IDs to detailed connection outcomes (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked). Over time, this data grows and can impact extension responsiveness.

- **Action:** Recognize that session data is cleared automatically when the browser session ends.
- **Outcome:** Awareness helps prevent confusion when badge counts or popup data reset unexpectedly.

### 2. Reset Session Data When Needed
If you notice stale or inconsistent connection data—such as counts not updating after many tabs or browsing—the session data may need resetting.

- **Action:** Disable and re-enable the extension, or reload your browser.
- **Advanced:** Use the browser's extension management interface to clear uBO Scope’s storage if supported.

- **Outcome:** Clearing session data restores accurate tracking and badge updates.

### 3. Monitor Browser Resource Usage
uBO Scope uses the browser’s native `webRequest` API via service workers or background scripts to monitor network requests continuously.

- **Tip:** Because it listens for numerous network events, minor increases in CPU or memory usage can occur during heavy browsing.
- **Tip:** These resource requirements are minimal compared to more complex blocking extensions.

### 4. Configure Feature Toggles for Niche Needs
Currently, uBO Scope has minimal configuration options but plans to add features beneficial for filter list maintainers and power users.

- **Best Practice:** Use the extension's default settings for everyday browsing to keep performance optimal.
- **For Advanced Use:** Watch for future updates that allow toggling detailed network request logging or session data handling to control resource consumption.

### 5. Avoid Common Pitfalls That Skew Privacy Results
- Do not rely solely on block counts or badge numbers to assess content blockers.
- Avoid 'ad blocker test' sites that serve unrealistic or fabricated network requests.
- Regularly verify uBO Scope's data freshness by closing old tabs and resetting session data if needed.

## Practical Examples

### Example: Resetting Session Data After Heavy Browsing
1. Open your browser's extension page.
2. Toggle uBO Scope off and then back on.
3. Refresh the active tabs to trigger new network requests.
4. Open the uBO Scope popup and confirm the badge count reflects current third-party connections.

### Example: Monitoring Performance Impact
- Use browser’s Task Manager (e.g., Chrome's `Shift+Esc`) to monitor uBO Scope’s resource usage during intensive browsing.
- If CPU or RAM spikes appear unreachable, consider restarting the browser or limiting the number of open tabs.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting & Performance Tips">
<Accordion title="Why is the toolbar badge not updating?">
Ensure that your browser correctly reports network events via the `webRequest` API, and that no browser setting or other extensions block this telemetry. Resetting the session data usually resolves stale badge counts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="My browsing seems slow after installing uBO Scope, what can I do?">
Heavy browsing or scenarios with numerous active tabs can strain system resources. Close unused tabs and periodically reset uBO Scope by disabling/enabling the extension or restarting the browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I configure uBO Scope to use less memory?">
Currently, no direct memory settings are exposed. Limiting session lifespan by resetting data and avoiding keeping long-running tabs open is recommended.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I reset session data manually?">
Although there is no explicit button in the UI, you can reset session data by:

- Restarting your browser
- Disabling and reenabling uBO Scope in your extensions management panel

Future versions may include dedicated controls.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Keep your uBO Scope extension updated to receive upcoming features that enhance performance and offer more granular control over monitoring and privacy insights.
