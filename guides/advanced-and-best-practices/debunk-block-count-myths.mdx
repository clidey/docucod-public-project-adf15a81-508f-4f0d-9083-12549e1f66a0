# Debunking Block Count Myths & Testing Blocker Effectiveness

## Understanding the Real Measure of Content Blockers

When evaluating content blockers, many users rely on the number displayed on the browser extension badge — often called the "block count." This approach is misleading and fails to reflect the true effectiveness of the blocker. uBO Scope provides clarity by focusing instead on **distinct third-party domains actually contacted** during browsing sessions.

### Why Block Counts Are Misleading

- **High block count ≠ better blocking**: A blocker showing a high number of blocked requests may still allow connections to more unique third-party domains, meaning it ultimately exposes you to a broader tracking surface.
- **Block counts often include fragmented or redundant requests**: Multiple requests to subdomains, tracking pixels, or scripts on the same domain inflate the block count.
- **Test pages can be deceptive**: So-called "ad blocker test" websites simulate unrealistic conditions that don’t reflect real-world browsing, leading to unreliable reports of blocker effectiveness.

<Info>
Instead of fixating on raw numbers, focus on the **number of unique third-party remote servers your browser connects to**. A lower count means a smaller attack and tracking surface.

## How uBO Scope Helps

uBO Scope reveals all third-party connection attempts in real-time and categorizes them into:

- **Allowed**: Domains where network requests succeeded or were allowed to proceed.
- **Blocked**: Domains where network requests were explicitly blocked (e.g., by content blockers).
- **Stealth-blocked**: Domains involved in redirects or hidden blocking mechanisms, helping understand stealth behaviors where requests may be altered or silently dropped.

This categorization lets you assess how well a blocker limits your exposure — not just by counting blocked requests, but by considering how many distinct domains appear in your active browsing session.

## Step-by-Step Workflow to Assess Blocker Effectiveness Using uBO Scope

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and active on your browser.
- A web page open in the active tab.
- The uBO Scope toolbar icon visible (check if pinned).

### 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- The popup shows the active tab’s hostname and summarizes third-party connections.

### 2. Interpret the Toolbar Badge
- The badge number shows how many unique third-party domains had allowed connections.
- A lower badge count indicates fewer unblocked third-party connections.

### 3. Review Domain Categories in the Popup
- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains with allowed connections.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were stealthily blocked or involved in redirects.
- **Blocked**: Domains with explicitly blocked requests.

Each section lists domains with the count of connections.

### 4. Compare Across Different Blockers
- Use uBO Scope while running different blockers to observe:
  - How many distinct domains are allowed to connect.
  - The distribution of domains in the stealth and blocked categories.

### 5. Understand Stealth Blocking
- Stealth blocking may hide the fact that some connections are redirected or filtered non-obviously.
- The uBO Scope popup helps you spot these hidden connection outcomes.

<Tip>
Taking stealth blocking into account is essential for a true assessment. Some blockers silently redirect or drop requests, and these won't appear as simple blocked counts.
</Tip>

## Practical Tips for Accurate Testing

- **Test with real-world browsing sessions**, not fabricated test sites.
- **Reload the page and navigate multiple times** to capture dynamic third-party connections.
- **Clear browsing sessions or restart browser** between tests to get fresh data.
- **Pin the uBO Scope icon** to your toolbar to easily access real-time data.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

<Warning>
Relying solely on the badge block count leads to false conclusions about blocker performance. Always use uBO Scope or equivalent tools to see actual domain-level connection data.
</Warning>

<Warning>
Avoid 'ad blocker test' pages for assessing your content blocker; they create unrealistic, easily gamed scenarios.
</Warning>

## Next-Level Insights with uBO Scope

Once comfortable with basic assessment, explore:

- **Connection Inspection Walkthrough**: Learn to dive deeper into each domain's behaviors.
- **Interpreting Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Outcomes**: Understand the nuances of connection filtering.
- **Filter List Analysis**: Use uBO Scope to aid filter list maintainers in refining blocking rules.

## Example Scenario

Assume you visit a news website with multiple content blockers:

| Blocker           | Toolbar Block Count | Unique Allowed Domains (uBO Scope) |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Blocker A         | 120                 | 15                                |
| Blocker B         | 80                  | 35                                |

Despite Blocker A showing a higher block count, it *actually* allows fewer third-party domains than Blocker B, meaning it is more effective at reducing exposure.
