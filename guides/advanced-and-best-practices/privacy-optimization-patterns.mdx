# Best Practices for Reducing Third-Party Connections

uBO Scope empowers you with transparent insight into all third-party network connections initiated by your browser. To truly benefit from this visibility and enhance your online privacy, it’s crucial to adopt effective strategies that minimize the number and impact of these connections.

This guide provides practical workflows and actionable recommendations to help you build a privacy-first browsing environment using uBO Scope in tandem with content blockers and privacy tools.

## 1. Why Minimize Third-Party Connections?

Third-party connections often represent tracking and data-sharing points that expose your browsing habits. Even if some third parties provide legitimate services (e.g., CDNs), excessive third-party requests increase your digital fingerprint and risk.

By reducing these connections, you achieve:

- **Improved privacy:** Fewer external entities can collect your browsing data.
- **Faster page loads:** Blocking unnecessary resources speeds up websites.
- **Lower bandwidth use:** Less data downloaded through unwanted third parties.
- **More control:** Understand and manage which parties your browser contacts.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before applying these practices, ensure:

- You have uBO Scope installed and active on a supported browser (Chromium v122+, Firefox v128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Basic configuration and permissions setup of uBO Scope are complete to allow full network monitoring. Refer to the [Basic Configuration Setup](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/first-steps-and-usage/configuration-setup) guide.
- You are familiar with interpreting the uBO Scope popup interface showing Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth-blocked domains.

## 3. Workflow to Reduce Third-Party Connections

### Step 1: Monitor Active Tab Connections

- Open uBO Scope’s popup while browsing the site of interest.
- Review the list of domains under **Not Blocked**, **Blocked**, and **Stealth-blocked** categories.
- Note the badge count on the toolbar icon showing the number of unique third-party domains connected.

Regularly checking these counts will help you understand your current exposure to third-party servers.

### Step 2: Identify Unwanted Third Parties

- Use the popup to identify domains you do not recognize or consider unnecessary for website functionality.
- Distinguish between legitimate service providers (e.g., well-known CDNs) and tracking domains.

### Step 3: Strengthen Your Content Blockers

- Adjust your primary content blocker (such as uBlock Origin) to block unwanted third-party domains observed by uBO Scope.
- Incorporate reputable filter lists focused on privacy and tracker blocking.

### Step 4: Recognize and Address Stealth Blocking

- Domains under **Stealth-blocked** are hidden by the content blocker’s tactics to avoid detection by websites.
- Be cautious not to confuse stealth-blocked domains with allowed ones; uBO Scope clearly marks these categories.
- Use stealth blocking as a privacy advantage, but test websites for breakage.

### Step 5: Leverage Additional Privacy Tools

- Combine uBO Scope insights with other privacy tools such as DNS-based blockers (e.g., Pi-hole) or browser privacy settings.
- Note that uBO Scope reports requests despite DNS-level blocking if reported by the browser API.

### Step 6: Establish Ongoing Privacy Maintenance

- Regularly monitor new domains appearing in the popup during your browsing sessions.
- Continuously refine your block rules and filter lists based on uBO Scope data.
- Use uBO Scope in multiple browsing contexts (work, personal, sensitive) to customize blocking strategies appropriately.

## 4. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Aim for a lower badge count:** The goal is to reduce the number of distinct third-party domains connected to.
- **Understand domain hierarchy:** Use uBO Scope’s domain and hostname grouping to avoid overblocking.
- **Balance blocking and usability:** Some third-party connections are essential for site functions; test and whitelist when necessary.
- **Use filter list maintainers’ insights:** Refer to guides like [Using uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance](https://docs.example.com/guides/advanced-and-best-practices/filter-list-analysis) for advanced curation.
- **Avoid misleading metrics:** Don’t trust internal block counts alone; rely on uBO Scope’s unique domain count to assess exposure.

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Pitfall 1: Assuming All Third-Party Connections Are Malicious

Not all third-party connections are harmful. Content delivery networks and essential service providers might be classified under allowed domains. Use discretion when blocking.

### Pitfall 2: Relying Solely on Block Counts

High block counts don’t mean better privacy if the underlying requests still reach many third parties. uBO Scope debunks this myth.

### Pitfall 3: Neglecting Stealth Blocking Effects

Stealth blocking hides blocking activity from websites but still counts as blocking in uBO Scope. Misinterpretation can lead to confusion.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- If the popup shows no data for a tab, confirm the extension permissions and that your browser supports the `webRequest` API fully.
- If uneasy about a domain, cross-check with external sources or reference known tracking domain lists.

## 6. Example Scenario: Privacy Optimization on an E-Commerce Site

1. Navigate to your favorite e-commerce site.
2. Open uBO Scope popup and observe:
   - 12 allowed third-party domains.
   - 5 stealth-blocked domains.
   - 3 blocked domains.
3. Identify suspicious domains not related to payment, product content, or support.
4. Update your content blocker to explicitly block these domains.
5. Refresh the site and verify the uBO Scope badge count has decreased.

This cycle helps you reduce tracking exposure while maintaining site usability.
