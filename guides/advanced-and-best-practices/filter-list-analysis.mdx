# Using uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance

## Workflow Overview

### Purpose
This guide empowers filter list maintainers and advanced users to leverage uBO Scope as an investigative tool for monitoring and maintaining filter lists. It focuses specifically on workflows to extract detailed network activity, identify domains that are bypassed or whitelisted erroneously, and thereby improve filter curation.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope must be installed on a supported browser (Chromium v122+, Firefox v128+, Safari v18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with uBO Scope's interface (badge counts and popup details).
- Access to browsing scenarios where filter list effectiveness needs validation.

### Expected Outcome
After following this guide, users will be able to:
- Extract actionable domain-level connection data from any active tab.
- Detect third-party domains that are allowed (whitelisted) or missed by filter lists.
- Use uBO Scope in environments with limited browser developer tools for filter list investigative workflows.

### Time Estimate
15–30 minutes to perform initial investigative steps per site.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate to Advanced: This guide assumes users have a foundational understanding of network requests and filter list concepts.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope on the Target Tab
1. Navigate to the website you want to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
3. Observe the badge number indicating unique allowed third-party domains.
4. Review the connection summary categorized under **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

**Outcome**: You see detailed domain counts classified by connection outcome.

### Step 2: Identify Allowed Domains for Filter List Review
1. Focus on the **not blocked** section.
2. The domains here represent third parties that your filter list currently allows.
3. Scrutinize these domains to identify:
   - Legitimate third-party services (e.g., CDN providers).
   - Potential domains overlooked by filters or intentionally whitelisted.

**Decision Point:**
- If a domain seems suspicious or unnecessary, consider adding it to your filter list.
- If a domain is essential to site functionality, document accordingly to avoid breaking the site.

### Step 3: Analyze Stealth-Blocked Domains
1. Review the **stealth-blocked** section which tracks requests blocked silently (redirects or hidden blocks).
2. These domains are blocked by your content blockers but may evade visible blocking metrics.
3. Use this insight to:
   - Confirm stealth blocking effectiveness.
   - Examine if any domains should be unblocked or further restricted.

### Step 4: Examine Blocked Domains
1. The **blocked** section lists domains explicitly blocked with errors.
2. Verify the domains in this list to ensure:
   - Blocks align with your filter list goals.
   - No critical third parties are inadvertently blocked.

### Step 5: Extract Domain-Level Data for Documentation or Filter List Update
1. Use the popup’s domain list and counts to record precise third-party domains linked to your target webpage.
2. If needed, manually copy domain names and counts for:
   - Building filter rules.
   - Reporting bugs or false positives.

### Step 6: Use uBO Scope on Devices with Limited Browser Tools
1. Given uBO Scope operates independently as a browser extension, it serves well on platforms with restricted developer tools.
2. Repeat the above steps to gather connection data without relying on complex browser developer panels.
3. Export or note down observed details for offline analysis or collaborative review.

### Step 7: Monitor and Iterate
1. Repeat monitoring across different sites or browsing sessions.
2. Compare domain behaviors to identify patterns or emerging third-party services.
3. Regularly update filter lists using insights gained from uBO Scope’s domain monitoring.

**Verification:** Confirm filter list changes reduce allowed domain counts without degrading site functionality.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Detecting a Missed Tracking Domain
- Visit a site suspected of third-party tracking.
- Open the uBO Scope popup.
- See domain "tracker.example.com" under **not blocked** with 15 connections.
- Decide to add a blocking rule to your filter list for "tracker.example.com".

### Example 2: Confirming Legitimate CDN Domains
- On a news site, you notice several CDN domains like "cdn.examplecdn.com" under **not blocked**.
- Verify these domains serve essential static assets.
- Mark these domains as safe to whitelist to avoid breaking page load.

### Example 3: Using uBO Scope on Mobile Firefox
- On Firefox mobile where developer tools are limited, use uBO Scope extension popup to view third-party connections.
- Save domain names manually.
- Use these for offline filter refinement.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Refresh regularly:** Reload the target webpage before checking uBO Scope to capture the latest network activity.
- **Cross-check with filter lists:** Use uBO Scope data alongside your existing filter lists to find mismatches.
- **Beware of false positives:** Not every allowed domain is malicious; assess domain ownership and usage.
- **Use session data:** Combine with other analysis tools or saved sessions to track persistent domain behaviors.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty lists
- Ensure you are focused on the active tab where you expect traffic.
- Reload the page and retry opening the popup.
- Verify that uBO Scope has all necessary permissions and that your browser supports the extension APIs.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions that may interfere with webRequest listeners.

### Issue: Domains appear under 'allowed' although filters should block them
- Confirm your filter list is correctly loaded and applied.
- Some requests may not be blockable due to browser or network limitations.
- Check if domains are whitelisted by rule exceptions in your filters.

### Issue: Counts seem unexpectedly low or high
- Remember the badge counts unique third-party domains, not total requests.
- Stealth blocking may hide some requests from direct block counts.
- Use uBO Scope as a transparency tool, not sole effectiveness metric.
