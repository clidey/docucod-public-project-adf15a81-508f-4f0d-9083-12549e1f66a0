# Interpreting Stealth-Blocked and Allowed Domains in Practice

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide walks you through practical, real-world examples for using the stealth-blocked and allowed domains data provided by uBO Scope. It empowers you to troubleshoot filtering issues, test filter lists, and validate stealth blocking effectiveness — even when multiple layers of blocking like other content blockers or DNS-level filters are active.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and enabled in your web browser.
- Basic familiarity with the extension’s popup interface showing allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- A web page with network activity (preferably containing third-party content) loaded in an active browser tab.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Distinguish allowed versus stealth-blocked and fully blocked domains in the extension’s report.
- Use the stealth data to identify subtle network filtering effects invisible to many blocker test pages.
- Confidently verify if stealth blocking behaves as intended, under complex network blocking layers.
- Debug missing or unexpected connections relying on domain visibility through uBO Scope.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10–20 minutes, depending on the complexity of your browsing scenario and familiarity with blocking concepts.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate — familiarity with browser network requests and content blocking concepts recommended.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup for Your Active Tab
1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon on your browser to open the popup panel.
2. Observe the header that displays the hostname and domain of the current active tab.
3. Note the summary count indicating the number of distinct connected third-party domains.

_Expected Result:_
- You see a categorized list of domains under “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked.”

---

### 2. Understand Domain Categorization and Outcome Meanings
- **Not Blocked (Allowed Domains):** Domains that the browser successfully connected to without obstruction.
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains:** Domains for which connections were silently redirected or filtered, making their blocking less visible to the web page itself or classic network monitoring.
- **Blocked Domains:** Domains for which connection attempts failed and were openly blocked.

_Decision Point:_
- If your goal is to audit which third parties are actually reachable and used, focus first on the allowed domains.
- If troubleshooting unexpected network behavior, pay close attention to stealth-blocked entries.

---

### 3. Use Stealth-Blocked Domain Data to Troubleshoot Filtering
1. Identify any stealth-blocked domains relevant to your browsing session.
2. Confirm if any stealth blocking aligns with your active filter lists or other blocking layers (e.g., DNS-level or other content blockers).
3. When you notice unexpected stealth blocking:
   - Compare with your filter list rules for that domain.
   - Validate if blending stealth blocking is intentional or a misconfiguration.

_Example Scenario:_
- A tracking domain you expect to be fully blocked appears under stealth-blocked. This may indicate a redirect or silent filter that the page can’t easily detect.

_Expected Result:_
- You discern if stealth blocking is functioning appropriately, allowing sophisticated blocking without breaking page functionality.

---

### 4. Verify That Stealth Blocking Functions Despite Layered Filters
1. If using multiple content blockers or DNS-based filters, reload the page.
2. View the stealth-blocked domains in uBO Scope after reload.
3. Confirm that stealth-blocked entries are consistently reported regardless of other blockers.

_Pro Tip:_
- uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API, so it can detect network events despite other blockers. Use this data to uncover hidden network blocking layers.

---

### 5. Test Custom Filters and Validate Effectiveness
1. Apply or adjust filter rules in your content blocker or hosts configuration.
2. Reload the target page.
3. Compare domain listings in allowed, stealth, and blocked sections in the uBO Scope popup.
4. Check for changes in stealth-blocked domains that match your filter changes.

_Expected Result:_
- The stealth-blocked domains count and list update in real time to reflect your filtering adjustments.

---

### 6. Interpret Domain Counts and Communication Frequency
- Each domain row shows a count badge reflecting how many network requests were associated with that domain during the page session.
- Higher counts can indicate persistent third-party activity.

_Use Case:_
- Quickly identify dominant trackers or services with frequent communications.
- Determine if suspected domains are recurrently contacted despite stealth blocking.

---

### 7. Save and Export Data for Further Analysis (Advanced)
_Currently, uBO Scope does not provide built-in export functions, but:
- The source code and session data handling (in `session.tabIdToDetailsMap`) can be queried programmatically by advanced users._

## Examples & Real-World Scenarios

### Example 1: Detecting Stealth Blocking That Webpages Can’t See
Imagine a webpage loads several third-party scripts from analytics.example.com.
- The domain does not show up under allowed or fully blocked domains but appears under stealth-blocked.
- This indicates uBO Scope observed connection redirects or silent filtering.
- Using this knowledge, you verify your filter’s intended stealth blocking rules are effective.

### Example 2: Troubleshooting Unexpected Allowed Domains
You notice a suspicious domain appears under the allowed domains list.
- Checking your filters, you find a missing or incorrect rule.
- You add an explicit blocking rule, reload, and observe this domain moving to stealth-blocked or blocked, confirming the filter works.

### Example 3: Validating Filter Layering
Using a DNS-level blocking tool alongside uBO Scope:
- DNS-level blocks prevent some connections, but uBO Scope still detects network requests blocked stealthily by the browser.
- This confirms layered blocking and helps find gaps or overlaps between DNS and extension-based filters.

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Empty domain lists:** Ensure that the page has loaded network requests; reload the page and confirm the extension is enabled with required permissions.
- **Missing stealth-blocked domains:** Some stealth blocking scenarios might be rare; try visiting sites with known trackers or testing with custom filters.
- **Confusing counts or domain splits:** Remember that domains are normalized by the Public Suffix List (PSL) to consolidate related hostnames.

### Best Practices
- Regularly update filter lists and confirm stealth-blocked domains to maintain up-to-date blocking.
- Use domain counts as a heuristic for which third parties are most active.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with traditional network debugging tools for comprehensive analysis.

### Performance Considerations
- uBO Scope batches network events with slight delays to optimize performance but reactiveness remains near real-time.
- Heavy page loads with many third-party domains might increase popup update times.

### Alternative Approaches
- Use uBO Scope alongside other browser developer tools, but rely on uBO Scope for stealth-blocked domain visibility unique to extension-blocking.

## Appendix: Understanding the Underlying Data

uBO Scope categorizes domains observed per active tab by listening to browser network events. It aggregates domain data using the Public Suffix List (PSL) for accurate domain grouping, reflecting:

- **Allowed:** Successful connections transmitted.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections silently redirected or suppressed but still detectable through network observation.
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly failed or stopped.

The popup interface displays these outcomes with domain counts, providing real-time visibility into the site's network behavior.

<Note>
Stealth blocking often uses redirection or subtle filtering techniques that do not necessarily generate visible block errors but prevent certain trackers or resources from actively participating.
