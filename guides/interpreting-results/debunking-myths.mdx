# Common Myths about Ad Blockers and Test Pages

Understanding content blocker behavior can be confusing, especially when relying on badge counts or test websites to gauge their effectiveness. This guide cuts through common misconceptions, empowering you to interpret uBO Scope results with confidence and appropriate skepticism.

---

## Why This Guide Matters

Many users assume that content blocker badge counts or online test pages provide clear, reliable indicators of ad blocker performance. This guide reveals why these assumptions are often incorrect and explains how uBO Scope offers a more truthful picture of what is happening behind the scenes.

## Myth 1: Higher Block Counts Mean Better Blocking

### Myth Explained
It is a widespread belief that if an ad blocker shows a higher number of blocked requests, it is more effective. Intuitively, blocking more content seems better for privacy and security.

### The Reality
- **Badge count on uBO Scope represents distinct connected third-party domains, not simply blocked requests.**
- A higher blocker count can actually mean ***more allowed connections*** to various third-party servers because some content blockers avoid blocking aggressively to prevent site breakage.
- Content blockers with very high block counts may still allow resource loads from numerous third-party hosts, undermining their effectiveness.

### Why It Happens
Webpages frequently try to load resources from multiple domains, including legitimate ones such as CDNs, analytics, or APIs. Some blockers balance between blocking and site functionality by stealthily redirecting or allowing certain connections.

### What to Do
- Focus on **the number of _allowed_ third-party domains** rather than the raw block count.
- Use uBO Scope’s badge count to gauge how many distinct servers the page truly connects to.
- Remember: **Lower is better** for the badge count — it indicates fewer third-party connections.

<Check>
A high number on your content blocker's badge does not automatically mean it is blocking more third-party connections. Cross-reference with uBO Scope’s popup for clarity.

## Myth 2: Ad Blocker Test Pages Are Reliable Benchmarks

### Myth Explained
Many rely on glorified "ad blocker test" websites that claim to detect if a blocker is working or not. These pages often simulate requests and show simplified results.

### The Reality
- These test pages use **fabricated and unrealistic network requests** that do not reflect normal webpage behavior.
- Many content blockers employ stealth techniques to evade detection — the test page cannot see these stealth blocks and reports false negatives.
- Test pages often trigger network requests that are never encountered in real-world browsing, making their results irrelevant.

### Why It Happens
Test pages operate on assumption-based detection which does not account for advanced content blocker methods such as request redirecting, silent blocking, and other evasion techniques.

### What to Do
- Avoid drawing conclusions solely based on the results of ad blocker test pages.
- Use uBO Scope to **observe actual network request outcomes on the real websites you visit**.
- Trust real browsing data over simulated tests to make decisions about content blockers.

<Warning>
Ad blocker test pages cannot capture the stealthy behavior of modern content blockers and can mislead you about their true performance.
</Warning>

## Making Sense of uBO Scope Results

### Three Categories of Domains Shown in uBO Scope Popup
- **Allowed:** Domains from which content was successfully loaded.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where requests were silently redirected or blocked to avoid detection.
- **Blocked:** Domains actively blocked with visible errors or failures.

Interpreting these categories is essential to understanding how content blockers protect your privacy.

### The Badge Count Meaning
The badge count reflects the number of unique third-party domains successfully connected — not the number of blocked attempts.

### Real-World Usage
- Use the detailed popup to see exactly which domains are connected or blocked.
- Look for patterns indicating stealth blocking, which test pages won't reveal.

---

## Practical Tips for Using uBO Scope

- **Use real browsing sessions to evaluate blockers, not synthetic tests.**
- **Focus on reducing the number of allowed third-party domains**, as this limits your exposure.
- **Recognize stealth blocking as a feature, not a bug.**
- Periodically review the popup for unexpected domains, which might indicate tracking or unnecessary connections.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

| Issue                         | Cause                                               | Solution                                      |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Badge count seems high         | Page loads many third-party servers                 | Review popup details; evaluate allowed vs blocked domains |
| Test page says blocker failed | Stealth blocking bypassed test detection mechanisms | Trust real browsing data over test page         |
| Inconsistent block counts     | Some blockers count requests, others count domains  | Use uBO Scope’s distinct domains count instead |

<Accordion title="Real-World Scenario: John’s Experience">
John installed uBO Scope to monitor the connections made by his favorite news website.

- Initially, the badge count was high, and the block count in his ad blocker was even higher.
- John realized that the block count alone was misleading.
- After reviewing the popup, he saw many allowed domains not blocked despite a high block count.
- He avoided relying on ad blocker test sites because they reported inconsistent results.
- By focusing on allowed domains’ count, John successfully tailored his filters and improved his privacy.
