# Comparing Content Blockers with uBO-Scope

This guide provides a practical, myth-busting approach to comparing different content blockers using **uBO-Scope** as an auditing tool. You will learn how to perform side-by-side site loads, interpret connection counts versus actual privacy exposure, and avoid common pitfalls during benchmarking.

---

## 1. Understanding the Challenge

Content blockers often report different numbers of blocked requests, but those counts can be misleading. A higher block count does **not** necessarily mean a blocker is more effective. What truly matters is how many **distinct third-party remote server connections are allowed** during your browsing, as these represent genuine privacy exposure.

<u>Why use uBO-Scope?</u>

uBO-Scope transparently logs **all network requests attempted by your browser**, regardless of which content blockers or DNS-level blocking are active. This lets you see who was actually connected to and understand the true privacy impact.

---

## 2. Preparing to Compare Content Blockers

### Prerequisites

- Install **uBO-Scope** in your preferred browser (compatible with Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Have two or more content blockers installed and enabled alternatively (e.g., uBlock Origin, AdGuard, etc.).
- A stable internet connection and the websites you want to test.

### Expected Outcome

By the end of this guide, you will:
- See how to run site loads with different blockers
- Understand the difference between raw block counts and effective connection blocking
- Identify common benchmarking traps and how to avoid them

## 3. Step-by-Step: Comparing Content Blockers with uBO-Scope

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO-Scope Popup">
Click the uBO-Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel for the active browser tab. This popup displays the connected third-party domains categorized as **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
</Step>

<Step title="Load the Test Website with First Content Blocker Enabled">
Ensure only your first content blocker is enabled. Load or refresh the website you want to test.

- Watch the uBO-Scope popup updating with the summary:
  - The badge count shows the number of distinct third-party domains allowed.
  - The popup lists domains in the three categories.
</Step>

<Step title="Record Observations">
Note the following:
- Number of allowed domains (this reflects actual third-party connections).
- Blocked domains count.
- Any stealth-blocked domains (requests blocked in stealth mode, often invisible to the site).

Avoid focusing solely on the block counts.
</Step>

<Step title="Switch to the Second Content Blocker">
Disable the first and enable the second content blocker. Reload the same site and observe uBO-Scope's popup and badge counts.

Compare:
- Are fewer or more third-party domains allowed?
- How do block vs. allowed counts differ?
</Step>

<Step title="Repeat for Additional Blockers or Configurations">
Repeat this load and observe cycle for any other content blockers or configurations for comprehensive comparison.
</Step>

<Step title="Analyze the Results">
Focus on:
- Which blocker yields the **lowest number of allowed third-party domains**?
- Are block counts correlating contrary to expected privacy (e.g., higher block count but more allowed domains)?

Remember the badge count in uBO-Scope represents real privacy exposure â€” the number of distinct third-party connections allowed.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Interpreting Block Counts vs. Allowed Connections

- **Block count**: The number of HTTP requests or resources a content blocker actively blocks.
- **Allowed connections** (reported by uBO-Scope badge and popup): Number of **distinct third-party domains** your browser successfully connected to.

### Why the difference matters:
- A blocker might block many requests but still allow connections to numerous unique third-party servers. This could mean more privacy risk despite high block numbers.
- Content blockers using stealth or indirect blocking may reduce block counts but still prevent unwanted requests effectively.

<u>Actionable insight:</u> Use uBO-Scope's **allowed domains count** to assess privacy exposure rather than block count alone.

---

## 5. Common Benchmarking Traps to Avoid

### Trap 1: Relying on Block Counts From Content Blocker UI
- Block counts are internally defined and may count subresource requests multiple times.
- They do not count allowed third-party domains, missing the full privacy picture.

### Trap 2: Using Ad-Block Test Pages
- Ad-block test pages often generate unrealistic, fabricated networks of requests.
- These do not reflect real-world web behavior and do not show stealth-blocking effects.
- uBO-Scope exposes all real network connections, revealing true exposure.

### Trap 3: Ignoring Stealth Blocking
- Some blockers stealthily block requests, making them invisible to webpages and some test methods.
- uBO-Scope reports **stealth-blocked domains** separately, helping you see these hidden effects.

---

## 6. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Always compare content blockers by loading the *same real websites* under the same network conditions.
- Focus on the **uBO-Scope badge count and popup allowed connections**, not block counts.
- Interpret stealth-blocked domains as additional privacy protection.
- Use the lists in the popup to identify unexpected or unwanted third-party domains.
- Consider multiple page loads or sessions for more reliable data.

<Tip>
For the most accurate benchmarking, clear your browser cache and cookies before switching content blockers and reloading sites to avoid cached content influencing results.
</Tip>

## 7. Understanding the uBO-Scope Popup Interface

The popup presents summarized data for the active tab:

- **Domains connected:** Total distinct third-party domains allowed by the current blocker.

Sections:
- **Not blocked:** Domains your browser successfully connected to.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains blocked invisibly to the webpage (stealth mode).
- **Blocked:** Domains fully blocked by content blockers.

Each domain entry shows the number of network requests recorded for that domain.

<u>Example:</u>

| Category       | Domain         | Requests Count |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Not blocked    | cdn.example.com| 12             |
| Stealth-blocked| tracker.foo    | 5              |
| Blocked       | ads.badads.com | 8              |

This data helps you understand both visible and hidden blocking effects.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Comparison with uBO-Scope">
<Accordion title="No Data or NO DATA shown in popup">
- Confirm uBO-Scope is installed and enabled.
- Refresh the page after opening the popup.
- Try another website to verify if the problem is isolated.
- Ensure your browser supports the required APIs and permissions.
- See the **Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues** guide for more details.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
- Wait a few seconds after loading the webpage; uBO-Scope updates connection counts with a slight delay.
- Reload the page.
- Confirm the extension has permission to access site data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected High Allowed Domains">
- Clear browser cache and reload.
- Verify no other extensions interfere with content blocking.
- Check if stealth-blocked list is extensive, which may indicate stealth blocking in effect rather than allowance.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
