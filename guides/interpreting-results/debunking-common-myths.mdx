# Debunking Common Extension Myths with uBO Scope

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you use uBO Scope to verify claims made by content blockers and ad blocker testing websites, uncovering misleading metrics and understanding real network connection outcomes.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope must be installed in your browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- You should have at least a basic understanding of browser extensions and webRequest API permissions.
- Familiarity with the uBO Scope popup interface is helpful.

### Expected Outcome
After following this guide, you will confidently interpret uBO Scope's data to fact-check popular myths about ad blockers, recognize unreliable 'ad blocker test' sites, and gain clarity on true third-party connection visibility.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10-15 minutes to walk through key scenarios and understand practical use cases.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open uBO Scope and Visit a Website
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- Navigate to any web page you want to analyze.
- Observe the toolbar badge showing the count of distinct allowed third-party domains.

**Expected Result:** You see a number on the badge representing distinct remote servers successfully connected, and the popup lists domains categorized as 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', or 'blocked'.

### 2. Understand What the Toolbar Badge Represents
- The badge count reflects **the number of distinct third-party domains from which network connections were *allowed*** for the active tab.
- Note that this is different from mere block counts seen in other blockers.

**Decision Point:** If you compare block counts between blockers, understand that a higher block count does not always mean better privacy or blocking.

### 3. Use uBO Scope to Evaluate Blocker Claims
- When an extension claims superior blocking based on block counts, open uBO Scope and:
  - Look for the actual number of allowed third-party domains.
  - Recognize that fewer allowed third-party domains generally means stricter and more effective blocking.

**Example Scenario:** An extension X shows it blocked 200 requests, but uBO Scope reveals that you still connect to 50 unique third-party domains, while extension Y blocks fewer requests but results in 10 allowed domains.

### 4. Test the Reliability of 'Ad Blocker Test' Web Pages
- Avoid relying on external ad blocker testing websites that simulate network requests.
- These sites often generate artificial or fabricated test cases that do not represent real-world browsing.
- Many extension-based blockers use stealth techniques that such sites cannot detect or properly evaluate.

**Practical Tip:** Use uBO Scope to observe actual network connections on real websites rather than artificial tests.

### 5. Analyze the Domain Connection Categories
- In the popup, inspect the three domain status sections:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains where requests succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected stealthily (blocked quietly to avoid detection).
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed or were explicitly blocked.

**Outcome:** This clear categorization helps understand the real effectiveness of blockers.

### 6. Fact-Check Extension Metrics Against uBO Scope Data
- If an extension claims to block more than another, cross-reference with uBO Scope.
- Focus on the number of allowed third-party domains, not just blocks.

**Verification:** A blocker allowing fewer distinct domains is preferable, even if its block count is lower.

## Examples & Case Study

### Example 1: Misleading Block Count vs Allowed Domains
- Extension A shows a block badge of 500.
- Extension B shows a block badge of 300.
- uBO Scope reveals:
  - Extension A allows 100 distinct third-party domains.
  - Extension B allows only 20 distinct third-party domains.

**Insight:** Despite more blocks reported, extension A allows connections to more third-party domains, implying less effective blocking.

### Example 2: Stealth Blocking Explained
- A network request to tracker.example.com is not visible as blocked by some blockers.
- uBO Scope shows 'stealth-blocked' for tracker.example.com.

**Interpretation:** The request was silently redirected or hidden, avoiding detection by websites or some test pages.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **No data in uBO Scope popup:** Confirm extension permissions are granted (webRequest, activeTab).
- **Badge count is zero on a site with many requests:** Some network requests might occur outside browser control or after uBO Scope was disabled.
- **Discrepancies between blockers’ counts and uBO Scope:** Remember that blockers report internally while uBO Scope reports actual observed network outcomes.

### Best Practices
- Use uBO Scope regularly to monitor your active browsing sessions.
- Always verify extension claims by correlating data with uBO Scope's output.
- Avoid using synthetic ad-blocker test webpages as a benchmark.

### Performance Considerations
- uBO Scope operates passively and efficiently by listening to network events.
- Data updates in the popup occur with minimal delay.

### Alternative Approaches
- Use uBO Scope alongside other monitoring tools but rely primarily on its direct network visualization for factual verification.

## Additional Notes

<u>Remember:</u> The value of uBO Scope lies in exposing the true network activities of your browser sessions. By grounding your privacy and blocker effectiveness evaluations in this reality, you bypass misleading abstractions and get actionable clarity.
