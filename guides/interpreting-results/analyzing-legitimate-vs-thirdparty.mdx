# Analyzing Legitimate vs. Third-Party Connections

Explore how to distinguish essential, legitimate connections from unnecessary third-party tracking by leveraging uBO Scope’s real-time network connection insights. This guide transforms your browser into a powerful investigative tool, helping you understand which external servers are accessed by webpages and how to interpret their significance for privacy.

---

## 1. Understanding the Role of Connections in uBO Scope

Every webpage you visit tries to load resources — some essential, some optional, and others intrusive. uBO Scope provides transparent visibility into these network connections by reporting the outcome of each remote server connection:

- **Allowed connections**: Network requests that succeeded and are visible to the browser.
- **Blocked connections**: Requests that failed due to content blocking or errors.
- **Stealth-blocked connections**: Redirected requests or those blocked invisibly to the webpage.

The goal is not to block all third parties blindly but to identify the difference between vital, legitimate third parties (such as Content Delivery Networks/CDNs) and third-party trackers or less necessary connections.

<Tip>
The toolbar badge shows the **count of distinct third-party domains contacted**, not the number of requests or blocked items. Lower counts typically indicate better privacy.
</Tip>

## 2. Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and pinned in your compatible browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Basic familiarity with browsing and opening browser extension popups.
- Optional: Experience with content blockers to deepen understanding.

## 3. Workflow for Analyzing Connections

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel, which shows categorized domains connected by the current active browser tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret the Toolbar Badge">
Look at the badge number on the toolbar — this represents how many distinct third-party domains were contacted for this tab.

- A lower number generally means fewer third parties contacted.
- Numbers reset per tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
Inside the popup, locate the 'not blocked' section. Domains here represent servers your browser successfully connected to and are typically essential or legitimate third parties. Examples include popular CDNs or service providers.

- Recognize familiar domains like `akamai.net`, `cloudflare.net`, or your main content provider domains.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Examine the 'stealth-blocked' section, which lists domains where connections were redirected or obscured from web content.

- These domains may indicate tracking attempts that were silently blocked.
- Their presence signals the effectiveness of your content blocker or uBO Scope in revealing hidden network activity.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Blocked Domains">
Look at the 'blocked' section for domains your content blocker or DNS prevented connections to.

- These domains often include known trackers or unwanted third parties.
- Analyzing these helps validate your filter list effectiveness.
</Step>

<Step title="Distinguish First-Party vs Third-Party Domains">
Understand the difference:

- **First-party domain**: The site you are visiting.
- **Third-party domains**: External servers contacted by the page for additional content or tracking.

Usually, CDNs and analytics providers are distinct third parties but may be legitimate.
</Step>

<Step title="Use Context to Judge Legitimacy">
Use domain knowledge, reputation, and the nature of the domain to decide if the third party is essential or intrusive.

- Sites often rely on CDNs (e.g., `cloudflare.net`) for assets delivery.
- Trackers or ad servers show as unrelated commercial entities.

Form judgment based on your goals: balancing functionality with privacy.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Keep an eye on the badge count** while browsing to spot unexpected third-party domains.
- **Cross-check suspicious domains** found in your popup against known tracker or CDN lists to identify unknown third parties.
- **Combine uBO Scope insights with your content blocker** settings to fine-tune blocking rules.
- **Use the popup after visiting a page** to analyze connections dynamically instead of relying on static block lists.

<Note>
Not all third parties are bad. Many legitimate websites use services such as fonts, analytics (privacy-focused or otherwise), or payment gateways that involve external domains.
</Note>

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="No Domains Showing in Popup">
- Ensure the extension has the necessary permissions (`webRequest`, host permissions).
- Verify your browser supports `webRequest` API.
- Refresh the page/tab to trigger connection monitoring.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Seems Too High or Low">
- Remember badge counts only distinct domains, not all requests.
- Some domains may be shared or use CDNs, look carefully.
- Switch to a different content blocker and compare using uBO Scope for deeper insight.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Distinguishing Legitimate vs. Tracking Domains is Confusing">
- Use public suffix/domain lists to understand domain ownership structure.
- Compare domains against trusted CDN providers (e.g., Akamai, Cloudflare) and known trackers.
- Research unfamiliar domains online for user reports or reputation.
</Accordion>

## 6. Example Scenario: Investigating a News Website

1. Visit a popular news site and open the uBO Scope popup.
2. The badge shows '7' distinct third-party domains.
3. In 'allowed', you see domains like `cloudflare.net` and `cdn.newsprovider.com` — these are likely content delivery services.
4. The 'stealth-blocked' section shows `track.adnetwork.com` — an ad tracker silently blocked.
5. The 'blocked' section lists `analytics.badtracker.com` — blocking effective.
6. Decision: Allow legitimate CDNs for site functionality; keep blocking trackers for privacy.
