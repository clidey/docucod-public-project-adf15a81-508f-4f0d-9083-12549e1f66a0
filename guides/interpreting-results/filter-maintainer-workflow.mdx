# Filter List Maintainers: Advanced Workflows

Step-by-step guidance for filter list maintainers to utilize uBO-Scope in verifying list effectiveness, capturing nuanced network activity, and using observed data to improve and debug filter rules, especially on locked-down devices.

---

## Overview

As a filter list maintainer, your goal is to create, evaluate, and refine rules that block unwanted network requests efficiently while avoiding disruptions to legitimate web functionality. The **Filter List Maintainers: Advanced Workflows** page provides practical instructions for using uBO-Scope as a powerful companion tool to:

- Validate how your filter list performs in real-world browsing
- Detect subtle network activities including stealthy or redirected connections
- Debug filter rules using detailed network connection data
- Work effectively on devices or environments with limited direct access to developer tools

By mastering these workflows, you will enhance your ability to craft precise and reliable blocking rules.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure:

- You have uBO-Scope installed and set up successfully. See [Installing and Setting Up uBO-Scope](./install-extension).
- You understand the basic interface and how to interpret connection outcomes. Review [Understanding the Extension Interface](./understanding-extension-ui) and [Your First Analysis: Interpreting Results](./first-analysis).
- Your filter lists are active in the browser against which you want to test.

### Expected Outcomes

Following these workflows, you will:

- Confidently analyze the allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked request lists within uBO-Scope’s popup interface.
- Identify cases where filtering rules need refinement or additional rules are required.
- Detect stealth requests and understand their impact on user privacy and block efficacy.
- Use uBO-Scope to debug and verify rules even in constrained environments where browser devtools aren’t accessible.

### Time Estimate

Allocate 30-60 minutes to work through key steps for initial setup and analysis with a website, longer for complex investigations.

### Difficulty Level

Intermediate to Advanced — assumes experience with filter list rule syntax and content blocking concepts.

## Step-by-Step: Evaluating Filter Lists with uBO-Scope

### Step 1: Open uBO-Scope Popup for Target Tab

1. Navigate to the website where you want to evaluate filter list effectiveness.
2. Click the uBO-Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
3. Observe the badge count indicating the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
4. Confirm the top header shows the correct target hostname and base domain.

### Step 2: Analyze Connection Outcomes

- **Not Blocked Section**: Shows third-party domains with allowed requests.
- **Stealth-Blocked Section**: Lists requests that were stealthily redirected or modified (not fully blocked).
- **Blocked Section**: Displays domains where requests were outright blocked by filter rules.

Review the counts next to each domain indicating the number of requests made.

### Step 3: Identify Anomalies and Verify Rule Impact

1. Look for unexpected allowed connections that might indicate gaps or misconfigurations in your filter list.
2. Investigate stealth-blocked domains — these often represent redirects or requests hidden from normal blocking mechanisms.
3. Use domain counts to prioritize high-frequency connections for rule adjustments.

### Step 4: Refine and Test Filter Rules

- Modify your filter list rules based on observed allowed or stealth connections.
- Reload the target website and repeat the analysis in uBO-Scope to verify effects.
- Use consistent browsing sessions in locked-down environments to collect reproducible data.

<Tip>
When testing on locked-down devices where standard devtools aren’t available, rely on the detailed domain counts and outcome categories in uBO-Scope to guide rule tuning.
</Tip>

## Advanced Investigation Techniques

### Using Domain Counts as a Heuristic

- Sort domains by request frequency to focus on troublesome or costly connections.
- Domains with high stealth-block counts may suggest resources evading full blocking and require specialized rules.

### Cross-Referencing with Filter List Syntax

- Check how domains correspond to your filter list entries.
- For ambiguous domains, consider adding exception rules or refine regular expressions.

### Debugging Filter Behavior

- Watch for domains that frequently appear in both allowed and stealth-blocked sections.
- Inspect the source hostname in webRequest logs (if accessible) for root cause analysis.

### Handling Redirects and Stealth Connections

- Understand that stealth-blocked entries capture redirects intercepted by uBO-Scope.
- Adjust your filter list to target redirect chains preventing unwanted connections effectively.

<Warning>
Stealth blocking is subtle and can lead to false negatives if not analyzed carefully. Confirm changes with repeated tests.
</Warning>

## Best Practices for Filter Maintainers

- Regularly test filter performance using uBO-Scope on multiple sites, including privacy-sensitive and popular web services.
- Employ incremental testing: add rules in small batches and verify their effect with uBO-Scope.
- Use the domain counts as a guide but do not solely rely on them; verify with actual network traces or behaviour.
- Collaborate with the community referencing observed domains and behaviors to optimize rule sets.

<Note>
Keep your public suffix list updated within uBO-Scope by restarting or ensuring internet access, as domain parsing accuracy depends on it.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### uBO-Scope Popup Shows No Data

- Verify that the target tab is active and has page content loaded.
- Ensure uBO-Scope has the required permissions (`webRequest`, activeTab).
- Try reloading the page or restarting the browser.

### Domain Counts Do Not Update

- The extension batch-processes requests every second; wait briefly.
- Some network requests outside `webRequest` API visibility cannot be tracked.

### Unexpected Allowed Connections

- Check for proxy, VPN, or undocumented bypass mechanisms.
- Use uBO-Scope alongside other tools (like browser devtools if possible) for validation.

### Working on Locked-Down Devices

- If inspecting devtools is impossible, rely heavily on uBO-Scope’s domain lists and counts.
- Automate usage via scripts externally if necessary, leveraging uBO-Scope’s data storage.
