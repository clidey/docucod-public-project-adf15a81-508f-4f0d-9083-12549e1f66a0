# Practical Use for Filter List Maintainers

uBO Scope is a powerful yet lightweight browser extension designed not only for privacy-conscious users but also as a crucial tool for filter list maintainers and privacy advocates. This guide focuses specifically on how maintainers can leverage uBO Scope to audit third-party connections on webpages, especially when advanced browser developer tools are unavailable or limited.

---

## 1. Introduction

### What This Guide Covers
This guide demonstrates practical workflows and techniques for filter list maintainers to use uBO Scope’s reporting capabilities to monitor and analyze third-party network connections. It emphasizes usability on all devices—including those that lack advanced browser developer tools—empowering maintainers to audit and refine filter lists effectively.

### Why uBO Scope Helps Filter List Maintainers
Maintaining filter lists requires understanding which third-party domains a webpage contacts, including those that may evade detection or appear stealth-blocked. uBO Scope provides a clear view of connection outcomes and server domains per active browser tab, thus helping:

- Identify unexpected or undisclosed third-party connections.
- Verify blocking rules in effect and detect stealth-blocking behaviors.
- Understand the scope of allowed versus blocked network calls.

This insight can be particularly invaluable in environments where browser consoles or developer tools are restricted or unavailable, such as on mobile devices or locked-down systems.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before using uBO Scope effectively as a filter list maintainer, ensure the following:

- **uBO Scope is installed and enabled** on a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) with the necessary permissions granted.
- You have basic familiarity with your browser’s extension interface and can access the uBO Scope popup.
- You understand core terms such as **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** domains (see related glossary).

For installation and setup, consult the [Installation Instructions](https://your-doc-site/guides/getting-started-essentials/install-and-setup) and [Basic Configuration](https://your-doc-site/getting-started/installation-and-setup/basic-configuration) guides.

## 3. Understanding the uBO Scope Popup for Audits

The uBO Scope popup aggregates network connection data by domain for the active tab:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains from which connections succeeded without blockage.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connection attempts were silently redirected or stealth-blocked.
- **Blocked**: Domains where connections were explicitly blocked by the browser’s content blocking mechanisms.

Maintainers should scrutinize these three lists to detect behavioral patterns and confirm filter list effectiveness.

<Tip>
The badge count on the browser toolbar icon represents the number of unique third-party domains successfully connected to during the page session. A lower number generally indicates better privacy but requires contextual interpretation.
</Tip>

## 4. Step-by-Step Workflow: Auditing Third-Party Connections with uBO Scope

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
- Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
- Wait briefly for the popup to load current tab connection data.
- Observe the top hostname indicator — this represents the site currently audited.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Domain Categories">
- Examine the "not blocked" domains to identify third-party servers contacted and allowed.
- Check the "stealth-blocked" domain list for connections bypassing visible blocking.
- Look at "blocked" to see domains your filters or blockers successfully prevented.
</Step>

<Step title="Analyze Domain Counts and Patterns">
- Each domain listed includes a count badge representing the number of connection events observed.
- Use this to prioritize domains with high connection attempts for further filter list testing or improvement.
</Step>

<Step title="Take Notes for Filter List Updates">
- Document unexpected or suspicious domains that require blocking or monitoring.
- Confirm domains flagged as stealth-blocked to address potential bypasses.
- Validate that essential domains remain allowed to avoid site breakage.
</Step>

<Step title="Repeat for Other Tabs and Pages">
- Switch tabs and repeat steps to accumulate comprehensive connection profiles.
- Use this data to compare behaviors across related sites or versions.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Leverage uBO Scope on mobile or restricted environments** where developer tools are missing; the popup reflects real-time tab-specific connection outcomes.
- **Regularly update your filter lists** with insights gained from stealth-blocked and blocked domain data.
- **Combine findings with other tools**: While uBO Scope offers domain connection counts and status, complement analysis with DNS-level and host file inspections for deeper coverage.
- **Interpret badge counts carefully**: Higher block counts do not imply better blocking; focus on unique third-party domains contacted.

<Warning>
Stealth-blocked domains represent connection attempts not fully visible through conventional block counters. Ignoring them risks leaving filter lists incomplete.
</Warning>

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Incomplete Information">
- Verify uBO Scope has permissions to monitor web requests.
- Reload the page to generate fresh network activity.
- Confirm you are viewing an active browser tab with network connections.
- Check that the browser is supported and meets minimum version requirements.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Toolbar Badge Count Is Not Updating">
- Badge updates upon network events; try reloading tabs.
- Ensure no interference from other privacy or content blocker extensions.
- Review browser permissions for webRequest API.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Domains Appear Unexpected or Malicious">
- Cross-reference domains against reliable filter lists and known trackers databases.
- Use domain public suffix knowledge to understand ownership hierarchy.
- Report or submit new findings to filter list maintainers or upstream projects.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Advanced Workflows

As uBO Scope evolves, future versions will add detailed network request attributes to aid maintainers. For now, maintainers can:

- Export connection data for offline analysis (by copying from popup views).
- Use observed domain counts to strategize filter rules targeting patterns of allowed domains.
- Audit stealth-blocked domains to detect trends in circumvented blocking.

Stay tuned to the official repository for updates: [uBO-Scope on GitHub](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).

## 9. Appendix: Example Scenario

**Scenario:** A filter list maintainer suspects a webpage loads resources from unlisted third-party servers that evade blocking rules.

**Workflow:**

1. Open the target webpage.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon.
3. Review the popup domain lists, paying special attention to "stealth-blocked".
4. Note domains with frequent connections.
5. Test filter rules to block those domains, then reload the page and observe the updated popup results.
6. Confirm that allowed domains match expected legitimate assets.

This iterative process accelerates identifying connections for list refinement.

<Tip>
Use the uBO Scope popup as a quick and accessible auditing tool without needing full browser developer tools, allowing flexible maintenance across devices.
