# Understanding the Badge Count and What It Means

## Overview

The badge count displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon represents the total number of distinct third-party domains your current browser tab has connected to successfully. This metric provides immediate insight into the volume of external connections initiated by the webpage you are viewing.

A key principle: **fewer third-party remote servers generally means better privacy and security.** This guide explains why that is the case, clarifies common misinterpretations of block counts, and shows how the badge count ties into real-world network behavior.

## Why the Badge Count Matters

When you load any webpage, it often requests resources from numerous external servers—ads, analytics, content delivery networks (CDNs), widgets, and more. Not all third-party connections are harmful or unwanted, but many can track your activity or expose you to security risks.

uBO Scope reveals these connections by counting the number of **unique remote domains** contacted, regardless of whether requests are allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked by content blockers.

### Key Points About the Badge Count

- The badge *only displays the count of allowed domains*, meaning domains where network connections were successful.
- It **does not** count individual requests or the total number of blocked requests.
- A **low badge count** typically indicates fewer unique third-party connections, often signaling a cleaner, more private browsing experience.
- A **high badge count** suggests many third-party connections, which can be a privacy or security concern.

<Tip>
Remember, uBO Scope focuses on **distinct domains**, not raw request totals. This approach provides a meaningful summary of where your data actually goes.

## Understanding Third-Party Domains

### What Counts as a Third-Party Domain?

- Third-party domains are external to the website's primary domain.
- Examples:
  - If visiting example.com loads images or scripts from cdn.example-cdn.net or ads.otherdomain.com, these count as third-party domains.

### Why Fewer Third-Party Domains Are Better

- Each external domain represents a potential data-sharing or tracking source.
- Some domains serve essential purposes (like common CDNs), but many others deliver ads or track behavior.
- Reducing third-party connections helps minimize your digital footprint and exposure.

## Misleading Notions About Block Counts vs. Badge Count

Users often misunderstand content blocker metrics, especially when comparing block counts across different blockers or assuming block count correlates directly with privacy benefit.

### Myth 1: "More blocks mean better privacy"

- A blocker might show a high block count but still allow many different third-party domains to load resources, leading to higher risk.
- Conversely, a blocker with a lower block count but fewer third-party connections (lower badge count) might be more privacy-effective.

### Myth 2: "Ad blocker test pages accurately reflect real blocking"

- Test pages use artificial or fabricated requests that do not represent real-world browsing.
- Blockers use stealth techniques to avoid breaking pages or revealing blocking behavior that tests rely on.
- uBO Scope counts actual network connections in real websites, giving a truthful picture.

<Warning>
Never rely solely on "block count" badges or test pages to evaluate your content blocker’s effectiveness. Focus on the distinct third-party domains allowed, as shown by uBO Scope’s badge count.
</Warning>

## How uBO Scope Measures and Displays Connections

1. **Network Requests Monitoring:**
   - uBO Scope listens to your browser’s `webRequest` API events to observe network requests made by pages.
   - Each request is categorized as **allowed**, **stealth**, or **blocked**.

2. **Domain Resolution:**
   - Hostnames are parsed to extract domains using the Public Suffix List for accuracy.

3. **Outcome Aggregation:**
   - For each tab, uBO Scope stores all unique domains linked with each outcome category.

4. **Badge Update:**
   - The toolbar icon badge displays the count of **allowed domains** (distinct third-party servers successfully connected).

5. **Popup Display:**
   - Expanding the extension popup shows domains grouped by allowed, stealth-blocked, and explicitly blocked.

---

## Practical Implications for Users

- **Use the badge count as a quick privacy health indicator.** Seeing a sudden spike may indicate a page is loading many third-party resources.
- **Check the popup details** to understand which domains are connected and their connection outcomes.
- **A lower badge count aligns with fewer distinct remote servers contacted, reducing tracking and potential threats.**

---

## Best Practices

- Regularly monitor the badge count during browsing sessions of privacy-critical websites.
- Investigate pages with unexpectedly high counts to assess risk.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with your preferred content blocker to optimize privacy strategies.
- Beware of overvaluing block counts or test page outcomes—trust actual connection data.

## Troubleshooting Common Badge-Count Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues">
<Accordion title="Why is my badge count zero on some pages?">
If a page does not initiate any third-party network requests, or if connections are prevented outside the `webRequest` API visibility, the badge count may be zero. Some sites are self-contained or use in-browser data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count not match my content blocker’s block count?">
Badge count represents unique allowed domains, not blocked requests. A content blocker may block many requests but still allow multiple domains, or vice versa, so numbers differ.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why does the count on the badge change dynamically while browsing?">
The badge updates as network activity changes per tab, reflecting host connections as pages load or navigate.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does stealth-blocked mean, and why isn’t it counted on the badge?">
Stealth blocking means the request outcome was hidden or altered to avoid webpage breakage. These connections are not counted as allowed domains to keep the badge focused on actual successful connections.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

The badge count on the uBO Scope icon is your dashboard’s most valuable privacy signal: the fewer distinct third-party domains allowed, the cleaner and safer your browsing. Always prioritize this over raw block counts to make informed privacy decisions.
