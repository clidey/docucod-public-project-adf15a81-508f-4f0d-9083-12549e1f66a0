# Understanding the Badge Count and Popup Panel

## Overview

This guide explains how uBO Scope calculates and displays the badge count on the browser toolbar and presents detailed domain connection information within the popup panel. You will learn how to interpret the distinct third-party server count, understand the meaning behind allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections, and gain confidence in reading the extension's real-time network exposure data.

---

## What This Guide Helps You Achieve

- Recognize what the badge count represents and why it matters.
- Explore the popup panel to view domains categorized by connection outcome.
- Understand the significance of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked statuses per domain.

---

## Prerequisites

Before working with this guide:

- Ensure uBO Scope is installed and activated in your browser. Refer to the [Installing uBO Scope](../../getting-started/installation-overview/browser-installation) guide.
- Familiarize yourself with basic network request concepts and third-party connections as explained in [Understanding Network Connections](../../overview/core-concepts/network-connection-types).
- Know how to access the extension popup by clicking the toolbar icon.

---

## Time Estimate

Approximately 5-10 minutes to review and explore the badge and popup panel with real-world browsing.

## Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate

# Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Understanding the Badge Count

- The badge text shown on the uBO Scope toolbar icon indicates the **number of distinct third-party domains** from which there was at least one successful connection in the active browser tab.
- This count excludes duplicates and focuses specifically on **third-party remote servers**, not first-party domains.
- The badge is updated dynamically as you navigate or load new pages.

#### What to expect:

- When you open a new tab and navigate to a website, the badge will display a number representing how many third-party domains connected.
- If the badge is blank or zero, no third-party connections were detected.


### 2. Accessing the Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- The panel header displays the current tab's hostname and its base domain, helping you contextualize the connection data.
- Below the header, the "domains connected" summary shows the total count of unique third-party domains observed.

### 3. Reading Domain Lists by Connection Outcome

The popup panel categorizes domains into three outcomes:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains where network requests succeeded and content was delivered.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where requests were redirected or stealthily blocked by content blockers or network controls. These connections were prevented in a way that might not be detectable by the site.
- **Blocked**: Domains where requests resulted in errors or explicit blocking.

Each category lists domains along with a count representing the number of requests made to that domain.


### 4. Interpreting Counts and Details

- The domain counts show how many times requests were made to each domain under each outcome category.
- Higher counts can indicate multiple resources or repeated requests to the same server.


### 5. Verifying the Data Matches Real Network Activity

- To validate data accuracy, open the popup panel on a site you know performs third-party tracking or content delivery (like a news website).
- Confirm the badge count roughly corresponds with the number of distinct third-party domains listed.


---

# Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Lower badge counts are generally better for privacy**, indicating fewer third-party connections.
- However, low counts may include important services such as content delivery networks (CDNs) necessary for site function.
- Use the domain lists in the popup to audit and recognize unexpected third parties.
- Remember stealth-blocked list helps identify connections that were silently blocked, providing a fuller picture of blocking effectiveness.

---

# Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Misinterpreting blocked request counts** as badge counts. The badge counts distinct domains, not individual blocked requests.
- Confusing first-party domains with third-party domains. The badge and popup focus on third-party remote servers.
- Expecting the popup to list every single network request; it aggregates by domain for meaningful overview.

---

# Troubleshooting

- If the badge count doesn't update or appears stuck:
  - Confirm uBO Scope is enabled for the site and in your browser.
  - Refresh the page to trigger new network monitoring.
  - Check for errors or limitations in the browserâ€™s extension platform.

- If no domains appear in the popup:
  - The page might not have loaded fully or issued network requests.
  - There may be browser privacy settings interfering with webRequest API reporting.

Refer also to [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../../getting-started/initial-usage-validation/common-setup-issues) for more guidance.

# Example Scenario

Imagine visiting https://example-news-site.com:

- The badge shows "5", indicating five unique third-party domains connected.
- Opening the popup reveals:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** cdn.example.com (10 requests), analytics-provider.net (5 requests)
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** tracker.surveillance.com (3 requests)
  - **Blocked:** ads.network.com (7 requests)

This insight tells you that despite some blocking, the browser made legitimate connections to five distinct domains relevant to the page content and some were blocked or stealth-blocked.

# Summary

Understanding the badge count and popup panel is fundamental to leveraging uBO Scope effectively. The badge offers quick insight at a glance into your third-party network exposure, while the popup panel provides detailed domain-level context, allowing you to audit and assess your browsing privacy with clarity.

# Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Asked Questions">
<Accordion title="What exactly does the badge count represent?">
The badge count shows the number of distinct third-party domains with successful or allowed network connections in the current browser tab. It helps quickly assess how many unique external servers your page connected to.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why are some domains under 'stealth-blocked'?"><p>Stealth-blocked refers to requests that were redirected or blocked in a way that is not apparent to the webpage itself, usually by content blockers working behind the scenes. These domains attempted to connect but were silently disrupted.</p></Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can the badge count be zero on a site I visit?">
Yes, if the site makes no third-party connections or all connections are blocked before network communication, the count may be zero, indicating strong privacy protections or a purely first-party content page.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is a higher badge count always worse?">
Not necessarily. A higher count means more third-party domains were contacted, which may indicate higher privacy exposure. However, some third-parties are essential (e.g., CDNs), so consider the context before drawing conclusions.
