# Best Practices for Privacy and Performance

## Overview
This guide helps uBO Scope users understand how to effectively reduce and interpret third-party remote server connections in their browser. It provides actionable advice on managing connections, leveraging uBO Scope alongside other privacy tools or filter lists, and cautioning filter maintainers on common pitfalls. By following this guide, users will optimize their browsing privacy and minimize unnecessary network exposures without unrealistic expectations.

## 1. Understanding Third-Party Connections

Third-party connections occur when a webpage loading in your browser communicates with remote servers different from the page's main domain. These connections often include content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics services, advertising networks, and tracking servers.

### Why Reducing Third-Party Connections Matters
- **Privacy Protection**: Fewer third-party contacts mean fewer entities potentially tracking your online behavior.
- **Performance Improvement**: Less network overhead reduces page load times and bandwidth usage.
- **Security Enhancement**: Minimizing connections lowers exposure to malicious or vulnerable external servers.

<u>uBO Scope's primary metric—the badge count—reflects the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to, helping you measure your exposure objectively.</u>

## 2. Practical Steps to Reduce Third-Party Connections

<Steps>
<Step title="Review Your uBO Scope Badge">
Observe the count on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon after browsing a site. A lower count is better—it means fewer distinct third-party connections.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the Popup Panel for Details">
Click the toolbar icon to open the popup. The panel categorizes third-party domains as Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked. Use this to identify which domains are communicating with your browser.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify Legitimate Third Parties">
Recognize which third-party domains are legitimate (e.g., major CDNs, essential services) vs. unnecessary trackers. Legitimate domains usually appear under the Allowed or Stealth-Blocked sections with low counts.
</Step>

<Step title="Adjust Content Blocker Settings Accordingly">
If you use uBlock Origin or similar content blockers, tune your filter lists focusing on:
- Blocking known trackers and ad networks
- Whitelisting essential third parties to avoid breakage

Use uBO Scope data to verify the impact without relying solely on block counts.
</Step>

<Step title="Leverage uBO Scope with Other Privacy Tools">
Use uBO Scope alongside privacy-enhancing tools like VPNs, DNS blockers, or browser privacy modes to get a holistic view of your exposure. Note that uBO Scope measures actual network outcomes regardless of upstream blocking.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Interpreting Which Remote Servers Matter

Not all third-party servers are equally important. Here's how to interpret them:

| Category           | Meaning & Action                                                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Allowed**        | Domains your browser successfully connected to. Review for necessity. |
| **Stealth-Blocked**| Requests redirected or blocked stealthily by content blockers. Usually beneficial blocking. |
| **Blocked**        | Requests denied, often by uBO or network filters. Enables assessment of filter effectiveness. |

### Tips:
- Focus on domains with high request counts; they have more impact.
- Distinguish between first-party essential services vs. third-party trackers.
- Beware that some stealth-blocked domains may still leak metadata.

## 4. Leveraging uBO Scope with uBlock Origin and Filter Lists

<u>uBO Scope is an observation tool, not a blocking tool.</u> It monitors network outcomes and does not in itself block connections.

### Best Practices:
- Use uBO Scope data to verify and compare the effectiveness of your filter lists.
- Avoid expecting uBO Scope's counts to reflect block list quality alone, since it reports actual network behavior.
- Filter maintainers should analyze patterns of allowed and stealth-blocked domains to refine rules.

### Common Pitfalls for Filter Maintainers:
- Assuming a high block count equals better privacy; it may indicate more trackers getting fetched.
- Misinterpreting stealth-blocked entries as allowed activity—they represent successful blocking.
- Overblocking legitimate essential third-party servers, causing site breakage.

## 5. Additional Privacy and Performance Tips

- **Reduce unnecessary extensions**: Too many extensions may increase third-party connections.
- **Use stricter filter lists with caution**: Always cross-check with uBO Scope to avoid overblocking.
- **Refresh sessions frequently**: Close tabs or reload to clear stale tab data in uBO Scope.
- **Combine with browser privacy features**: Enable tracking prevention features and secure DNS.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Third-Party Connection Monitoring">
<Accordion title="High Badge Count Despite Using Filters">
- Verify your content blocker is active and configured correctly.
- Check if the site uses new or obscure third-party domains.
- Use uBO Scope to pinpoint which domains raise the count.
- Consider adding custom filters for unrecognized trackers.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup Panel Shows No Data or 'NO DATA'">
- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled and permitted in your browser.
- Try reloading the page and opening the popup again.
- Check browser compatibility with the extension’s required permissions.
- Review related installation and troubleshooting guides.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="False Expectations from uBO Scope Data">
- Remember uBO Scope does not block connections—it reports observed requests.
- Use block counts and connection data as complementary, not decisive, privacy indicators.
- Avoid comparing block counts from different blockers without considering actual third-party connections.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Summary

Achieving better privacy and performance through reduced third-party connections is a balancing act that requires understanding which remote servers truly matter. uBO Scope empowers you to observe your browser’s network connections transparently, helping you refine your content blocker configuration and leverage privacy tools effectively. Always align your expectations with uBO Scope’s role as a measurement companion, and avoid relying on misguided block-count comparisons.
