# Workflows for Filter List Maintainers

uBO Scope offers powerful insights for filter list maintainers and advanced users who need to audit, verify, and improve content blocking rules. This guide walks through practical workflows to harness uBO Scope’s domain connection data, enabling you to identify missed connections, verify stealth blocking efficiency, and understand how devices with limited browser tooling are protected.

---

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps filter list maintainers leverage uBO Scope to audit network connection outcomes for web pages, focusing on detecting third-party connections that bypass filters, analyzing stealth block effectiveness, and assessing protection levels on browsers or devices with constrained developer tools.

### Prerequisites
- Install uBO Scope in a supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with content blocking concepts and filter lists.
- Access to the uBO Scope popup UI.

### Expected Outcome
- You will confidently interpret allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domain lists.
- Identify overlooked connections missed by current filters.
- Confirm stealth blocking is active and effective.
- Assess overall network connection hygiene for given browsing sessions.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15–30 minutes to perform initial audit workflows; deeper analysis may take longer depending on scope.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate — assumes understanding of content blocking and domain relationships.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open uBO Scope Popup on Active Tab
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- Observe the main heading showing the current page’s hostname and domain.
- Check the "domains connected" count in the summary area.

**Expected Result:** Popup displays three domain sections: not blocked (allowed), stealth-blocked, and blocked.

### 2. Review Allowed Domains
- Scan the “not blocked” section for third-party domains where connections succeeded.
- Identify any unexpected or suspicious domains that could indicate missed filters.

**Tip:** Legitimate CDNs or required service domains usually appear here; unexpected domains might require filter updates.

### 3. Analyze Stealth-Blocked Domains
- Examine the “stealth-blocked” section for domains where requests were stealthily blocked.
- Stealth blocking means requests were silently prevented without making connection visible.

**Expected Result:** Presence of stealth-blocked domains means filter lists and blockers are working subtly.

**Decision Point:** If this list is empty but you expect stealth blocking (due to your rules), verify filter effectiveness or uBO Scope settings.

### 4. Check Blocked Domains
- Review the “blocked” section showing domains that connection attempts failed visibly.
- These appear when network requests are rejected or fail due to blocking.

**Tip:** Consider whether any blocked domains need whitelist exceptions or if new rules should be added here.

### 5. Cross-Reference with Filter Lists
- Compare the domain lists from uBO Scope with domains covered by your filter lists.
- Identify allowed domains that should be blocked to improve privacy and efficiency.

### 6. Record and Investigate Anomalies
- For domains appearing unexpectedly in allowed or stealth-blocked categories, document them.
- Use browser developer tools (if available) and external DNS or WHOIS lookups to understand their function.

### 7. Iterate Filter List Updates
- Use findings to refine your filter lists.
- Deploy new filters and revisit uBO Scope to confirm improvements.

### 8. Monitor Badge Counts Over Time
- Use the toolbar badge count on the uBO Scope icon as a real-time indicator of third-party connections.
- A decreasing count after filter enhancements indicates successful blocking.

## Real-World Example

Imagine you maintain a filter list for privacy-focused users. After visiting a news site:

- The popup shows 20 allowed third-party domains, 3 stealth-blocked, and 5 blocked.
- You notice that some social media tracking domains are in the allowed list.
- You add rules to your filter list to block these domains.
- Reload the page and recheck uBO Scope; allowed domains drop to 15, stealth-blocked rise to 7.
- This confirms stealth blocking is catching additional requests not previously visible.

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **No data shown in popup:** Ensure permissions granted; reload the page or restart browser.
- **Badge count does not update:** Confirm uBO Scope runs in the correct tab; some network requests might be out of uBO Scope's scope if webRequest API limitations exist.
- **Unexpected empty stealth-blocked section:** Your content blocker or filter list may not support stealth blocking fully.

### Best Practices
- Regularly audit domains on popular high-traffic websites.
- Use public suffix and hostname awareness to properly group connected domains.
- Compare uBO Scope data with browser network panels for deeper validation.

### Performance Considerations
- uBO Scope processes network requests asynchronously to avoid browser performance hits.
- Heavy usage testing multiple tabs may introduce delay; wait briefly for badge updates.

### Alternative Approaches
- Use uBO Scope alongside other privacy auditing tools to triangulate findings.
- For platforms with limited tools, rely on uBO Scope to reveal connections invisible elsewhere.
