# Real-World Examples: Common Scenarios

Explore practical use cases that demonstrate how uBO Scope provides clear, actionable insights into website network behavior. This guide presents scenarios designed to help you audit popular websites, identify unnecessary trackers, and compare different content blocking approaches while debunking common misconceptions.

---

## Workflow Overview

- **Task Description:** Learn how to use uBO Scope to analyze real-world websites, spot unneeded third-party trackers, and test the impact of various content blockers.
- **Prerequisites:** 
  - uBO Scope is installed and active in your Chrome, Firefox, or Safari browser.
  - Basic familiarity with the uBO Scope popup panel and toolbar badge (refer to [Reading the Popup Panel Data](guides/interpreting-results/reading-popup)).
  - Access to websites for auditing.
- **Expected Outcome:** Gain confidence in interpreting uBO Scope data to distinguish between essential and unnecessary remote connections, validate content blocker effectiveness, and identify deceptive or stealthy network activity.
- **Time Estimate:** Approximately 15-30 minutes per scenario.
- **Difficulty Level:** Intermediate, suitable for privacy-conscious users and security enthusiasts.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Scenario 1: Auditing a Popular News Website

1. **Open the website in a browser with uBO Scope enabled.**

2. **Observe the toolbar badge:** Note the number indicating distinct third-party domains connected.

3. **Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.**

4. **Examine the 'not blocked' section:** Identify legitimate CDNs and necessary services (e.g., static content delivery).

5. **Check the 'stealth-blocked' and 'blocked' sections:** Look for trackers or ads prevented from loading.

6. **Assess if any trackers remain allowed:** 
  - Consider if they are truly essential or candidates for blocking.
  - Research any unfamiliar domains using external tools if needed.

7. **Take action as appropriate:** Adjust your content blocker or filter lists outside uBO Scope to further limit unwanted connections.

#### Expected Result:
- Understanding of the true network footprint of the site including which third parties are successfully connected versus blocked or stealth-blocked.

---

### Scenario 2: Comparing Effects of Different Content Blockers

1. **Enable uBO Scope alongside your current content blocker (e.g., uBlock Origin, AdGuard).**

2. **Visit a high-traffic website known for having many trackers.

3. **Record the badge count and the popup panel details.

4. **Disable your current content blocker.

5. **Enable an alternative content blocker and repeat steps 2-3.

6. **Compare the badge counts and popup panel breakdowns for both setups.**
  - Pay attention not just to *block counts,* but to how many distinct third-party domains remain allowed.

7. **Decide which content blocker better aligns with your privacy goals by focusing on the count and identity of allowed remote servers.**

#### Expected Result:
- Accurate comparison of content blockers based on the number of distinct remote servers your browser connects to, not just the block count.

---

### Scenario 3: Debunking the 'Ad-Block Test' Myth

1. **Navigate to a popular 'ad block test' webpage while uBO Scope is active.

2. **Note the outcomes reported by the test page.**

3. **Cross-reference with uBO Scope’s popup panel.

4. **Understand why these tests often give misleading impressions:**
  - Test pages may make artificial requests that do not appear in real browsing scenarios.
  - Content blockers often operate stealthily, preventing these tests from detecting blocks.

5. **Use uBO Scope’s real-time network request data as a more reliable indicator instead of relying on test webpages.

#### Expected Result:
- Clear recognition that ad-block test pages are poor indicators of real content blocker effectiveness, and a trustworthy alternative via uBO Scope insights.

## Examples & Illustrations

### Example: Understanding Domain Count in the Popup Panel

Suppose you open a website, and the badge displays ‘15’. Clicking the toolbar icon, you see:

- **Not blocked (allowed):** 7 domains, representing essential services like content delivery networks and APIs.
- **Stealth-blocked:** 5 domains, possibly trackers silently redirected or blocked without webpage knowledge.
- **Blocked:** 3 domains, clearly prevented by your content blocker.

This breakdown helps you see that while more domains may be blocked or stealth-blocked, your browser still connects to 7 distinct third-party domains that the site depends on — a crucial insight into real network activity.

### Practical Tip:
Always focus on the **allowed** domains in the popup panel to understand your true exposure footprint, not just the blocked ones.

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Popup panel shows NO DATA or no domain list:**
  - Make sure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (`webRequest` and host permissions).
  - Verify extension is active and monitoring the current tab.
  - Reload the webpage and then open the popup.

- **Badge count does not update consistently:**
  - Network requests can delay; wait a few seconds for updates.
  - Certain network requests outside browser API scope might not be captured.

- **Unexpected allowed domains:**
  - Some third parties are legitimate (e.g., CDN providers).
  - Look up the domain to decide if it should be blocked via filters.

### Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blocker for layered insights.
- Regularly audit your frequently visited websites to track changes in third-party connections.
- Avoid relying on block counts alone to measure privacy or content blocker strength.

### Performance Considerations

- uBO Scope listens to many network events; however, it efficiently batches updates to avoid slowing down browsing.
- Keep your browser and extension updated for optimal performance.

### Alternative Approaches

- Use uBO Scope data to inform adjustments in your main content blocker’s filter lists.
- For advanced users, consider combining uBO Scope with network analyzers or privacy-focused browsers for deeper privacy auditing.

<u>By following these scenarios with uBO Scope, you empower yourself with an authoritative toolset to audit, interpret, and improve your browser privacy setup decisively.</u>


<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions & Myths">
<Accordion title="Why is a lower badge count better?">
The badge count represents the number of distinct third-party domains your browser has successfully connected to. A lower count means fewer external connections, which usually translates to better privacy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I trust 'ad blocker test' web pages to assess blocker effectiveness?">
No. These test pages are often unrealistic and unable to detect stealthy blocking mechanisms used by modern content blockers. uBO Scope provides a more reliable real-time view.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do stealth-blocked domains show up here?">
Stealth-blocked connections are those network requests that were blocked without the originating webpage being able to detect it, often to prevent webpage breakage or detection of blocking.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
Understanding these practical scenarios lets you wield uBO Scope not just as a monitoring extension, but as a powerful privacy auditing instrument tailored to your real browsing behavior.
