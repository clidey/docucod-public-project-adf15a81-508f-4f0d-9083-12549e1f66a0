# Interpreting Results: Myths, Pitfalls, and Best Practices

## Overview

This guide clarifies common misconceptions and best practices for interpreting uBO Scope results effectively. It emphasizes understanding what the badge counts represent, why comparisons between different blockers can be misleading, and the dangers of relying on online ad-blocker test pages. Most importantly, it helps you use uBO Scope as an objective tool to evaluate your privacy exposure and the effectiveness of filter lists.

## 1. Understanding Badge Counts and Their Limitations

### What the Badge Count Represents

- The toolbar badge shows **the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted** while browsing the active tab.
- A **lower count is better**, indicating fewer unique third parties connected.
- The count is an objective metric reflecting actual network connections rather than raw block counts.

### Why Badge Count Comparisons Are Misleading

- **Block counts do NOT directly equate to better blocking.** A higher block count does not mean you are more protected.
- Extensions with high block counts can still allow more distinct connections because they block many requests from more servers but allow connection to even more servers overall.
- The badge counts distinct third-party servers that were connected, which matters for real privacy exposure, **not** the number of blocked requests.

### Real Scenario

Imagine two blockers:

- Blocker A reports 50 blocked requests but allows connections to 100 distinct servers.
- Blocker B blocks only 20 requests but allows connections to 40 distinct servers.

uBO Scope’s badge count would show a **higher number for Blocker A**, meaning greater real network exposure despite the higher block count. This inversion is why badge counts should be trusted over block counts for privacy evaluation.

## 2. Avoiding Trust in Online "Ad Blocker Test" Pages

### Why These Test Pages Are Unreliable

- Many extension blockers operate stealthily, manipulating network requests in ways that test pages cannot detect.
- These pages trigger **fabricated network requests** that real-world websites don’t use.
- Their tests do not reflect actual blocking performance in everyday browsing.

### Risks of Relying on These Tests

- False positives: test pages might flag a blocker as ineffective due to stealth blocking.
- False confidence: passing these tests doesn’t guarantee real-world effectiveness.

### Best Practice

Use uBO Scope instead to observe **real network connections and their outcomes** during actual browsing sessions, rather than relying on contrived test websites.

## 3. Best Practices for Using uBO Scope

### Use uBO Scope as an Objective Privacy Tool

- Treat its badge count as a direct signal of your exposure to third-party domains.
- Review the popup panel to see which domains were allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked.
- Understand the split between domains and network requests for accurate interpretation.

### Regularly Monitor and Compare Real-World Results

- Perform your own tests by visiting commonly used websites or trusted pages.
- Look for unexpected third-party domains or unexpectedly high domain counts.
- Use the domain lists in the popup to identify domains you want to block or investigate.

### Avoid False Judgments Based on Raw Numbers

- A low block count with a low badge count usually indicates good filter list effectiveness.
- Beware of discrepancies where block counts and badge counts do not align.

### Recommended Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup Panel">
Check the badge count in the toolbar badge then click the uBO Scope icon to open the detailed popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Domain Counts">
- Review the **Allowed** domains list - these are third parties your browser connected to.
- Review the **Stealth-Blocked** domains - connections internally blocked or redirected stealthily.
- Review the **Blocked** domains - requests outright blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare Across Browsing Sessions">
Check counts before and after enabling/disabling certain content blockers or filter lists to see real impact.
</Step>
<Step title="Look for Anomalies or Unexpected Domains">
If unknown domains appear often, investigate and decide whether to block them or whitelist.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

<AccordionGroup title="Common Pitfalls Using uBO Scope Results">
<Accordion title="Comparing Badge Counts Without Context">
Even with a low badge count, if you visit different websites or use different browsing patterns, the results vary. Ensure you compare under similar browsing conditions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Relying Solely on Block Counts">
Block counts are often misleading; many network requests from multiple distinct servers can be blocked multiple times but do not reflect fewer third-party connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Misinterpreting Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Stealth-blocking is subtle but important. It includes redirects or filtered requests not visible to the public web page. Don't ignore or discount these domains; they represent partial protection.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Trusting Results From Fake Ad-Blocker Tests">
Avoid using online test pages to judge effectiveness. Instead, analyze real browsing results with uBO Scope.
</Accordion>

## 5. Tips for Effective Use

- **Use uBO Scope alongside your primary content blocker** to get an objective, external perspective on network connections.
- **Interpret badge numbers with the context of your browsing habits** to understand privacy risks better.
- **Leverage the detailed domain lists in the popup** to identify and block problematic domains manually if necessary.
- **Regularly update your filter lists** and observe any changes in domain exposure through uBO Scope.

## 6. Troubleshooting Interpretation Issues

### No Badge or Badge Count is Zero

- Ensure you have active network traffic in the monitored tab.
- Confirm that the extension is installed and enabled correctly.
- See [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../getting-started/initial-usage-validation/common-setup-issues) for guidance.

### Unexpectedly High Domain Counts

- Check for background tabs or other extensions that might open network connections.
- Confirm your filter lists are up to date and well configured.

### Lack of Domain Details in Popup

- Reload the popup or the browser tab.
- Verify you have network activity and permissions.
