# Understanding Domain Connectivity and Badge Counts

This guide provides a clear explanation of how to interpret domain connectivity information and understand the badge counts displayed in the uBO Scope extension popup and toolbar. By the end of this document, you’ll confidently assess the number and types of third-party server connections made by webpages you visit, helping you make informed decisions about privacy and content blocking.

## 1. What This Page Covers

- The meaning of domain lists shown in the popup categorized by request outcome.
- The definitions of **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** connection states.
- How to read and interpret the toolbar badge count.
- Practical tips for understanding connection patterns and third-party server activity.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- Have uBO Scope installed on a supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Open a webpage tab with network activity.
- Open the uBO Scope popup by clicking its toolbar icon.

---

## 3. Key Concepts & Definitions

### Domains, Hostnames, and Connections

uBO Scope tracks network requests made by webpages, grouping them by the effective domain (derived from hostnames using the Public Suffix List). Tracking by domain helps cluster related requests (e.g., subdomains) under one identifiable name.

### Connection Outcomes
The extension categorizes all connections into one of three mutually exclusive states:

1. **Allowed (Not Blocked)**  
   Connections that were successfully made and **not blocked** by any content blocker or network filter.
2. **Stealth-Blocked**  
   Requests that were redirected or blocked in a way that attempts to be hidden from the webpage. These requests do not show up in typical web request logs and are a stealthy method of blocking.
3. **Blocked**  
   Requests that were **explicitly blocked** (for example, by the browser or a blocking filter).

### Toolbar Badge Count

- The number displayed on the extension's toolbar icon badge always indicates the **number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections** on the active tab.
- A **lower badge count** signifies fewer unique third-party servers connected, generally implying better privacy and less tracking.

## 4. Exploring the Popup Interface

The popup is organized into sections reflecting connection outcomes:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**  
  This section lists domains where network connections succeeded without interruptions.
  
- **Stealth-Blocked**  
  This lists domains where requests were silently blocked or redirected stealthily.
  
- **Blocked**  
  Shows domains from which network requests were explicitly blocked.

Each section lists:
- The **domain name**, displayed in a way that converts internationalized domain names (IDNs) into Unicode for readability.
- The **count of requests** made to each domain, indicating the volume of connection attempts.

This clear categorization allows you to gauge not only which domains are contacted but also how your content blocking mechanisms are affecting network traffic.

## 5. Step-by-Step: Analyzing a Tab’s Network Connections

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Extension Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar to open the popup interface.
</Step>
<Step title="Read the Toolbar Badge Count">
Look at the number on the toolbar badge. This is the count of distinct allowed third-party domains connected by the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Tab Hostname and Domain">
At the top of the popup, note the primary site’s hostname and domain to understand the context.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Allowed Domains">
In the 'not blocked' section, review the list of domains your page connected to without interruption. Higher counts suggest more third-party dependencies.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Stealth-Blocked List">
Review stealth-blocked domains to identify connections blocked in a stealthy manner. These are invisible to the loading site but impact the actual network activity.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect the Blocked Domains">
Look through blocked domains to see what your content blocker or network restrictions stopped explicitly.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Request Counts per Domain">
Use the counts beside each domain to understand which third-party servers are involved most frequently.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- **Focus on the Allowed Count:** The badge count reflects how many third-party servers are actively connected. Tracking this number over time helps you understand your exposure.

- **Consider Legitimate Third Parties:** Not all third-party connections are harmful or tracking-related; common content delivery networks (CDNs) often appear here.

- **Watch for Stealth Connections:** Stealth-blocked domains can reveal attempts by certain blockers to silently filter requests. Their presence might suggest hidden filtering mechanisms.

- **Use Results to Improve Privacy:** By identifying allowed third parties, you can adjust block lists or browser settings for tighter control.

- **Remember Limitations:** Some network requests outside browser APIs will not show here; this tool only monitors requests visible to the webRequest API.

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Domain Connectivity and Badge Counts">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge number sometimes fluctuate?">
The badge updates dynamically as the page loads and network activity occurs. Dynamic content or scripts can trigger new connections, causing the count to change.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why might the 'stealth-blocked' list be empty?">
Stealth blocking is a subtle mechanism. If no stealth-blocked connections appear, it means either no such blocking occurred or your blocker doesn’t employ stealth methods.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some third-party domains show under 'allowed' despite blocking rules?">
Some third-party domains may be intentionally allowed by your content blockers or are essential for site functionality, hence counted as allowed. Review your filter lists if you expected them to be blocked.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is the toolbar badge count zero even though I see remote connections?">
The badge count shows only allowed third-party domains. If all third-party requests are blocked or there are no third-party connections, the badge will be zero or empty.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Summary Table

| Section          | Description                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Allowed Domains  | Successfully connected third-party domains.   |
| Stealth-Blocked  | Silently blocked or redirected domains.       |
| Blocked Domains  | Explicitly blocked domains.                     |
| Toolbar Badge    | Count of distinct allowed third-party domains.|

---

## 9. Illustrative Example

Imagine visiting example.com. The popup shows:

- Allowed domains: `cdn.examplecdn.com (5 requests)`, `fonts.examplefonts.net (2 requests)`
- Stealth-blocked domains: `adstealth.examplead.com (1 request)`
- Blocked domains: `tracker.badads.com (3 requests)`

The toolbar badge displays "2," indicating two distinct allowed third-party domains.

This tells you most resources loaded came from the first two allowed domains, while some ad-related domains were blocked or stealth-blocked.

<Tip>
Always view the badge count as a primary indicator of distinct third-party servers contacted without blocking. This is the critical privacy metric to watch.
</Tip>

<Info>
The domain lists in the popup are dynamically grouped and updated per tab by the background processes using the browser’s webRequest API and a public suffix list to accurately determine effective domains.

By understanding these fundamental concepts and how to read uBO Scope’s popup and badge, you gain powerful visibility into your browsing’s third-party network footprint—empowering better privacy and filtering decisions.
