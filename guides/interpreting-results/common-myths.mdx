# Debunking Common Myths About Block Counts

## Overview
This guide addresses two prevalent misconceptions among users of content blockers and network connection monitors such as uBO Scope:

- The false belief that a higher block count necessarily means better security or privacy.
- The unreliable nature of so-called 'ad blocker test' websites as benchmarks for blocker performance.

By clarifying these myths and demonstrating how uBO Scope provides a more accurate and nuanced view of network privacy, this guide empowers you to interpret network connection data properly and make more informed decisions about your content blocker setup.

## 1. Myth: More Blocks Means Better Protection

### Understanding the Badge Count
uBO Scope's toolbar badge displays the _number of unique third-party remote servers_ contacted per browser tab. A _lower count_ indicates fewer external connections, which generally corresponds to better privacy.

Focus on reducing distinct third-party domains contacted, not just the sheer count of blocked requests.

### Why High Block Counts Can Be Misleading

- A high block count might indicate your content blocker is allowing more third-party connections overall, requiring it to block more individual requests to those servers.
- Blocking many requests from a wide range of third parties does not necessarily reduce the number of actual unique remote servers your browser connects to.
- It’s the _effectiveness of blocking distinct 3rd-party domains_ that matters, not the number of individual requests blocked.

### How uBO Scope Helps

- By reporting _unique domains contacted_, uBO Scope reinforces that your real privacy gain comes from _minimizing distinct third-party connections_.
- The extension categorizes connection outcomes as **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked**, giving you a clearer picture beyond just request counts.

### Practical Tip

Use the uBO Scope badge as your primary indicator of privacy exposure:

- **Lower badge count means fewer unique third-party connections.**
- Avoid assuming blockers that report more blocks are necessarily better.

## 2. Myth: “Ad Blocker Test” Websites Are Reliable Benchmarks

### Why These Websites Are Problematic

- These test pages often simulate artificial, fabricated network requests to domains that don’t exist in the real world.
- Extension-based blockers often employ "stealth" methods to avoid breaking webpages or being detected; such methods can confuse test pages.
- As a result, these sites produce misleading results that don't reflect your real-world browsing privacy or blocker effectiveness.

### uBO Scope’s Advantage

- It observes **real network requests** initiated by webpages, regardless of content blockers or DNS filtering mechanisms.
- By capturing _actual third-party remote server connections_, uBO Scope gives you a precise and actionable insight into your browsing privacy.

### Practical Tip

Avoid relying on fake "ad blocker test" pages when evaluating content blockers. Instead:

- Use tools like uBO Scope to monitor real network traffic and blocking outcomes.
- Evaluate blockers based on actual third-party domain connections and the categories they fall into.

## 3. Using uBO Scope for Evidence-Based Analysis

By relying on uBO Scope, you accurately track network connections with these steps:

### Step 1: Monitor the Toolbar Badge

- The badge reflects how many distinct third-party domains your browser connected to in the active tab.
- Strive for a low badge count to reduce exposure.

### Step 2: Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Inspect domains categorized as:
  - **Allowed:** Connections permitted by the content blocker.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that are intercepted stealthily to avoid breaking sites.
  - **Blocked:** Requests outright prevented from completing.

### Step 3: Interpret Data with Real Context

- Consider that not all third parties are harmful; legitimate CDNs and essential services count as well.
- Use domain counts and categories to identify potential privacy risks.

### Step 4: Adjust and Validate Your Filters

- If your goal is maximum privacy, use uBO Scope's insights to refine your content-blocking filters.
- Validate changes by observing badge count reductions and domain categorizations over time.

## 4. Summary

| Aspect                    | wBO Scope Insight                                 | Misconception Clarified                         |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Block count vs connections| Badge shows unique domains contacted, not blocks | More blocks ≠ better privacy                     |
| Test websites validity     | Real network requests tracked                     | Test sites give unreliable ad blocker metrics   |

Use uBO Scope as a trustworthy, evidence-based tool that clarifies the true privacy impact of your content blocker setup.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Why badge count is unexpectedly high:**
  - Verify your filters; some allowed connections may be necessary third parties (e.g., CDNs).
  - Check if any extensions or settings interfere with network monitoring.

- **No badge or data updates:**
  - Make sure uBO Scope has the required permissions and is active.
  - Reload or restart the browser tab.

- **Distinguishing stealth-blocked vs blocked:**
  - Stealth-blocked requests are intercepted to avoid false positives or webpage breaks.
  - Blocked requests never contact the remote server.

- **Do not rely on block counts from other extensions or test websites.**
  - Use uBO Scope's domain-centric data instead.
