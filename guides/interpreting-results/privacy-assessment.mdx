# Using uBO-Scope for Privacy and Filter Evaluation

Discover practical, real-world ways to leverage uBO-Scope to compare content blockers, debunk ad-blocking myths, and identify hidden privacy leaks on popular websites. This guide walks you through actionable analysis workflows using uBO-Scope’s popup interface and toolbar badge, helping you gain meaningful insight into your browser’s third-party connections.

---

## 1. Why Use uBO-Scope for Privacy and Filter Evaluation?

uBO-Scope provides transparent reporting on all distinct remote server connections a website attempts or makes. Unlike traditional content blockers, this extension shows the actual count of unique third-party domains contacted, regardless of your current filtering setup.

- **Empowers users to compare content blockers** based on the real-world impact on third-party connections,
- **Exposes stealthy background requests** that other blockers or test pages might miss,
- **Helps evaluate filter lists reliably** by showing domains actually connected rather than just blocked request counts.

### Key Value

A lower badge count means fewer distinct third-party connections, which typically implies better privacy protection and less exposure to trackers.

## 2. Prepare to Use uBO-Scope

Before proceeding, ensure:

- uBO-Scope extension is installed and pinned in your browser toolbar. [Installation Guide](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/guides/getting-started/install-extension.mdx)
- You understand the basic interface elements: toolbar badge and popup panel. [Extension Interface Guide](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/getting-started/basic-usage-config/understanding-extension-ui.mdx)
- Your preferred content blockers are enabled for comparative testing.

## 3. Comparing Content Blockers in Action

### Overview
You want to objectively assess which content blocker reduces third-party connections more effectively by using uBO-Scope.

### Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Open a Target Website">
Navigate to a website where you want to assess third-party connections, e.g., a news or e-commerce site.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Observe Toolbar Badge">
Note the number on uBO-Scope’s toolbar badge. This number reflects the count of distinct third-party domains contacted (allowed connections).
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Open uBO-Scope Popup">
Click the toolbar icon to open the popup. Review the detailed lists of domains under 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' sections.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: Enable or Switch Content Blockers">
Toggle or switch to another content blocker in your browser.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 5: Repeat Observation">
Reload the website, note changes in the toolbar badge count, and examine the popup domain lists again.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 6: Compare Results">
Identify which content blocker results in the lowest distinct third-party connection count.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Expected Results
You’ll see a tangible reduction in the badge count and fewer domains under the 'not blocked' section as blockers become more restrictive.

### Tips
- Watch for stealth-blocked domains, which indicate covert redirects or silent connections.
- Use the domain counts per entry to gauge frequency of connections.

## 4. Debunking Ad-Blocker Test Page Myths Using uBO-Scope

### Problem
Many test pages create artificial requests that don’t match real-world browsing, leading to misleading block counts.

### Using uBO-Scope

Follow the typical browsing workflow on real websites instead of test pages, and use uBO-Scope to observe actual network connections. This reveals:

- The real number of unique third-party domains contacted,
- That high block counts on test pages do not always mean better privacy,
- Stealth requests that other blockers hide from test pages.

## 5. Identifying Privacy Leaks on Typical Websites

uBO-Scope helps uncover invisible or unexpected third-party connections, enabling you to evaluate your exposure.

### Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Browse Normally">
Visit commonly used websites during your routine browsing.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Check uBO-Scope Badge">
Note the badge count at different sites to observe variations in third-party connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Open Popup for Details">
View the popup to see exactly which domains are contacted and how frequently.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: Focus on Stealth-Blocked Domains">
These indicate connections silently redirected or blocked, which can suggest trackers or ad tech.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 5: Use Domain Information for Decisions">
Research unfamiliar domains in the popup to decide on stricter blocking or reporting.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Best Practices
- Regularly monitor sites you consider privacy-sensitive.
- Use the domain lists to help adjust your filter lists or blocking preferences.
- Cross-check with your current content blocker’s own logs if available.

## 6. Practical Example: Website Comparison

Assume you want to compare three content blockers (A, B, and C) on a news website.

| Content Blocker | uBO-Scope Badge Count | Not Blocked Domains | Stealth-Blocked Domains | Blocked Domains |
|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| A               | 12                    | a.com, b.net, c.org | d.info, e.io            | f.com, g.net    |
| B               | 8                     | a.com, b.net        | d.info                  | c.org, e.io, f.com, g.net |
| C               | 4                     | a.com               | (none)                  | b.net, c.org, d.info, e.io, f.com, g.net |

Using this, blocker C exhibits the best reduction in distinct third-party connections, and uBO-Scope’s popup helps verify the specific domains affected.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting Steps">
<Accordion title="Popup Displays 'NO DATA' or 'Loading' Stuck">
- Ensure the current tab is a web page and not a browser internal page.
- Refresh the page to trigger network request capture.
- Check extension permissions in your browser settings.
- Disable and re-enable uBO-Scope if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Toolbar Badge Does Not Update">
- Confirm that uBO-Scope has the required permissions (webRequest, activeTab, storage).
- Verify your browser version meets minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Try restarting the browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains Listed Don't Match Expected Blocker Behavior">
- Remember uBO-Scope reports connections visible via webRequest API.
- Some network requests may bypass extension detection and not be reported.
- Check if other privacy or security extensions interfere with network monitoring.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Tips for Maximizing uBO-Scope’s Benefits

- Think of the badge count as a straightforward privacy gauge — lower means fewer unique third-party connections.
- Use the explicit domain lists in the popup to identify frequent or suspicious domains.
- Compare results across websites and blockers to spot patterns.
- Stealth-blocked section can highlight hidden or suspicious redirects.
- Use punycode decoding in the popup to understand internationalized domain names.
