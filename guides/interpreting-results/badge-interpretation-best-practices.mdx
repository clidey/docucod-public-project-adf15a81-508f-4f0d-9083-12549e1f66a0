# Making Sense of the Badge Count and Domain Lists

Understanding the toolbar badge and domain lists in uBO Scope is key to unlocking the full value of this extension. This guide walks you through practical best practices for interpreting these indicators, debunks common misconceptions about block counts versus connection counts, and empowers you to read meaningful patterns from the data.

---

## 1. Understanding the Badge Count: What Does It Really Mean?

The badge count on the uBO Scope toolbar icon represents the **number of distinct third-party domains that the current browser tab connected to successfully**. This is not the count of blocked domains or requests.

- **Why 'Fewer is Better'**: A lower badge count means fewer distinct third-party servers were reached, indicating a cleaner, more privacy-respecting browsing experience.
- **Not a Block Count**: The badge is not a tally of blocked requests but of allowed, distinct third-party domains.

<Tip>
The badge updates dynamically as you browse, providing real-time insight into third-party connections that actually succeeded.
</Tip>

## 2. Interpreting the Domain Lists in the Popup

Clicking the toolbar icon opens a popup showing domains classified into three categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains your browser successfully connected to.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Requests that were redirected stealthily, often by the content blocker using redirection techniques to prevent detection.
- **Blocked**: Domains where requests failed, typically due to content blocking or network errors.

Each domain entry includes a connection count showing how many times requests were made to that domain.

<Check>
Pay attention to the **allowed** domains to understand which third parties actually received data.
</Check>

## 3. Common Myths Debunked

### Myth: A Higher Block Count Means a Better Content Blocker

This misconception is widespread but false. A high block count can coincide with more third-party connections because:

- A blocker might selectively allow more domains after blocking many requests.
- Some content blockers use stealth techniques that don't surface directly as block counts.

Ultimately, **what matters is how many distinct third-party domains your browser connects to—lower is more privacy-friendly.**

### Myth: "Ad Blocker Test" Websites Are Reliable Benchmarks

Such sites often simulate unrealistic network behaviors. They cannot accurately measure how stealthy or effective your content blocker is due to:

- Content blockers masking their activity to avoid detection.
- Fake network requests that don't represent real browsing.

Avoid relying on these tests and instead use tools like uBO Scope to see real-world network behavior.

## 4. Best Practices for Meaningful Analysis

Follow these tips to extract value from the badge and popup data:

- **Focus on the Badge Count First**: Use it as an immediate privacy health indicator.
- **Explore the Domain Lists**: Check out allowed domains to spot unexpected third parties or CDNs.
- **Spot Patterns**: Repeated connections to unfamiliar domains signal trackers or ads.
- **Use Context**: Some domains, like CDN providers, are expected and less concerning.

<Warning>
Avoid jumping to conclusions based solely on the number of blocked entries—they don't reflect actual exposure as clearly as the allowed domain count does.
</Warning>

## 5. Step-by-Step Workflow to Interpret Badge and Popup Data

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the toolbar icon on your browser to open the domain list popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Badge Count">
Observe the badge number on the icon—it shows how many distinct third-party domains were allowed for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
Focus on the 'not blocked' section for domains your browser connected to successfully. Identify common third parties or unexpected domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Stealth-Blocked and Blocked Domains">
Look at stealth-blocked and blocked lists to see which requests were intercepted or failed.
</Step>
<Step title="Assess Privacy Impact">
Use the count and domain nature to decide if a page is connecting excessively or to suspicious domains.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Refresh or navigate pages to observe how the badge count and lists update in real time.
</Note>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Tips for Badge and Domain Interpretation">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count sometimes drop when I visit a new page?">
The badge resets as the tab navigates to a new page. It always reflects the count for the current page’s allowed third-party domains.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if the popup shows no data after browsing?">
This can happen on tabs that have no network activity or due to temporary extension delays. Reload the page or wait a moment for data to populate.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do stealth-blocked domains sometimes appear in allowed or blocked lists?">
Stealth blocking uses redirections or invisible handling, so domains can appear in multiple categories depending on the exact outcome of requests. This is normal and reflects the complexity of network requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is the block count on my content blocker different from the blocked list here?">
uBO Scope reports by monitoring network requests via the browser’s webRequest API, independent of how your content blocker counts blocked requests. Differences arise from stealth techniques, DNS blocking, and timing.
</Accordion>

## 7. Additional Tips for Advanced Users

- **Combine with Content Blocker Logs**: Compare uBO Scope’s allowed third parties against your content blocker’s logs for a full picture.
- **Track Changes Over Time**: Keep an eye on badge counts across browsing sessions to detect changes in network behavior.
- **Use Domain Information**: Filter lists or registrar information can help identify legitimate domains versus trackers.

---

## 8. Summary

- The toolbar badge reflects distinct third-party domains **allowed** to connect — lower is better.
- The popup classifies domains as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, providing a detailed connection snapshot.
- Block counts alone are misleading; focus on unique domains your browser connects to.
- Avoid relying on ‘ad blocker test’ sites; use real network data with uBO Scope.
- Follow the practical workflow to interpret the badge and domain lists effectively.
