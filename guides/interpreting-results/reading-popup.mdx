# Reading the Popup Panel Data

Understanding the popup panel in uBO Scope is essential to make sense of the connections your browser establishes with remote servers. This guide provides a practical walkthrough of the popup interface, clarifying the grouping of domains, the meaning of different statuses, the significance of badge counts, and the role of the Public Suffix List (PSL).

---

## 1. Overview of the Popup Panel

When you click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar, the popup panel displays detailed data about network connections made by the currently active tab. This interface helps you quickly grasp which third-party domains were contacted and how these connections were handled.

### Key Sections of the Popup Panel:

- **Tab Hostname Header:** Shows the main site hostname and domain being viewed.
- **Domains Connected Summary:** Displays the total count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Connection Outcome Sections:** Divided into three categories:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
  - **Stealth-Blocked**
  - **Blocked**

Each category lists domains along with the count of requests made to each domain.

## 2. Understanding Domain Groupings

### Top-Level Domain and Public Suffixes

uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List (PSL) to accurately identify domains, distinguishing between the registered domain (effective TLD + 1) and subdomains.

- **Domain:** The registered domain derived from the hostname, such as `example.com`.
- **Hostname:** The full hostname including subdomains, such as `ads.example.com`.

This distinction ensures proper aggregation of request counts at meaningful domain levels, avoiding inflated or misleading numbers caused by unrelated subdomains.

### How Domains Are Grouped in the UI

- **Domain Names Displayed:** The popup lists domains by their registered domain, converted to Unicode where applicable for readability.
- **Count Representation:** Each domain shows how many requests or connection attempts were associated with it.

## 3. Interpreting Connection Statuses

The popup organizes observed domains into three main statuses based on connection outcomes:

### 3.1 Not Blocked (Allowed)

- **Definition:** Domains from which network requests successfully completed.
- **What It Means:** Resources from these domains were fetched by the browser.
- **Use Case:** Generally, low counts of allowed third-party domains reflect tighter privacy.

### 3.2 Stealth-Blocked

- **Definition:** Domains with requests that underwent stealth blocking.
- **What It Means:** Requests were blocked or masked silently without explicit blocking errors, often to avoid website breakage or detection.
- **Use Case:** These connections indicate blocking activity that is subtle, reflecting advanced content blocking techniques.

### 3.3 Blocked

- **Definition:** Domains where requests failed explicitly or were blocked outright.
- **What It Means:** The browser or content blocker prevented connections to these servers.
- **Use Case:** Identifying these domains helps you understand the extent of active blocking.

## 4. Badge Counts and Their Meaning

At the toolbar icon, uBO Scope displays a badge with a number that represents:

> **The number of distinct third-party remote domains that had allowed connections in the current tab.**

This count is a critical privacy indicator:

- **Lower numbers are better,** indicating fewer remote servers contacted.
- It reflects **unique third-party domains, not total requests.**
- The badge **ignores blocked or stealth-blocked domains** so it focuses on domains that successfully delivered content.

<Warning>
Do not confuse the badge count with the number of blocked requests or total traffic volume. The badge is a measure of distinct third-party domains successfully contacted.
</Warning>

## 5. Practical Example

Suppose you visit a news website. The popup panel might display:

| Status        | Domain           | Request Count |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| Not Blocked   | cdn.news.com     | 25            |
| Not Blocked   | analytics.io     | 3             |
| Stealth-Blocked | tracker.ads.net | 2             |
| Blocked      | ads.malware.com  | 4             |

From this you understand:
- Resources from `cdn.news.com` and `analytics.io` loaded successfully.
- Some requests to `tracker.ads.net` were stealth blocked.
- Requests to `ads.malware.com` were fully blocked.
- The badge count would be **2**, reflecting the two allowed domains.

---

## 6. Best Practices for Using the Popup Panel

- **Regularly review connected domains** to understand which third parties your browser contacts.
- Use the **status groupings to identify possible unwanted trackers or advertising domains.**
- **Focus on the badge count as a privacy metric.** Lower numbers indicate less exposure.
- Recognize that some allowed domains are legitimate service providers like content delivery networks (CDNs).
- Use the domain counts to spot excessive third-party resource loading that may impact performance.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Popup Shows 'NO DATA'
- Ensure that the tab is fully loaded and has active network connections.
- Verify that uBO Scope is properly installed and has necessary permissions.

### Counts Not Updating
- Reload the tab and reopen the popup.
- Check for any browser restrictions or privacy settings interfering with the extension.

### Confusing Domain Names
- Domains may be shown in their Unicode form; look carefully for internationalized domains.
- Use external tools or search engines if unsure about domain legitimacy.

<Accordion title="Popup Panel Data Structure Example">
Below is a conceptual example of connectivity data structured by uBO Scope for a given tab:

- Hostname: news.example.com
- Domain: example.com

**Allowed Domains:**
- cdn.example.com (15 requests)
- fonts.googleapis.com (5 requests)

**Stealth-Blocked Domains:**
- tracking.ads.net (3 requests)

**Blocked Domains:**
- malware.badsite.org (2 requests)

This representation helps clarify what you see grouped by each section in the popup panel.
