# Understanding Domain Status: Allowed, Stealth, Blocked

## Overview

This guide helps you understand the three distinct connection statuses uBO Scope displays for third-party network requests: **Allowed**, **Stealth-Blocked**, and **Blocked**. Knowing what each status means enables you to interpret your browsing security and privacy more confidently and make informed decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Install uBO Scope on a supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Complete initial setup, including granting required permissions.
- Basic familiarity with the uBO Scope popup interface and badge count.

## Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will:
- Understand the meaning of each connection status in uBO Scope.
- Recognize why connections fall into each category.
- Learn how these statuses relate to your browsing privacy.
- Interpret the badge count contextually.

## Time Estimate

Approximately 5-10 minutes.

## Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate.

## 1. Domain Status Categories Explained

### Allowed (Not Blocked)

- **What it means:** These are network connections to third-party remote servers that were successfully established by your browser.
- **Why it matters:** Allowed connections represent real resources fetched and used by the webpage or browser.
- **Examples:** Content delivery networks (CDNs) serving static resources, analytics servers explicitly permitted, or essential third-party services.

### Stealth-Blocked

- **What it means:** Connections that a content blocker blocked silently without making it obvious to the webpage. They may appear as redirects or hidden block actions.
- **Why it matters:** Stealth blocking maintains page integrity while preventing unwanted requests, helping reduce fingerprinting or privacy leakage.
- **Examples:** Tracking scripts that are blocked at the network level but without breaking webpage behavior.

### Blocked

- **What it means:** Connections that were directly prevented from being established by the content blocker or browser extension.
- **Why it matters:** These are attempts that never succeeded in reaching the server, fully protecting you from those third-party connections.
- **Examples:** Ads, trackers, or malicious domains explicitly blocked by your filters.

## 2. How These Statuses Appear in uBO Scope

When you open the uBO Scope popup, you’ll see three separate sections:

- **Not Blocked:** Lists domains with allowed connections.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Shows domains where connections were stealth blocked.
- **Blocked:** Displays domains where connections were outright blocked.

Each domain also shows a count representing how many requests were made to that domain within the active tab’s browsing session.

## 3. Interpreting the Toolbar Badge Count

The toolbar icon badge reflects only the **number of distinct allowed third-party remote servers** on the active tab, not blocked or stealth-blocked connections.

- **Lower badge count is better:** It means fewer third-party domains were allowed to connect.
- **Why badge counts matter:** This number gives a realistic privacy indicator, focusing on actual network connections made.

<Tip>
A high block count in a content blocker does not necessarily mean better protection. Sometimes, higher block counts correlate with *more* allowed third-party servers, increasing privacy risk. uBO Scope’s badge count gives the real picture: the number of distinct allowed domains.
</Tip>

## 4. Practical Examples

### Scenario: Viewing a News Website

- You visit a news site.
- uBO Scope shows 5 allowed third-party domains (CDNs and essential services).
- 3 stealth-blocked domains (trackers blocked silently).
- 7 blocked domains (ads and trackers blocked explicitly).

Interpretation:
- The site loads necessary resources without compromising your privacy.
- Stealth-blocking reduces detectable tracking.
- Blocked domains indicate active protection.
- The badge count will be **5**.

### Scenario: Visiting an Advertiser-Rich Site

- A site attempts connections to 20 third-party domains.
- uBO Scope shows 4 allowed (mostly CDN and analytics), 10 stealth-blocked, and 6 blocked.

Interpretation:
- Your content blocker is actively limiting third-party load.
- A smaller allowed count means fewer entities receive data.
- The badge count shows **4**, highlighting successful privacy gains.

---

## 5. Best Practices & Tips

- Refresh the uBO Scope popup after opening a new tab or navigating, to see fresh connection data.
- Use the badge count as your privacy and connection health indicator.
- Remember, some allowed third-party connections are normal and necessary.
- Review stealth-blocked domains to understand silent blocking effectiveness.
- Blocked domains confirm that your filters are actively working.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- **Confusing block counts with allowed counts:** Only allowed domains contribute to the badge number.
- **Expecting all third parties to be bad:** Legitimate services (like CDNs) will appear as allowed.
- **Misinterpreting stealth-blocked domains as allowed:** These are silently blocked.

<Warning>
uBO Scope reports only network requests passing through the browser's `webRequest` API. Connections made outside this scope (e.g., system-wide DNS-level blocking) will not appear.
</Warning>

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

- If you don’t see any data or the badge is missing, verify:
  - uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
  - Required permissions are granted (see installation guides).
  - You are on a supported browser and version.

- If counts seem abnormally high, check for conflicting extensions or unusual network activity.

---

## 8. Understanding Domain Grouping

uBO Scope groups connections by their **registrable domain** rather than full hostname. For instance:

- `cdn.example.com` and `assets.example.com` count under `example.com`.
- Internationalized domains are handled and displayed properly using punycode conversion.

This grouping gives a clearer view of distinct entities connecting.
