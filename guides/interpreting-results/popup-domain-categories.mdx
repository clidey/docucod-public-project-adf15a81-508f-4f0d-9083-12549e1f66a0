# What Are Allowed, Stealth, and Blocked Domains?

Understanding the categories of domains reported by uBO Scope is essential for making informed privacy and content blocking decisions. This guide explains the meaning of **Allowed**, **Stealth-blocked**, and **Blocked** domains as shown in the extension's popup interface, helping you interpret real-world network activity accurately.

---

## 1. Overview

When you open the uBO Scope popup, domains connected by the active browser tab are divided into three clear categories:

- **Allowed**: Domains to which your browser successfully connected.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Domains for which requests were redirected or otherwise altered stealthily by content blockers.
- **Blocked**: Domains where network requests failed due to blocking by content blockers or other errors.

This classification provides transparency into what actually happens behind the scenes when you visit a web page, showing both successful connections and various forms of blocking.

---

## 2. Understanding the Domain Categories

### Allowed Domains

**Allowed domains** list all remote servers from which your browser successfully fetched resources or established connections for the current tab.

- These connections indicate third-party servers that were permitted by your content blocker settings or other browser/network conditions.
- A lower number of allowed domains generally means better privacy because fewer third-parties are contacted.
- Allowed domains include legitimate services like CDNs, API providers, or essential third-party content required by the website.

<u>_Example Scenario_:</u>

Visiting a news website may show allowed domains such as `cdn.example.com` and `fonts.examplecdn.net`, indicating these content domains were accessed successfully without blocking.

### Stealth-blocked Domains

**Stealth-blocked domains** represent those origins where requests were **redirected or modified quietly** by your content blocker or privacy tools.

- These domains didn’t result in outright failures but were redirected to different URLs to prevent tracking or resource loading.
- This stealth blocking helps maintain site functionality and avoid detection by trackers or web pages trying to detect content blockers.
- Domains in this category may still see some network traffic, but the nature of the content or requests is altered to safeguard your privacy.

<u>_Example Scenario_:</u>

A tracking domain like `tracker.example.com` might be stealth-blocked by redirecting its request to a local 'null' URL or modified proxy, thus preventing the tracker from operating while keeping the page intact.

### Blocked Domains

**Blocked domains** are remote servers where network requests explicitly failed due to blocking.

- These failures are commonly caused by content blocking rules, network errors, or security restrictions.
- Domains in this section indicate that connection attempts to these domains were prevented, which could include ads, known trackers, or other undesirable content.
- Tracking a high count of blocked domains can reveal aggressive blocking behavior but doesn’t necessarily mean fewer actual third-party connections, making the distinction from allowed count important.

<u>_Example Scenario_:</u>

Attempted connections to ad servers like `ads.exampleadnetwork.com` may appear here, indicating they were prevented from loading by the content blocker.

## 3. How Domains Are Categorized Internally

- uBO Scope parses each outgoing network request to extract its **hostname** and then normalizes it to its **domain** using the Public Suffix List.
- Requests are recorded in three separate mappings (allowed, stealth, blocked), tracking domains and hostnames with counts of occurrences.
- The extension distinguishes connection outcomes by listening to the browser's `webRequest` events:
  - `success` events lead to categorization as **allowed**.
  - `redirect` events are marked as **stealth**.
  - `error` events indicate **blocked**.

This layered approach ensures users can see an accurate reflection of all real remote server interactions reported by the browser.

## 4. Using the Popup Interface to Assess Privacy

The popup shows these domain categories in separate sections with counts:

- **Not Blocked** shows allowed domains.
- **Stealth-blocked** reveals subtle blocking via redirection.
- **Blocked** lists outright blocked domains.

Each domain shows a count representing how many requests were made involving that domain, helping prioritize which third parties are the most active or potentially invasive.

### Practical Tips

- Focus on the number and type of **allowed domains** to gauge how many third parties your browsing contacts.
- Use the **stealth-blocked domains** to understand where content blockers are silently preventing trackers or annoying content without breaking sites.
- Review **blocked domains** to verify that known trackers or ad servers are being stopped entirely.

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **Empty or NO DATA in popup:** This means no tab data is available or no connections were measured yet. Reload the page and re-check.
- **Unexpected domains in allowed:** Some essential services (e.g., content delivery networks) may always show up; ensure you distinguish these from tracking or ad domains.
- **Discrepancy between badge count and popup:** Badge count reflects unique allowed domains, while popup shows detailed count breakdowns; they serve complementary purposes.

If popup contents do not update or categories seem incorrect, consult related documentation sections on [reading the badge count](/guides/interpreting-results/reading-badge) and troubleshooting.

## 7. Appendix: Example Visualization

The popup interface divides the results as follows:

```html
<section class="outcome allowed">
  <h3>not blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains">
    <!-- Allowed domains listed here -->
  </div>
</section>
<section class="outcome stealth">
  <h3>stealth-blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains">
    <!-- Stealth-blocked domains listed here -->
  </div>
</section>
<section class="outcome blocked">
  <h3>blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains">
    <!-- Blocked domains listed here -->
  </div>
</section>
```

Each domain row includes the domain name in Unicode and a badge showing the count of requests.

# Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup title="FAQs about Domain Categories">
<Accordion title="Why are some domains stealth-blocked instead of blocked?">
Stealth blocking involves redirecting or modifying requests silently to prevent user tracking without breaking website functionality. This is often preferable to outright blocking, as it avoids site breakage or anti-adblock detection.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can allowed domains include tracking or advertising servers?">
Yes. Allowed domains are simply those successfully connected. Whether they track or serve ads depends on your content blocker’s rules. uBO Scope reflects actual connection outcomes without judgement.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if I see suspicious domains in blocked or stealth-blocked categories?">
Investigate those domains further to understand their nature. They could be trackers or malicious servers. You can then adjust your content blocker settings if needed.
