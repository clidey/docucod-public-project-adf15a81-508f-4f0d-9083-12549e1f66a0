# Understanding the Popup Panel: Domains and Statuses Explained

Discover how to interpret uBO Scope’s popup panel interface, understand what each section means, and differentiate between allowed, blocked, and stealth connections. This guide walks you through the popup’s key elements and explains domain groupings with real-world context.

---

## 1. What This Guide Helps You Accomplish

When you click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar, a popup panel appears displaying connection data for the active tab. This guide enables you to:

- Identify and understand each distinct section within the popup panel
- Learn how to interpret the connection statuses shown
- Distinguish between allowed, blocked, and stealth network connections
- Understand what domain groupings mean and how they relate to real-world browsing scenarios

By mastering this page, you can quickly evaluate third-party connections made by your browser and assess privacy exposure.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- uBO Scope extension installed and enabled in your browser
- Open a webpage/tab with loaded content (connections are tracked per tab)
- Basic understanding of browser network requests is helpful but not required

---

## 3. Popup Panel Layout and Sections

The popup panel is the immediate interface you interact with for live connection insights. It consists of the following key parts:

### 3.1. Page Header — Tab Hostname

At the top, the panel shows the hostname and domain of the current active tab:

- **Domain** — The main domain serving the current page
- **Hostname prefix** — If the hostname is a subdomain, it appears as a prefix here

For example, if you visit `news.example.com` and the registered domain is `example.com`, the panel header splits these so you can see the subdomain portion separately from the main domain.

### 3.2. Summary Section — Total Distinct Connected Domains

Below the header is a summary displaying the total number of distinct domains contacted by the active tab during page load and interactions.

- This number counts **unique third-party** domains connected successfully and is the value reflected by the toolbar badge
- A lower number generally means fewer third parties and better privacy


### 3.3. Connection Outcome Sections

The main body of the popup is divided into three sections reflecting connection outcomes:

#### a) Not Blocked (Allowed)

- Lists domains to which network connections succeeded or were allowed by the content blocker
- Shows the domain name and how many connections (requests) were made to it
- Highlighted in green to indicate allowed traffic

#### b) Stealth-Blocked

- Lists domains detected as stealth-blocked, meaning requests were redirected or silently blocked in ways that evade typical observable blocking
- These are red-highlighted to emphasize their stealth, meaning the page or scripts may not outright know these connections were intercepted

#### c) Blocked

- Lists domains for which network requests failed due to explicit blocking by content blockers or errors
- Also highlighted in red indicating explicitly blocked domains

#### When a section is empty, it is hidden automatically to reduce clutter.

### 3.4. Domain Rows

Each domain listed shows:

- **Domain name** — in user-friendly Unicode format if applicable
- **Count Badge** — number of connection attempts tracked to that domain

---

## 4. How Connections Are Categorized

uBO Scope classifies network requests based on their outcomes as follows:

| Outcome Type       | Meaning                                                                                       | User Impact/Interpretation                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Allowed            | Requests successfully completed, indicating allowed third-party resources                     | Indicates third-party servers your browser connected to
| Stealth-Blocked    | Requests that were redirected or silently blocked (usually by stealth blocking techniques)    | Hidden blocking that evades normal detection
| Blocked            | Requests blocked or errored out, indicating explicit blocking by your filter or blocker       | Domains prevented from loading resources

This classification gives you deep transparency into which third parties actually got through and which were interrupted or hidden.

## 5. Real-World Usage Examples

### Example Scenario

You visit an online newspaper homepage. The popup panel shows:

- **Not Blocked:** cdn.examplecdn.com (12 connections), analytics.exampletracker.com (3 connections)
- **Stealth-Blocked:** ads.exampleadnetwork.com (2 connections)
- **Blocked:** unwantedtracker.example.com (5 connections)

You know the CDN is essential for page assets, so allowed connections there are expected. Analytics may be allowed or blocked depending on your filter settings. Stealth-blocked domain shows a blocker silently redirected requests to ads, preventing page breakage. Blocked domains are explicitly prevented, showing effectiveness.

This helps you evaluate your content blocking strategy’s effectiveness on real sites.

## 6. Step-by-Step: Opening and Interpreting the Popup Panel

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel">
1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup will load the active tab’s connection data.
3. Wait briefly for the data to populate.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the Page Domain and Hostname">
- Review the top header showing the page’s domain.
- If there is a subdomain, note it as it may influence connection grouping.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Summary of Connected Domains">
- Look at the 'domains connected' count.
- This reflects the number of unique domains your browser connected to.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
- Examine domains under the 'not blocked' section.
- These represent third parties where connections succeeded.
- Click through or compare counts to identify major third-party players.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe Stealth-Blocked Domains">
- See if any domains appear under the 'stealth-blocked' header.
- Understand these are silently redirected or covertly blocked connections.
- This section helps you recognize advanced blocking techniques.
</Step>
<Step title="Look at Blocked Domains">
- Check domains that were explicitly blocked or resulted in errors.
- This shows the external parties prevented from connecting.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Patterns and Evaluate">
- Use these groupings to assess your privacy and blocking settings.
- Lower allowed counts usually indicate fewer third party exposures.
- Stealth and blocked counts indicate how actively blocking is enforced.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 7. Tips, Best Practices, and Common Pitfalls

- **Tip:** The badge count on the toolbar icon shows the number of allowed distinct domains (not total requests). Always correlate popup details with badge count.

- **Tip:** Recognize that "stealth-blocked" domains may not appear in browser developer tools but still impact privacy.

- **Best Practice:** Use the popup panel regularly to monitor real browsing sessions, not artificial test pages.

- **Beware:** Seeing many connected domains may indicate unnecessary third-party trackers; consider enhancing filters.

- **Avoid:** Interpreting the blocker’s effectiveness solely based on the number of blocked requests rather than distinct allowed connections.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Panel Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Panel Shows NO DATA or Is Empty">
- Ensure you have navigated to an actual webpage tab (not a blank tab).
- Wait a few seconds for data to load after page load.
- Check that the extension is enabled and allowed permissions.
- Reload the page to trigger fresh connection measurement.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Counts in Sections Don’t Add Up as Expected">
- Allowed domains count corresponds only to successfully connected domains; stealth and blocked are separate.
- Some stealth-block methods hide connections from normal detection, expect discrepancies vs browser dev tools.
- Confirm your content blocking settings in uBO or other blockers influence results.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
