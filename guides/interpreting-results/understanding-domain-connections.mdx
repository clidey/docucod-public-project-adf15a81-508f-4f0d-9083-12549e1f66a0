# Understanding Domain Connections and Badge Counts

## Overview
This guide explains how uBO-Scope collects and reports third-party connections for web pages using the browser's `webRequest` API. You will learn how to distinguish between different connection outcomes—attempted, blocked, and stealth-blocked—and understand how the badge count on the extension icon reflects your actual privacy exposure.

## What You Will Learn
- How uBO-Scope monitors network requests to identify third-party connections.
- What the different connection outcomes mean and how to interpret them.
- How the toolbar badge count relates to real privacy risk.
- Best practices to spot unexpected or suspicious third-party connections.

## Prerequisites
- uBO-Scope installed on your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser.
- Basic familiarity with navigating the uBO-Scope extension popup.

## 1. How uBO-Scope Collects Third-Party Connection Data

uBO-Scope listens to the browser's `webRequest` API, tracking all network requests initiated by the current webpage across various stages:

- **Success**: The request completed successfully, and the remote server responded.
- **Redirect**: The request was redirected, potentially masking the final destination.
- **Error**: The request failed due to network issues or was blocked.

Every request is analyzed by uBO-Scope to identify:

- The hostname and domain of the remote server.
- Whether the request was allowed, blocked outright, or stealth-blocked (hidden by content blockers).

### Domains and Hostnames
uBO-Scope extracts the hostname from each request URL, then derives the registered domain using the Public Suffix List. This ensures accurate grouping of requests by domain, even for complex or internationalized domains.

---

## 2. Understanding Connection Outcomes

In the popup interface, connections are categorized into three groups based on the outcome:

### 2.1 Allowed Connections ("Not Blocked")
These requests completed successfully, connecting to third-party servers. They represent your actual exposure to remote parties when browsing a page.

### 2.2 Stealth-Blocked Connections
These represent requests that were initially redirected or altered by content blockers to hide their presence from the webpage itself. Although the webpage may not be aware of these connections, uBO-Scope nonetheless reports them to provide transparency.

### 2.3 Blocked Connections
These are requests that never completed because they were blocked by content blockers or network errors. They indicate attempts by third parties to connect that did not succeed.

---

## 3. How the Badge Count Relates to Privacy Risk

The badge count on the uBO-Scope toolbar icon displays the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected (i.e., allowed connections). This is a crucial metric for understanding your real privacy risk.

### Key Points:
- **Lower Badge Count = Better Privacy:** You want fewer third-party domains connected during your browsing.
- **Block Counts Are Not Reliable Indicators:** A content blocker that shows high block counts may still permit connections to many third parties, which increases exposure.
- **Stealth Connections Are Important:** Requests stealth-blocked by blockers are hidden from the page but visible to uBO-Scope, highlighting the true connection attempts.

## 4. Best Practices for Interpreting Domain Connections

To effectively use uBO-Scope to monitor third-party connections, follow these tips:

### 4.1 Regularly Review the Popup Data
Open the extension popup to inspect third-party connections split by allowed, stealth, and blocked. Pay attention to domains you don't recognize.

### 4.2 Identify Unexpected Third Parties
A sudden appearance of new third-party domains—especially unknown trackers or advertising networks—may point to privacy leaks or misconfigurations on the visited page.

### 4.3 Understand Legitimate Third Parties
Many websites rely on a small set of well-known content delivery networks (CDNs) and service providers. These are normal and expected.

### 4.4 Use Domain Counts, Not Request Counts
The badge shows distinct third-party domains, not the total number of requests. One domain making many requests counts once, focusing your attention on the variety of remote parties.

### 4.5 Monitor Stealth-Blocked Connections
Stealth-blocked domains can indicate attempts to circumvent blockers. Investigate these to improve blocking lists or settings.

## 5. Step-by-Step: Checking Domain Connections and Badge Counts

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO-Scope Extension Popup">
Click the uBO-Scope icon next to your browser's address bar while on a webpage.

*Expected result:* The popup displays the site's hostname and three sections listing connected domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Allowed Domains List">
Look under the 'not blocked' section to see domains from which resources were successfully fetched.

*Expected result:* You see domains and request counts indicating real third-party connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Review the 'stealth-blocked' section for domains that tried to connect but were hidden by blockers.

*Expected result:* Domains here reflect attempts that the page is unaware of but uBO-Scope logs.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine the Blocked Domains">
Look at the 'blocked' section to understand which third parties were prevented from connecting.

*Expected result:* Domains in this list show blocked connection attempts.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare With the Toolbar Badge Count">
Verify that the badge number matches the count of allowed distinct domains.

*Expected result:* Badge reflects the number shown in the 'domains connected' summary.
</Step>
<Step title="Spot Unexpected Domains">
If you find unknown or suspicious domains, investigate further or adjust your content blocker settings.

*Expected result:* You can take action to reduce unwanted connections and increase privacy.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Pitfall: Badge Count Not Updating
If the badge does not update after navigating to a new page:
- Ensure the browser supports the required permissions.
- Confirm uBO-Scope has permission to access web requests.
- Reload the page or restart the browser.

### Mistake: Assuming High Block Counts Mean Better Privacy
Remember, block counts don't equate to fewer third-party connections. Focus on allowed domain counts.

### Confusion: Stealth Connections Not Visible in Other Tools
Stealth-blocked requests are invisible to the web page and many blockers; uBO-Scope reveals them for transparency.

## 7. Additional Tips

- **Use uBO-Scope alongside your content blocker** to understand what's truly allowed through.
- **Check domain names carefully** and research unknowns to assess risk.
- **Keep the Public Suffix List updated** (uBO-Scope does this internally) to ensure accurate domain parsing.

## Appendix: How uBO-Scope Tracks the Requests (Technical Summary)

While this guide focuses on user experience, a brief technical overview helps contextualize the data:

- uBO-Scope records all network requests of a page’s tab.
- Each request is identified by type (`main_frame`, `sub_frame`, etc.) and URL.
- Outcomes classified as `success`, `redirect`, or `error` determine allowed, stealth, or blocked status.
- The tool maintains session storage to track occurrences of each domain.
- The badge count is updated dynamically to the count of unique allowed domains.

For the technically curious, the core tracking logic lives in `background.js`.

### Code Snippet: How Allowed Domains are Tracked
```javascript
function recordOutcome(tabId, request) {
    const tabDetails = session.tabIdToDetailsMap.get(tabId) || structuredClone(TABDETAILS_ENTITY);
    // Extract hostname and domain here...
    switch (request.event) {
        case 'success':
            outcomeDetailsAdd(tabDetails.allowed, hostname);
            break;
        case 'redirect':
            outcomeDetailsAdd(tabDetails.stealth, hostname);
            break;
        case 'error':
            outcomeDetailsAdd(tabDetails.blocked, hostname);
            break;
    }
    // Save and update badge...
}
```
