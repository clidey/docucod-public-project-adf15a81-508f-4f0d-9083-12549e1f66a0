# Comparing Content Blockers: What the Numbers Really Mean

## Workflow Overview

**Task Description**

This guide helps you accurately compare how different content blockers affect the third-party network connections initiated by websites using the uBO Scope extension. You'll learn why relying on typical block count numbers is misleading, how to interpret the badge counts properly, and what patterns to observe for an objective assessment of content blocker effectiveness.

**Prerequisites**

- Have uBO Scope installed and enabled in your web browser (see [Installing uBO Scope](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installing-browser-extension)).
- Basic understanding of what third-party connections are (see [Core Concepts & Terminology](/overview/introduction/core-concepts-and-terms)).
- Familiarity with accessing the uBO Scope popup panel (see [Launching and Accessing uBO Scope](/getting-started/first-run-experience/launching-extension)).

**Expected Outcome**

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

- Objectively use uBO Scope data to evaluate and compare different content blockers.
- Understand the true meaning behind badge counts and how they relate to privacy exposure.
- Avoid common misconceptions and unreliable external test methods.

**Time Estimate**

Approximately 10–15 minutes to perform comparative assessments using uBO Scope and to digest the key insights.

**Difficulty Level**

Beginner to Intermediate — no advanced technical skills required, but an understanding of browser extensions and network requests is helpful.

## Understanding the Challenge: Why Block Counts Can Mislead

Many users naturally assume that a higher block count displayed by a content blocker means "better" blocking. However, as uBO Scope reveals, this is not the case. Here’s why:

- The critical measurement is the number of distinct third-party remote servers from which resources are successfully fetched — the badge count in uBO Scope reflects this.
- A content blocker that reports a higher block count may ironically allow more third-party connections overall, resulting in a **higher badge count**, which means more privacy exposure.
- Conversely, a blocker with a lower block count might restrict connections more effectively, presenting fewer third-party domains in uBO Scope.

  <Warning>
    **Do not rely on the block count badges of content blockers themselves to judge effectiveness.** These numbers reflect filtering events, not third-party exposure.
  </Warning>

## Step-by-Step Instructions: Using uBO Scope to Compare Content Blockers

<Steps>
<Step title='Step 1: Install and Enable uBO Scope'>
Make sure uBO Scope is installed in your browser and enabled. Follow the dedicated installation guide if needed: [Install and Enable uBO Scope](/guides/getting-started-essentials/install-and-enable-extension).

> **Result:** You have the uBO Scope toolbar icon visible and the extension is actively monitoring network requests.
</Step>

<Step title='Step 2: Open uBO Scope and Observe the Badge Count'>
Navigate to a website you want to test with a given content blocker enabled. Observe the number displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge — this counts the distinct third-party remote domains contacted.

> **Result:** The badge count shows the actual number of unique third-party servers your browser contacted while loading the page.
</Step>

<Step title='Step 3: Open the Popup Panel to Review Domain Categories'>
Click the toolbar icon to open the uBO Scope popup. It categorizes third-party domains into:

- **Not Blocked:** Resources fetched successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections silently redirected or otherwise stealth-blocked.
- **Blocked:** Formally blocked network requests.

> **Result:** You have a detailed overview of which third-parties are allowed or blocked.
</Step>

<Step title='Step 4: Record Observations with Different Content Blockers Enabled'>
Disable your current content blocker and enable another one or adjust its settings. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 on the same website to compare badge counts and domain categorizations.

> **Decision Point:** A blocker with a **lower** uBO Scope badge count reduces your exposure to third parties more effectively.
</Step>

<Step title='Step 5: Look Beyond Block Counts — Focus on Actual Connections'>
Remember that block counts shown by blockers often do not equate to fewer third-party connections.

Use uBO Scope’s data to recognize if a blocker reports many blocks but allows more server connections, increasing privacy exposure.

> **Verification:** Confirm the extension accurately tracks requests by cross-referencing with known browser developer tools or using sites with normal traffic behavior.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Avoid 'Ad Blocker Test' Websites:** These pages simulate unrealistic network requests and do not reflect real-world blocking behavior. uBO Scope measures real traffic.
- **Focus on Unique Third-Parties:** A lower count in the popup badge means fewer distinct third-party servers exposed.
- **Pay Attention to Stealth Blocking:** Some blockers silently redirect or block requests without increasing visible block counts; uBO Scope flags these.
- **Test Over Multiple Real Websites:** Performance can vary by site; compare blockers using your regular browsing patterns.

## Common Pitfalls

- Misinterpreting blocking counts on content blocker icons as privacy effectiveness.
- Using artificial "test pages" that do not represent real web traffic.
- Forgetting that some legitimate third-party servers (e.g., CDN domains) are necessary and expected.

## Examples

### Comparing uBO Scope Results Between Blockers

| Content Blocker | uBO Scope Badge Count | Interpretation                               |
|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Blocker A       | 15                    | Allows more unique third-party connections — higher exposure. |
| Blocker B       | 8                     | Restricts more third-party connections — better privacy. |

### Real-World Scenario

- Visit news.example.com with Blocker A enabled, badge shows 15 distinct third-party domains.
- Switch to Blocker B, reload the page, badge drops to 8.
- Examine domains listed in popup — Blocker B blocks or stealth-blocks ad networks and trackers more effectively.

This hands-on comparison reveals which blocker truly limits third-party exposure.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues While Comparing Blockers">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Appear or Update">
- Ensure uBO Scope extension is enabled and permissions are granted.
- Check browser compatibility (Chrome ≥122, Firefox ≥128, Safari ≥18.5).
- Reload the page to force data refresh.
- Verify no conflicts with other extensions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title='Popup Panel Shows No Data or "NO DATA"'>
- Confirm the tab is active and loaded.
- Reload the extension popup.
- Restart the browser if necessary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Block Counts from Other Content Blockers Don't Match Actual Exposure">
- Remember their block counters differ fundamentally from uBO Scope's domain count badge.
- Refer to uBO Scope’s data for reliable measurement.
