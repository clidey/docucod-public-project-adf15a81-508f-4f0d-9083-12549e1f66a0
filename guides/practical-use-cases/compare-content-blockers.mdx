# Comparing Content Blockers with uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide demonstrates how to use **uBO Scope** to objectively compare different content blockers in real browsing scenarios. It provides a clear, reliable method to assess which content blocker better minimizes third-party connections, avoiding the common pitfalls of misleading badge counts and fabricated ad block tests.

## Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and active in your browser. Install it from the official stores for [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
- Have two or more content blockers installed that you want to compare (e.g., uBlock Origin, other popular ad blockers).
- Basic familiarity with how content blockers work and how uBO Scope reports connections.

## What You Will Achieve
- Learn to interpret uBO Scope’s connection reports to evaluate third-party leakage.
- Avoid reliance on superficial metrics like block counts or unrealistic test webpages.
- Make an informed, data-driven choice about which content blocker provides the best privacy protection.

## Estimated Time
Approximately 15–30 minutes depending on browsing and comparison depth.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare the Test Environment
1. Open your browser with uBO Scope and both content blockers installed.
2. Disable all content blockers except the first one you want to test.
3. Navigate to a few representative real-world websites of your choice.

### Step 2: Use uBO Scope to Record Connection Outcomes
1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup for the current tab.
2. Observe the number of distinct third-party remote domains under these categories:
   - **Not Blocked:** Domains that loaded resources successfully.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were stealthily blocked (blocked but invisible to the page).
   - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked.
3. Note the **total distinct third-party domain count** shown in the summary.
4. Repeat for each visited site.

### Step 3: Switch to the Next Content Blocker
1. Disable the first content blocker and enable the second.
2. Repeat browsing the same sites under the same conditions.
3. Open uBO Scope for each tab and record the distinct third-party domains and domains blocked.

### Step 4: Analyze the Results
- Compare the **distinct third-party domains successfully connected** across content blockers.
- Pay attention to stealth-blocked versus blocked domains to understand blocking strategy.
- The optimal content blocker is the one yielding the **lowest number of distinct third-party connections** (not necessarily the highest block count).

### Step 5: Interpret and Decide
- Understand that a higher block count badge does not mean better blocking—it can indicate more connections were made and subsequently blocked.
- Prioritize content blockers that reduce distinct third-party connections effectively and transparently.

### Step 6: (Optional) Deepen Analysis
- Use uBO Scope to explore domain counts in detail by expanding the popup sections.
- Check if allowed third parties are legitimate CDNs or necessary services, or unwanted trackers.
- Repeat tests across diverse websites for comprehensive evaluation.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices
- **Choose Real Websites**: Avoid synthetic "ad block test" pages which create unreal network requests and misrepresent blocker effectiveness.
- **Evaluate Stealth Blocking**: uBO Scope differentiates stealth-blocked requests; this indicates that blocking occurs invisibly to the site, reducing detection risk.
- **Focus on Third-Party Domains**: The critical privacy metric is how many distinct third-party domains your browser connects to, not raw counts of blocked requests.
- **Consistency Is Key**: Perform tests consistently across the same sites to get reliable comparative data.

### Common Pitfalls
- Mistaking the extension badge count as a measure of effectiveness.
- Relying on “ad blocker tests” webpages with unrealistic network patterns.
- Ignoring stealth blocks which impact the privacy outcome.

## Example Scenario
Suppose you want to compare **Content Blocker A** and **Content Blocker B**:

1. Enable Content Blocker A; visit `example.com`
2. Open uBO Scope popup:
   - Not Blocked: 8 domains
   - Stealth Blocked: 3 domains
   - Blocked: 5 domains
   - Summary: 11 distinct third-party connections
3. Disable Content Blocker A; enable Content Blocker B; revisit `example.com`
4. Open uBO Scope popup:
   - Not Blocked: 5 domains
   - Stealth Blocked: 6 domains
   - Blocked: 4 domains
   - Summary: 9 distinct third-party connections

**Conclusion:** Content Blocker B exposes fewer third-party connections, making it a more effective privacy tool despite possibly showing a lower block count on its own badge.

## Understanding uBO Scope’s Popup UI

| Section         | What It Means                                                                                            |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Allowed         | Third-party remote domains successfully fetched resources, i.e., connections allowed by the content blocker. |
| Stealth-blocked | Requests blocked in a way invisible to the webpage (hidden blocking), enhancing privacy protection stealthily.   |
| Blocked         | Requests explicitly blocked that the browser or content blocker blocked before completion.                |

The **summary** shows the total number of distinct third-party domains connected to during browsing.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Data in Popup or Badge is Missing:**
  - Ensure the extension has the proper permissions (activeTab, webRequest).
  - Confirm your browser supports the `webRequest` API for your version.
  - Try refreshing the page or reloading the browser extension.

- **Unexpectedly High Third-Party Counts:**
  - Double-check active content blocker settings.
  - Review if other extensions or browser settings affect network requests.

- **Stealth Blocking Not Showing Correctly:**
  - Some browsers or configurations may affect stealth blocking visibility; use latest uBO Scope versions.
