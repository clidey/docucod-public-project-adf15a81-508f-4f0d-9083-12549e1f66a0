# Auditing Third-Party Network Connections with uBO Scope

uBO Scope is designed to provide you transparent insight into the remote servers a web page connects to. This guide walks you through how to use uBO Scope to analyze these network connections, distinguish between first-party and third-party domains, and identify privacy or security risks through its reporting features.

---

## 1. Understanding the Auditing Workflow

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
- Learn how to interpret network connection data for the active browser tab.
- Identify which domains are contacted by the page—including allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.
- Differentiate between first-party and third-party domains.
- Use domain data to evaluate potential privacy or security concerns.

### Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and activated in your browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Basic understanding of domain names and third-party web connections.

### Expected Outcome
After following this guide, you will be able to confidently audit the network behavior of any web page using uBO Scope's popup interface and interpret the detailed domain listings.

### Estimated Time
Approximately 10–15 minutes to fully review and practice with real websites.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to intermediate—no advanced technical expertise required.

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions to Audit Connections

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope Popup for the Active Tab
1. Navigate to the browser tab whose network connections you want to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
3. The popup window will open, displaying data specific to that tab.

**Expected Result:** The popup loads the domain data and shows the page’s hostname near the top.

### Step 2: Read the Hostname Header
- The header shows the hostname and the registered domain of the active web page.
- This is considered the _first-party_ domain.

**Example:** If the page is `news.example.com`, you might see:

```
news. example.com
```

Where "example.com" is the registered domain.

### Step 3: Understand the Badge Count
- The badge on the extension icon displays the number of _distinct third-party domains_ that successfully had connections for the page.
- This count summarizes the number of unique external domains the page requested resources from.

**Important:** A _lower_ badge count generally means better privacy, indicating fewer third-party connections.

### Step 4: Explore the Domain Categories
The popup classifies domains into three groups:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were blocked transparently or indirectly by your content blocker or other mechanisms.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly blocked and requests failed.

Each category lists the domains alongside the number of requests made to them.

### Step 5: Differentiate Between First-Party and Third-Party Domains
- The first-party domain is the same as the active page’s registered domain.
- Any other domain shown in the allowed, stealth, or blocked lists is considered third-party.

**Tip:** Use this distinction to understand what external services or trackers a page contacts.

### Step 6: Analyze Privacy and Security Implications
- Review the third-party domains in the allowed and stealth-blocked sections to identify potential trackers or analytics services.
- Domains in the blocked list indicate resources or connections your content blocker prevented, helping you identify threats or unwanted connections.

## 3. Practical Example: Auditing a News Website

Imagine you visit `https://news.example.com` and open uBO Scope's popup.

- The hostname header shows "news. example.com" indicating the first-party domain.
- The badge count reads "5", meaning five distinct third-party domains were allowed.
- The "not blocked" section might list domains like `cdn.examplecdn.com` and `analytics.exampletracker.com`.
- The "stealth-blocked" list could have `ads.exampleadnetwork.com` indicating these connections were blocked stealthily.
- The "blocked" list may include domains known for aggressive tracking that your content blocker halted.

By reviewing this data, you decide whether you are comfortable with the external connections or need to adjust your blocking settings.

## 4. Tips, Best Practices, and Troubleshooting

### Tips for Effective Auditing
- **Regularly check multiple sites** to understand typical third-party network behaviors.
- **Watch for unexpected domains** especially in the allowed list; these could signal intrusive trackers.
- **Use the registered domain view** as your baseline to distinguish legitimate first-party subdomains from third-party domains.
- **Consider the stealth-blocked list** carefully; these connections might still have some impact despite being blocked stealthily.

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **No data shown or popup is empty:**
  - Make sure uBO Scope is active and permissions are granted.
  - Confirm the tab is fully loaded and network activity has occurred.
  - Check browser compatibility as per [Supported Browsers & Prerequisites](/getting-started/setup-installation/system-requirements).

- **Badge count does not update:**
  - Reload the tab to refresh network monitoring.
  - Restart your browser and validate the extension is enabled.

- **Confusing domain names (punycode or internationalized domains):**
  - uBO Scope converts punycode domains to their readable form in the popup for clarity.

### Performance Considerations
- uBO Scope monitors network requests in real-time with minimal performance impact.
- Badge count updates batch network events efficiently, avoiding browser slowdowns.

### Alternative Workflows
- Combine uBO Scope analysis with content blocker configuration to customize what connections you allow or block.
- Use the extension to verify the effectiveness of privacy add-ons by observing stealth-blocked vs. blocked domains.

## Appendix: Underlying Concepts (Brief)

uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List to accurately determine the registered domain from any hostname. This allows it to classify domains correctly into first-party and third-party categories. It listens to network request events (`webRequest` API) reported by the browser to track actual network communication outcomes — whether requests succeed, fail, or are redirected.


<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions About Auditing">  
<Accordion title="Why does uBO Scope report distinct domains instead of requests?">  
The badge count and domain lists focus on _distinct_ domains contacted, rather than total request count, because this better reflects unique external services a page depends on, impacting privacy.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="What is the difference between stealth-blocked and blocked domains?">  
Stealth-blocked domains were blocked in a way that the webpage cannot directly detect (e.g., via silent blocking or indirect failures), whereas blocked domains had explicit blocking events.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope report requests blocked by DNS or other network tools?">  
Yes, as long as the browser's `webRequest` API reports the network request events, uBO Scope observes them regardless of how the blocking occurs.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope impact browser performance?">  
The extension is optimized to minimize overhead, batching network events and managing data efficiently.
