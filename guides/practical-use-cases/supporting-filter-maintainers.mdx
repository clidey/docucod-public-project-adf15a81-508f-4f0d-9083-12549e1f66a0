# Supporting Filter List Maintainers with uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide demonstrates how uBO Scope empowers filter list creators and maintainers to observe real-world network activity effectively, especially on platforms with restricted developer tools access. It provides actionable strategies to capture detailed measurements of third-party connections and report on resource blocking effectiveness, making it a vital tool in the lifecycle of filter list development and refinement.

---

## 1. Purpose and Context
uBO Scope provides granular visibility into network connections initiated by webpages, independently of how they are blocked or allowed. This capability is invaluable for maintainers of filter lists tasked with auditing, validating, and improving these lists.

Filter list maintainers typically need to:

- Identify all third-party domains contacted by web pages.
- Understand which connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- Assess whether filters effectively block unwanted content without breaking sites.
- Gather data to improve or create new filter rules.

On platforms or devices with limited browser developer tools, uBO Scope is an essential workaround to access this network activity data with ease.

---

## 2. Preparing to Capture Network Activity Data

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and activated in a compatible browser (Chrome ≥ 122, Firefox ≥ 128, Safari ≥ 18.5).
- Basic understanding of third-party domains and filter list concepts (see [Core Concepts and Terminology](/overview/product-intro-core-value/core-terms-and-concepts)).
- Target webpages loaded in active tabs for network observation.

### Expected Outcome
- Ability to observe detailed third-party connection data categorized by outcome.
- Insights to refine and report filter lists with data-driven confidence.

### Time Commitment
- Initial setup and familiarization: 5–10 minutes.
- Capturing and analyzing data for a single site: 10–20 minutes depending on complexity.

## 3. Step-by-Step Workflow for Filter List Maintenance

### Step 1: Load the Target Website
Open the webpage you want to analyze in the browser where uBO Scope is installed. Ensure the page fully loads to capture the complete set of network requests.

### Step 2: Open uBO Scope Popup
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to bring up the popup interface showing network connection data for the active tab.

### Step 3: Review Domain Connections by Category
The popup divides domains into:

- **Not blocked:** Domains successfully connected to without obstruction.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains whose connections were blocked but undetectably by stealth methods.
- **Blocked:** Domains whose connection attempts were visibly blocked.

For filter list maintainers, focusing on the 'not blocked' and 'stealth-blocked' lists helps identify leaks where unwanted third parties are not fully blocked.

### Step 4: Analyze Connection Counts
Each domain listed has a count of connection attempts. Higher counts can indicate frequent use or critical resources, influencing whether to target these domains for filtering.

### Step 5: Capture Detailed Data for Reporting
Use uBO Scope’s data export or record screen data alongside domain details manually. Note domains that:

- Appear unexpectedly in allowed domains but are known trackers or ad servers.
- Appear in stealth-blocked, signaling partial blocking requiring further filter enhancement.
- Are blocked correctly, confirming current filters are effective.

### Step 6: Formulate or Refine Filter Rules
Based on your analysis, craft new filter rules or modify existing ones. Remember to:

- Prefer rules that block domains at the domain level rather than individual hostnames for better coverage.
- Test rules incrementally to prevent site breakage.

### Step 7: Validate Changes
Reload the webpage with updated filters enabled and verify changes in uBO Scope’s popup reflect desired blocking behavior.

### Step 8: Document and Share Findings
Prepare detailed yet clear reports showing third-party connection behaviors, network outcomes, and filter impacts to support collaborative filter list development.

## 4. Tips for Effective Measurement and Reporting

- **Use Multiple Site Samples:** Test several representative pages of a site to get comprehensive data.
- **Leverage uBO Scope Badge Counts:** Use the badge count on the toolbar icon as a quick indicator of distinct allowed third-party domains.
- **Monitor Stealth-Blocked Domains Closely:** These often reveal partial blocking scenarios requiring filter refinement.
- **Automate Data Collection When Possible:** Use scripts or browser automation combined with uBO Scope to gather large-scale data.
- **Combine with Other Tools:** For deep inspection, pair uBO Scope data with browser network panels or external HTTP debugging tools.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Misinterpreting Badge Counts:** Remember that a lower badge count generally means fewer distinct allowed third-party domains, which is preferable for privacy.
- **Ignoring Stealth Blocking Evidence:** Stealth-blocked domains are often overlooked; validate these domains carefully.
- **Assuming Network Requests Are Fully Representative:** Some browser requests might not be observable due to platform limitations.
- **Skipping Testing After Filter Changes:** Always verify with uBO Scope after updating filter lists.

## 6. Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| No network data shown | Browser permissions not granted or extension inactive | Ensure uBO Scope is enabled with necessary webRequest permissions; see [Troubleshooting Installation Issues](/getting-started/usage-validation-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-install) |
| Unexpected allowed domains | Filters not effective or incomplete | Review stealth-blocked domains for clues; refine filter rules accordingly |
| Popup shows outdated data | Session data might need refreshing | Reload the page or restart the browser to reset session |

## 7. Example Scenario

Imagine you maintain a filter list targeting a major news site that loads numerous third-party trackers.

- Launch the news site in your browser.
- Open uBO Scope popup and see a list of third-party domains under 'not blocked' including some suspicious analytics domains.
- Notice that some tracker domains appear under 'stealth-blocked' but not fully blocked.
- Use this data to add or strengthen blocking filters for those domains.
- Reload the site and confirm via uBO Scope that these domains now appear under 'blocked'.
- Document the changes with connection counts before and after filtering to share with your team.
