# Running a Site Privacy Audit

## Overview

This guide walks you through the practical, step-by-step workflow to audit any website for third-party network activity using uBO Scope. You will learn how to identify every outgoing network connection, interpret their origins, and distinguish between common content delivery networks (CDNs) and more privacy-sensitive third-party domains.

The goal is to empower you with the knowledge to evaluate a site's network footprint and help you spot potential privacy risks effectively.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running a site privacy audit, ensure you have:

- Installed the uBO Scope extension on a supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- Granted necessary permissions including activeTab, storage, webRequest, and host permissions.
- Familiarity with basic usage of the uBO Scope popup UI to view allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Access to a target website in your browser tab ready for analysis.

Refer to the [Installation & Basic Setup](./installation-and-basic-setup) guide and [Basic Configuration and Permissions](./basic-configuration) to verify your environment.

---

## Expected Outcome

By completing this workflow, you will be able to:

- Monitor all third-party connections initiated by a target website.
- Identify and categorize domains as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked by the browser or content blockers.
- Understand which connections originate from legitimate CDNs and which may pose privacy risks.
- Use uBO Scope’s detailed domain breakdowns to make informed decisions about site trustworthiness.

---

## Time Estimate

This privacy audit typically takes about 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the complexity of the site audited and your familiarity with the interface.

---

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate – basic understanding of web browsing and network concepts is helpful.

---

## Step-by-Step Audit Instructions

### 1. Open uBO Scope on the Target Tab

- Navigate to the website you want to audit.
- Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
- The popup UI will open, displaying network connection data for the active tab.

**Expected Result:**
- You see the hostname of the tab displayed at the top.
- The total count of distinct connected domains appears prominently.

---

### 2. Review the Domain Categories

uBO Scope classifies network connections into three categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which network requests succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains of requests that were silently blocked (stealth-blocked) by your content blocker, often to prevent detection or breakage.
- **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked by your content blocker.

Within each category, you will see domains sorted alphabetically with a count badge showing the number of requests.

**Action:**
- Scroll through each category to observe which domains are active.
- Use the counts to judge the volume of connections per domain.

**Tip:**
- A low number of allowed third-party domains usually indicates fewer potential privacy leaks.

---

### 3. Identify Third-Party Domains

- Confirm that the allowed domains are not part of the first-party site.
- Use the domain list to spot well-known CDNs (e.g., `cloudflare.net`, `akamai.net`, `amazonaws.com`).
- Domains unrelated to the main site’s business or location could be tracking or advertising entities.

**Tip:**
- Refer to trusted domain lists or the [public suffix list](https://publicsuffix.org) for domain validation.

---

### 4. Investigate Stealth-Blocked and Blocked Domains

- Stealth-blocked domains indicate requests that were blocked silently, possibly to avoid website breakage.
- Explicitly blocked domains show where your content blocker acted overtly.

**Action:**
- Analyze stealth-blocked domains carefully; these could be problematic trackers or unwanted third parties.
- Evaluate known trackers or suspicious domains.

**Tip:**
- Sometimes high counts in stealth-blocked domains highlight aggressive tracking or ad-related connections.

---

### 5. Interpret and Validate the Badge Count

- The badge on the uBO Scope icon reflects the number of distinct third-party domains allowed.
- Compare this count with the total domains visible in the popup.

**Confirm:**
- A significantly high badge count often means many third-party connections are allowed, potentially reducing privacy.

**Avoid:**
- Using block count as the privacy indicator. Instead, base your judgment on the allowed domain count.

---

### 6. Export or Document Your Findings

Currently, uBO Scope doesn't offer direct export functionality.

**Action:**
- Manually record counts and domain names if auditing for research or reporting.
- Take screenshots or use browser developer tools for further investigation.

---

## Understanding the Data and its Sources

uBO Scope internally resolves hostnames to their registrable domain using the public suffix list. This precision helps in detecting distinct organizations behind second or top-level domains.

---

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Audit Multiple Pages:** Repeat this process on various pages within the same site to capture different third-party loads.
- **Use Trusted Public Domain Lists:** Leverage the public suffix list integrated into uBO Scope for authoritative domain parsing.
- **Recognize Legitimate Services:** Some third parties like Google Analytics, CDNs, or cloud providers might be unavoidable but usually have reputations.
- **Look for Anomalies:** Domains that appear unrelated, obscure, or have repetitive high requests may warrant deeper scrutiny.
- **Combine with Other Privacy Tools:** Use alongside content blockers or network inspection tools to get a holistic privacy perspective.

---

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **No Data or 'NO DATA' Shown:** Ensure the extension has all necessary permissions and is active on the page.
- **Badge Count Stuck or Incorrect:** Reload the page and the extension popup to refresh data.
- **Unrecognized Domain Names:** Domains with punycode-encoded names will be decoded automatically in the popup; refer to the Unicode display for clarity.
- **Stealth-Blocked Domain Confusion:** These represent silently blocked connections, not failures; verify with your blocking lists or content blocker settings.

---

## Example Scenario

You visit a commercial news website:

- Open uBO Scope.
- You see 8 allowed domains, including `example.com` (the site), `cloudflare.net`, and `google-analytics.com`.
- Stealth-blocked list shows `doubleclick.net` with numerous requests.
- Blocked list contains known ad servers.

You interpret that the site uses some tracking domains but effectively blocks many ads while relying on common CDNs.
