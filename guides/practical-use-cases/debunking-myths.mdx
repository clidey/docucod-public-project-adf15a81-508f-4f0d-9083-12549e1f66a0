# Debunking Ad Blocker Badge and Test Myths

## Overview
This guide helps you understand why badge counts in content blockers and third-party "ad blocker test" websites can be misleading. It explains the limitations of these metrics and shows you how to use uBO Scope for independent, reliable verification of content blocker effectiveness.

## Why Badge Counts Are Misleading

Most content blockers display a badge count that reports blocked requests or connections. However, a higher block count does not necessarily mean better blocking effectiveness.

- The badge count in uBO Scope shows the **number of distinct third-party remote servers from which resources were successfully fetched** (allowed domains). 
- A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, which typically means better privacy.
- Some blockers may report more blocks but still allow connections to a larger number of third-party domains, meaning they are less effective.

### Common Misconceptions

> _"This content blocker blocks more requests, so it must be better"_

- A higher number of blocked requests can coexist with more third-party connections because blockers vary in their filtering strategies.
- Block count alone does not reflect the scope or quality of blocking — what truly matters is the **number of unique external domains that remain reachable during browsing**.

## The Fallacy of Third-Party Ad Blocker Test Sites

Many public "ad blocker test" web pages claim to reveal how well a blocker performs. However, these are often unreliable for the following reasons:

- **Unrealistic Network Patterns:** These test sites make artificial requests that do not correspond to real-world browsing patterns.
- **Failure to Detect Stealth Blocking:** Some blockers use stealth or indirect blocking methods invisible to these tests.
- **Extension Detection Challenges:** Webpages cannot fully observe extension behavior, especially when blockers avoid detection or page breakage.

### Why Avoid These Tests

Such test pages might show a blocker failing when, in realistic scenarios, it actually blocks much more.

## Using uBO Scope to Verify Content Blockers

uBO Scope offers a transparent, independent way to observe network requests and verify blocking effectiveness:

- It **monitors all network connections your browser attempts**, reporting distinct domains contacted.
- The badge count represents the number of unique third-party domains connected to, so a **lower count means fewer external exposures**.
- uBO Scope also categorizes domains based on the outcome of the request:
  - **Not blocked:** Domains the browser connected to successfully.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where network requests failed due to blocking.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Redirected or otherwise stealth-blocked connections.

### Verification Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Install and Activate uBO Scope">
Ensure uBO Scope is installed and active in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
</Step>
<Step title="Open a Website">
Navigate to a site you want to evaluate.
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup view.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Badge Count and Domain Listings">
Check the badge count for distinct connected third-party domains and review the domain lists under 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare Across Content Blockers">
Toggle different blockers on/off and observe differences in domain connections using uBO Scope.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Practical Tips
- Use real browsing sessions instead of synthetic test pages to get meaningful data.
- Pay attention to domains appearing in the "not blocked" list — these are exposures your blocker permits.
- Use the stealth-blocked category to detect blockers that silently redirect or interfere with requests.

## Practical Example: Evaluating Two Content Blockers

1. Enable Blocker A and browse a typical news website.
2. Observe uBO Scope showing 10 distinct allowed third-party domains.
3. Switch to Blocker B and repeat browsing.
4. Note that uBO Scope now shows 20 allowed third-party domains despite Blocker B showing a higher block count badge.

**Interpretation:** Blocker A exposes fewer third-party domains, making it more effective at limiting external connections even if it reports fewer "blocks."

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope Verification">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Changing as Expected">
- Ensure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions.
- Confirm the extension is active and not disabled by the browser.
- Reload the web page and open the popup after a few seconds.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Requests Are Not Displayed">
- Some network requests may not go through browser APIs and thus not appear.
- Non-HTTP(S)/WebSocket requests outside browser control are not tracked.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Ad Blocker Test Sites Show Different Results than uBO Scope">
- Trust uBO Scope’s direct network monitoring over test pages.
- Test sites often use unrealistic requests and should not influence your blocker choice.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary
Using uBO Scope provides an authoritative way to inspect third-party connections your browser makes, moving beyond misleading badge counts or unreliable ad blocker test webpages. This empowers you to make informed decisions on content blocker effectiveness based on real-world data.

## FAQs

**Q: Why does a blocker with a high block count sometimes perform worse?**

A: Because block counts can track the number of blocked requests but don’t reflect how many distinct third-party domains remain accessible. More allowed domains typically mean less effective blocking.

**Q: Can I rely on public ad blocker test pages?**

A: No. These tests use artificial request patterns and cannot detect stealth blocking. For accurate analysis, use tools like uBO Scope that monitor real network traffic.

**Q: What does the "stealth-blocked" category mean in uBO Scope?**

A: It indicates requests that were silently redirected or manipulated by blockers, often invisible to webpages and some other tools.
