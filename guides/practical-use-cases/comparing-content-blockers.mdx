# Comparing Content Blocker Results with uBO Scope

Understand how to objectively compare different content blockers by leveraging uBO Scope’s transparent monitoring of network connections. This guide helps you avoid common myths associated with block counts and teaches you to focus on the real impact of content blockers on network traffic by analyzing what servers your browser actually communicates with.

---

## 1. Purpose of This Guide

uBO Scope uniquely reveals all network connections attempted or established by your browser when visiting any webpage, regardless of which content blockers are active. This page guides you through using uBO Scope to:

- Compare the effectiveness of different content blocking extensions or configurations objectively.
- Interpret network connection data beyond simplistic block counts.
- Avoid common pitfalls and misconceptions when evaluating content blocker results.


## 2. What You Need Before Starting

- uBO Scope installed on your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- One or more content blockers installed/configured for comparison.
- Basic familiarity with opening the uBO Scope popup UI and interpreting allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connection lists. (See [Exploring the Popup UI](/guides/getting-started-journeys/exploring-the-popup-ui))
- A target set of websites to test with each blocker setting.


## 3. Expected Outcome

By the end of this guide, you will:

- Understand how to use uBO Scope’s detailed network connection reports to compare content blockers.
- Be able to interpret badge counts correctly, focusing on allowed third-party connections.
- Recognize why block count alone is an unreliable metric.
- Confidently draw conclusions about content blockers based on real network footprints.

## 4. Step-by-Step Workflow to Compare Content Blockers

### Step 1: Select Websites for Comparison
Choose one or several real-world websites that you want to test under different content blockers or configurations. Select websites you use regularly or those known for tracking or ads.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Browser
Ensure uBO Scope and your first content blocker are installed and enabled. Close other extensions that might interfere with network monitoring.

### Step 3: Visit the Test Website With First Content Blocker
1. Navigate to the website.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup UI.
3. Observe the badge count and connection categories:
   - **Allowed**: Domains/resources successfully connected.
   - **Stealth-blocked**: Redirected or suppressed connections.
   - **Blocked**: Failed or stopped network connections.

### Step 4: Record the Data
Make note or take screenshots of uBO Scope's report:

- The badge count (distinct allowed third-party domains).
- The count and names of domains in each category.

### Step 5: Repeat With Other Content Blockers
Disable the current blocker and enable another one.
Repeat Steps 3 and 4 on the same website(s).

### Step 6: Compare Results Objectively
Focus on the **allowed third-party connection counts** and domain lists:

- Fewer allowed third-party domains generally mean better privacy protection.
- Higher block counts don’t necessarily indicate better blocking.
- Use the domain lists to evaluate which third parties are allowed or blocked.

### Step 7: Analyze Stealth Behavior
Note that some blockers stealthily block or redirect connections without triggering high block counts. uBO Scope reveals these subtle behaviors in the stealth-blocked category.

## 5. Why Block Counts Are Misleading

- **High block count may correlate with more network connections:** A content blocker with a high block count can coincide with allowing many third-party connections, meaning it blocks many trivial or non-critical requests but fails to block the main trackers.
- **Stealth blocking hides true blocking metrics:** Many modern blockers redirect or drop connections stealthily, so block counts shown by the blocker UI are incomplete or missing.
- **Test pages are unrealistic:** "Ad blocker test" sites often fabricate requests and cannot detect stealth blocking accurately, rendering their results unreliable.


---

## 6. Best Practices When Comparing Content Blockers

- Always use **uBO Scope’s badge count** and popup UI as your primary measurement tool.
- Test using **real-world sites, not test pages** designed to detect ad blockers.
- Compare the **full domain lists** in allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories to understand the type of connections passing through.
- Allow time for pages to fully load and for all network requests to complete before capturing data.
- Consider browser-specific behaviors as reported in [Supported Browsers & Environment Integration](/overview/core-concepts-system/integration-environment).

## 7. Example Scenario: Comparing Two Blockers on News Site

1. Using uBO Scope with Blocker A:
   - Badge count: 12 allowed domains
   - Blocked: 8 domains
   - Stealth-blocked: 3 domains

2. Using uBO Scope with Blocker B:
   - Badge count: 20 allowed domains
   - Blocked: 15 domains
   - Stealth-blocked: 1 domain

**Interpretation:**
- Although Blocker B shows a higher block count (15 vs 8), it allows significantly more third-party domains (20 vs 12).
- Blocker A has better coverage in stealth blocking (3 vs 1), potentially stopping connections more effectively.
- Therefore, **Blocker A provides better privacy protection despite a lower visible block count**.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Missing or zero badge count:** Confirm uBO Scope has all needed permissions and the `webRequest` API is functional (see [Basic Configuration and Permissions](/getting-started/setup-and-troubleshooting/basic-configuration)).
- **Popup shows "NO DATA":** Refresh the page after opening the popup or check if the page is blocked or in a private window that the extension does not support.
- **Inconsistent counts across browsers:** Due to browser-specific limitations, some blocked requests may not be reported consistently. Refer to [Supported Browsers & Environment Integration](/overview/core-concepts-system/integration-environment).

## 9. Tips for Maximizing Insights

- Use uBO Scope in conjunction with your content blockers to confirm what connections are truly allowed.
- Regularly audit websites you frequent to detect changes in third-party connections.
- Leverage uBO Scope to understand when stealth blocking is used by your content blockers.
- Document findings for filter list maintainers or privacy-focused communities.

<Tip>
Always assess content blockers based on the count of allowed third-party servers, not just on the number of blocked requests shown in blocker UI badges.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Avoid relying on "ad blocker test" websites for evaluating content blocker effectiveness; they do not provide reliable or realistic assessments.
</Warning>

<Info>
Stealth blocking techniques can obscure the true blocking behavior of content blockers. uBO Scope reveals this through its stealth-blocked domain reporting.
