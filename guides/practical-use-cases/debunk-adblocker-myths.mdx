# Debunking Adblocker Myths with Evidence Using uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide equips you with practical knowledge to use uBO Scope for challenging common misconceptions about ad blockers and content blocking efficiency. By following step-by-step workflows, you'll learn how to interpret network connection data — including stealth-blocked and explicitly blocked requests — and understand what truly impacts your online privacy.

uBO Scope empowers you to see beyond misleading block counts or artificial testing sites, instead focusing on the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser actually connects to.

---

## 1. Why Use uBO Scope to Debunk Adblocker Myths?

Many users rely on the badge's block count or third-party websites that claim to test ad blockers to judge effectiveness. These approaches can be misleading because:

- A higher block count can mean more requests allowed from more unique servers, not fewer.
- Test sites generate unnatural network requests that don't represent real browsing.
- Stealth blocking hides blocked requests from the page itself, confusing test results.

uBO Scope reveals actual network outcomes, reporting all attempted connections including **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth-blocked**. It offers a transparent view of the real privacy landscape.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- uBO Scope must be installed in your supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
- Ensure all required permissions are granted (especially `webRequest` permission).
- You should have observed at least one webpage's network connections using the popup interface.

If you still need to install or configure uBO Scope, follow the [Installation Instructions](/getting-started/setup-introduction/installation-instructions) and [Configuration & Setup](/getting-started/setup-introduction/extension-configuration-setup) guides.

## 3. Understanding the Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Allowed connections** | Server connections not blocked and reported under 'not blocked' in the popup. These are third-party connections made by the web page.
| **Blocked connections** | Requests explicitly blocked by content blockers, appearing under 'blocked'. They never reach the server.
| **Stealth-blocked connections** | Connections stealthily blocked, hiding blocking from the webpage but visible in uBO Scope's popup under 'stealth-blocked'.
| **Badge count** | Shows the number of distinct third-party domains contacted successfully (allowed). A lower count means fewer unique third-party connections.

Understanding these definitions is crucial to interpreting results accurately and dispelling common misbeliefs.

## 4. Step-by-Step Workflow: Using uBO Scope to Debunk Myths

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope’s Popup on a Target Webpage

1. Visit the webpage you want to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon on your browser toolbar.
3. The popup opens, showing the domain of the current tab, total connected domains, and categorized lists of domains:
   - **Not blocked** (allowed)
   - **Stealth-blocked**
   - **Blocked**


### Step 2: Analyze the Number of Connected Domains

- Note the **badge number** on the extension icon—it reflects the number of distinct remote third-party servers that actually got connected.
- Within the popup, observe the 'domains connected' summary that corresponds to this count.

**Why this matters:** Lower badge numbers equate to fewer third-party connections, which is the primary indicator of privacy impact.


### Step 3: Review the 'Stealth-blocked' Categories

- Expansion of the **stealth-blocked** section shows third-party domains blocked in a stealthy fashion.
- These requests are hidden from the webpage but still monitored by the extension.

> This reveals that some content blockers may stealthily block requests, which artificially lowers block counts reported by the blocker itself.


### Step 4: Compare Blocked and Stealth-Blocked Domains

- Review which domains appear in 'blocked' versus 'stealth-blocked'.
- A site with a high block count may actually allow connections to more unique third parties, something uBO Scope will expose.


### Step 5: Understand What Truly Affects Privacy

Focus on **distinct third-party servers connected** as the meaningful metric rather than just block counts or artificial test results.

- The fewer unique third parties connected, the better for privacy.
- High block counts can sometimes correlate with more connections allowed, due to filtering strategies.

## 5. Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Comparing Two Content Blockers

1. On the same webpage, enable one content blocker.
2. Observe uBO Scope’s badge and popup data: note number of third-party connections.
3. Disable and enable a different content blocker.
4. Observe changes in third-party connections in uBO Scope.

Outcome: You’ll often find that a blocker with fewer badge blocks may connect to fewer unique third parties, indicating better privacy.


### Example 2: Analyzing an Ad Blocker Test Page

- Visit a popular claims-based "ad blocker test" site.
- Observe large numbers of blocked requests but also many allowed connections.
- Use uBO Scope popup to see stealth-blocked and allowed connections.

Learning: These test sites generate unrealistic traffic that doesn’t reflect real browsing; uBO Scope reveals actual connection behavior.

## 6. Best Practices and Tips

- **Regularly check uBO Scope popup** when browsing to understand your real privacy exposure.
- Use multiple real-world websites for testing rather than artificial test pages.
- Focus on distinct third-party domains contacted, *not* block counters.
- Keep uBO Scope updated to benefit from improvements in connection analytics.

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

| Issue | Description | Solution |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Badge count not updating or missing data | Extension lacks permissions or is not active | Reinstall uBO Scope and ensure `webRequest` permission granted; restart browser if needed. See [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/setup-introduction/troubleshooting-common-issues). |
| Confusing block counts across blockers | Relying on badge block counts alone fosters false conclusions | Use uBO Scope popup to verify actual distinct third-party connections instead. |
| Over-reliance on ad blocker test sites | These sites use fabricated requests | Avoid test pages for privacy assessment; use normal browsing with uBO Scope analyzing connections. |

## 8. Next Steps

- Explore the uBO Scope popup in more detail: see [Exploring the Popup](/guides/getting-started/popup-intro).
- Learn how to objectively compare blockers using uBO Scope: [Compare Content Blockers](/guides/practical-use-cases/compare-content-blockers).
- If interested in filtering technologies and privacy tools, investigate [Maintaining Filter Lists](/guides/practical-use-cases/maintain-filter-lists).

## Appendix: Understanding uBO Scope’s Popup Sections

- **Domains Connected:** Total unique third-party servers connected (allowed).
- **Not Blocked:** Domains from which connections were successful and allowed by the content blocker.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains blocked so that the webpage cannot observe blocking; these connections never complete.
- **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked and typically visible to the webpage.
