# Monitoring Third-party Connections with uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide walks you through using uBO Scope to identify and analyze all third-party domains a visited webpage attempts to reach. It helps you distinguish essential connections, such as content delivery networks (CDNs), from potentially undesirable or privacy-invasive third parties. Practical examples and explanations ensure you can effectively interpret the data uBO Scope presents for your active browser tab.

---

## What You Will Achieve
- See all third-party domains contacted by the webpage you visit
- Understand categories of connection outcomes: not blocked, stealth-blocked, and blocked
- Differentiate benign essential services from potentially unwanted third parties
- Use real-world examples to make informed decisions about privacy exposure

---

## Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and activated on your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser
- Permissions granted for uBO Scope to monitor network requests
- Familiarity with basic web browsing and extension toolbar interaction
- Recommended: Review the [Feature Quick Tour](/overview/core-architecture-concepts/feature-quick-tour) for a primer on popup UI elements

---

## Understanding the Popup Interface
The uBO Scope popup summarizes all remote server connections initiated by the active tab, grouping them into three distinct outcome categories:

- **Not blocked:** Domains from which connections succeeded
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains whose connections were silently redirected or stealthily blocked
- **Blocked:** Domains whose connections failed or were explicitly blocked by the system

At the top, the domain and hostname of the current active tab are shown. Below that, a domain count indicates how many distinct third-party domains were contacted successfully (not blocked).

## Step-by-Step: Monitoring Third-party Connections

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon while on the webpage you want to analyze. The popup will load the summary data for the current active tab.

**Expected Result:** The popup displays the tab hostname at the top and lists domains under the three outcome categories.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret the Tab Hostname">
Review the top header that shows the tab's full hostname and its registered domain in Unicode format. This helps you ensure you are examining the correct webpage.

**Tip:** The popup translates punycode to human-readable Unicode for internationalized domains.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Domain Count">
Look at the 'domains connected' summary. This number reflects the count of unique third-party domains successfully contacted (not blocked).

**Decision Point:** A lower count generally means reduced third-party exposure and potentially better privacy.
</Step>

<Step title="Analyze Each Outcome Section">
Expand each of the three sections — not blocked, stealth-blocked, and blocked — to review the domains listed. Each domain has a request count badge showing how many connections involved it.

- **Not blocked:** Identify domains you recognize, such as CDNs (e.g., `cloudflare.com`, `akamai.net`) which are typically essential.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains whose presence indicates that some connections were silently redirected or obscured.
- **Blocked:** Domains that the browser or content blockers prevented from loading.

**Example:** Seeing domains like `google-analytics.com` under not blocked might indicate tracking activity.
</Step>

<Step title="Distinguish Essential vs. Unwanted Third Parties">
Use your knowledge or external resources to differentiate legitimate third parties (e.g., CDN providers, social media widgets) from potentially privacy-invasive trackers or advertising domains.

**Tip:** Consider frequently visited websites: a low number of benign CDNs is expected, while a high diversity of unknown or advertising domains could signal privacy concerns.
</Step>

<Step title="Use Insights to Adjust Your Blocking or Browsing Behavior">
Based on what you discover, decide whether to adjust your content blocker settings or avoid certain sites to enhance privacy.

**Verification:** Refresh the webpage and check if domain counts or domain lists change, indicating dynamic third-party requests.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Example Scenario
Suppose you visit a news website and open the uBO Scope popup:

- Tab hostname shows `www.examplenews.com` with domain `examplenews.com`.
- The not blocked section lists 12 domains, including `examplenews.com` CDN domains and some ad network domains.
- The stealth-blocked section contains a few ad-related domains that seem to be stealth-blocked.
- The blocked section has no entries.

**Analysis:** The site connects to known CDNs plus several advertising-related domains. Stealth blocking is present but no outright blocks were triggered. You decide to increase privacy by using stricter filters or avoid pages with high exposure counts.

---

## Best Practices and Tips
- **Regular Monitoring:** Check uBO Scope regularly to track changes in third-party exposure as websites update their content.
- **Familiarize with Domains:** Maintain a list or use privacy tools to identify known trackers versus legitimate services.
- **Check Multiple Tabs:** Each tab has independent connection data reflecting its unique network activity.
- **Beware of False Assumptions:** A higher number of blocked domains does not always mean better privacy. Focus on the unique allowed domains count.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Popup Observations">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows ‘NO DATA’ or Empty Lists">
Ensure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions enabled. Verify the extension has access to active tabs and webRequest API as described in installation guides.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Counts Do Not Update After Navigating">
Refreshing the page and reopening the popup forces data refresh. If problem persists, restart the browser or check for extension conflicts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Domains Appear in All Sections">
Some domains may appear due to redirects or stealth blocking. Consult documentation on stealth blocked behavior to better interpret these results.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

This flow illustrates how clicking the toolbar icon triggers a query to the background script, which aggregates network request outcomes per tab. The popup then presents this data sorted by blocking results.
