# Supporting Filter List Maintenance with uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide empowers filter list maintainers to effectively use uBO Scope for monitoring real-world third-party remote server connections initiated by webpages. It is especially designed for scenarios where access to browser developer tools is limited or unavailable, such as on locked-down browsers or devices.

Using uBO Scope’s popup interface, maintainers can capture actionable data about network connections, identify domains that evade existing filters, and share findings to refine and improve filter lists. This guide leads you step-by-step through collecting, interpreting, and utilizing connection data to enhance filter effectiveness.

---

## Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and active in a supported browser (Chromium, Firefox, Safari).
- Basic familiarity with domain-based filtering concepts and third-party network requests.
- Ability to access and open the uBO Scope popup interface during browsing sessions.

---

## What You Will Achieve
- Capture precise data on allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked third-party connections for any webpage.
- Identify domains that consistently connect despite existing filter rules.
- Export or record connection data to support filter refinement.
- Collaborate effectively using real-world evidence gathered via uBO Scope.

---

## Estimated Time
5 to 15 minutes per session, depending on browsing activity and complexity of connections.

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope while browsing

1. Navigate to the webpage you want to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
3. The popup window will display the hostname at the top, indicating the tab you are analyzing.

<Tip>
Make sure the page has fully loaded or interacted with the site to generate network requests before opening uBO Scope.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Understand the connection categories on the popup

- **not blocked**: Domains from which connections were allowed.
- **stealth-blocked**: Domains for which connections were blocked quietly, without triggering typical indicators.
- **blocked**: Domains explicitly blocked by filter rules or content blockers.

Each section lists third-party domain names with counts of requests.

### Step 3: Identify unexpected or frequent third-party domains

1. Review the domains under the “not blocked” and “stealth-blocked” sections carefully.
2. Look for domains that:
   - Appear frequently across browsing sessions.
   - Are unexpected or unknown to you.
   - Do not have corresponding rules in your current filter lists.

<Tip>
Use the domain counts to prioritize domains generating the most requests for further examination.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Collect data for analysis

- Capture a screenshot of the popup or copy the domain names and counts manually.
- Optionally, record multiple browsing sessions to observe recurring domains.

<Tip>
If you are performing filter maintenance for a site or category, record data across different pages and interaction points for comprehensive coverage.
</Tip>

### Step 5: Cross-reference identified domains with filter lists

- Check whether the domains showing connections are covered by existing filters.
- For domains missing from filter lists, consider creating or updating filter rules to block unwanted connections.

### Step 6: Share findings and collaborate

- Communicate collected domain data with your filter list team.
- Provide context such as counts, connection types (“allowed”, “blocked”, “stealth-blocked”), and the host page.

<Tip>
Encourage other maintainers to validate findings through uBO Scope on their own devices for consistency.
</Tip>

## Practical Tips
- Regularly periodically perform data captures on sites known for unwanted third-party connections.
- Use domain counts and connection outcomes to prioritize domains for blocking or whitelist review.
- Pay special attention to stealth-blocked connections, as they may indicate evasion techniques needing filter refinement.

---

## Common Pitfalls
- **Confusing first-party and third-party domains:** uBO Scope focuses on third-party connections; ensure you understand the distinction when assessing which domains to block.
- **Relying on a single snapshot:** Network connections can vary per visit; multiple observations improve accuracy.
- **Ignoring legitimate services:** Not all third-party domains require blocking; identify CDNs or essential services to avoid site breakage.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If the popup shows "NO DATA" or no domains:
  - Refresh the tab and wait for network requests.
  - Confirm that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (activeTab, webRequest).
  - Verify that your browser supports reporting network requests through the `webRequest` API.

- If some expected network connections are missing, check if other privacy tools or DNS-level blockers are interfering with data collection.

## Example Scenario

Suppose you maintain filters for an e-commerce site and notice consistent connections to a suspicious tracking domain under "not blocked" in uBO Scope's popup.

1. You visit multiple pages on the site.
2. Open uBO Scope each time and note domain counts.
3. Confirm the domain is absent from your filter lists.
4. Create a new filter blocking that domain.
5. Test again by opening uBO Scope; the domain should now move to the "blocked" section or no longer appear.

This evidence-driven approach ensures filters target actual connections seen in the wild.
