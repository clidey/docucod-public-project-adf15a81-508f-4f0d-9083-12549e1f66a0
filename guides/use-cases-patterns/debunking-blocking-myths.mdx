# Debunking Blocking Myths with uBO Scope

## 1. Introduction

This guide equips you to dispel widespread misconceptions about content blockers using uBO Scope as an objective, evidence-based tool. Many users equate a high “block count” badge on their extension icon with better blocking, but this can be misleading. Instead, uBO Scope helps you identify the true measure of content blocking effectiveness by focusing on actual network exposure to third-party domains.

By following real-world examples in this guide, you will learn how to use uBO Scope to observe network connections, interpret results, and make informed judgments about your content blockers—beyond simple block counts or unreliable "ad blocker test" pages.

---

## 2. What This Guide Helps You Accomplish

- Understand the **difference between block count and network exposure** to third parties.
- Learn why a higher block count does not necessarily mean better blocking.
- Use uBO Scope’s detailed logging and popup interface to identify true third-party server connections.
- Recognize the limitations of common online "ad blocker test" webpages.
- Confidently evaluate and compare the efficacy of content blockers based on network activity.

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and enabled in a supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with browsing web content and accessing browser extensions.
- For best results, a content blocker (such as uBlock Origin or uBO Lite) installed alongside uBO Scope.

### Expected Outcome

You will be able to analyze network requests independently of block counts, see which third-party domains successfully connect, and debunk common myths about blocker performance.

### Time Estimate

Approximately 15–30 minutes to follow examples and interpret results.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate.

## 3. Understanding the Myth: Block Count vs. Network Exposure

Many users falsely assume that:

> _"A content blocker with a higher block count is always better because it blocks more unwanted content."

### Why This Is a Myth

- The block count on a badge reflects **number of blocked network requests**, not the **number of distinct third-party domains contacted**.
- It's possible that a content blocker with a higher block count actually allows connections to **more distinct third-party servers** — meaning your browser is exposed to more domains despite blocking more requests.
- Thus, a blocker with a lower badge number of blocks but fewer distinct third-party connections is **more effective** at limiting network exposure.

<u>uBO Scope measures the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connects to, providing a more accurate picture of privacy exposure.</u>

## 4. Using uBO Scope to Explore Blocking Behavior

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope Popup on Active Tab

- Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
- The popup panel shows:
  - The top site domain at the top.
  - Three sections displaying:
    - **Not Blocked** (allowed third-party domains)
    - **Stealth Blocked** (requests stealth-blocked by a content blocker)
    - **Blocked** (requests explicitly blocked)
  - A summary of total connected distinct domains.

### Step 2: Open Sample Webpages with Different Blocking Configurations

Test with:

- No blocker enabled.
- Content blocker enabled with different filter lists.
- Content blocker disabled.

### Step 3: Observe the Badge and Popup Data

- Note the badge count (block count) reported on the extension icon.
- Compare with the **number of distinct domains** listed under the "not blocked" section in the popup.

### Step 4: Analyze Differences

- A higher block count badge does not always translate to fewer connected remote domains.
- When block count is high but "not blocked" domains are many, the extension allows many distinct third parties.
- When block count is low but "not blocked" domains are few, blocking is more effective at reducing exposure.

### Step 5: Draw Conclusions

- Focus on minimizing the count of distinct third-party domains allowed rather than maximizing block count.

## 5. Real-World Example

Imagine visiting a news website with uBO Scope running alongside a content blocker:

- **Scenario A:** Block count badge shows 25
- **Popup shows:** 15 allowed third-party domains

- **Scenario B:** Block count badge shows 15
- **Popup shows:** 8 allowed third-party domains

<u>Despite Scenario A showing a higher block count (25), you are exposed to almost twice as many third-party domains than Scenario B.</u>

This means Scenario B’s content blocker configuration is more privacy-preserving despite the lower block count.

---

## 6. Why You Should Avoid "Ad Blocker Test" Webpages

Many ad blocker test sites are unreliable because:

- They create **artificial network requests** for domains that real-world websites don't use.
- They can't detect **stealth-blocking** mechanisms employed by modern blockers.
- They do not reflect **real browsing conditions** or network activity.

<u>uBO Scope’s methodology measures actual network connections during your typical browsing, offering a realistic, trustworthy understanding of content blocking effectiveness.</u>

---

## 7. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope in conjunction with your preferred content blocker to gain accurate visibility on third-party connections.
- Interpret the extension badge as the count of third-party domains your browser connected to; lower is better.
- Regularly review the popup data to spot unexpected domains or increased exposure.
- Avoid relying on raw block counts when comparing blockers; deeper network analysis is critical.
- Remember that some third parties, like CDN providers, are often legitimate and unavoidable.

<Tip>
If you don’t see data in the popup or the badge doesn’t update:
- Confirm uBO Scope has the necessary permissions, especially `webRequest`.
- Make sure background scripts are running.
- Verify the content blocker you use does not interfere with webRequest reporting.
- Try disabling and re-enabling uBO Scope.
- Restart your browser if issues persist.
</Tip>
