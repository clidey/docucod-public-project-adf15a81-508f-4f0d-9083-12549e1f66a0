# Evaluating Filter List and Content Blocker Efficacy

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide shows you how to use uBO Scope to rigorously compare the network behavior of webpages under different content blockers or filter lists. You will learn how to identify stealth blocking techniques, DNS-level blocking effects, and verify actual third-party connections through live monitoring of network requests using uBO Scope.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your browser (Chromium, Firefox, or Safari).
- Basic understanding of uBO Scope’s badge count and popup user interface (refer to [Understanding the Badge Count and Popup Panel](https://example.com/guides/getting-started-essentials/understanding-badge-and-popup)).
- At least two different content blockers or filter lists installed and switchable in your browser.
- A test webpage or set of webpages for analysis.

### Expected Outcome
By completing this guide, you will be able to:
- Confidently interpret uBO Scope’s popup outcomes—allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Detect when a content blocker uses stealth techniques versus outright blocking.
- Compare third-party connection counts and domains across filter list configurations.
- Validate real network exposure beyond misleading block counts.

### Time Estimate
15–30 minutes depending on the number of blockers tested and the complexity of the webpages analyzed.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Testing Environment
- Install and enable uBO Scope alongside the content blockers or filter lists you want to evaluate.
- Ensure your browser allows background webRequest monitoring and that uBO Scope has necessary permissions.
- Close unnecessary tabs and extensions to avoid noise in network data.

### 2. Open uBO Scope and Familiarize Yourself with the Popup Panel
- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- Observe the badge count: this indicates the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- In the popup panel, notice the categorized lists:
  - **Allowed**: Domains for which connections succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where redirection or stealth blocking was detected.
  - **Blocked**: Domains with outright blocked connections.

### 3. Baseline Measurement Without Content Blockers
- Disable all content blockers or filter lists except uBO Scope.
- Open or refresh your test webpage.
- Click the uBO Scope icon to view the badge count and popup details.
- Record the number and names of domains under each category.

### 4. Enable the First Content Blocker/Filter List
- Enable the first content blocker or filter list you want to test.
- Reload the same test webpage.
- Open uBO Scope’s popup panel.
- Compare the badge count and domain lists against your baseline.
- Note changes in allowed, stealth, and blocked domains.

### 5. Enable the Second Content Blocker/Filter List
- Disable the first content blocker and enable the second one.
- Reload the test webpage.
- Check the badge and popup categories.
- Record differences from both the baseline and first blocker.

### 6. Analyze Stealth Blocking and DNS-Level Blocking
- Pay special attention to the **stealth-blocked** category. This indicates that the content blocker may be silently redirecting connections or using evasive techniques rather than outright blocking.
- Recognize that some blocking may occur at DNS level and may not appear as blocked directly but reflected as stealth or allowed events.

### 7. Compare Third-Party Connection Exposure
- Focus on the **allowed** domains list and badge count as the true measure of network exposure.
- A lower allowed count typically indicates better blocking effectiveness, regardless of block count.
- Verify if any domains persist across blockers or appear only with certain filters.

### 8. Repeat Tests for Additional Filters and Real-World Sites
- Test other content blockers or filter lists as needed.
- Try different webpages, including privacy-critical sites, to broaden your evaluation.

### 9. Document Your Findings
- Create a comparison table or notes summarizing badge counts, number, and names of allowed, stealth, and blocked domains per blocker.
- Use this data to determine the reliability and real-world efficacy of each content blocker or filter list.

### Verification Steps
- Confirm uBO Scope’s popup updates promptly on page reload.
- Verify domain names are displayed in Unicode for readability.
- Ensure badge count accurately reflects distinct allowed third-party domains.

## Practical Examples

### Example: Comparing uBO Lite and an Alternative Blocker
| Content Blocker | Allowed Domains (Count) | Stealth-Blocked Domains | Blocked Domains |
|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| None (Baseline)  | 34                      | 0                      | 0               |
| uBO Lite        | 8                       | 4                      | 12              |
| AlternativeX    | 12                      | 10                     | 2               |

- Interpretation: Although AlternativeX shows fewer outright blocked domains, it allows more third-party connections than uBO Lite, suggesting less effective blocking.
- Stealth blocking is more prevalent with AlternativeX, indicating reliance on redirection or silent blocking techniques.

### Using uBO Scope Popup for Analysis
- Look under **allowed** to see exactly which third-party domains your browser connected to.
- Under **stealth-blocked**, check for domains redirected or modified silently; these may still expose some user data.
- The **blocked** list shows domains where connections were clearly prevented.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **No data displayed in popup:** Ensure you have active tabs open and uBO Scope has permission to monitor web requests.
- **Badge count not updating:** Try reloading the current tab; background processing may be delayed due to batching.
- **Unexpectedly high allowed count:** Check that the tested content blocker is actually enabled and active.

### Best Practices
- Always test on real-world websites with typical browsing behavior.
- Avoid relying on block count alone to measure a content blocker’s effectiveness.
- Use multiple measurements over time for consistency.

### Performance Considerations
- uBO Scope batches network request monitoring every second to optimize performance.
- Running multiple content blockers simultaneously for evaluation may affect network behavior.

### Alternative Approaches
- For deep analysis, combine uBO Scope with browser developer tools network panels.
- Use uBO Scope in combination with filter list testing in isolated profiles.
