# Best Practices for Privacy and Web Health Using uBO Scope

Welcome to the actionable guide on leveraging uBO Scope for **enhancing your web privacy** and maintaining **optimal web health**. This page focuses exclusively on practical tips, patterns, and workflows you can adopt to reduce third-party network exposure, distinguish legitimate domains from excessive connections, and establish a trustworthy baseline for your browsing environment.

---

## 1. Establishing Your Baseline: Understanding Normal Third-Party Connections

Before you can improve your network privacy, you need to understand what normal looks like for the websites you visit regularly.

### Why Establish a Baseline?
- To differentiate **legitimate** third-party connections from suspicious or excessive ones.
- To recognize how many third-party domains a website typically contacts when using your default blocking setup.
- To create a reference point for spotting unusual or new connections.

### How to Establish a Baseline with uBO Scope

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel">
Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Visit Your Favorite Website">
Load the website you want to analyze in a new browser tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Badge Count and Popup Details">
The toolbar badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains allowed to connect. The popup breaks down these domains into:
- **Not blocked (allowed)**
- **Stealth-blocked**
- **Blocked**
</Step>
<Step title="Record Baseline Counts">
Note down the number of allowed third-party domains and observe which domains are shown in the allowed section.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Regularly visiting the same websites and establishing baselines helps detect changes caused by website updates or unintentional privacy leakages.

## 2. Limiting Third-Party Network Exposure Effectively

uBO Scope helps you identify and minimize unnecessary third-party connections that can compromise privacy or degrade web performance.

### Practical Patterns to Reduce Third-Party Connections

- **Review high-count allowed domains:**
  - Excessive allowed third-party connections often indicate trackers or ad networks.
- **Use uBO Scope to detect stealth blocking:**
  - Stealth-blocked domains reveal hidden blocking by your content blocker; these should be monitored.
- **Investigate blocked entries:**
  - Confirm if any important service is unintentionally blocked and adjust filters if necessary.

### Steps to Limit Exposure

<Steps>
<Step title="Analyze Allowed Third-Party Domains">
In the popup panel, identify domains that frequently appear with a high count under “not blocked”. Check if these are essential or potentially invasive.
</Step>
<Step title="Cross-Reference Domains With Popular Blocklists">
Use community-maintained blocklists to decide whether to add certain domains to your own blocking rules.
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust Content Blocker or Browser Settings">
Configure your blocker or browser privacy settings to block or stealth-block unwanted domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Changes Using uBO Scope">
Reload the website and confirm that the badge count has decreased appropriately and the blocked/stealth-blocked lists reflect your new rules.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Not all third-party connections are harmful; major CDNs and essential service domains often appear in allowed connections. Aim to reduce unnecessary domains without breaking site functionality.
</Tip>

## 3. Interpreting Legitimate Domains Versus Excessive Connections

Discerning the nature of connected domains is crucial for effective privacy management.

### Identifying Legitimate Third-Party Domains

- Typically includes CDNs like `cloudflare.net`, `akamai.net`, `amazonaws.com`.
- Services trusted by the website for content delivery or core functionality.

### Recognizing Excessive or Suspicious Domains

- Domains appearing in large numbers with many counts, especially ad or tracking-related domains.
- Unfamiliar or unrelated domains that belong to analytics, marketing, or social media platforms.

### Using uBO Scope to Categorize Domains

- Check the **count** next to each domain in the popup for frequency of connection.
- Domains with high counts but no clear purpose often indicate privacy concerns.

<Note>
Excessive third-party connections not only increase privacy risk but also add performance overhead by loading additional resources.
</Note>

## 4. Best Practices Summary

- **Regularly establish and update baselines** for your most visited websites to track changes in third-party exposure.
- **Focus on reducing the number of allowed third-party domains** while ensuring website functionality stays intact.
- **Monitor stealth-blocked domains** to uncover hidden privacy protections and verify your blocker’s effectiveness.
- **Use domain counts as an indicator** of heavy third-party activity. Investigate domains with unusually high counts.
- **Leverage the detailed popup panel** in uBO Scope for insightful analysis of your browsing sessions.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and How to Resolve Them">
<Accordion title="High Number of Allowed Domains Despite Blocking">
- Verify your content blocker settings and ensure it is active.
- Check if some connections bypass blocking via other means (e.g., DNS-level blocking incompatible with uBO Scope).
- Review if any allowed domains are essential CDNs or services to avoid breaking sites.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth-Blocked Domains Not Updating">
- Stealth blocking may depend on your blocker’s current rules; update the blocker and refresh the tab.
- Some stealth blocking is deliberate to avoid detection; verify configurations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Data Shows No Information or 'NO DATA'">
- Confirm uBO Scope is properly installed and has required permissions.
- Reload the webpage or open a new tab.
- Check for browser compatibility and uBO Scope version.
</Accordion>
