# Analyzing Network Connections on a Webpage

Discover who your browser is talking to when you visit a webpage. This guide walks you through using uBO Scope's popup interface to inspect all attempted and successful network connections made by a website. You'll learn how to read connection outcomes, distinguish first-party from third-party domains, and interpret connection results to make informed privacy decisions.

---

## 1. Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
- Understand the popup interface that visualizes network connections per webpage.
- Learn to identify which domains and servers your browser connects to.
- Distinguish between connections that were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Gain actionable insights to evaluate the network exposure of any website you visit.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser.
- An active browsing session on a website you want to inspect.
- Basic familiarity with browser extensions and accessing toolbar icons.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will confidently interpret the popup panel to see detailed real-time reported network connections for the active tab, categorized by connection outcome and domain.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 5-10 minutes for an initial familiarization and inspection.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate — no technical background required.

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions to Analyze Network Connections

### Opening the Popup Interface
1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser.
2. The popup panel will open, showing connection details for the currently active tab.

### Understanding the Main Popup Layout

- **Hostname Header:** Displays the current tab’s hostname, split into the subdomain and main domain.
- **Domains Connected Summary:** Shows the total number of distinct domains contacted.
- **Connection Outcome Sections:** The popup divides connections into three categories:
   - **Not Blocked:** Domains where network requests succeeded.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected stealthily.
   - **Blocked:** Domains where requests were explicitly blocked or errored.
- Each section lists domains contacted with a count of requests made to that domain.

---

### Detailed Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Check the Active Tab Hostname">
View the hostname displayed at the top, showing you exactly which webpage’s network connections you are inspecting. The left part shows any subdomain prefix; the right side shows the main domain, decoded to Unicode if internationalized.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domains Connected Summary">
Just below the hostname, note the number of distinct domains that the webpage connected to. A lower number often implies fewer third-party connections.
</Step>
<Step title={'Explore "Not Blocked" Domains'}>
Open the "not blocked" section. This lists domains whose requests succeeded, signifying active connections that fetched resources. The count next to each domain reflects how many requests targeted it.
</Step>
<Step title={'Investigate "Stealth-Blocked" Domains'}>
Review the stealth-blocked section to see domains where requests were redirected secretly, typically indicating stealth blocking to avoid webpage breakage or detection.
</Step>
<Step title={'Inspect "Blocked" Domains'}>
Explore the blocked section to identify domains where connection attempts failed due to explicit blocking or errors.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify First-Party vs. Third-Party Domains">
Understand that domains matching the active tab’s main domain are considered first-party. Third-party domains are everything else, which typically shows services the site uses externally.
</Step>
<Step title="Use the Request Counts as a Guide">
Higher counts next to a domain suggest more frequent interactions with that server. This information can guide your privacy decisions by highlighting heavily contacted third-party domains.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Interpret Badge Count Contextually:** The popup shows detailed domain connections, while the toolbar icon badge gives you a quick count of distinct third-party domains contacted. Use both in combination for a better picture.
- **Recognize Legitimate Third Parties:** Common third-party domains, such as CDN providers, often appear in the allowed list and may be necessary for website functionality.
- **Watch for Unexpected Third Parties:** A high number of unusual third-party domains might indicate excessive tracking or unwanted connections.
- **Use Regular Checks:** Periodically inspect network connections on sites you trust to establish a baseline of normal behavior.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### No Data Shown in Popup
- Ensure the tab is active and has fully loaded.
- Reload the webpage and reopen the popup.
- Confirm that uBO Scope has proper permissions and is enabled.

### Domain Names Display as Encoded or Unreadable
- uBO Scope automatically decodes internationalized domains using Punycode.
- If domain names still appear garbled, try updating or reinstalling the extension.

### Counts Not Updating in Real-Time
- Some browsers may delay background processing.
- Wait a few seconds and refresh the popup.
- Reload the tab to force new network activity.

## 5. Examples

### Example Scenario: Inspecting a News Website
When visiting a news website, open the uBO Scope popup. You'll likely observe:
- The site’s own domain under "not blocked" with multiple requests.
- Third-party analytics or ad network domains scattered in "not blocked" or "stealth-blocked".
- Some domains in the "blocked" section if you use content blockers.

Use these insights to balance site functionality and privacy by deciding if you want certain connections allowed or blocked.

## 6. Related Documentation & Next Steps

- **Understanding the Badge and Popup Interface:** Learn how to interpret the icon badge alongside popup details.
- **Interpreting Blocked and Stealth Connections:** Dive deeper into the meaning of each connection outcome.
- **System Architecture Overview:** Understand how uBO Scope processes and aggregates network data.
- **Installation and Setup Guides:** Ensure your extension is correctly installed and configured.

For ongoing mastery, revisit the Key Features document to appreciate the value uBO Scope brings to network inspection and privacy auditing.

## 7. Technical Details for Curious Users

- uBO Scope monitors network requests via browser `webRequest` API.
- It categorizes requests into allowed (successful), blocked (errored), and stealth-blocked (redirected stealthily).
- Domains are grouped using the Public Suffix List for accurate parent domain extraction.
- The popup fetches data asynchronously from the background script and displays live connection counts.

<Tip>
Use uBO Scope routinely to gain continuous visibility into which servers your browser interacts with, helping maintain control over your online privacy.
</Tip>

<Note>
uBO Scope currently does not provide controls to block or allow connections; it is an observational tool designed to report network connections.
</Note>

<Warning>
The extension relies on browser support for the `webRequest` API. Some browsers or restrictive settings may limit data availability.
