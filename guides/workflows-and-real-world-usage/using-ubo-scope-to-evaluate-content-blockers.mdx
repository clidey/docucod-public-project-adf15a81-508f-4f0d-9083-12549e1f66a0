# Using uBO Scope to Evaluate Other Content Blockers

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide enables you to leverage uBO Scope's independent reporting capabilities to compare different content blockers or privacy tools side-by-side. You will learn how to set up your tests to avoid misleading metrics, understand what network connection outcomes truly mean, and draw accurate conclusions about the effectiveness of content blockers in reducing third-party exposure.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and running in a supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Familiarity with the uBO Scope interface, especially the badge and popup displaying allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.
- At least two different content blockers or privacy tools installed for comparison.
- Access to real, non-fabricated websites reflecting typical browsing behavior.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Run consistent tests comparing various content blockers using uBO Scope as the objective measurement tool.
- Avoid common pitfalls such as relying on block counts or fabricated test webpages.
- Understand and interpret the true third-party connections and exposure.
- Make informed decisions about the effectiveness of content blockers based on network connection data.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 20–30 minutes to run tests and evaluate results.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate: Requires some understanding of content blockers and network connection concepts.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Testing Environment
1. Ensure uBO Scope and all content blockers you want to evaluate are installed and enabled in your browser.
2. Open a new browser window or profile where only the target content blocker is active to isolate its effects.
3. Confirm uBO Scope is active by checking that the toolbar icon shows a badge number when browsing.

### Step 2: Choose Real-World Websites as Test Targets
- Select commonly used websites that involve typical third-party requests (e.g., news sites, popular blogs, e-commerce platforms).
- Avoid using "ad blocker test" or fabricated test pages since these do not represent realistic network behavior and can mislead your assessment.

<Tip>
Select websites you frequently visit or that are representative of your browsing habits to get meaningful results.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Clear uBO Scope Data Before Testing
1. Close all other tabs except the one where you will conduct the test.
2. Restart the browser or refresh uBO Scope’s session state if possible (e.g., by disabling and re-enabling the extension) to remove residual data.

<Warning>
Residual data can affect the domain counts and skew your comparison results. Start each test with a fresh session.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Run the Test on Website #1 with Content Blocker #1
1. Visit the selected website.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup and observe the network connections:
   - Note the total number of third-party domains connected.
   - Review the breakdown of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.
3. Record the numbers clearly.

### Step 5: Repeat for Website #1 with Content Blocker #2
1. Disable Content Blocker #1 and enable Content Blocker #2.
2. Refresh the same website.
3. Open uBO Scope popup again and record the same metrics.

### Step 6: Compare Results Across Content Blockers
- Focus on the **number of allowed third-party domains** since fewer allowed domains mean less exposure and better blocking.
- Understand that a higher block count in a content blocker is not necessarily better if it allows more distinct third-party domains.
- Use the stealth-blocked category in uBO Scope to identify connections that the content blocker is blocking silently, which is valuable information.

### Step 7: Expand Testing to Additional Websites
- Repeat steps 4 to 6 across multiple websites to get a more comprehensive comparison.
- Keep consistent testing conditions for fairness.

### Step 8: Draw Conclusions
- Identify which content blocker minimizes the number of allowed third-party domains most effectively.
- Consider both the quantity and nature of blocked and stealth-blocked domains.
- Use your findings to choose or fine-tune the content blockers for your privacy needs.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Avoid Fake Test Sites:** "Ad blocker test" webpages often simulate unrealistic network traffic that content blockers handle with stealth techniques, misleading these tests.

- **Focus on Domains, Not Just Block Count:** uBO Scope emphasizes distinct third-party domains contacted. This is a better privacy indicator than raw counts of blocked requests.

- **Use Private Browsing or Separate Profiles:** This limits side effects from cache, cookies, and other session data.

- **Regularly Update Your Block Lists:** For content blockers relying on filter sets, ensure they are up to date for accurate results.

- **Interpret Stealth-Blocked Domains:** These indicate connections that are silently blocked or redirected, reflecting an extra layer of blocking sophistication.

- **Consistency:** Run your tests under similar network conditions and times for comparable results.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="No Data or Empty Popup in uBO Scope">
- Verify uBO Scope has necessary permissions.
- Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser.
- Refresh the browser window or restart the browser.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions that might interfere.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Inconsistent Badge Counts Between Tests">
- Clear browsing data and restart testing.
- Use a new browser profile to avoid persistent cookies and cached content.
- Confirm only one content blocker is active at a time.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Misleading Results from 'Ad Blocker Test' Websites">
- Avoid these test pages.
- Use real-world websites for accurate measurements.

## Example Scenario

Suppose you want to compare Content Blocker A and Content Blocker B on a popular news site:

- With Content Blocker A enabled, uBO Scope shows 15 allowed third-party domains, 5 stealth-blocked, and 10 blocked.
- With Content Blocker B enabled, uBO Scope shows 25 allowed, 15 stealth-blocked, and 5 blocked.

Despite Content Blocker B having a higher stealth-block and block count combined, it allows more distinct domains, meaning you have more third-party exposure. Content Blocker A provides better overall privacy in this case.
