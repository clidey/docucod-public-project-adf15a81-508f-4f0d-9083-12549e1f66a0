# Interpreting Blocked and Stealth Connections

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you understand how uBO Scope categorizes network connections in its interface, specifically what it means when connections are listed as **blocked** or **stealth-blocked**. You will learn how various content blockers and DNS filtering policies influence these outcomes and gain practical skills to assess your browsing privacy and security using this information.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed in your Chromium (122+), Firefox (128+), or Safari (18.5+) browser.
- Basic familiarity with uBO Scope's toolbar badge and popup interface (see the guide on [Understanding the Badge and Popup Interface](https://example.com/guides/getting-started/understanding-badge-and-ui)).
- A working internet connection and some browsing activity to generate network requests.

### Expected Outcome
By the end of this guide, you will be able to:
- Distinguish between **blocked** and **stealth-blocked** connections in the uBO Scope popup.
- Understand the underlying reasons why connections are categorized this way.
- Use these insights to evaluate how effectively your content blockers or DNS policies are protecting you.

### Time Estimate
About 10 minutes

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface
- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- The popup shows:
  - The number of distinct third-party domains connected.
  - Lists of domains categorized under **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

### 2. Understand What 'Blocked' Means
- Domains under **Blocked** represent remote servers for which network requests were attempted but ultimately failed due to filtering or blocking mechanisms.
- Common causes:
  - Content blocker rules actively denied the request.
  - DNS-based blocking prevented address resolution.
  - Network errors caused by external filters or firewalls.

### 3. Understand What 'Stealth-Blocked' Means
- **Stealth-blocked** connections denote requests that were redirected or silently blocked in a way that some content blockers use to avoid detection or minimize webpage breakage.
- These connections do not result in outright failures but are invisibly prevented or rerouted.
- Examples include:
  - Redirecting tracking requests to a local or non-existent server.
  - Using DNS tricks that intercept requests without triggering explicit errors.

### 4. Recognize How Different Content Blockers Impact Outcomes
- uBO Scope listens to browser network request events and reports outcomes regardless of which content blocker or DNS filter is engaged.
- If your content blocker uses stealth techniques, more domains may appear under **stealth-blocked**.
- If blocking is direct and explicit, more domains will appear under **blocked**.

### 5. Use This Information to Assess Your Privacy
- A lower number of **allowed** (not blocked) domains usually means fewer third parties are contacted.
- A high count of **blocked** or **stealth-blocked** domains indicates the content blocker or DNS filter is actively preventing connections.
- Analyze whether stealth blocking affects important site functionality by testing site behavior with and without your blocker.

### 6. Verify and Update Your Setup
- If you see no blocked or stealth domains despite expecting them, verify:
  - Your content blocker permissions and rules.
  - uBO Scope installation correctness.
  - DNS filtering setup.
- Refer to troubleshooting guides if problems arise.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Typical Privacy-Conscious Browser Session
You visit a news website:

- Allowed domains: content delivery networks (CDNs) and first-party domains.
- Blocked domains: known ad servers and trackers that your content blocker denies.
- Stealth-blocked domains: tracking requests silently redirected by your blocker to avoid site breakage.

### Example 2: DNS-Based Blocking Scenario
Your DNS provider enforces blocking on a set of malicious domains:

- Blocked domains show mostly DNS errors.
- Stealth-blocked domains remain few or none.
- You confirm via uBO Scope that blocking is effective independently of browser extension rules.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues When Interpreting Blocked Connections">
<Accordion title="Blocked and Stealth Lists Are Empty">
- Confirm uBO Scope is installed and active.
- Check that your browser has granted `webRequest` permissions to uBO Scope.
- Verify you have visited a site that triggers third-party connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpectedly High Allowed Count">
- Your content blocker may be in a permissive mode or disabled.
- Some third parties are essential for site functionality and cannot be blocked.
- Investigate your filter lists and DNS settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Too Many Stealth-Blocked Domains" >
- Stealth blocking may cause subtle site issues.
- Test disabling stealth blocking in your content blocker (if applicable).
- Use uBO Scope to monitor changes in domain counts.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Best Practices
- Use uBO Scope in combination with your content blocker to monitor real network outcomes.
- Regularly update filter lists to improve blocking accuracy.
- Avoid reliance on generic “block count” metrics; focus on unique third-party domains contacted.
- Be mindful of sites breaking due to blocking—investigate stealth blocking as a compromise.

<Tip>
Understanding the distinction between blocked and stealth-blocked connections allows you to better evaluate how well your content blockers or DNS filters protect your privacy without unnecessarily breaking functional parts of websites.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Not all blocked domains represent malicious or tracking entities. Some content is essential, so focus on patterns over isolated entries.
</Warning>

<Check>
Regularly check the uBO Scope popup after browsing new sites to understand how domain connections change with your settings.
