# Supporting Filter List Maintainers with uBO Scope

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide empowers filter list maintainers to leverage uBO Scope to identify missed domains, stealth requests, and real-world network behaviors. It details how to use the extension's popup panel to discover network requests unseen by other tools, especially on restricted platforms or locked-down devices.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled in a supported browser (Chromium, Firefox, Safari).
- Basic familiarity with browser extensions and filter list terminology.
- Access to a webpage where you want to analyze third-party network requests.

### Expected Outcome
After following this guide, you will:
- Reliably identify distinct third-party domains contacted by a webpage.
- Distinguish allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.
- Understand the source of missed connections that standard debugging tools might hide.
- Use real-world, live evidence to improve filter list efficiency and accuracy.

### Time Estimate
~ 10–20 minutes per analysis session, depending on site complexity and investigation depth.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate – assumes understanding of browser network requests and filter list maintenance.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open uBO Scope Popup for Target Page
- Click the uBO Scope browser toolbar icon while on the webpage you want to analyze.
- The popup will display the tab's hostname and domain at the top.
- The "domains connected" counter summarizes third-party domains from which network requests were allowed.

*Expected Result:* Popup loads showing three sections: "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" domains.

### 2. Interpret Domain Outcome Sections
- **Not Blocked:** Lists domains contacted successfully, providing a view into which third parties are actively delivering resources.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Contains domains where connections were intercepted by stealth blocking techniques—requests that don't appear outright blocked but are internally redirected or canceled.
- **Blocked:** Shows domains actively blocked by content blockers or network policies.

*Decision Point:* Focus on "stealth-blocked" domains to uncover connections that might be hidden or misclassified by traditional tools.

### 3. Identify Missed or Unlisted Domains
- Review the blocked and stealth-blocked lists for unexpected or unknown domains.
- Consider whether these domains represent tracker infrastructure missed by your filter list.
- Note domains appearing only in "allowed" that may have slipped past blocking rules.

*Verification Step:* Cross-reference these domains against your filter list to confirm coverage.

### 4. Understand Stealth Request Behavior
- Recognize that stealth-blocked entries can reveal bypass attempts or adaptive resource fetching.
- Use this knowledge to adjust filter lists or blocking rules to counter evasive domains effectively.

### 5. Share Findings for Filter List Updates
- Document domains you identify as missed or stealthy.
- Submit these domains along with context to your filter list repository or maintainers.
- Validate updates with repeated use of uBO Scope to ensure changes take effect.

*Expected Result:* More comprehensive and robust filter lists informed by real-world network observations.

## Examples & Sample Analysis

### Example Scenario: Video Streaming Site
- Visiting a streaming site with uBO Scope open shows several allowed domains related to CDNs.
- Stealth-blocked section reveals additional analytics domains not explicitly blocked.
- Blocked list includes well-known ad servers.

*Action:* Add stealth-blocked analytics domains to filter lists after verifying their behavior.

### Sample Domain Row Output
```plaintext
example-cdn.com        12
tracking.analytics.com  8
ads.network.com        3
```
- The number represents connection attempts from the page.
- Use these counts to prioritize high-frequency connections.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Popup shows "NO DATA":** Ensure you are on an active tab with network requests; reload the page if needed.
- **No stealth-blocked domains appearing:** Some browsers or configurations may limit visibility; ensure permissions are granted.
- **Unexpected empty lists:** Clear extension cache (via browser extension settings) or reinstall.

### Best Practices
- Always cross-verify suspicious domains outside uBO Scope with other network analysis tools like browser devtools or external monitoring.
- Use consistent browser environment to rule out platform-specific anomalies when analyzing stealth requests.
- Refresh or navigate pages dynamically to catch delayed network requests.

### Performance Considerations
- uBO Scope monitors network requests asynchronously; allow a few seconds for data to populate fully after page load.

### Alternative Approaches
- Combine uBO Scope insights with filter list testing on various mobile or restricted platforms where debugging tools are less accessible.

## Summary
This guide enables filter list maintainers to harness uBO Scope effectively to detect hidden or missed third-party network activity. The extension provides practical visibility into allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked network domains, empowering maintainers to refine filter lists based on real-world browsing behavior, even on environments where traditional network tools are limited or unavailable.
