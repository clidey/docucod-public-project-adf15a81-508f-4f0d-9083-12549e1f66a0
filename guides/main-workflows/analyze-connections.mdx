# Analyzing Page Connections and Third Parties with uBO Scope

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide explains how to use uBO Scope to analyze all network connections initiated by a webpage. You'll learn how to reveal every third-party remote server a page interacts with, distinguish between allowed, blocked, and stealth connections, and interpret the significance of the toolbar badge count for your privacy.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and enabled in your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser.
- A webpage loaded in the active tab to analyze.
- Basic familiarity with browser extensions and the toolbar badge.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Open and navigate the uBO Scope popup interface.
- See categorized lists of domains related to the current tab's network activity.
- Understand connection outcomes and their privacy implications.
- Use the toolbar badge count to gauge the number of distinct third-party connections.

### Time Estimate
5-10 minutes depending on your familiarity with browser tools.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser.
- The popup will open, displaying details about network connections for the current tab.

<Check>
If the popup shows "NO DATA," ensure the page has fully loaded and that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions.
</Check>

### 2. Understand the Popup Layout

The popup interface divides third-party connections into three categories:
- **Not Blocked:** Domains where connections were successfully made.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were redirected silently.
- **Blocked:** Domains where the connection failed or was denied.

Underneath each category title, domains are listed with counts showing the number of requests associated with each.

### 3. Interpret the Domain Names

Domains are displayed in Unicode format for readability, converted from punycode if necessary.

- The top heading shows the current tab's hostname and domain.
- Domains are sorted alphabetically within their respective categories.

### 4. Examine the Toolbar Badge Count

- The badge number on the uBO Scope icon shows the number of **distinct third-party domains** with allowed connections.
- A **lower badge count indicates fewer third-party servers**, typically meaning better privacy.

### 5. Investigate Real-World Scenarios

- Browse your favorite websites and open the uBO Scope popup.
- Observe which domains appear under each category.
- Check how new browsing activity changes the badge count.

### 6. Confirm Accuracy and Detail

- To verify, interact with different page elements that load content from various third parties.
- Refresh the popup to ensure new network connections are reported accurately.

### 7. Use Connection Statuses to Understand Privacy Impact

- **Allowed Connections:** Resources loaded openly, representing potential privacy exposures.
- **Stealth-Blocked Connections:** Redirected or replaced requests often by stealth blocking to evade detection; these are effectively blocked without easy webpage detection.
- **Blocked Connections:** Requests that failed due to blocking rules or errors.

### 8. Close and Continue Browsing

- Keep the popup open for real-time monitoring or close it and revisit when needed.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Use the badge count as a privacy indicator.** High numbers often imply many third-party trackers or asset servers.
- **Pay close attention to stealth-blocked entries** as they represent effective blocking without visible errors.
- **Remember not all third-party connections are inherently bad**; content delivery networks (CDNs) are common legitimate third parties.
- **Reload the page if data appears stale or incomplete.** uBO Scope updates in near real-time but may lag briefly.
- **Combine uBO Scope with a content blocker for enhanced privacy insights.**

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Connection Analysis">  
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA'">  
- Ensure you are viewing an active tab with a loaded webpage.
- Verify the extension has permissions in your browser settings.
- Reload the tab and re-open the popup.
- Check for conflicting extensions that may interfere with network monitoring.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Change">  
- Confirm you are browsing HTTPS or HTTP sites.
- Make sure the page triggers third-party requests; some pages may not.
- Check for browser session issues and restart the browser if necessary.
- Review the 'Troubleshooting Installation & Setup' guide for permission or compatibility problems.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Unexpected Domains or Missing Entries">  
- Keep in mind uBO Scope reports requests through the browserâ€™s webRequest API; requests outside this scope (e.g., some WebSocket connections) might not show.
- Verify the browser version is supported and up to date.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example Scenario

Imagine you visit `https://example.com`:

- You click the toolbar icon.
- The popup shows **not blocked** entries such as `cdn.example.net` and `fonts.gstatic.com`.
- Under **blocked**, you see `tracker.trackingdomain.com`.
- The badge count is 3, indicating three distinct allowed third-party domains.
- When you interact with embedded videos or ads, new entries can appear, changing counts.

You now have a clear sense of how many third parties your browsing involves and how many are blocked or stealth blocked.

## Understanding the Badge Count Importance

The badge on uBO Scope is a privacy health indicator:

- **Lower is better:** It means fewer third-party servers received your data.
- **Higher counts:** Suggest multiple domains interacting, possibly including trackers.

This number reflects the count of *distinct* third-party domains with allowed connections, not total requests.
