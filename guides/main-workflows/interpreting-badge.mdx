## Interpreting the Badge and Main UI

Understanding the badge count and the main user interface of uBO Scope is essential to unlocking its full value as a tool for monitoring third-party remote connections in your browser. This guide explains what the badge count represents, what low versus high numbers mean, and how these relate to the third-party servers your browser connects to. You will also learn when to be concerned about the badge count and how to use this insight to make informed decisions during everyday browsing.

---

### 1. What the Badge Count Represents

The badge displayed on the browser toolbar icon for uBO Scope shows a single number:

- **This number equals the count of distinct third-party domains with successful connections for the current browser tab.**

By 'third-party domains,' we mean domains that are different from the main website you are visiting in that tab. Each distinct third-party domain successfully connected to is tallied precisely once regardless of how many requests were made to it.

#### Why Distinct Domains Matter

Third-party domains represent external entities involved in your browsing session, such as ad networks, analytics services, content delivery networks (CDNs), or other embedded resources. Tracking them distinctly provides a clearer picture of your actual exposure to third parties rather than a raw count of all individual requests.

---

### 2. Understanding Low vs High Badge Counts

- **Low Badge Count (e.g., 0 to low single digits):**
  - Indicates minimal third-party connections.
  - Typically expected on privacy-conscious sites or when strong content blocking is in place.
  - Common legitimate third parties might include essential CDNs or trusted services.

- **High Badge Count (e.g., dozens or more):**
  - Suggests your browser is connecting to many third-party servers.
  - Could imply higher tracking exposure or loading of excessive external content.
  - May occur on websites with heavy ad frameworks or multiple analytics providers.

<Tip>
A higher badge count is not necessarily ‘bad’ by default, but it is worth investigating if you were expecting a more privacy-preserving experience.
</Tip>

### 3. Relationship Between Badge Count and Network Requests

Each network request your browser makes can have one of several outcomes:

- **Allowed:** Connection succeeded and content was fetched.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Request was silently blocked by your primary content blocker but might still be observed by some scripts.
- **Blocked:** Request was actively blocked and prevented from completing.

uBO Scope counts only the domains of connection outcomes that succeeded (Allowed) for the badge. The badge **does not** count blocked or stealth-blocked domains.

---

### 4. When to Worry About a High Badge Count

Consider these signs as triggers to review the badge count carefully:

- The badge count drastically increases on sites where you expect few third-party requests (e.g., banking, email, or privacy-focused websites).
- Unexpected third-party domains appear, especially those associated with advertising or tracking.
- You notice performance slowdown or suspect privacy issues correlated with the badge count.

<Tip>
Use the uBO Scope popup interface to examine which domains contribute to the count under 'allowed,' 'stealth-blocked,' and 'blocked' sections to get detailed insight.
</Tip>

### 5. How to Use This Insight in Daily Browsing

1. **Monitor Badge Counts Across Sites:** Use the badge to quickly assess the third-party exposure of any website.
2. **Investigate Anomalies:** If a badge count seems high for a site, open the popup to dig into which domains are involved.
3. **Adjust Content Blocking:** Complement this insight by tuning your content blocker or filter lists accordingly.
4. **Validate Your Privacy Tools:** Confirm if your content blocker settings are effective by comparing badge counts with and without blocking.

### 6. Navigating the uBO Scope Popup UI

The popup UI breaks down third-party connections into three main sections:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Third-party domains your browser connected to successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were blocked invisibly, i.e., the page might behave as if requests succeeded but content is not loaded.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were prevented outright based on your content blocker or system policies.

At the top, the UI summarizes the **total number of distinct third-party domains connected** (mirroring the badge count).

<Tip>
Use this segmentation to understand the behavior of different third parties on each webpage and how your configuration affects them.
</Tip>

---

### 7. Practical Example

Imagine you visit a news website:

- The badge shows **18**.
- You open the popup and see:
  - Allowed: 5 domains (CDNs, social widgets)
  - Stealth-Blocked: 10 domains (some tracking scripts)
  - Blocked: 7 domains (aggressive ad servers)

This indicates the site is connecting to several third parties, many of which your content blocker is intercepting stealthily or actively blocking. You can choose to investigate stealth-blocked domains further or adjust filters to reduce allowed connections.

### 8. Troubleshooting Common Badge and UI Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Badge Count Discrepancies">
<Accordion title="Badge Not Updating or Showing Zero">
- Ensure the extension has permissions, especially access to the `webRequest` API.
- Try refreshing the active tab or restarting the browser.
- Confirm the tab still exists, as badge data is tab-specific.
- See the 'Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues' guide for detailed steps.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Seems Too High or Too Low">
- Remember the badge counts distinct third-party domains successfully connected, not requests.
- Some extensions or privacy settings might impact counting accuracy.
- Check if your content blocker uses stealth blocking, which doesn't affect the badge number.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup UI Shows No Data or Empty Sections">
- Wait a moment after loading a page for data to populate.
- Confirm the tab is active and supported (not a browser internal page).
- Ensure the extension is enabled and functioning.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

| Aspect                        | Explanation                                         |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Badge Count                  | Number of distinct third-party domains connected successfully for the active tab |
| Low Count                   | Fewer third-party connections; generally positive  |
| High Count                  | Many third-party connections; warrants review      |
| Badge vs UI                 | Badge reflects allowed domains; UI shows allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked separately |
| Use                        | Monitor privacy exposure, verify blocking efficacy, and investigate suspicious activity |
