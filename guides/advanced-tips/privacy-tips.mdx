# Best Practices for Privacy Diagnostics with uBO Scope

## Introduction
uBO Scope provides crucial insights into the third-party remote connections initiated by the webpages you visit. However, interpreting these results correctly and making meaningful privacy assessments requires awareness of certain nuances and best practices. This guide equips you with essential recommendations to accurately understand toolbar badge counts, interpret connection data intelligently, and adapt to browser-specific behaviors.

---

## 1. Understanding Toolbar Badge Counts

### What the Count Represents
- The badge on uBO Scope's toolbar icon shows the **number of distinct third-party remote server domains** with at least one successful connection during the current tab’s browsing session.
- **Lower counts indicate better privacy** since you’re connecting to fewer third-party domains.

### Common Misconceptions
- **Badge count does not equate to total blocked requests.** It solely reflects distinct domains under the 'allowed' category.
- A **higher block count in content blockers may still result in a higher badge count** if the allowed domains are more numerous.

### Best Practice
Always consider the badge count as a **privacy indicator based on the diversity of third-party connections**, not simply on how many requests were blocked.

<Note>
The badge count is designed as a **reliable, real-world privacy metric integrating all content blocker effects and DNS filtering**, offering an honest representation of distinct allowed third-party domains.
</Note>

## 2. Contextualizing Connection Outcomes

### Outcome Categories in the Popup Interface
- **Not Blocked**: Domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains with connections prevented through redirection or stealth techniques.
- **Blocked**: Domains explicitly blocked, causing network errors.

### Interpreting the Domain Lists
- Examine connection counts to identify heavily contacted third parties.
- Focus on **distinct domains** rather than raw request volume for privacy evaluation.

### Practical Tip
Because networks and webpages can behave differently, combine connection data with your browsing context:
- Are unexpected or numerous third parties present?
- Do stealth or blocked domains correlate with known trackers?

<Warning>
Stealth blocking might mean certain requests are silently redirected or blocked in ways that don't appear in “blocked” categories. Relying solely on explicit blocked domains can underestimate tracking.
</Warning>

## 3. Cross-Browser Considerations

### Variations in `webRequest` API Behavior
- uBO Scope depends on browser exposure of network requests via the `webRequest` API.
- Some browsers or versions may **limit visibility into certain requests** (e.g., due to performance or privacy features), resulting in incomplete data.

### Best Practice
- Validate that your browser supports the full range of `webRequest` events needed by uBO Scope.
- When privacy expectations differ between browsers, adjust your diagnostics accordingly.

### Troubleshooting Hint
If connections appear missing or badge counts seem too low, consult the [Troubleshooting Data & Understanding Limitations](guides/advanced-tips/troubleshooting) page for browser-specific insights.

## 4. Interpreting Results in the Broader Privacy Landscape

### Recognize Legitimate Third-Party Services
- Not all third-party domains are negative; common CDNs and accepted services may appear.
- Use uBO Scope’s domain counts as a **starting point** for privacy exploration rather than a definitive blocklist.

### Avoid Misleading Tests
- **Do not rely on fake or simplistic 'ad blocker test' webpages** for evaluating privacy tools.
- uBO Scope exposes real-world third-party connections beyond synthetic benchmarks, offering more trustworthy data.

### Recommendation
- Use uBO Scope data alongside content blocker analysis, DNS filtering logs, and privacy policy review for a holistic privacy assessment.

## 5. Best Practices for Using uBO Scope Effectively

### Regularly Monitor the Toolbar Badge and Popup
- Observe how badge counts change as you browse to recognize privacy leaks or third-party inclusions.
- Frequently open the popup to review domains and counts for deeper insights.

### Translate Unicode Domains
- uBO Scope automatically converts punycode-encoded domains to Unicode for easy reading.
- This helps spot suspicious or unfamiliar domains that might be hidden by encoded names.

### Maintain Updated Public Suffix List
- uBO Scope leverages the public suffix list to correctly identify domain boundaries.
- An updated list ensures accurate grouping of connection data.

### Combine with Other Tools
- Integrate uBO Scope with your favorite content blockers for advanced blocking validation.
- Use connection analytics in filter list maintenance or defender audits.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall: Overestimating Privacy from Block Counts Alone
- **Mistake:** Assuming a content blocker is effective because it reports blocking many requests.
- **Fix:** Focus on distinct allowed third-party domains via uBO Scope as a true privacy indicator.

### Pitfall: Ignoring Stealth Blocking
- **Mistake:** Neglecting stealth-blocked domains which might silently track activity.
- **Fix:** Review the 'stealth-blocked' section in the popup interface to identify such domains.

### Pitfall: Expecting Complete Coverage from uBO Scope
- **Mistake:** Expecting uBO Scope to report every network request, including those outside browser APIs.
- **Fix:** Understand uBO Scope’s reliance on browser APIs and use complementary tools where needed.

## 7. Summary
This guide empowers you to use uBO Scope as a precise privacy diagnostic tool by:

- Correctly understanding toolbar badge domain counts.
- Accurately interpreting allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connection outcomes.
- Accounting for browser-specific behaviors and API limitations.
- Avoiding common misinterpretations and pitfalls.

By applying these best practices, you can maximize uBO Scope’s value, gaining clearer, actionable insights into your browsing privacy.

## Example Workflow for Privacy Assessment Using uBO Scope

### Step-by-Step

1. Install and activate uBO Scope in your browser.
2. Navigate to a website where you want to assess privacy.
3. Watch the toolbar badge update as the page loads and use triggers.
4. Click the toolbar icon to open the popup interface.
5. Review the counts under **Not Blocked**, noting the distinct third parties providing content.
6. Examine **Stealth-Blocked** and **Blocked** sections for domains filtered out silently or explicitly.
7. Consider if the count of allowed domains is reasonable relative to your privacy goals.
8. Repeat on different websites and adjust your content blocker settings accordingly.

<Tip>
Frequent use of the popup's domain list deepens your understanding of which third parties are active and how your blockers behave in real-time.
