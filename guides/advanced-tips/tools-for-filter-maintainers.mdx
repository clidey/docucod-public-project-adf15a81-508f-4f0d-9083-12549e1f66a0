# uBO Scope for Filter List Maintainers

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps filter list maintainers leverage uBO Scope to audit the effectiveness of content blocking filter lists by revealing all outgoing network connections grouped by allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories. It empowers maintainers to catch missed connections and verify how well their filters perform, even when browser developer tools are limited or unavailable.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed in a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Basic familiarity with network requests and domain/hostname concepts.
- Optional: Access to filter list source filters or blocker details for cross-checking.

### Expected Outcome
- Ability to audit network requests initiated by webpages, categorized by outcome.
- Clear insight into which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked by the content blocker.
- Understanding of gaps or shortcomings in filter lists based on real-world connection data.

### Time Estimate
5 to 15 minutes per audit session depending on the complexity of the webpage audited.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate — suited for users familiar with ad blocking and network request auditing.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Install and Launch uBO Scope
- Install uBO Scope from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
- Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the uBO Scope popup.

### 2. Navigate to the Webpage You Want to Audit
- Visit the webpage where you want to audit network request filtering.
- Ensure the page is fully loaded to allow all network requests to flow.

### 3. Open uBO Scope Popup
- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup while focused on the active tab.
- The popup displays:
  - The hostname and domain of the page.
  - A count of distinct third-party domains connected.
  - Three categorized sections: `Allowed`, `Stealth-Blocked`, and `Blocked` domains.

### 4. Review Connections by Outcome
- **Allowed:** Domains from which network requests succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed due to blocking.

### 5. Analyze Domain Counts
- Each domain row shows the domain name and the number of requests to it.
- Identify domains with unexpected allowed connections that may indicate missed filters.
- Note stealth-blocked domains that could reveal indirect or redirected requests.

### 6. Validate Against Filter Lists
- Cross-reference domains seen in the popup with your filter lists to spot gaps.
- Investigate allowed domains that should be blocked or stealth-blocked domains that may require filter adjustment.

### 7. Repeat Audit Across Pages
- Test other webpages with different sets of filters active.
- Observe changes in domain counts and categories to understand filter efficacy.

### 8. Save Results
- Record or screenshot popup data for your audit logs.
- Consider sharing key findings with your filter list community.

## Practical Tips & Advanced Workflow

- **Using uBO Scope Without Developer Tools:** Many devices or browsers restrict deep developer tools access; uBO Scope works independently to reveal network request outcomes in a simplified interface.
- **Interpreting Stealth-Blocked Connections:** These often indicate redirect-based blocking or content caught by stealth mechanisms—valuable for finding indirect connections missed by filters.
- **Badge Count Usage:** The badge on the browser toolbar shows the number of distinct allowed third-party domains, a proxy to assessing real-world privacy risk.
- **Upcoming Features:** Future uBO Scope versions plan to include more granular request details beneficial for filter maintenance.

## Examples & Scenarios

### Example 1: Discovering a Missed Third-Party Tracker

1. Visit a news website.
2. Open uBO Scope popup.
3. Notice an allowed domain like `tracking.example.com` with multiple requests.
4. Cross-check your filter list - domain absent.
5. Add a blocking filter for `tracking.example.com` and retest.

### Example 2: Understanding Stealth Blocking

1. Visit a social media page.
2. Observe stealth-blocked domains, such as `redirect.ads.com`.
3. Recognize the blocker redirects tracking requests stealthily to prevent detection.
4. This validates your filters are effectively blocking indirect trackers.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting Scenarios">
<Accordion title="No Data in Popup">
- Ensure the active tab is fully loaded.
- Confirm uBO Scope has required permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).
- Reinstall the extension if issues persist.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- Confirm network activity on the page.
- Refresh the page and popup.
- Check for conflicting extensions that may block uBO Scope’s monitoring.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Allowed Domains">
- Verify whether domains are essential CDNs or real trackers.
- Cross-check with filter lists and add missing filters.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Filter list maintainers should audit multiple types of webpages to identify domain patterns missed by filters, using uBO Scope’s categorized domains to guide enhancements.
</Tip>

<Warning>
uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API. Connections made outside this scope (e.g., non-browser network activity) will not be reported.
</Warning>
