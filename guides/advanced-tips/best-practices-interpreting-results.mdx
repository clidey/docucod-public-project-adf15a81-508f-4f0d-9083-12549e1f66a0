# Best Practices: Interpreting Network Results

## Overview

This guide provides expert recommendations to help you effectively use uBO Scope’s network monitoring results. By understanding how to distinguish necessary connections from redundant ones, interpret stealth-blocked requests, and avoid common misinterpretation errors, you’ll refine your privacy posture and gain practical insights for managing filter lists or assessing third-party exposure.

## 1. Understanding Your Network Results

uBO Scope classifies network requests into three main outcome categories displayed in the popup interface:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked)**: Connections where webpage resources successfully loaded from third-party domains.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Requests that were redirected or filtered in a way that web content and trackers can’t detect.
- **Blocked**: Network requests actively prevented from completing.

### Why This Matters

Focusing on distinct third-party domains, not just requests, helps you gauge actual exposure. A large number of allowed domains usually indicates a higher risk or resource consumption, while a lower count suggests better privacy.

## 2. Practical Tips for Interpreting Connections

### 2.1 Differentiate Between First-Party and Third-Party

- **First-Party** connections are to the site’s own domain or subdomains.
- **Third-Party** connections involve external domains unrelated to the visited site.

uBO Scope counts and reports only third-party domains, giving a focused view of external connections.

### 2.2 Recognize Legitimate Third-Party Services

Legitimate third parties, such as CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) and analytics platforms, are common and often necessary for site functionality and performance:

- Examples: `cdn.example.com`, `fonts.gstatic.com`, or major cloud providers.

Focus on unexpected or unfamiliar domains that could be privacy risks or unwanted trackers.

### 2.3 Interpret Stealth-Blocked Requests Carefully

- Stealth-blocked connections are handled in a way that prevents the website or embedded scripts from detecting them.
- These entries often reflect sophisticated blocking by content blockers or browser controls.

**Tip:** Presence of stealth-blocked domains means your content blocker is actively mitigating tracking without breaking functionality.

### 2.4 Assess Patterns Over Time

Pay attention to recurring domains across pages or sessions. Repeated connections to unknown domains may require further investigation or filter list tuning.

## 3. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### 3.1 Avoid Relying Solely on Block Counts

- Block counts do not equal better privacy or security.
- A high block count can sometimes mean more requests were made in total.

Refer to the number of distinct allowed third-party domains (shown in the toolbar badge and popup) for a true measure of exposure.

### 3.2 Beware of “Ad Blocker Test” Sites

- These test pages simulate unusual or unrealistic network behaviors.
- Results from these tests may not reflect actual browsing or blocker efficacy.

Use uBO Scope during normal browsing to understand real-world network activity.

### 3.3 Don’t Misinterpret Redirects or DNS-Level Blocking

Stealth or blocked outcomes can occur even if the final connection is allowed or dropped at the DNS level. uBO Scope reports what the browser perceives via the webRequest API, offering the most reliable insight.

## 4. Expert Workflow: Analyzing Network Results

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the extension icon in the browser toolbar to view the current tab’s network connection summary.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Hostname Header">
Confirm the active tab’s hostname and domain displayed on top correspond to the site you are analyzing.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Summary Count">
Note the number next to 'domains connected' which represents unique third-party domains allowed.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Allowed Domains">
Observe the list of domains that successfully connected. Identify known CDNs or analytics services versus unexpected domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Look at stealth-blocked entries for hidden or redirected requests your content blocker handles quietly.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Blocked Domains">
Review actively blocked third-party domains which were prevented from loading.
</Step>
<Step title="Make Actionable Decisions">
Use this information to decide if your filter list needs adjustments or if some third-party content is essential.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Real-World Example

Imagine visiting a news website. The uBO Scope popup shows:

- Allowed domains: `cdn.news-site.com`, `fonts.gstatic.com`, `analytics.example.net`
- Stealth-blocked domains: `tracker.adnetwork.com`, `pixel.ads.com`
- Blocked domains: `ads.badtracker.com`

**Interpretation:**
- Legitimate content is loaded from CDNs and font services.
- Analytics domains are tracked but stealth-blocked, meaning some tracking is mitigated invisibly.
- Ads from known bad tracker domains are blocked outright.

You can safely allow trusted analytics but investigate unknown domains for potential risks.

## 6. Troubleshooting Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Network Result Interpretation">
<Accordion title="Why are some stealth-blocked domains appearing repeatedly?">
This usually indicates your filter lists or content blockers are actively intercepting requests. It’s a sign they are working as intended.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The badge count shows zero but the popup lists domains">
The toolbar badge only counts allowed third-party domains. If all connections are blocked or stealth-blocked, the badge will be empty, but the popup displays all categories.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected third-party domains keep appearing">
These may be legitimate services dynamically loaded by the webpage or new trackers. Consider updating your filter lists or blocking suspicious domains manually.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup data seems outdated or doesn’t refresh">
Refresh the webpage or close and reopen the popup to ensure fresh data. Network requests are processed with a slight delay to batch updates.
</Accordion>

## 7. Best Practices Summary

- Focus on distinct allowed third-party domains to understand your exposure.
- Use stealth and blocked domains indication to evaluate filter effectiveness.
- Avoid relying on block counts or synthetic ad block test sites.
- Regularly analyze and update filter lists based on network result patterns.
- Use uBO Scope as a complementary tool alongside your content blocker for transparency.
