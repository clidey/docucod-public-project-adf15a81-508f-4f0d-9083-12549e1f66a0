# Advanced Use: Debugging and Filtering with uBO Scope

## Introduction
This guide is designed for advanced users and filter list maintainers who want to go beyond basic network telemetry. Using uBO Scope’s powerful debugging and filtering capabilities, you can analyze network flows deeply—beyond standard content blocker reports—and optimize your workflow for detailed privacy investigations.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### What You Will Accomplish
- Learn how to leverage uBO Scope to debug network traffic with greater granularity
- Understand how stealth blocking works and how to interpret it
- Explore DNS-level blocking insights via uBO Scope’s independent reporting
- Optimize your investigation process for filter maintenance and advanced privacy research

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and functional in your supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+)
- Basic familiarity with uBO Scope popup and interpreting badge counts
- Understanding of network request lifecycles and content blocker basics

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Distinguish between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections precisely
- Use uBO Scope as a debugging companion to filter lists and blocking rules
- Confidently interpret network flows that are not apparent through traditional content blocker user interfaces

### Estimated Time
Approximately 20-40 minutes depending on your familiarity and depth of exploration

### Difficulty Level
Advanced — suited for power users and filter list maintainers

## 2. Understanding Advanced Network Outcomes

### Allowed vs. Blocked vs. Stealth-Blocked Requests
uBO Scope categorizes network connections into three outcomes:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully made to third-party domains
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly prevented, often visible in standard filters
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections silently prevented by stealth techniques, typically invisible to the webpage but observable in uBO Scope

### Why Stealth Blocking Matters
Stealth blocking prevents requests without revealing them to the webpage, reducing breakage and detection. uBO Scope reveals these stealth-blocked connections to help you understand the true network impact of your blocking rules.

### DNS-Level Blocking Insight
Though DNS-based blocking operates outside the browser context, uBO Scope can still report connections outcomes as the browser reports network requests via its webRequest API. This makes it uniquely capable of revealing blocking at multiple levels.

## 3. Step-by-Step Debugging and Filtering Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Open uBO Scope Popup for the Active Tab">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser to open the popup panel for the active tab. This reveals detailed domain connection reports categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Analyze Domain Lists and Counts">
Review the domains and the number of requests associated with each domain in all three categories. Use these insights to identify unexpected connections or issues.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Identify Stealth Blocking Patterns">
Focus on the stealth-blocked section to detect when a request was silently blocked. This helps uncover stealth rules or DNS-level blocks affecting your workflow.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: Cross-Check Network Traffic with Filter Logic">
Correlate the observations from uBO Scope with your filter lists or content blocking rules to verify if stealth or DNS blocks align with your expectations.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 5: Refine Filters and Test">
Update your filter lists as needed based on findings. Reload the page and revisit the popup to confirm if changes yield the expected block or allow outcomes.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 6: Use Badge Counts for Quick Monitoring">
Observe the toolbar badge count reflecting the number of distinct allowed third-party domains. Use this as a quick indicator when testing filter effectiveness.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
For best results, always clear previous session data or reload the tab before testing filter refinements to ensure up-to-date telemetry.
</Check>

## 4. Tips and Best Practices

- **Focus on Domains, Not Just Requests:** uBO Scope tracks unique third-party domains per tab, which gives a clearer picture of network exposure than raw request counts.

- **Leverage Stealth Reports:** Many filter lists rely on stealth blocking to improve user experience. Use the stealth section to ensure these blocks are effective.

- **Validate DNS Blocking Effects:** DNS-level blocking can silently prevent requests before they reach the browser. Use uBO Scope to detect gaps or mismatches in DNS rules.

- **Regularly Compare Across Browsers:** Differences in browser support for webRequest API events can affect results. Cross-browser testing helps maintain confidence in your filters.

- **Use Unicode Domain Display:** uBO Scope translates IDN domains from punycode back to Unicode for better readability.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Advanced Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Advanced Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="No Stealth-Blocked Domains Showing">
Ensure your content blocker is actively using stealth blocking techniques and that uBO Scope has appropriate permissions. If stealth domains remain empty, verify that the page is loading with stealth block active.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Allowed Domains After Effective Filtering">
Check if DNS blocking or external proxy settings are influencing results. Refresh the session and validate that your filter rules are up-to-date and correctly applied.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Inconsistent Badge Counts Across Tabs">
Each browser tab is tracked independently. Ensure you are observing the correct tab. If counts fail to update, reload the tab or restart the browser to reset the session.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Real-World Scenario: Debugging a Filter List Update

Suppose you've updated a filter list aiming to block tracking domains silently via stealth blocking:

1. Visit a site known for tracking scripts.
2. Open the uBO Scope popup and note the stealth-blocked domains.
3. If stealth-blocked domains do not appear as expected, check whether your new rules are actually in effect.
4. Modify the filter list, then reload and observe changes in allowed, stealth, and blocked domains.
5. Use the toolbar badge to quickly assess overall third-party exposure.

This approach ensures your stealth rules work as intended without breaking website functionality.

## 8. Summary
uBO Scope empowers experts to debug and optimize filter lists through detailed categorization of network requests, exposing stealth blocking and DNS-level effects often hidden from conventional tools. Mastering these capabilities enhances your ability to safeguard privacy and design effective content blocking strategies.

## Appendix: Glossary of Key Terms

- **Stealth-Blocked Request:** A network request blocked so that the webpage does not detect the blocking.
- **DNS-Level Blocking:** Blocking done at the DNS resolution step outside the browser.
- **Badge Count:** The number of unique third-party domains allowed for the tab.

---

## Appendix: Example Data Interpretation

```
Allowed:
- analytics.example.com (12 requests)
- cdn.example.net (30 requests)

Stealth-Blocked:
- tracker.adnetwork.com (5 requests)
- ads.example.org (3 requests)

Blocked:
- obsolete.badtracker.com (1 request)
```

Interpretation: You are successfully stealth blocking typical trackers and blocking outdated or explicit third parties, while allowing necessary CDNs and analytics providers.
