# Advanced Use Cases: For Filter List Maintainers & Privacy Auditors

Explore practical, hands-on workflows tailored for advanced users of uBO Scope. This guide delves into validating filter lists using real-world connection data, understanding stealth blocking behaviors, and operating the extension effectively in environments without developer tools access. These strategies empower filter list maintainers and privacy auditors to extract deep insights and enhance privacy analysis even in restrictive or privacy-sensitive scenarios.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### Purpose
This guide helps you leverage uBO Scope’s capabilities beyond everyday monitoring. You will learn how to validate filter list effectiveness, interpret stealth blocking nuances, and utilize the extension where developer tools are unavailable—key tasks for filter list maintainers and privacy auditors focused on precise network connection evaluation.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled in a supported browser (Chromium, Firefox, or Safari).
- Basic familiarity with the extension's popup UI and badge interpretation.
- Optional but recommended: a content blocker like uBlock Origin installed alongside for comparative validation.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will:
- Confidently assess filter lists by validating real third-party domain connections.
- Understand and distinguish stealth blocking events from outright blocking.
- Use uBO Scope effectively on platforms or devices without full developer tool access.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 20-30 minutes to work through these advanced workflows depending on your familiarity with network monitoring.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate to Advanced

## 2. Validating Filter Lists Using uBO Scope

When maintaining or auditing filter lists, understanding their real-world impact on third-party connections is critical. uBO Scope provides objective data to validate how many and which third parties remain reachable.

### Step 1: Configure and Observe
- Ensure uBO Scope and your target content blocker are both enabled.
- Navigate to webpages representative of typical user visits for your filter list.
- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup and review the displayed domains, categorized as:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains where connections succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were silently intercepted or redirected.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where connections failed or were explicitly blocked.

### Step 2: Analyze Domain Counts and Patterns
- Note the number of distinct third-party domains not blocked; a lower count generally indicates stricter filtering.
- Use domain details and counts to identify potential filter list weaknesses or overly permissive entries.

### Step 3: Iterate with Updates
- After modifying filter lists, repeat the observation to confirm expected block behaviors.
- Use multiple test pages and varying browsing sessions to obtain comprehensive results.

<Note>
Because stealth blocking does not produce visible errors or block counts, uBO Scope’s categorization is essential for distinguishing actual network exposure from stealth-filtered connections.

## 3. Understanding Stealth Blocking Behavior

Stealth blocking is a technique used by some content blockers to silently redirect or fake responses instead of outright blocking to prevent detection or webpage breakage.

### How uBO Scope Reveals Stealth Blocking
- Stealth-blocked domains appear in their own section in the popup UI.
- They differ from blocked domains because the network request does not outright fail; it may be redirected or modified.

### Best Practices for Auditors
- Always review the **stealth-blocked** list along with blocked lists to understand true third-party exposure.
- Look for sudden changes in stealth-blocked domains when updating filters or changing content blockers.

### Scenario
If a filter list silently stealth blocks a tracking domain instead of blocking it, traditional block counts won’t reflect this. uBO Scope exposes such behavior so you can assess filter efficacy accurately.

## 4. Using uBO Scope in Environments Without Developer Tools

On some devices, corporate environments, or privacy-sensitive setups, browser developer tools may be unavailable or limited. uBO Scope’s independent popup UI facilitates network monitoring even in such constrained contexts.

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope Popup
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to access a summary of network connections for the active tab.

### Step 2: Interpret Badge Counts
The icon badge number communicates the count of distinct third-party domains observed as successfully connected (allowed).

### Step 3: Review Domain Categories
The popup sections list domain names with request counts per category (not blocked, stealth-blocked, blocked) to allow comprehensive analysis without external tools.

### Practical Tips
- Use uBO Scope to audit network behavior on devices where using browser tools is restricted.
- Supplement your privacy audit reports with uBO Scope’s disclosures to present clear evidence of network exposure.

## 5. Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls

- **Tip:** Refresh the page to capture current network requests; stale data can mislead your validation.
- **Tip:** Pay attention to the domain names instead of IPs — the extension resolves domains reliably against a public suffix list.
- **Pitfall:** Relying solely on badge counts without reviewing stealth or blocked lists may miss critical exposure.
- **Pitfall:** Testing only on ad blocker test pages is insufficient; use real-world browsing scenarios.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### No Data Displayed in Popup
- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled and has appropriate permissions.
- Verify you have active network traffic; some pages might not generate third-party requests.
- See [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](/getting-started/onboard-intro-basics/troubleshooting-setup) for detailed remedies.

### Unexpectedly High Not Blocked Count
- Check if stealth blocking is hiding some blockers’ true effect.
- Validate that no other extensions or settings interfere with request monitoring.

### Popup Interface Performance Issues
- If the popup is slow refreshing data, clear browser session storage or restart the browser.
