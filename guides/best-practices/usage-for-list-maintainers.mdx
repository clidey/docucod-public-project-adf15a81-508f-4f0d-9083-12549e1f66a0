# Advanced: Using uBO Scope for Filter List Curation

---

## Workflow Overview

### Purpose
This guide helps filter list maintainers and advanced users leverage uBO Scope to validate and refine filter lists, identify stealthy or subtle third-party requests, and troubleshoot connectivity and blocking in resource-constrained or restricted browser environments.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed on a supported browser (Chromium v122+, Firefox v128+, Safari v18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with uBO Scope’s popup interface and network connection categorizations (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).
- Access to the extension popup UI or other browser network tools, though tips are included for limited tool access.

### Expected Outcomes
- Confident analysis of third-party network requests relevant to filter list effectiveness.
- Ability to detect stealth blocking and ambiguous network outcomes.
- Practical troubleshooting strategies for scenarios where browser tooling access is limited.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15-30 minutes to perform initial analysis and validation workflows.

### Difficulty Level
Advanced – targeted at power users and filter list maintainers familiar with third-party network dynamics and content blocking principles.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Environment
- Ensure uBO Scope is fully installed, active, and has been granted all necessary permissions.
- Update your filter lists in your content blocker to the latest versions to test against current web requests.

### 2. Start with a Target Website
- Visit the site for which you want to validate or curate filter lists.
- Reload the page fully to capture fresh network request data.

### 3. Open uBO Scope Popup
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
- Observe the domain connection summary for the active tab.

### 4. Analyze Domain Connection Categories
- Review the three main sections:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains whose requests were stealthily blocked (requests redirected or failed silently).
  - **Blocked**: Domains where requests failed with identifiable errors.

- Pay special attention to stealth-blocked entries; these often reveal filter list actions that do not appear as obvious blocking but prevent resource loading.

### 5. Validate Filter List Effectiveness
- Confirm that suspicious or undesired third-party domains appear in the stealth or blocked lists.
- Note any allowed third-party domains that you believe should be blocked and consider updating your filter lists accordingly.
- Identify domains that evade typical blocking (appear as allowed but shouldn't) to improve filter precision.

### 6. Detect and Address Stealth Requests
- Use uBO Scope’s stealth-blocked domain list to detect requests performed via redirects or other stealth methods.
- These stealth blocks may bypass traditional block counting metrics and affect privacy.
- Correlate stealth-blocked domains with filter list rules and investigate necessary adjustments.

### 7. Work Around Restricted or Limited Tool Access
- If your browser or environment limits access to developer tools or networking consoles:
  - Rely on uBO Scope’s popup as your primary visibility window.
  - Use progressive site reloads with varying filter list states (enable/disable specific rules) to observe changes in domain presence.
  - Log collected data externally for manual comparison.

### 8. Repeat Across Sites and Conditions
- Test multiple websites and user conditions to ensure filter list reliability across common usage.
- Use patterns from domain occurrences across multiple sites to identify global third-party actors.

### 9. Document and Share Findings
- Record your observations and filter list modifications.
- Share data with the filter list community if appropriate, including unusual stealth patterns or suspect connections.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Stealth Blocking Is Key**: Traditional block counts may not fully reflect filter list performance; stealth statistics fill that gap.
- **Use Unicode Decoding**: Domain names in uBO Scope may be punycode encoded; rely on uBO Scope’s display of decoded Unicode for clarity.
- **Filter List Updates Matter**: Keep filter lists current to catch evolving third-party requests.
- **Cross-Reference Domains**: Use public suffix list-based domain identification (built into uBO Scope) to handle subdomains accurately.
- **Monitor Badge Counts**: A stable or reduced badge count over time generally indicates better blocking effectiveness.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: No Data or Incomplete Data in Popup
- Verify that uBO Scope has all required permissions (`webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab`).
- Confirm your browser version is supported.
- Reload the tab after enabling uBO Scope.
- If persistent, consult installation and permission guides.

### Issue: Stealth Blocking Not Showing Up
- Understand that stealth-blocking relies on network request redirect events.
- Some requests blocked via DNS or outside webRequest API reach may not appear.
- Check for stealth-blocking evidence by comparing allowed domains to known trackers.

### Issue: Browser Restriction Limits Network Insight
- Without full developer tools, rely exclusively on uBO Scope popup.
- Perform controlled tests by toggling filters and observing popup changes.
- Export and analyze connection data externally if possible.

### Issue: Badge Count Differs from Expected Block Counts
- Remember the badge shows unique allowed third-party domains, not block counts.
- Cross-check allowed vs blocked domains in popup for full understanding.

## Examples & Real-World Scenarios

### Example: Identifying a Missed Tracker
After visiting a news site, you notice a suspicious domain listed under "not blocked" in uBO Scope but absent in your filter list. Query the list source, add a custom blocking rule for the domain, reload the page, and observe the domain shift to "blocked" or "stealth-blocked," confirming your list improvement.

### Example: Confirming Stealth Blocking
On an e-commerce site, stealth domains appear in the popup, revealing subtle request redirects that your filter list is handling. This confirms your filter list’s silent protection capabilities beyond visible block counts.
