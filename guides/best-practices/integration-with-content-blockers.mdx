# Integrating uBO Scope with Other Content Blockers

## Overview

This guide helps you understand how to effectively use uBO Scope alongside other content blockers in your browser to achieve a more comprehensive privacy analysis. uBO Scope operates independently from existing content blockers, DNS filters, or browser privacy settings, giving you an unfiltered view of all network connections your browser attempts or successfully makes.

By integrating uBO Scope with other blocking tools, you can correlate and validate findings, uncover stealthy connections that other blockers might miss, and gain greater insight into the true third-party exposure of websites you visit.

## Why Integrate uBO Scope with Other Content Blockers?

- **Complementary Insights**: While many blockers prevent certain requests, uBO Scope reveals every attempted connection, whether blocked or allowed. This gives awareness of "hidden" network activity.
- **Independent Reporting**: uBO Scope uses the browser's `webRequest` API to track network requests after any blocking or filtering occurs. This ensures you see the final outcome, not just what the blocker intended.
- **Identify Stealth Blocking**: Some content blockers perform stealthy blocking that can evade typical detection methods. uBO Scope categorizes domains as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, helping you discover these subtle differences.
- **Cross-Validation of Block Lists**: Filter list maintainers can use uBO Scope to verify the actual impact of their filters in real browsing scenarios where multiple blockers might be deployed.


## Prerequisites

- You must have uBO Scope installed and active in your browser. For installation instructions, see [Installing uBO Scope on Your Browser](/guides/getting-started/installing-ubo-scope).
- Have at least one other content blocker or privacy tool installed and active, such as uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, or DNS-level blockers.
- Understand basic operation of your other content blocker.


## How uBO Scope Works Independently

uBO Scope is designed to function regardless of content blocking layers:

- It monitors the network requests reported by your browser's `webRequest` API.
- It logs outcomes as **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked** domains based on the actual network traffic observed after all blocking actions.
- Unlike most blockers, it does not prevent requests but reports on what happens to them.

This independence means whether you have a DNS filter, an extension filter, or native browser privacy features enabled, uBO Scope captures the resulting network activity and outcomes.


## Step-by-Step Integration Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Install and Enable uBO Scope Alongside Your Content Blockers">
Make sure uBO Scope and your preferred content blockers are installed and fully enabled in your browser.

- Verify uBO Scope toolbar icon is visible and active.
- Confirm your other blockers are also active.

**Expected Result:**
- Both tools are running concurrently, without conflicts.
</Step>
<Step title="Browse to a Target Webpage">
Visit the website you want to analyze. Let all blockers and privacy settings process requests naturally.

**Expected Result:**
- The page loads normally or with blocking as per your other content blockers.
- uBO Scope starts recording network request outcomes.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup Dashboard">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup dashboard.

- Review the domain counts for **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** connections.
- Observe total distinct third-party domains contacted by the page.

**Expected Result:**
- You see an accurate list of domains categorized by outcome, reflecting all network activity post-blocking.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare uBO Scope Data With Your Other Content Blocker’s Reports">
Open the interface or popup of your content blocker.

- Note blocked domains or requests indicated by the other tool.
- Identify any domains present in uBO Scope’s allowed or stealth-blocked lists.

**Decision Point:**
- If domains marked as blocked by your content blocker appear as allowed in uBO Scope, investigate possible stealth blocking or DNS-level filtering.
- If uBO Scope shows blocked domains your other blocker does not, consider that your content blocker might be missing some blocking.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze Stealth-Blocked Domains">
uBO Scope identifies stealth-blocked domains that do not appear in the explicit blocked list.

- Use this data to uncover connections silently blocked or redirected by your content blockers or DNS services.
- Adjust filter lists or settings if you want to manage these stealth connections more transparently.
</Step>
<Step title="Use uBO Scope as a Verification Tool for Filter List Development">
Filter list maintainers can leverage uBO Scope to test modifications.

- Apply filter list changes in your content blocker.
- Reload the webpage and watch changes in uBO Scope’s domain classification.
- Confirm the impact of your filters on third-party exposure.

**Expected Result:**
- Clear correlation between your filters' intentions and the actual network request results.
</Step>
<Step title="Refresh and Repeat for Continuous Monitoring">
To maintain up-to-date information:

- Refresh the page as needed.
- Observe the popup dashboard update with new domain counts.

Repeat this process when testing different sites, blockers, or configurations.
</Step>
</Steps>


## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Use uBO Scope as a Passive Listener:** It does not interfere with blocking; think of it as a forensic tool giving you the final truth after all blockers act.
- **Combine with DNS-blocking Analysis:** If you use DNS-level DNS filters, pair uBO Scope's data with DNS logs to identify stealth or hidden connections.
- **Beware of Browser Limitations:** Some browsers might not report all network requests to the WebRequest API; results may vary.
- **Regularly Review Stealth-Blocked Domains:** These are often overlooked connections that can impact privacy.
- **Validate Blocking Efficiency:** A higher block count on your content blocker doesn’t always mean better protection; use uBO Scope’s domain counts to assess true third-party exposure.


## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Integration Issues">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Shows No Data or 'NO DATA'">
- Confirm uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Check that the webpage you are browsing is actively loading network requests.
- Verify browser permissions and that the extension has access to host permissions.
- Reload the page or browser to reinitialize monitoring.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Counts Seem Inconsistent with Other Blockers">
- Understand that uBO Scope reports actual network request outcomes, while other blockers show intended or intercepted requests.
- Differences may be due to stealth blocking or browser reporting limitations.
- Verify your blockers are up to date.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Toolbar Badge Count Not Updating">
- Refresh the page or reopen the popup dashboard to trigger updates.
- Ensure you are on the active tab matching the badge counts.
- Restart browser if issue persists.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Summary

The integration of uBO Scope with other content blockers presents a powerful workflow to reveal true network activity and the real impact on privacy exposure. By independently reporting all network request outcomes, uBO Scope allows you to: detect stealth blocking, cross-verify filter effectiveness, and gain full visibility beyond what any single blocker or DNS filter can provide.
