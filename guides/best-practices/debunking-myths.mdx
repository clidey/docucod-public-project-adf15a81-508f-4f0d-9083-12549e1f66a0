# Debunking Content Blocker Myths

Understanding the data presented by uBO Scope is critical to leveraging its full potential. This guide addresses some widespread misconceptions users may have about content blockers and explains how to interpret what uBO Scope truly reports. By clarifying these myths, you’ll gain practical insights into privacy, blocking effectiveness, and how to use connection data meaningfully.

---

## 1. Why Block Counts Alone Are Misleading

### Myth: “A content blocker showing more blocked requests is better.”

Many users believe that the higher the block count reported on their toolbar icon, the more effective the blocker is. However, uBO Scope reveals a different perspective.

- **The badge count shows *unique distinct third-party domains* successfully connected to, not block counts.**
- A high block count may actually correlate with your browser making more requests to a larger number of distinct third parties.
- Conversely, allowing fewer unique third parties to connect means better privacy and content control.

**Practical takeaway:** Focus on the number of allowed distinct third-party domains rather than how many requests were blocked.

<Note>
Block counts don't reflect the real impact on privacy or tracker reduction. The true measure is how many unique third-party servers your browser contacts.
</Note>

## 2. The Limitation of "Ad Blocker Test" Websites

### Myth: “Ad block testing pages prove the reliability of blockers.”

Specialized test pages claiming to detect ad blockers are often flawed and misleading:

- These pages trigger network requests to domains that do not exist or are fabricated for the test.
- Extension-based blockers, including uBO Scope and uBlock Origin, use stealth techniques to prevent detection by these test pages.
- Real-world web requests and tracker behaviors vastly differ from these artificial test scenarios.

**Practical takeaway:** Avoid relying on ad block test pages as benchmark tools for blocker effectiveness or extension reliability.

<Tip>
Trust real-world data and comprehensive tools like uBO Scope to understand your actual third-party exposure.
</Tip>

## 3. Meaningful Third-Party Blocking: What Really Matters

Understanding actual connections beyond blocking events empowers better privacy decisions.

- **Allowed domains:** Third-party domains your browser connected to successfully.
- **Stealth-blocked domains:** Redirected or modified network requests that the extension detected as stealth intercepts.
- **Blocked domains:** Requests that the content blocker or network layer prevented from completing.

Use this information to:

- Identify unexpected or unrecognized third parties.
- Verify if blocking rules are effectively reducing third-party connections.
- Adjust your filter lists to refine blocking without risking website breakage.

Remember, the lower the allowed count of distinct third-party domains, the stronger your privacy stance.

## 4. Using uBO Scope in Everyday Scenarios

To maximize the extension’s value for privacy and troubleshooting:

<Steps>
<Step title="Visit a Website">
Open any website and let uBO Scope gather network request data.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Badge Count">
Look at the toolbar icon badge showing the number of unique third-party domains allowed.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Extension Popup">
Click the toolbar icon to open uBO Scope’s popup interface and explore detailed outcomes.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domain Categories">
Examine which third parties were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, noting counts.
</Step>
<Step title="Cross-check with Content Blockers">
Compare with other blocker tools to understand true third-party exposure beyond block counts.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Regularly update your filter lists and blockers to maintain effective protection.
- Don’t equate high numbers of blocked requests with better privacy — rely on domain counts.
- Use uBO Scope’s transparent reporting to identify tracker domains and assess your exposure.
- Avoid test pages that claim to "challenge" your blocker; they artificially test scenarios not found in typical browsing.

## 6. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Assuming the badge count is a block count: It’s actually the count of allowed unique third-party domains.
- Overinterpreting stealth-blocked counts: Stealth blocking is an advanced mechanism often invisible to webpages, but interpret carefully in context.
- Ignoring browser limitations: Not all network requests are visible due to browser API restrictions; see related documentation.

## 7. Troubleshooting FAQ

### Q: Why does my blocker show a high block count but uBO Scope shows many allowed domains?
**A:** Blocks may be frequent but scattered across many third parties. uBO Scope reports the unique domains you connect to, which indicates your true privacy exposure.

### Q: Can uBO Scope detect all third-party connections?
**A:** No. uBO Scope relies on browser `webRequest` API. Some low-level or encrypted connections initiated outside this API won’t be detected.

### Q: Should I trust ad blocker test websites for evaluation?
**A:** No. They use unrealistic techniques that do not represent typical browsing environments.

<Warning>
If you suspect permission or visibility issues, verify your extension permissions and browser support as explained in the troubleshooting guides.
