# Using uBO Scope as a Filter List Maintainer

A practical workflow guide designed specifically for filter list authors, demonstrating how to leverage uBO Scope to observe stealth blocking effects, validate filter effectiveness, and detect subtle issues that common browser developer tools often overlook.

---

## 1. Introduction

As a filter list maintainer, understanding how your filters behave in real browsing scenarios is critical. uBO Scope provides a transparent and reliable view of third-party network requests, including those that are stealth-blocked or completely blocked. This guide walks you through using uBO Scope to improve your filter lists by uncovering hidden connections and validating blocking precision.

<u>Note:</u> This guide focuses exclusively on the usage of uBO Scope for filter list maintenance and assumes you already have the extension installed and functioning. For installation instructions, see the [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) guide.

---

## 2. Workflow Overview

- **Goal:** Use uBO Scope to monitor stealth-blocked requests, verify filter list impact, and identify unexpected third-party connections.
- **Prerequisites:** uBO Scope installed on a compatible browser, basic familiarity with filter lists (e.g., uBlock Origin filters), and access to websites to test filters.
- **Outcome:** Gain insights into stealth-blocking behavior, confidently assess filter effectiveness, and generate actionable data to refine your filter list.
- **Estimated Time:** 15-30 minutes per website analyzed.
- **Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (requires knowledge of content blocking concepts)

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope Popup

1. Navigate to the target website you want to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar.
3. The popup dashboard will open, showing a summary of distinct third-party domains connected.

**Expected Result:** You should see domains categorized into three groups: `not blocked`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked`.

### Step 2: Understand Domain Outcome Categories

- **Not Blocked:** Domains where connections were successfully allowed.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains whose network requests were allowed to initiate but are redirected or blocked in a way preventing resource loading or exposure; these are subtle and often missed by regular network inspectors.
- **Blocked:** Domains completely blocked by your filters.

Focus on `stealth-blocked` domains because they reveal filter effects that are not straightforward.

### Step 3: Examine Stealth-Blocked Domains

1. In the popup, scroll to the `stealth-blocked` section.
2. Expand and review domains that appear here.
3. Cross-reference with your filter list entries to ensure intended blocks correspond to these domains.

**Tip:** A high number of stealth-blocked domains may indicate filters doing precise blocking that bypasses detection by common tools.

### Step 4: Validate Filter Effectiveness

1. Toggle filters in your list on and off or test different versions of your filter lists.
2. Reload the webpage after each change.
3. Observe how the `blocked` and `stealth-blocked` domains change in uBO Scope.

**Expected Result:** Blocking specific domains should move them from `not blocked` to `blocked` or `stealth-blocked` as expected.

### Step 5: Detect Unexpected Connections

1. Watch for third-party domains in the `not blocked` category that you did not intend to allow.
2. Investigate these domains by checking domain ownership or purpose—this might uncover filter list gaps.
3. Consider adding rules to your filter list to block unwanted domains exposed by uBO Scope.

**Caution:** Always verify if the domains are legitimate first-party services or necessary CDNs before blocking.

### Step 6: Repeat Workflow on Multiple Pages

Test your filter list changes across different webpages or sites.

**Why:** This practice ensures your filters are effective and do not unintentionally break site functionality.

### Step 7: Record Findings for Filter List Updates

Keep a log of domains observed in stealth-blocked or unexpected categories.
Use this to propose improvements in your filter list.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Example: Spotting Stealth Blocking on a News Website

- Visit `https://example-news-site.com` with your filter list enabled.
- Open the uBO Scope popup.
- Note that domains like `ads.exampleads.com` appear under `stealth-blocked`.
- Check your filter list for rules targeting these domains.
- If absent, add a blocking rule for `||exampleads.com^` and reload the site.
- Confirm that the domain now moves to the `blocked` category.

### Example: Detecting Leakage of Unfiltered Trackers

- Test a privacy-focused website.
- Notice unexpected third-party domains under `not blocked` such as `tracker.unfiltered.com`.
- Research the domain to confirm its tracking function.
- Update your filter list to block the domain.
- Validate the update in uBO Scope after reloading.

## 5. Best Practices & Tips

- Use uBO Scope alongside traditional browser developer network tools for a comprehensive view.
- Regularly update the Public Suffix List used by uBO Scope to ensure accurate domain parsing.
- When verifying stealth blocking, pay attention to redirects or error outcomes in the popup.
- Avoid overblocking domains that may impact site functionality or user experience.
- Use real sites and normal browsing patterns to observe practical filter effects.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="No Data in Popup">
- Verify that uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled.
- Ensure you have granted the required permissions.
- Reload the webpage and open popup again.
- If problems persist, see the [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) guide.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Domains Not Blocked">
- Confirm your filter list is active and correctly formatted.
- Check if the domain is on a whitelist or overridden by other filters.
- Test disabling conflicting filters to isolate the issue.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- Reload the page.
- Close and reopen the tab.
- Restart the browser if necessary.

## 9. Appendix: How uBO Scope Categorizes Domains

| Category       | Description                                                                                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked    | Connections successfully allowed; resources loaded from these domains.                            |
| Stealth-Blocked| Network requests appear as redirects or errors; they're suppressed in a way to avoid detection.   |
| Blocked        | Requests completely denied; domains are actively blocked by filter rules.                         |

Understanding these distinctions is essential in interpreting results and optimizing your filters.
