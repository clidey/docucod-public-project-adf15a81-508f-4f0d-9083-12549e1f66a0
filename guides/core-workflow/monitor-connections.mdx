# Monitoring Third-Party Connections

## Overview

This guide walks you through how to use uBO Scope to monitor all third-party remote server connections that your browser attempts or successfully completes during normal web browsing. You'll learn how to interpret the toolbar badge count, understand the detailed network connection reports visible in the popup, and why these insights matter for your online privacy and security.

---

## What You Will Achieve

- Understand how uBO Scope tracks connections to remote servers while you browse.
- Learn how to interpret the badge count on the extension's toolbar icon.
- Explore the popup interface that categorizes connections as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- Gain actionable insights into what third parties your browser communicates with and their impact.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following:

- uBO Scope is installed and active in your supported browser (Chromium-based, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- You have visited one or more websites to generate network activity logs.
- You understand basic browser extension operation, including opening extension popups and recognizing toolbar badges.

## Time Estimate

- Approximately 5 to 10 minutes to review and understand connection monitoring and badge interpretation.

## Difficulty Level

- Beginner to intermediate: no advanced networking knowledge needed, but some familiarity with browser usage is helpful.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Monitoring Third-Party Connections

### Step 1: Observe the Toolbar Badge Count

- When you browse, uBO Scope monitors all network requests made by web pages.
- The **toolbar badge count** shows the total number of distinct third-party remote server domains contacted by the active tab.
- A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, which typically means reduced privacy exposure.

> **Important:** The count reflects **distinct third-party domains connected**; it does not show blocked requests or more granular counts.

### Step 2: Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
- The popup displays detailed information about the third-party domains contacted during the current browsing session.

### Step 3: Interpret the Popup Data

The popup divides third-party domains into three categories:

1. **Not Blocked (Allowed):**
   - Domains your browser successfully connected to.
   - These connections represent resources your browser fetched without interference.
2. **Stealth-Blocked:**
   - Domains for which connection attempts were stealth-blocked by content blockers or other stealth techniques.
   - These requests likely initiated redirects or occurred behind the scenes, making them less visible to websites.
3. **Blocked:**
   - Domains where connection attempts resulted in errors or were outright blocked.

Additionally, the popup shows the count of unique domains under "domains connected" reflecting all allowed third parties.

### Step 4: Understand the Domains and Counts

- Each domain listed has an associated count indicating how many times your browser attempted or completed connections to that domain during the session.
- Higher counts indicate more frequent requests and potentially more data exchange with that domain.

### Step 5: Use Insights to Enhance Your Privacy Awareness

- Recognize unexpected or unfamiliar third-party domains, which could be tracking services, ads, or analytics servers.
- Understand that not all third-party connections are harmful; some are essential content delivery networks (CDNs) or services required for website functionality.
- A persistently high number of third-party connections suggests increased potential privacy exposure.

## Practical Examples

Imagine you visit a popular news website.
- The toolbar badge shows `15`, indicating 15 unique third-party domains your browser connected to while loading the page.
- Opening the popup reveals domains like `cdn.examplecdn.com`, `analytics.tracker.com`, and `ads.adserver.net` categorized under "not blocked."
- You also find several stealth-blocked domains indicating the presence of content blockers preventing some network requests.

By monitoring these details, you can make informed decisions about your privacy setup and evaluate how different sites interact with third-party services.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Refresh the popup:** The popup shows data for the currently active browser tab. Switch tabs and reopen the popup to see data for other web pages.
- **Regularly monitor:** Frequent monitoring helps you notice when new or unfamiliar third-party connections appear.
- **Combine with blockers:** Use uBO Scope alongside content blockers to get a fuller picture of your browsing privacy.
- **Watch for anomalies:** Unexpected spikes in connections or unknown domains can signal tracking or unwanted content loading.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Badge Does Not Appear or Shows No Data

- Verify the extension is installed and enabled.
- Ensure you have visited web pages since installation to generate connection data.
- Check for browser updates to meet minimum version requirements.
- Restart the browser if problems persist.

### Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Empty Lists

- Make sure you have active network activity in the current tab.
- Network requests outside what the browser `webRequest` API captures will not appear.
- Content blockers or network settings might interfere with data collection.

### Counts Seem Higher or Unexpected

- Recognize some browsing sessions load numerous legitimate third-party domains (e.g., CDNs, analytics, advertisement).
- Confirm that stealth-blocked and blocked categories give more insight into filtered connections.

## Developer Insights (Optional)

Although not necessary for users, understanding that uBO Scope uses browser `webRequest` API listeners allows it to track network requests and classify them into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories across browsing sessions. It maintains counts of distinct third-party domains per tab, updating the toolbar badge accordingly.
