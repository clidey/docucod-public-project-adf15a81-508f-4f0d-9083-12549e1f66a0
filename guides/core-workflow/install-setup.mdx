## 3. Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Choose Your Browser

Decide which browser you will use with uBO Scope:

| Browser       | Minimum Version      | Installation Source                        |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Chrome/Chromium | Version 122 and above| Official Chrome Web Store                 |
| Firefox       | Version 128 and above | Official Mozilla Add-ons site             |
| Safari        | Version 18.5 and above| Apple Safari Extensions Gallery          |


### Step 2: Install from Official Stores

**Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)**
1. Navigate to the Chrome Web Store.
2. Search for 'uBO Scope' or visit directly if you have the link.
3. Click `Add to Chrome` (or your browser’s add button).

**Firefox**
1. Open the Firefox Add-ons site.
2. Search for 'uBO Scope' or use a direct link.
3. Click `Add to Firefox`.

**Safari**
1. Open the Safari Extensions Gallery.
2. Search for 'uBO Scope'.
3. Click the install button.

### Step 3: Confirm Extension Permissions

During installation, you will be prompted to grant permissions. uBO Scope requires these permissions to monitor network requests:

- **Access to all websites (host permissions):**
  - `https://*/*`, `http://*/*` (also WebSocket URLs like `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*` for Chromium and Firefox)

- **Web Request API:** To listen to network events and detect connections

- **Storage:** To save session monitoring data persistently

- **Active Tab:** To interact with the currently active browser tab

The extension requests exactly these scopes, no more. This allows uBO Scope to transparently track and categorize network connections.

### Step 4: Activate the Extension

Once installed, ensure uBO Scope is enabled in your browser’s extensions/add-ons page.

- In Chromium and Firefox, look for the uBO Scope icon near the address bar or in the extensions panel.
- In Safari, extensions show up in the Safari toolbar if active.


### Step 5: Verify Installation and Setup

After installation and activation, verify that uBO Scope is running properly:

1. Look for the toolbar icon labeled "uBO Scope".
2. When you browse, a badge count should appear on the icon showing the number of third-party domains being contacted.
3. Click on the icon to open the popup. You should see categories of connections such as 'Allowed', 'Stealth-blocked', and 'Blocked' domains.

If the badge remains empty or the popup shows no data even after visiting several websites, follow the troubleshooting tips below.
