# Using uBO Scope Without Developer Tools

## Workflow Overview

### Purpose
This guide empowers users to perform detailed network request analysis using uBO Scope in environments where browser developer tools are unavailable, unsuitable, or limited. It focuses on practical techniques to gather meaningful evidence about remote connections and how to leverage uBO Scope’s extension UI to audit network activity effectively.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and enabled in your browser.
- Basic understanding of network concepts and uBO Scope terminology (e.g., allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked domains).
- Access to the browser toolbar where the uBO Scope icon is visible.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Collect and interpret network connection data without relying on browser developer consoles.
- Use the uBO Scope popup UI and toolbar badge for transparent, evidence-based network request audits.
- Apply practical approaches for privacy auditing even in constrained or restricted environments.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10-20 minutes for initial setup and familiarization, plus additional time depending on audit depth.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate – assumes familiarity with browser extensions and basic network concepts but requires no coding.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Confirm uBO Scope Installation and Activation
- Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
- If the icon is missing, install the extension from your browser’s official extension store and reload your browser.
- Confirm the extension is active by checking the toolbar badge, which shows the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.

### 2. Navigate to the Website You Want to Analyze
- Open the target website in a browser tab.
- Allow the page and its resources to fully load to capture network requests properly.

### 3. Interpret the Toolbar Badge Count
- The badge displays the count of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections from the current tab.
- A lower badge count implies fewer third-party connections, often indicating better privacy.

### 4. Open the uBO Scope Popup UI
- Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- Observe the "domains connected" summary, displaying the total number of distinct allowed third-party domains.

### 5. Analyze Domain Lists in the Popup
- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which network connections were successfully made.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where network requests were redirected stealthily, often hidden from the page's perspective.
- **Blocked:** Domains for which network requests were prevented due to errors or active blocking.

### 6. Use Domain Counts to Prioritize Investigation
- Each domain row in the popup includes a count indicating the number of requests for that domain.
- Higher counts may suggest domains with more intensive tracking or content delivery.

### 7. Gather Evidence and Report
- Use the information displayed to document third-party connections, especially if developer tools or network logs are inaccessible.
- Capture screenshots or notes from the popup UI for audit or filter list maintenance.

### 8. Maintain and Update Filter Lists (For Filter List Maintainers)
- Leverage observed network data from limited environments to identify domains requiring filter list attention.
- Share findings with the community to improve blocking rules and privacy protections.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Regularly Refresh During Testing:** Reload pages to capture fresh network data and update popup domain counts.
- **Combine With Other Guides:** Complement this approach with the 'Understanding the Popup UI' and 'Conducting a Third-Party Tracker Audit' guides for deeper insights.
- **Avoid Relying on Badge Alone:** The badge count is a quick privacy metric but always validate with the popup UI details.
- **Stealth-blocked Domains:** Recognize these as network requests that browsers report but webpages may not; useful for understanding hidden tracking surfaces.
- **Browser Limitations:** Some browsers or environments may limit access to network APIs; uBO Scope adapts but not all requests may be visible.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Toolbar Badge Not Updating
- **Cause:** Extension may be disabled or browser session not tracking requests.
- **Solution:** Verify extension is enabled; reload browser tabs, check for extension conflicts.

### Issue: No Data in Popup UI
- **Cause:** No network activity detected or data not yet recorded.
- **Solution:** Browse a website fully; press the toolbar icon after allowing time for data collection.

### Issue: Limited Information on Some Network Requests
- **Cause:** Network requests initiated outside the reach of browser `webRequest` API (e.g., some WebSocket or browser-internal requests).
- **Solution:** Accept that certain requests may not be logged; use available data for audit.

### Issue: Environment Without Developer Tools Access
- **Cause:** Device or browser restrictions.
- **Solution:** Use uBO Scope’s popup UI as the primary source of network connection audit data.

## Example Use Case

Imagine working on a locked-down corporate device where developer tools are disabled. You need to verify if a browser is loading any unwanted third-party content.

1. Open uBO Scope extension and navigate to the suspicious website.
2. Observe the toolbar badge to get an immediate sense of third-party connections.
3. Click the extension icon to see detailed allowed, stealth, and blocked domains.
4. Note domains with high request counts as potential tracking sources.
5. Document these findings to support your audit without any API or developer console access.

This approach ensures transparent network evidence gathering even with limited tooling.

## Additional Notes for Filter List Maintainers

- On devices or platforms with restricted access to network debugging tools, uBO Scope serves as a critical audit tool to identify domains implicated in third-party requests.
- Regular snapshots of the allowed and blocked domains from the popup UI can inform filter list updates.
- Consider contributing improvements back to the uBO Scope project to enhance capabilities in limited environments.
