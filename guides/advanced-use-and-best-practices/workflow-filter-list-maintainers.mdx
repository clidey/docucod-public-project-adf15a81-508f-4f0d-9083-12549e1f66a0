# Best Practices for Filter List Maintainers

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide provides a practical, step-by-step workflow tailored specifically for filter list maintainers to use uBO Scope effectively. It teaches how to operate uBO Scope on devices with limited native browser developer tools, interpret the classification of network requests (allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked), validate the real-world enforcement of filter lists, and gather actionable data to improve filter lists.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and activated in a supported browser (Chromium, Firefox, Safari).
- Basic knowledge of the roles and types of network requests: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- Familiarity with filter lists basics and filter list maintenance goals.
- Access to the browser toolbar where uBO Scope icon is located.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Use uBO Scope on devices lacking advanced browser tools to monitor network connections.
- Distinguish and interpret stealth-blocked requests from allowed and fully blocked ones.
- Validate that your filter lists are effectively enforcing rules on real websites.
- Collect accurate and actionable observations on filter performance to refine and improve your lists.

### Time Estimate
About 15-30 minutes to complete the initial workflow, depending on browsing complexity and number of sites tested.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate — assumes prior understanding of filter lists and network monitoring concepts.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Launch and Setup uBO Scope on Your Device

- Ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your browser.
- Confirm the extension icon is visible in the browser toolbar.
- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup interface.
- You will see sections for Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked domains with connection counts.

### 2. Perform Browsing Sessions to Collect Data

- Navigate to a target website where you want to validate filter list enforcement.
- Browse naturally through the site to trigger typical network requests.
- Observe the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge; it counts distinct third-party domains with
  network requests allowed by your filters.

### 3. Interpret the uBO Scope Outcome Categories

- **Allowed Domains:** Domains from which network requests were permitted. Fewer allowed third-party domains typically indicate stricter blocking.
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains:** Domains where requests were blocked in a way that the website could not detect the blocking (stealth blocking).
- **Blocked Domains:** Domains from which requests were attempted but explicitly blocked or resulted in errors.

Understanding these categories allows you to see not just what was blocked outright but also what stealth blocking conceals from web pages.

### 4. Use uBO Scope on Devices with Limited Browser Tools

- If you lack access to full developer tools (e.g., on mobile or restricted environments), rely on uBO Scope's popup to surface filtered network activity.
- Note the domain counts and details inside the popup for each connection outcome category.
- The concise popup report replaces more complex browser debugger analysis.

### 5. Validate Filter List Enforcement with Real-World Data

- Compare the actual network requests seen with your expectations from your filter lists.
- Look for:
  - Unexpected allowed domains that could indicate filter leaks.
  - Stealth-blocked domains suggesting filters are hiding blocking without detection.
  - Residual blocked domains to confirm filters are actively enforced.

- Repeated testing on several representative sites ensures statistical confidence.

### 6. Collect Actionable Data for Improving Filter Lists

- Record domains that were unexpectedly allowed or stealth-blocked but should be blocked.
- Aggregate counts and patterns across browsing sessions to identify common offenders.
- Use uBO Scope’s data as evidence to update, add, or refine filter list rules.

### 7. Confirm Updates After Filter List Changes

- After modifying your filter lists, repeat the browsing tests with uBO Scope active.
- Confirm that previously unintended domains are now effectively blocked or stealth-blocked.
- The toolbar badge count should decrease or reflect improved blocking.

### 8. Clear Session or Reset Data as Needed

- To avoid stale data lingering from prior sessions, restart your browser or close and reopen tabs.
- This resets the internal session data collected by uBO Scope for fresh measurement.

## Practical Example

Imagine you maintain a filter list aimed at blocking trackers on a news website:

1. You open the site in a browser with uBO Scope active.
2. The badge shows 12 allowed third-party domains.
3. You open the popup and notice several stealth-blocked domains that you didn’t anticipate.
4. You identify these stealth domains and confirm none should be allowed.
5. You modify your filter list to explicitly block those domains.
6. Upon retesting, the badge count drops to 8, and the stealth-blocked domains have shifted to fully blocked, confirming your update's effectiveness.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues for Filter List Maintainers">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Badge Does Not Update During Browsing">
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and has necessary permissions.
- Verify that the extension icon is active and not hidden by the browser.
- Refresh the page or open a new tab to trigger extension data collection.
- Confirm your browser allows `webRequest` monitoring (some browsers or modes may limit this).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth-Blocked Domains Appear Unexpectedly High">
- Understand that stealth blocking is used to avoid detection by webpages and is expected behavior.
- Review filter list rules for that domain to decide if remediation is needed.
- Stealth blocking does not necessarily mean a failure; it often indicates effective stealth enforcement.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Data Is Shown in the Popup on Limited Devices">
- Check for browser or OS restrictions on extensions or network monitoring.
- Reload uBO Scope or the browser to reset data collection.
- Use desktop or fully featured browsers if critical data is needed.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices & Tips

- Periodically test your filter lists on a variety of real websites to catch edge cases.
- Use uBO Scope’s domain counts as a metric, but focus on the distinct domains allowed rather than block counts.
- Don't rely on synthetic "ad blocker test" pages; validate with real-world browsing sessions.
- Combine data from stealth-blocked and blocked categories to uncover subtle leaks.
- Document changes and test results methodically for iterative filter list improvement.

## Summary

This guide has equipped you with a hands-on workflow to use uBO Scope for validating and improving your filter lists, even on constrained devices. By interpreting allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked requests in real browsing contexts, you gain a data-driven approach to refine filter efficacy and ensure privacy protections.

## Appendix: Understanding uBO Scope Data Flow (Background)

When a network request occurs, uBO Scope categorizes it as follows:

- `allowed`: requests that passed filtering and reached the remote server.
- `stealth`: requests that were blocked stealthily to avoid detection by scripts.
- `blocked`: requests that were blocked explicitly and failed.

It tracks these per-tab and aggregates domain counts which are displayed on the toolbar badge and popup UI, enabling visual and quantitative analysis of filtering outcomes.

## Glossary

- **Stealth Blocking**: A blocking method that prevents a webpage from detecting that a request was blocked.
- **Toolbar Badge**: The count displayed on the extension icon showing the number of distinct allowed remote domains.
- **Filter List Enforcement**: The practical effect of rules in your filter list in preventing or allowing network connections.
