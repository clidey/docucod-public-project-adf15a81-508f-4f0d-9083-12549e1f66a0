# Debunking Block Count Myths and Interpreting Outcomes

## Overview
uBO Scope reveals the truth behind common misconceptions about content blocking effectiveness, focusing on why the badge count alone—indicating the number of blocked connection attempts—should not be seen as a proxy for better privacy or content blocker success. This guide explains the nuance behind block counts and connection outcomes, shows practical examples of how these numbers can mislead, and guides you on how to draw meaningful conclusions using uBO Scope data.

## 1. Understanding What the Badge Count Represents

The badge count on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon displays the **number of distinct third-party domains for which content blocking prevented some network requests**. It is **not** a measure of total content blocked requests or a quality indicator of your content blocker.

- **Higher badge count** means blocking connections to more unique third-party domains.
- **Lower badge count** means fewer unique blocked third-party domains.

<span style="font-weight:600;">Important:</span> A higher block count can occur because your browser encounters more distinct third-party servers, not necessarily because the content blocker is better.

<Tip>
Never judge content blocker efficacy or privacy protection solely on the block count shown on the badge.
</Tip>

## 2. Why a Higher Block Count Doesn’t Always Mean Better Blocking

### Scenario: More Connections, More Blocks
If one content blocker allows connections to more third-party servers, it will likely have to block more network requests from those many domains. Even if fewer requests pass through, the block count can be higher simply because the extension sees many distinct domains trying to connect.

### Scenario: Fewer Connections, Lower Block Count
Conversely, a setup that restricts or limits the number of third-party domains from the start might show a low block count because fewer attempts are made. This can result in better privacy and fewer allowed connections despite the lower block number.

### Practical Example
Assume two content blockers A and B applied to the same website:

| Content Blocker | Unique Blocked Domains (Badge Count) | Unique Allowed Domains | Interpretation |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| A               | 15                                   | 5                      | Many distinct domains try to connect, some blocked, still many allowed—potentially lower privacy. |
| B               | 7                                    | 2                      | Fewer distinct domains overall, fewer blocks, likely better overall privacy. |

The block count for A is higher, but that does not mean it is more effective.

## 3. How uBO Scope Helps You Look Beyond Block Counts

uBO Scope categorizes network requests in three outcomes:

- **Allowed** — Connections successfully established to remote servers.
- **Stealth-blocked** — Connections blocked transparently (e.g., redirects, stealth techniques).
- **Blocked** — Explicitly denied connections.

The popup provides a detailed list of distinct domains in each category, along with connection attempt counts.

By reviewing both **allowed** domains and **blocked** domains, you gain:

- Awareness of how many third-party domains your browser connects to (allowed).
- Insight into how many distinct third-party domains the content blocker stops (blocked).

This helps determine if a content blocker truly limits third-party exposure or simply blocks many requests from a larger set of domains.

## 4. How to Interpret Outcomes Effectively

Follow these steps to interpret uBO Scope's reports wisely:

### Step 1: Review the Allowed Domains
- A low number here means good privacy practice since fewer third-party servers were contacted.
- Look for unusual or suspicious domains that might indicate tracking or ad networks.

### Step 2: Examine Blocked and Stealth-Blocked Domains
- These indicate what the content blocker prevented.
- Check if blocked domains correspond to known tracking or ad-serving servers.

### Step 3: Compare Across Browsing Sessions or Tools
- Notice if higher block counts correspond to more allowed domains or fewer.
- A higher block count with higher allowed domains suggests many connections are made despite blocking.

### Step 4: Avoid Using Badge Count Alone
- Badge counts do not reflect the quality of blocking.
- Use the popup details to form an accurate picture.

<Tip>
Use uBO Scope's popup to verify the actual list of allowed domains to better gauge connection breadth instead of relying on raw block counts.
</Tip>

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Regularly inspect** the popup domains while browsing to familiarize yourself with common and suspicious entities.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your primary content blocker to identify unwanted third-party domains slipping through.
- Combine with filter list analysis: uBO Scope helps filter list maintainers verify if filters effectively reduce third-party connections.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

| Pitfall                                      | How to Avoid                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Using badge count as a standalone metric    | Always analyze allowed vs blocked domains for context           |
| Trusting synthetic 'ad blocker test' pages | Avoid these test pages; they don’t reflect real-world browsing  |
| Ignoring stealth-blocked domains             | Review stealth-blocked section for hidden blocking activity     |

## 7. Illustrative Example: Interpreting uBO Scope Data

Imagine you open uBO Scope popup on a news website:

- Allowed domains: `cdn.example.net (5)`, `trusted-ads.com (1)`
- Stealth-blocked domains: `tracker.example.org (3)`
- Blocked domains: `ads.doubleclick.net (8)`, `tracker.badsite.com (4)`

Interpretation:
- The content blocker successfully blocked many ad and tracker domains.
- The allowed domains include some third-party CDNs, which are usually legitimate.
- Stealth blocking is active, indicating some blocking happens quietly to avoid detection.
- The badge count corresponds to the number of blocked domains (two in this example).

This shows a nuanced and trustworthy filtering setup, which cannot be summarized by the badge count alone.

## Appendix: Technical Background (Optional)

<u>How does uBO Scope collect this data?</u>

- It uses browser `webRequest` API listeners to monitor network requests.
- Categorizes requests as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked based on their outcomes.
- Tracks distinct domains connected per tab session.

This technical mechanism supports the detailed reporting but is abstracted away to keep you focused on meaningful insights.
