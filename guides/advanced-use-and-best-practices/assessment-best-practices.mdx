# Best Practices for Assessing Content Blockers and Third-Party Requests

Discover how to leverage uBO Scope to accurately evaluate filter lists, debunk common misconceptions from misleading 'ad blocker test' claims, and conduct fair, real-world comparisons of content blockers. This guide is tailored for privacy advocates and filter list maintainers seeking reliable, actionable insights on third-party request handling.

---

## 1. Understanding the Purpose and Goals

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
- Evaluate content blocker's effectiveness based on distinct third-party connections instead of simple block counts.
- Use uBO Scope to analyze network requests and outcomes with real-world browsing scenarios.
- Debunk unreliable claims from synthetic 'ad blocker test' webpages.
- Adopt fair comparison techniques to assess and improve filter lists.

### Who Should Use This Guide
- Privacy-conscious users wanting transparent insights on what your browser really connects to.
- Filter list maintainers aiming to evaluate their lists against realistic network activity.
- Content blocker evaluators searching for accurate, data-driven assessment methods.

### What You Will Achieve
By following this guide, you will:
- Gain confidence interpreting uBO Scope data.
- Learn to avoid common interpretation mistakes that lead to false conclusions.
- Develop a methodology for consistent and meaningful content blocker assessment.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15–30 minutes for reading and applying the core practices during your browser sessions.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate — assumes familiarity with browser extensions and understanding of content blocking concepts.

## 2. Assessing Content Blockers Using uBO Scope

### Step 1: Use Real Browsing Activity for Testing

1. **Navigate Browsing Sessions Naturally:** Avoid relying on artificially crafted test pages that mimic ad-blocker triggers. These pages often produce unrealistic network requests.
2. **Observe the Toolbar Badge:** The badge number represents the count of distinct third-party domains to which connections were made (i.e., _allowed_ connections).
3. **Open the uBO Scope Popup:** Click the extension icon and view categorized lists:
   - **Not Blocked**: Domains your browser connected to.
   - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains silently blocked by content blockers or the browser.
   - **Blocked**: Domains explicitly blocked.
4. **Compare Across Blockers or Filter Lists:** Use the same browsing session or identical scenario, not synthetic tests, to measure which blocker or filter list truly reduces third-party connections.

<Check>
Remember, a _lower_ badge count signals better privacy because it means fewer distinct third-party domains were contacted.
</Check>

### Step 2: Debunk Misleading 'Ad Blocker Test' Claims

Many 'ad blocker test' websites rely on unrealistic assumptions and network behaviors.

- **Test Pages Can be Deceptive:** They make network requests to domains no real website uses, which content blockers often ignore or treat differently.
- **Stealth Techniques Conceal True Blocking:** Content blockers may silently prevent certain requests, invisible to web page scripts but visible to uBO Scope.
- **Block Count vs. Real Connections:** High block counts do not automatically indicate superior blocking; they can paradoxically correspond to connecting to _more_ third parties overall.

Use uBO Scope data to see beyond these misleading tests—focusing on actual distinct third-party domain connections rather than block triggers or counts.

---

### Step 3: Conduct Fair and Repeatable Comparisons

1. **Set Up Consistent Environments:** Test blockers and filter lists under the same browser version, network conditions, and browsing scenario.
2. **Clean State:** Use a fresh browser profile or clear relevant caches and data to avoid residual state interference.
3. **Monitor the Same Pages:** Navigate through identical websites with real-world content loading.
4. **Capture and Analyze Data:** Use the uBO Scope popup to collect domain connection outcomes, documenting allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.
5. **Evaluate Third-Party Domains Count:** Focus on the unique number of third-party domains successfully connected to, not just raw block metrics.

<Tip>
Consider using multiple browsing sessions or visits to popular sites to gain a representative assessment. Single-page tests may not reflect true blocking performance.
</Tip>

## 3. Practical Tips & Best Practices for Accurate Assessment

- **Interpret the Badge Wisely:** A badge showing zero or a very low count usually means stricter blocking or fewer third-party connections.
- **Use the Popup to Drill Down:** Review domain lists to identify which third parties are blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed.
- **Beware of Overblocking:** Some domains counted as third parties may be legitimate, such as CDN providers. Consider this to avoid overconflating counts with privacy impact.
- **Understand Stealth Blocking:** Domains listed under stealth-blocked may be silently blocked by your content blocker or the browser, invisible in standard tools.

<Warning>
Do not equate higher block counts with better privacy — this is a common misinterpretation that uBO Scope explicitly aims to correct.
</Warning>

## 4. Example Scenario: Evaluating Two Filter Lists

### Setup
- Use the same browser and version.
- Install uBO Scope.
- Configure your content blocker to test Filter List A.
- Open uBO Scope popup on your browsing session.
- Record the badge count and domain outcome breakdown.
- Repeat the steps with Filter List B.

### Analysis
- Compare total distinct third-party domains connected (the badge number).
- Review domains blocked and stealth-blocked for differences.

### Outcome
- The filter list yielding fewer allowed third-party domains while maintaining site functionality is more effective.

## 5. Troubleshooting Assessment Challenges

### Issue: Badge Count Not Updating
- Ensure browsing activity includes network requests to third-party domains.
- Confirm that uBO Scope has proper permissions and is enabled in your browser.
- Reload or open a new tab and revisit a site with known third-party content.

### Issue: No Data Displayed in Popup
- Confirm that the active tab has network activity.
- Verify that uBO Scope is granted `webRequest` permissions.
- Close and reopen the popup.

### Issue: Unexpected Domain Appearances
- Some legitimate services (e.g., CDNs) may show up as third-party connections.
- Distinguish domains that actually impact privacy from innocuous services by reviewing domain names and cross-referencing known CDNs.

<Note>
Refer to the documentation on "Using the Popup: Viewing and Interpreting Network Connections" for details on reading and navigating the popup interface.
