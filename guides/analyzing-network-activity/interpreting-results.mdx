# Interpreting Third-Party Connection Data in uBO Scope

Discover how to effectively read and analyze the categorized network requests reported by uBO Scope. This guide helps you distinguish allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections, empowering you to identify legitimate third-party domains versus unwanted or potentially harmful ones during your browsing.

---

## 1. Understanding Connection Outcomes

uBO Scope classifies each network request made by a webpage into one of three distinct categories based on its outcome:

- **Allowed:** Requests that successfully connected to third-party servers.
- **Blocked:** Requests that were outright blocked and failed to load.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests that were silently redirected or suppressed by content blockers or other mechanisms.

Each category has practical implications for your browsing privacy and page functionality.

### Why These Categories Matter

Knowing which third-party connections were allowed versus blocked offers a clear window into your web privacy footprint. Many ad blockers misleadingly show only block counts, but uBO Scope surfaces the actual number of distinct third-party domains connected, which is the true measure of exposure.

<Info>
The badge count on the uBO Scope toolbar icon corresponds to the number of unique third-party domains in the **allowed** category. A lower count signifies stronger privacy protection.
</Info>

## 2. Reading the uBO Scope Popup Interface

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup displays the following components:

- **Domain Header:** Shows the top-level domain of the current tab for context.
- **Summary Section:** Displays the total count of distinct third-party domains connected (allowed).
- **Outcome Sections:** Three collapsible panels for **not blocked (allowed)**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** domains.

Each section lists domains with their request counts, indicating how many connections were made or attempted.

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Open the popup:** Click the toolbar icon while on a webpage.
2. **Check the header:** Confirm it reflects the site you are analyzing.
3. **Review the summary:** See how many unique third-party domains were connected.
4. **Expand outcome categories:** Inspect domains grouped by their connection result.
   - Allowed domains are generally trusted or necessary third parties like CDNs.
   - Blocked and stealth-blocked domains often indicate trackers or unwanted scripts.

<Tip>
Some legitimate services (e.g., content delivery networks, APIs) may appear in the **allowed** category. Count alone is not an absolute indicator of risk; domain reputation and your browsing context matter.
</Tip>

## 3. Differentiating Legitimate vs. Unwanted Third-Party Domains

Analyzing third-party domains requires a combination of domain familiarity, the nature of the site, and observed behavior.

### What to Look For

- **Known Services:** Domains of large providers like `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `fonts.googleapis.com`, or `cloudflare.net` often serve legitimate site functionality.
- **Unfamiliar or Odd Domains:** Unrecognized domains with generic or suspicious names might be trackers or ad networks.
- **Repeated Requests:** High request counts to a domain, especially in blocked or stealth-blocked sections, often indicate persistent tracking attempts.

### Best Practices

- Use online tools to research unfamiliar domains.
- Cross-reference domains against popular blocklists or whitelist guides.
- Note the domain patterns; some trackers use subdomains of a known domain.

<Warning>
Be cautious about blocking domains essential for site functionality. Over-blocking may break website features.
</Warning>

## 4. Applying This Knowledge to Real Websites

Imagine you visit a news website. The uBO Scope popup shows:

- **Allowed:** Domains like `newswebsite.com`, `fonts.googleapis.com`, and `cdn.newsvendor.net`.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains related to tracking like `track.someadnetwork.com`.
- **Blocked:** Multiple ad-serving domains.

### How to Respond

- Confirm necessary service domains are in allowed.
- Validate that most trackers appear in blocked or stealth-blocked.
- If suspicious domains appear in allowed, consider adjusting your content blockers to tighten controls.

<Tip>
Pay attention to whether stealth-blocked domains are consistently the same across sites; these often represent trackers that block quietly to avoid detection.
</Tip>

## 5. Step-by-Step: Analyze Network Connections Using uBO Scope Popup

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Locate and click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify Current Site and Total Connections">
Check the top header for the current site's domain, then note the 'domains connected' summary for the count of allowed third-party domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
Expand the 'not blocked' section and scan through the domains listed.

- Look for well-known services and CDNs.
- Verify no suspicious or unknown domains are unexpectedly allowed.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Open the 'stealth-blocked' section to see domains silently redirected or blocked.

- Frequent appearance of certain domains suggests tracking or advertising attempts.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Blocked Domains">
Review the 'blocked' domains to confirm your content blocker is actively preventing connections.

- A list of ad-related or tracking domains here is positive.
</Step>
<Step title="Make Informed Adjustments">
Based on your observations, adjust content blocker settings if needed to improve privacy or maintain site functionality.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### Pitfall: Misinterpreting Allowed Domains

Not all allowed domains are harmful or privacy risks. Many support essential site features such as fonts, images, or content delivery.

### Pitfall: Over-Blocking

Blocking domains indiscriminately may break webpage functionality. Always verify the role of a domain before blocking.

### Troubleshooting: No Data or Empty Sections

- Ensure uBO Scope is installed and active on your browser.
- Verify the extension's permissions and restart the browser if necessary.
- Reload the webpage and reopen the popup to refresh data.

<Check>
If the badge shows a count but the popup is empty, a refresh or reinstallation may be required.
</Check>
