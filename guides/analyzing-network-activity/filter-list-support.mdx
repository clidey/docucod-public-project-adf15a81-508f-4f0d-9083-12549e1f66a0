# Supporting Filter List Maintenance with uBO Scope

This guide provides a practical, step-by-step workflow tailored for filter list maintainers and advanced privacy users. It explains how to leverage uBO Scope to validate the effectiveness of content blocking filters, especially on platforms where browser developer tools may be limited or unavailable. By following this guide, maintainers can objectively verify whether their filters block third-party domains as intended and detect any evasion patterns.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps users validate and maintain content blocking filter lists by using uBO Scope to monitor third-party connections in real-time, analyze allowed versus blocked third-party domains, and assess filter performance across different web environments.

### Prerequisites
- Install uBO Scope on your supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with content blockers and filter lists.
- Access to the target website or application to analyze network requests.

### Expected Outcome
- Understand how to use uBO Scope's popup to examine real third-party connections.
- Identify discrepancies between expected and actual blocking behavior.
- Gain actionable insights to refine filter lists effectively without relying on browser dev tools.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15-30 minutes per website or filter list validation session.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate (filter maintainers and privacy enthusiasts).

## 2. Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope on the Target Webpage
1. Navigate to the website or platform you want to test.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
3. Observe the displayed domain count and categorized connections:
   - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
   - **Stealth-Blocked**
   - **Blocked**

> The badge number on the toolbar icon reflects the count of distinct third-party domains connected (allowed).

### Step 2: Analyze Third-Party Domains Reported
1. Examine each category in the popup:
   - **Allowed**: Domains where requests were permitted, potentially exposing privacy.
   - **Stealth-Blocked**: Requests that were intercepted and concealed from the top-level page but technically allowed.
   - **Blocked**: Requests actively prevented by the filter.
2. Use the domain counts to gauge frequency and significance of each third-party.
3. Identify any unexpected or suspicious allowed domains that should be blocked.

### Step 3: Cross-Reference with Your Filter List
1. Compare the uBO Scope allowed and blocked domains with your current filter rules.
2. Verify if domains you expect to block are showing under **Allowed** or **Stealth-Blocked**.
3. Investigate whether stealth-blocking indicates partial filter effectiveness or evasion.

### Step 4: Refine and Test Filter Updates
1. Adjust your filter list by adding or modifying rules to target any missed or stealthy connections.
2. Reload the target webpage and open uBO Scope again to monitor changes.
3. Confirm that the blocked categories increase for problematic domains and allowed categories decrease.

### Step 5: Repeat Validation Across Browsers or Platforms
- Since browser dev tools might be limited on some platforms (e.g., Safari or mobile), use uBO Scope consistently across different supported browsers to compare blocking behavior.

### Step 6: Document Findings and Share with Your Community
- Maintain notes on changes, filter effectiveness, and any evasion techniques detected.
- Share insights with fellow filter maintainers to improve collective privacy defenses.

## 3. Practical Examples

### Example Scenario: Detecting Filter Evasion
- While testing a news website, you observe through uBO Scope that a known ad domain appears under **Stealth-Blocked** instead of **Blocked**.
- This indicates the domain's requests are being redirected or masked rather than outright blocked.
- You update your filter with more precise rules targeting subdomains or request patterns to achieve full blocking.
- After reload, uBO Scope shows the domain under **Blocked** with no stealth bypass.

### Example Scenario: Identifying Unexpected Allowed Domains
- After applying a filter, the popup shows a surprising third-party domain allowed frequently.
- Investigation reveals the domain was recently added or changed ownership.
- You promptly update your filter list to include it.
- Monitoring with uBO Scope confirms the domain is now blocked.

## 4. Tips & Troubleshooting

### Tips
- Always reload the page after filter changes before inspecting with uBO Scope to get accurate data.
- Use the popup's domain counts to focus on high-frequency or high-risk third parties.
- Stealth-blocked domains can be a subtle sign of partial blocking or HTTP redirects — investigate with care.
- Keep your browser and uBO Scope updated to ensure compatibility and accuracy.
- Use uBO Scope in conjunction with your content blocker’s logger for deeper analysis if available.

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue                                       | Solution                                         |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| No data in popup after opening uBO Scope    | Ensure the tab is active and uBO Scope is installed and enabled. Reload the webpage.
| Unexpected domains showing as allowed       | Confirm your filter list covers these domains; consider updating filters.
| Stealth-blocked domains causing confusion   | Understand stealth blocking as redirected or disguised requests; refine filters or consult filter maintainers.
| uBO Scope badge count not updating properly | Reload page and verify extension permissions and host access.

## 5. Next Steps & Resources

- Proceed to [Interpreting Third-Party Connection Data](/guides/analyzing-network-activity/interpreting-results) to deepen your understanding of the connection categories.
- Explore [Mythbusting and Truths About Content Blocking](/overview/introduction-core-concepts/mythbusting-and-truths) to improve your filter list strategies.
- For installation or setup help, refer to [Installing uBO Scope](/getting-started/installation-and-prerequisites/installing-ubo-scope) and [Supported Browsers & System Requirements](/getting-started/installation-and-prerequisites/system-requirements).

## 6. Additional Information on uBO Scope Popup Interface

The popup interface presents three outcome categories for network requests:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Shows third-party domains whose connections succeeded without interference.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were redirected or stealthily handled to limit exposure without full blocking.
- **Blocked:** Domains actively blocked by content filters.

Each domain is listed with a request count, helping you prioritize maintenance efforts based on frequency and potential impact.
