# Interpreting the Toolbar Badge Count: What Does a High or Low Number Mean?

Understanding the number displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar badge empowers you to judge your browser's network privacy at a glance. This guide unpacks what the badge count represents, why fewer third-party servers is a sign of better privacy and security, distinguishes normal versus suspicious connections, and warns against common misunderstandings when comparing content blockers by badge counts.

---

## 1. What the Badge Count Means

The toolbar badge number reflects the **count of distinct third-party remote servers** your current browser tab connected to or attempted to connect to. This is not just raw requests, but the variety of unique domains involved.

- A **lower number** generally means fewer third-party servers are involved, which typically translates to better privacy and reduced tracking surface.
- A **higher number** indicates your browser connected to many third-party domains, increasing exposure to trackers, data leakage, or unnecessary overhead.

<u>Why fewer is better:</u>

- Third-party domains often include advertising networks, analytics providers, or other trackers.
- Even some legitimate services can accumulate to a large number, which is undesirable for both privacy and performance.

<u>What the badge **does not** represent:</u>

- It does **not** indicate the number of blocked requests.
- It does **not** reflect the number of allowed sub-resources from a _single_ domain (count is per distinct domain, not requests).

---

## 2. Understanding Normal vs. Suspicious Connections

Not all third-party connections are inherently bad or privacy-invasive. It's important to recognize typical patterns vs. suspicious ones.

### Typical Legitimate Connections

- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for fonts, scripts, or images (e.g., `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`, `fonts.gstatic.com`).
- Analytics services when explicitly allowed or expected.
- Payment gateway domains or embedded widgets that you trust.

### Suspicious or Potential Privacy Risks

- Unexpected advertising or tracking networks unrelated to the site content.
- Numerous stealth-blocked or blocked domains indicating heavy tracking attempts.
- Domains with obfuscated or unfamiliar names that suddenly appear in your browsing session.

<u>Tip:</u> Check the popup UI to see how the extension categorizes these by **Allowed**, **Stealth-blocked**, and **Blocked** to gain deeper insight.

---

## 3. Avoiding Misinterpretations When Comparing Content Blockers

Many users compare badge counts or block counts between different content blockers to decide which is "better." This can be misleading.

### Common Myths Debunked

- **"Higher block count means better blocking."**
  - Not necessarily. A blocker that blocks more but still allows more third-party domains leaks more connections.
  - The badge focuses on allowed third-party domains, which matter more for privacy.

- **"This test site shows my content blocker is effective."**
  - ‘Ad blocker test’ sites often simulate artificial scenarios that don't reflect real-world browsing.
  - They can't detect the stealth intercepts many blockers perform, skewing results.

<u>Essential insight:</u> The figure that matters for privacy and blocking efficacy is the **number of distinct third-party domains your browser actually connects to** — which is what uBO Scope reveals.

## 4. How to Use This Information Effectively

Follow these steps to leverage the badge count for your privacy and browsing safety:

<Steps>
<Step title="Observe the Badge Count">
- See the number on the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
- Remember: A lower number is better — fewer distinct third-party connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup for Details">
- Click the toolbar icon to open the popup.
- Review the breakdown: Allowed (green), Stealth-blocked (red), and Blocked domains.
- Identify if any unfamiliar domains are present.
</Step>
<Step title="Evaluate Suspicious Domains">
- If unknown or suspicious domains appear in Allowed or Stealth lists, investigate further.
- Consider stronger blocking rules or filters targeting those domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare Across Browsing Sessions or Blockers">
- Use uBO Scope consistently to measure how your content blockers affect third-party connections.
- Avoid being misled by raw block counts or test sites.
</Step>
<Step title="Take Action Based on Insights">
- Adjust filter lists or content blockers based on findings.
- Aim to reduce the badge count while maintaining site functionality.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: Misreading the badge as total connections

The badge does not count every request; it counts distinct third-party domains successfully connected.

### Pitfall 2: Expecting zero badge count on complex sites

Many legitimate sites rely on third-party CDNs or services. Zero is rare and may break site features.

### Pitfall 3: Comparing different users’ badge counts directly

Different browsing behavior, sites visited, and blockers in use mean badge counts are personal.

### Pitfall 4: Relying on ad-blocking test pages

These tests can be misleading and do not reflect real network activities as noted earlier.

## 6. Practical Example

Consider you visit an online news website. The uBO Scope badge shows **8**. You open the popup:

- Allowed: 3 domains (main site, CDN for images, a legitimate analytics service).
- Stealth-blocked: 4 domains (various tracking and ad servers hidden from the site).
- Blocked: 5 domains (ads and trackers you blocked).

This means while some third parties connect, many trackers are stealth-blocked or outright blocked, reducing tracking surface. A count of 8 distinct allowed domains here is reasonable.

If, however, you see 25 or higher, investigate domains to see if unnecessary trackers are slipping through.

## 7. Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting Topics">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- Check if the extension is enabled and has granted permissions.
- Refresh the webpage or open a new tab to trigger network tracking.
- See the Troubleshooting guide for more details.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badges Showing High Counts Unexpectedly">
- Open the popup to verify the domains.
- Identify possible legitimate third-party services inflating the count.
- Consider applying stricter blocking or reporting suspicious domains.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Always Shows Zero or Empty">
- Confirm browsing activity includes network requests.
- Verify no network blocking by other tools preventing tracking.
- Confirm uBO Scope is installed in the right profile/browser.
</Accordion>
