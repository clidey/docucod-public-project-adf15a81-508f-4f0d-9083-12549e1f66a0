# Debunking Content-Blocking and Privacy Myths

uBO-Scope goes beyond typical content blocker comparisons and testing sites by revealing the real story behind what content blockers catch, allow, or stealthily block. This page guides you through practical examples and explanations on why relying on block counts or popular ad-block tester sites to evaluate content blockers can be misleading — and how uBO-Scope provides a clearer, unbiased insight into your browser's true network connections.

## Understanding the Common Myths

### Myth 1: "A Higher Block Count Means a Better Content Blocker"

Many users compare content blockers based on how many connections they block, often represented by a badge count. However, this is a flawed approach because:

- **Block count measures attempts, not success**: A higher block count might mean the browser is attempting connections to more third-party servers, not necessarily that more connections are blocked.
- **Allowed distinct connections matter more**: Privacy and performance improve when fewer distinct third-party remote servers are contacted, regardless of how many block events occur.

<u>How uBO-Scope helps:</u>

uBO-Scope displays the **number of distinct third-party domains your browser successfully connected to** (the badge count). This metric reflects the true exposure. A lower number means fewer external parties received your data, which is more privacy-conscious than just counting blocked requests.


### Myth 2: "Ad-Blocker Test Pages Are Reliable Measures of Blocking Effectiveness"

Popular ad-block tester webpages try to measure blocker effectiveness by generating artificial ad or tracker network requests.

- **Unrealistic scenarios**: These tests use fabricated URLs and setups that do not occur naturally on the web.
- **Stealth blocking is invisible to the page**: Many blockers, including uBO, silently block or redirect requests to avoid breakage or detection. The test pages cannot see or detect stealth-blocking, leading to false assumptions.

<u>How uBO-Scope helps:</u>

By monitoring all network requests at a browser level, uBO-Scope reports actual third-party connections *regardless* of webpage detection. This way, you see the real-world effectiveness of the content blocker rather than what test pages claim.

## Practical Examples Demonstrating the Myths

### Scenario: Comparing Two Content Blockers by Block Count

1. **Blocker A** reports 200 blocked requests via its badge.
2. **Blocker B** shows 100 blocked requests.
3. Intuitively, one might believe Blocker A is better.

<u>Reality check via uBO-Scope:</u>

- With Blocker A, the browser actually allowed connections to 25 distinct third-party domains.
- With Blocker B, the browser allowed connections to only 10 distinct third-party domains.

_Conclusion:_ Blocker B yields fewer actual data-leaking connections even if it reports a lower block count.


### Scenario: Using Ad-Block Test Sites for Benchmarking

- Test pages send requests to non-existent or synthetic third-party domains.
- Real content blockers use stealth techniques that these sites cannot detect, resulting in test pages erroneously classifying the blocker as ineffective.

<u>uBO-Scope's Role:</u>

By observing all network requests your browser makes — including those the page cannot see — uBO-Scope gives an unbiased report showing which connections occurred, which were blocked openly, and which were stealthily handled.

## How to Use uBO-Scope to Validate Blocking Effectiveness

1. **Install uBO-Scope** in your supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
2. **Open uBO-Scope’s popup** while browsing your typical websites.
3. Observe the **domains connected count** shown on the toolbar icon badge.
4. Click the popup to expand detailed lists of:
   - `Not Blocked` (allowed connections)
   - `Stealth-blocked` (blocked connections but hidden from webpages)
   - `Blocked` (explicitly blocked connections)

By analyzing these, you get a comprehensive and real-time view of how your content blocker performs.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Focus on allowed domains count, not block count**: Lower distinct connected third-party domains mean better privacy.
- **Ignore ad-block tester site results for serious assessment**: Instead, use uBO-Scope to analyze actual network behavior.
- **Combine with other privacy tools and settings** for comprehensive protection.
- **Use uBO-Scope on real browsing sessions** to get realistic insights rather than in contrived test environments.

## Troubleshooting Common Misinterpretations

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Encountered Issues and Clarifications">
<Accordion title="The extension badge count is high, does this mean I am not protected?">
Not necessarily. The badge shows current distinct third-party domains connected to your active tab. Some are necessary, like CDN providers or essential services. Assess the list in the popup for legitimacy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some domains show in 'stealth-blocked' rather than 'blocked'?">
Stealth-blocking hides blocking events from webpages to avoid breakage or detection. These domains were blocked quietly by your content blocker, indicating advanced protective measures.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does uBO-Scope interfere with content blocking?">
No, uBO-Scope only monitors network requests reported by the browser. It does not block or modify traffic itself.
</Accordion>
