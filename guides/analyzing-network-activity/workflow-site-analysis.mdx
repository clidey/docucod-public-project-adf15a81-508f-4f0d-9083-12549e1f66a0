# Site Analysis Workflow: Uncover Third-Party Requests

## Overview
This guide walks you through a practical real-world workflow for analyzing the network connections a website initiates using uBO Scope. You will learn how to interpret the toolbar badge count, explore the categorized lists of domains in the popup dashboard, and drill down to request details to differentiate essential resources from potential privacy risks.

Understanding this workflow enhances your ability to audit third-party network activity on any webpage efficiently and thoughtfully.

---

## Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and active in your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser.
- Confirm that the extension has the required permissions and is monitoring network activity correctly.
- Open the webpage you want to analyze with active tab selected.
- Basic familiarity with browser network concepts and third-party domains is helpful.


## Expected Outcome
By completing this workflow, you will:
- Accurately interpret the toolbar badge count representing distinct third-party connections.
- Navigate the popup dashboard to review allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Identify which domains serve essential functions and which might pose privacy concerns.
- Make informed decisions about content blocking or privacy measures.


## Time Estimate
10-20 minutes, depending on the number of third-party connections and depth of investigation.

## Step-By-Step Analysis Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Observe the Toolbar Badge Count">
The badge on the uBO Scope toolbar icon shows a number representing the **count of unique third-party domains** your current tab connected to.

- A **lower badge count generally indicates fewer third-party connections**, which can imply better privacy.
- Note the number before opening the popup dashboard.


<Tip>
This count is not just block counts or arbitrary network requests but reflects distinct third parties actually connected to, regardless of content blocking.
</Tip>

<Check>
Verify the badge count changes as you reload pages or interact with the site to confirm active and correct monitoring.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Step 2: Open the Popup Dashboard for the Current Tab">
Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup dashboard.

- You will see three sections:
  - **Not Blocked**: Third-party domains from which resources loaded successfully.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains with connections redirected stealthily (likely blocked silently).
  - **Blocked**: Domains where requests were explicitly blocked or failed.


<Info>
The dashboard reflects real-time session data gathered for the active tab, categorized by request outcome.
</Info>

<Check>
Confirm the tab domain shown at the top matches the active webpage.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Step 3: Review Allowed (Not Blocked) Domains">
Focus first on the **Not Blocked** section which lists third-party domains your browser connected to.

- Look for familiar CDN or service domains that are essential for site functionality.
- Count the number of domains and compare with the toolbar badge to confirm they match.


<Tip>
Legitimate sites often rely on a small set of key external CDNs or APIs; a high number of allowed third parties may indicate extensive tracking or dependencies.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Don’t assume all allowed connections are safe; investigate suspicious or unfamiliar domains before whitelisting or ignoring them.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Step 4: Examine Stealth-Blocked Domains">
The **Stealth-Blocked** section lists connections that were redirected or blocked silently to prevent detection.

- These may represent trackers or unwanted third-party resources that your content blocker stops quietly.
- Investigate any domains you recognize or suspect.


<Tip>
Stealth blocking is important to prevent breakage or telemetry detection by websites, making this section a valuable indicator of background blocking efficacy.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Step 5: Analyze Explicitly Blocked Domains">
Check the **Blocked** section for domains where connection attempts were stopped entirely.

- This includes resources your content blockers or DNS blocking prevented.
- This section helps identify known trackers or advertising domains that were blocked.


<Note>
A high count here is not necessarily better; focus on whether the blocked domains are known tracking or advertising services.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Step 6: Drill-Down and Investigate Specific Domains">
For domains that raise questions or interest, perform further research:

- Use external tools or domain reputation services to verify legitimacy.
- Cross-reference domain usage with the observed behavior on the webpage.
- Consider adjusting your browser’s content blocking rules if necessary.


<Tip>
Use browser developer tools in parallel to cross-check network requests and understand resource usage.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Step 7: Apply Insights and Iterate">
Based on your findings:

- Decide if you want to tighten privacy controls by blocking more third parties.
- Identify domains critical to site functionality that you must allow.
- Reload the webpage and observe changes in badge count and dashboard.


<Check>
Repeat the process periodically or on different sites to build a comprehensive privacy profile.
</Check>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Example

Imagine analyzing a popular news website:

1. Toolbar badge shows `15` — this means 15 distinct third-party domains were connected.
2. Popup dashboard shows:
   - Not Blocked: `10` domains including content delivery networks and analytics.
   - Stealth-Blocked: `3` domains commonly associated with trackers.
   - Blocked: `2` domains linked to advertising networks.
3. You notice a domain you don’t recognize in the allowed list that contacts an unfamiliar analytics provider.
4. After investigation, you add a custom block for that domain and reload.
5. Badge reduces to `14` and stealth-blocked count increases, indicating your block took effect.

This workflow helps you balance usability and privacy with concrete data.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues When Analyzing Sites">
  <Accordion title="Badge Count Remains Zero or Inaccurate">
    If the badge count does not update or remains zero despite network activity:

    - Confirm uBO Scope has required permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).
    - Reload the extension or browser tab.
    - Verify browser compatibility as some versions limit `webRequest` API visibility.
    - Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/validation-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-common-issues) guide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Popup Dashboard Shows No Data">
    When the popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty sections:

    - Ensure the tab is active and fully loaded.
    - Check network activity has occurred recently.
    - Reload the popup or extension.
    - Validate you are viewing the right tab's data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Domains Are Not Sorted or Difficult to Read">
    If the domain lists seem unordered or confusing:

    - The popup currently sorts domain lists alphabetically.
    - Use browser search within the popup if supported, or export data if available for offline analysis.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Patience is key. Some sites make dozens of requests dynamically, so give uBO Scope a moment after page load for data to appear accurately.
</Tip>

## Best Practices for Site Analysis
- Regularly analyze sites you frequently visit to detect changes in third-party connections.
- Use the badge count as a quick privacy health indicator.
- Combine uBO Scope data with content blocker filter lists knowledge.
- When uncertain about domains, search online for security or privacy assessments.

- Read [Reading and Interpreting uBO Scope Data](/guides/analyzing-network-activity/reading-interpreting-data) for advanced data interpretation techniques.
- Investigate your content blocker's filter lists and refine them based on insights.
