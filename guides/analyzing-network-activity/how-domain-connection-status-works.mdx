# Understanding Allowed, Stealth, and Blocked Connections

## Overview

This guide explains how uBO-Scope categorizes network requests into three distinct statuses: **Allowed**, **Stealth-blocked**, and **Blocked**. These statuses represent the outcome of your browser's attempts to connect to third-party remote servers when loading a webpage. Understanding these categories empowers you to interpret the extension’s reports accurately, helping you assess your browser’s privacy posture and troubleshoot connection behavior.

### What You Will Learn

- The definitions of Allowed, Stealth-blocked, and Blocked connections.
- How uBO-Scope determines and displays these outcomes per domain.
- Practical use cases illustrating how these categories impact privacy and filtering decisions.

## 1. How uBO-Scope Classifies Connections

uBO-Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor every network request initiated by active tabs and categorizes them based on the request’s outcome and blocking status.

### Allowed Connections

These are network requests that successfully reached the target remote server and received a valid response. They represent third-party servers the browser connected to without interference.

- Typically, these include content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics services, APIs, or any external resources not blocked by content blockers.
- In uBO-Scope’s popup UI, allowed connections appear in the **'not blocked'** section with a green accent.

### Stealth-blocked Connections

Stealth-blocked connections are those network requests that were internally redirected or modified in a way that silently prevents the browser from connecting, often to maintain compatibility and avoid detection by websites.

- These connections never reach the remote server but do not produce an obvious failure visible to the webpage.
- They appear in the **'stealth-blocked'** section with a red accent.
- This subtle blocking technique helps prevent webpage breakage while enforcing privacy.

### Blocked Connections

Blocked connections are network requests where the browser attempted to connect but failed due to active blocking (by the extension, DNS filtering, or other mechanisms).

- These requests result in errors or connection failures.
- They are reported in the **'blocked'** section of the UI, also highlighted in red.

## 2. Viewing Connection Statuses in the uBO-Scope Popup

When you open the uBO-Scope extension popup, you receive a real-time summary of all third-party domains contacted by the active tab. The interface divides this information clearly:

- **Tab Hostname:** Displays the domain of the current active tab.
- **Domains connected:** The number of distinct third-party domains the active tab has communicated with.
- Three distinct sections:
  - **Not blocked:** Lists all allowed third-party domains.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Lists domains for requests that were stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Lists domains where requests were actively blocked with error.

Each domain entry shows the domain name and a numeric badge representing how many requests were made to it.

<Tip>
These categories help you gauge how many and which external servers your browser accessed, what was silently prevented, and what was outright blocked to protect your privacy.
</Tip>

## 3. Step-by-Step: Checking Connection Status per Domain

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO-Scope Popup">
Click the uBO-Scope icon on your browser toolbar to open the popup. It immediately loads and displays connection data related to your current active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the Tab Hostname">
Review the top header showing the primary hostname of the current page. This contextualizes all subsequent connection data.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
Look under the **'not blocked'** section. These domains successfully connected.

- Domains are sorted alphabetically.
- The count next to each domain shows the number of requests.
- A large list with many entries means your active tab connected to many third-party services.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Next, examine the **'stealth-blocked'** section.

- These domains represent requests silently blocked without webpage awareness.
- Knowing these helps you understand nuanced privacy protections.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Blocked Domains">
Finally, check the **'blocked'** section.

- These are explicit failures or canceled requests.
- A domain appearing here may indicate aggressive blocking or filtering rules.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpreting the Summary">
At the popup’s summary line, note the total number of distinct allowed domains.

- This count is reflected as the badge on the extension icon.
- A lower badge count means fewer third-party connections, indicating better privacy at a glance.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Verifying Privacy Protections

You visit a news website and open uBO-Scope popup. 
- You see several domains under 'blocked' and 'stealth-blocked'.
- This confirms your content blocker is actively limiting requests to potential trackers.
- By cross-checking these domain names, you can identify common tracking services being blocked.

### Scenario 2: Diagnosing Functional Website Issues

If a website shows broken features,
- Check uBO-Scope to see if critical third-party domains are blocked.
- If required scripts or APIs are blocked, consider whitelisting or adjusting blocking rules.

### Scenario 3: Filter List Maintenance

Filter list maintainers can use the explicit counts and categories to:
- Detect unexpected allowed domains that might need blocking.
- Identify stealth-blocked domains for refining blocking tactics.

## 5. Tips and Best Practices

- **Refresh the popup for updated data:** uBO-Scope gathers connections in real-time; switching tabs or refreshing your website will update the count.
- **Interpret badge counts wisely:** A higher block count does not necessarily mean stronger blocking; focus on the allowed third-party count instead.
- **Use domain names as clues:** Recognizable domains linked to ads or trackers usually appear rightly blocked or stealth-blocked.
- **Understand limitations:** Network requests outside the browser’s `webRequest` API scope may not be visible here.

<Warning>
Do not rely solely on third-party “ad blocker test” sites to assess protection efficacy. They often do not reflect real-world network interactions—uBO-Scope reveals actual network behavior.
</Warning>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Connection Statuses">
<Accordion title="No data shows up in the popup">
Ensure you have the latest version installed, permissions are granted, and you open the popup on an active browser tab with loaded content. See the [First-Time Configuration & Extension Access Guide](/getting-started/essentials/configuration-basics) for help.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some domains only show under stealth-blocked?">
Stealth-blocking silently prevents requests without direct failures to avoid site breakage. These domains may be trackers that your content blocker employs stealth tactics against.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The badge count seems high despite blocking many domains">
The badge counts **allowed** third-party domains. More allowed domains mean more connections made, which could mean the blocker is less effective even if many blocks are reported.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I see request details per domain?">
The current version presents aggregate domain counts. Future updates may expose detailed request information for maintainers.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
