# Reading and Interpreting uBO Scope Data

## Overview

This guide empowers you to confidently understand how uBO Scope categorizes and displays network connection outcomes. You will learn the distinctions between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections, how to read these data within the popup dashboard, and how to interpret the privacy implications for any visited webpage.

With practical examples and annotated scenarios, the guide helps you avoid common misunderstandings and ensures you extract maximum value from uBO Scope's insights about your browsing activity.

## 1. Understanding Connection Classifications

uBO Scope tracks all third-party remote server connections initiated by webpages and classifies these network requests into three outcome categories:

### Allowed Connections
- **Definition:** Network requests that successfully reached the remote server and were allowed to complete.
- **What it means for you:** These connections indicate third-party domains that your browser accessed without interference. Typically, these include content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics services, and other external resources.

### Stealth-Blocked Connections
- **Definition:** Requests that were silently redirected or stealth-blocked in a way that attempts to obscure the blocking event.
- **What it means for you:** These are connections that were blocked or redirected by content blockers or privacy features without triggering a visible or explicit error.

### Blocked Connections
- **Definition:** Network requests actively blocked due to errors, such as DNS rejections, explicit blocking rules, or other blocking events reported by the browser.
- **What it means for you:** These are third-party servers that your browser attempted to contact but were explicitly prevented from completing the connection.

## 2. Navigating the uBO Scope Popup Dashboard

The popup dashboard is the primary interface where uBO Scope presents connection data for the currently active browser tab.

### Key Sections in the Dashboard

- **Hostname Display:** Shows the exact hostname and domain of the active tab in a split view for clarity.

- **Summary Panel:** Displays the distinct count of connected third-party domains.

- **Outcome Categories:** Separate sections for Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked domains, each listing third-party domains along with request counts.

### How to Read the Data

- The **badge count** on the toolbar icon corresponds to the number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections on the current page.
- The domain lists within each outcome section provide detailed insights about which remote servers were connected to or blocked.
- Counts next to each domain reflect the number of individual requests associated with that domain.

<Tip>
The dashboard updates live as you navigate between tabs or reload pages, ensuring you always view current network connection statuses.

## 3. Example Scenarios and Interpretation

### Scenario 1: Low Allowed Count, Some Blocked Connections

Imagine visiting a news website that loads images and scripts from a few third-party CDNs. Your uBO Scope popup shows two domains under Allowed with moderate counts and one domain under Blocked.

Interpretation:
- Your content blocker or browser is successfully blocking unwanted trackers (Blocked category).
- Essential resources from trusted CDNs are allowed and accounted for (Allowed category).
- You maintain a low exposure to extraneous third-party servers.

### Scenario 2: High Allowed Count with Few or No Blocked Connections

In this case, you see a large number of domains under Allowed, few under Blocked, and multiple under Stealth-Blocked.

Interpretation:
- The site or its embedded content pulls resources from many third-party servers.
- Your content blocker might be configured to allow or not catch certain connections.
- Stealth-blocked entries indicate some blocking without explicit failure alerts.

Action:
- Review your content blocking settings if privacy is a priority.
- Investigate suspicious high counts by looking up the domains.

### Scenario 3: No Data or "NO DATA" Display

If the popup shows "NO DATA", the extension has not yet recorded network requests for the current tab.

Possible reasons include:
- uBO Scope has not fully initialized or is still processing.
- The tab has not triggered any third-party network requests.
- Browser permissions or compatibility issues preventing data collection.

Resolve by refreshing the tab or validating installation.

## 4. Best Practices for Interpretation

- **Focus on distinct domain counts:** A lower number of allowed domains generally indicates better privacy.
- **Consider context:** Some allowed connections come from essential, trusted providers (e.g., CDNs).
- **Use domain knowledge:** Research unfamiliar domains before assuming risk.
- **Watch for stealth-blocked entries:** These may hint at hidden blocking activity.
- **Don’t equate block counts with better blocking:** High block counts may mean the site loads more third-party content, not necessarily stronger blocking.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Data Interpretation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with Reading uBO Scope Data">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Domains or Empty Lists">
Check if uBO Scope has permissions to monitor requests and the tab contains active network activity.
- Reload the tab to trigger data capture.
- Verify installation and permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Match Expected Connections">
Understand that the badge reflects distinct allowed domains only.
- Confirm other content blockers may alter network requests.
- See the Mythbusting guide for further explanation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Domains in Allowed or Blocked Lists">
- Use domain lookup tools to verify legitimacy.
- There may be legitimate third-party services on the site.
- Consider adjusting browser or blocker settings if privacy concerns arise.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Practical Tips

- Regularly check the dashboard on sites of interest to understand tracking behaviors.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with your preferred content blocker configurations.
- Use the dashboard before saving filter lists or adjusting blocking rules.
- Consider the badge count as a real-time privacy health indicator per tab.

## Appendix: Annotated Screenshot Example

```html
<!-- Fragment from popup.html -->
<h2 id="tabHostname"><span>subdomain.</span><span>example.com</span></h2>
<section id="summary">
    domains connected: <span>20</span>
</section>
<section class="outcome allowed">
    <h3>not blocked</h3>
    <div class="domains">
        <div class="row"><span class="domain">cdn.example.net</span><span class="count badge">15</span></div>
        <div class="row"><span class="domain">analytics.safesite.com</span><span class="count badge">5</span></div>
    </div>
</section>
<section class="outcome stealth">
    <h3>stealth-blocked</h3>
    <div class="domains">
        <div class="row"><span class="domain">tracker.hiddenads.com</span><span class="count badge">3</span></div>
    </div>
</section>
<section class="outcome blocked">
    <h3>blocked</h3>
    <div class="domains">
        <div class="row"><span class="domain">ads.unwantedsite.net</span><span class="count badge">8</span></div>
    </div>
</section>
```

This example shows the current tab connecting to 20 distinct domains. The majority are allowed connections, some requests are stealth-blocked (likely filtered silently), and several are explicitly blocked. This layout helps users quickly assess which third-party domains are interacting with the page and which are successfully blocked.
