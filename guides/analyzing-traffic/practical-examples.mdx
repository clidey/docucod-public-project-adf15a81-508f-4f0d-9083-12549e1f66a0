# Real-World Privacy Investigations with uBO Scope

Explore practical workflows for auditing third-party network requests using uBO Scope. This guide helps you uncover stealth trackers, analyze connection patterns on well-known and unfamiliar websites, and distinguish between essential and unnecessary remote server connections.

---

## 1. Introduction

uBO Scope exposes all connections initiated by the browser to remote servers during web browsing. This page empowers you to perform real-world privacy investigations to gain visibility into third-party tracking and resource loading that can impact your online privacy.

By following these workflows, you will learn to interpret uBO Scope's reports effectively, recognize stealthy connections, and evaluate the legitimacy of third-party domains contacted.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before starting your investigations, ensure the following:

- **uBO Scope is installed and active** in your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser.
- Your **browser meets minimum version requirements** (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- You have the extension icon visible on your toolbar to open the popup interface.
- You understand the basics of uBO Scope’s terminology and interface. (Refer to [Getting Started: Viewing Your First Domain Connections]( /getting_started/first_use_and_troubleshooting/viewing_your_first_domain_connections)).

---

## 3. Expected Outcomes

- Ability to audit third-party network requests per tab using uBO Scope’s popup.
- Identification of stealth-blocked connections—those that are blocked but may try to evade detection.
- Differentiation between legitimate third-party services (e.g., CDNs) and questionable trackers.
- Enhanced understanding of real-time network connections to inform your privacy choices.

## 4. Investigation Workflows

### 4.1 Auditing Third-Party Connections on Popular Websites

#### Step 1: Navigate to a Popular Website
Open a well-known website (e.g., news, e-commerce, or social media site).

#### Step 2: Open the uBO Scope Popup
Click the uBO Scope extension icon on your toolbar. The popup displays tab-specific third-party domains:

- **Not blocked:** Domains where connections were allowed.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where connections were blocked in a way that attempts to be undetectable by the site.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.

#### Step 3: Analyze Domain Counts
Review the count of distinct domains under each category:

- The **badge number** on the toolbar icon reflects the total distinct allowed third-party domains.
- High counts in the "Not blocked" section indicate numerous third-party connections.

#### Step 4: Identify Unexpected Connections
Look for domains unfamiliar to you, especially under "Not blocked" and "Stealth-blocked." Questions to ask:

- Is this domain related to site functionality or analytics?
- Could this domain be a tracker or ad network?


#### Step 5: Follow Up
Use external tools, such as [publicsuffix.org](https://publicsuffix.org/) or [Whois lookup](https://whois.domaintools.com/), to investigate suspicious domains further.

### 4.2 Investigating Unknown or Suspicious Websites

Follow the same steps as in workflow 4.1, with special attention to:

- Domains with unexpected TLDs or domain structures.
- Connections to domains in the stealth-blocked list, indicating attempts to evade blocking.
- Sudden spikes in domain counts, which may imply aggressive tracking or resource loading.


---

### 4.3 Uncovering Stealthy Trackers

Stealth-blocked entries highlight connections caught blocking mechanisms that try to obscure themselves.

**Action steps:**

- Compare "Stealth-blocked" domains with known tracker lists.
- Consider adjusting filter lists or content blockers if stealth trackers are prevalent.


---

## 5. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Regularly check the popup per tab:** Connections vary per website and browsing session.
- **Use uBO Scope alongside content blockers:** This visualizes what is being blocked or allowed beyond your base filters.
- **Be aware of legitimate domains:** CDNs and popular cloud services often appear and are not inherently risky.
- **Investigate unexpected new domains:** Especially those with counts rising over time.
- **Keep your browser extension updated:** Updates may include improved detection and reporting.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Domains Appear in the Popup
- Verify that uBO Scope is enabled and has required permissions.
- Make sure the website has finished loading network requests.
- Reload the page and reopen the popup.

### Issue: Badge Count is Zero but Connections Happen
- The badge only counts distinct third-party domains successfully connected.
- If connections fail or are stealth-blocked, they may not contribute to the badge.

### Issue: Popup Stays Empty on Some Tabs
- Some websites restrict or sandbox iframe content, limiting visibility.
- Network requests outside the browser (e.g., OS-level) are not reported.

### Tips
- Restart the browser if data appears stale.
- Consult [Solving Common Installation & Setup Issues]( /getting_started/first_use_and_troubleshooting/solving_common_issues) if problems persist.

## 7. Example Investigation Scenario

You visit a popular news site and open the uBO Scope popup. You notice:

- 8 domains listed under "Not blocked" — mostly well-known CDN and ad-serving domains.
- 2 domains under "Stealth-blocked" — you recognize one as a tracker previously flagged.
- 3 domains under "Blocked" — these appear to be known ad networks.

By identifying the stealth-blocked trackers, you explore updating your filter lists to better catch these evasive connections, improving your browsing privacy.
