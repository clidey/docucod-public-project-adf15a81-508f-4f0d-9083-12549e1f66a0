# Techniques for Filter List Maintainers

## Overview
This guide delivers advanced, practical strategies specifically designed for filter list maintainers and power users who want to leverage uBO Scope to its fullest potential. Through these techniques, you will learn how to verify filter effectiveness, spot unexpected remote connections, and debug complex network behaviors on devices where standard development tools are unavailable.

By focusing on uBO Scope's core reporting capabilities rather than browser dev tools, these techniques enable precise, reliable diagnostics vital for maintaining highly effective and privacy-conscious filter lists.

---

## Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and actively monitoring network connections in your browser.
- Basic familiarity with browser extensions and webRequest API concepts.
- Understanding of fundamental filter list terminology, such as "allowed", "blocked", and "stealth-blocked" connections.

For best results, ensure you have performed initial configuration and have verified uBO Scope is capturing data accurately. See [Installation and Setup](/guides/getting-started/install-setup) and [Your First Session: Checking Connections](/getting-started/first-use-and-validation/first-use) for guidance.

---

## Expected Outcome
By following this guide you will be able to:
- Utilize uBO Scope’s popup and badge indicators to quickly confirm which third-party domains your filter list allows or blocks.
- Detect stealth connections that bypass typical blocking, providing insights into filter evasion techniques.
- Troubleshoot filter rules effectively when browser developer tools are limited or unavailable.
- Maintain a data-driven workflow for filter list refinement and reliability testing.

---

## Time Estimate
Approximately 30-45 minutes to fully absorb and practice the techniques using live browsing scenarios.

## Step-by-Step Techniques

### 1. Use uBO Scope to Assess Network Connection Outcomes

- Open uBO Scope popup by clicking the extension toolbar icon.
- Observe the badge count indicating the number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections.
- Review the popup's categorized lists:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which your browser successfully fetched resources.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains whose requests were redirected or silently blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked by your filters.

**Outcome:** Quickly identify which domains your filters permit and which are potentially problematic.

---

### 2. Analyze Stealth-Blocked Domains

Stealth-blocked entries are crucial as they reveal domains your filters redirect or block silently without clear error indications.

- Within the popup, focus on the "stealth-blocked" section.
- Cross-reference these domains against your filter list rules to identify any unintended bypasses or covers.
- Use this to track evasive behaviors by third-party scripts or resources.

**Pro Tip:** These domains often indicate advanced ad networks or trackers working around standard blocking mechanisms.

---

### 3. Compare Results Across Multiple Browsing Sessions

Filter effectiveness is best validated under realistic, diverse browsing conditions.

- Use uBO Scope during browsing on various websites relevant to your filter list domain.
- Observe the badge and popup updates live to capture evolving connection patterns.
- Document frequent allowed or stealth-blocked domains that may require new or adjusted filter rules.

**Example Scenario:** If a shady tracking domain appears consistently allowed, consider crafting targeted rules to block it.

---

### 4. Leverage Badge Counts as a Health Indicator

The badge number reflects distinct third-party domains allowed by the filter.

- A sudden increase may indicate a regression or filter gap.
- A consistently low badge count suggests strong filtering.

**Monitoring Tip:** Use the badge as a quick metric during filter list updates before deeper analysis.

---

### 5. Use Cases for Devices without Dev Tools Access

When standard developer tools are restricted or unavailable (e.g., mobile devices, kiosk modes):

- uBO Scope acts as a standalone monitor revealing network activities.
- You can remotely verify what domains are contacted during browsing without complex tools.
- This aids in diagnosing silent filter leaks or unexpected connections.

**Workflow:** Distribute test URLs, collect data via uBO Scope popups or logs, then analyze remotely for filter adjustments.

---

## Practical Example: Identifying Filter Gaps

1. Browse a popular news website while uBO Scope is active.
2. Note allowed third-party domains, focusing on new or suspicious entries.
3. Open the stealth and blocked sections to see if any trackers are stealthily bypassing rules.
4. Edit your filter list to target these domains or subdomains.
5. Reload the site, confirm reductions in allowed domains via badge count and popup.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Regularly update uBO Scope:** Use the latest version to benefit from any added insights geared toward maintainers.
- **Document findings:** Maintain notes on consistently allowed domains for future rule refinement.
- **Use Unicode domain translation:** The popup UI shows domains in Unicode; use this for accurate domain interpretation.
- **Validate your filters on multiple browsers:** Behavior can differ slightly between Chromium, Firefox, and Safari.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Challenges for Filter List Maintainers">
<Accordion title="Unexpected High Badge Counts">
- Check for streaming or heavy CDN usage by websites.
- Review transient third-party services like analytics or embedded content.
- Use the popup to identify if domains are legitimate or require blocking.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Data in Popup">
- Ensure necessary permissions are granted (see installation guides).
- Close and reopen the popup or reload the browser tab.
- Clear session data if outdated or corrupted (see troubleshooting docs).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth Blocking Not Showing Expected Domains">
- Some domains might be bypassing detection if network conditions vary.
- Cross-verify with browser dev tools if available on desktop.
- Report potential gaps to uBO Scope GitHub if uncertain.
