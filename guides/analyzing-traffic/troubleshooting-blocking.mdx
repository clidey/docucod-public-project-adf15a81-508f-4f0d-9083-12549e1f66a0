# Troubleshooting Content Blocking

Use uBO Scope to gain clear visibility into network requests your browser makes and to resolve issues with content loading or misunderstandings from online ad blocker test sites. This guide walks you through common scenarios such as missing images, videos, or page elements and explains how to interpret uBO Scope’s data to identify what is actually allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.

---

## Understanding the Problem Through uBO Scope

When content on websites doesn't load as expected—images missing, videos not playing, or elements failing to appear—these issues often relate to network requests being blocked or filtered. However, the root cause is not always clear because:

- Your primary content blocker may employ stealth techniques.
- DNS-level blocking or other network-level filters may affect requests invisibly.
- Online "ad blocker test" sites typically simulate unrealistic network requests that do not reflect typical browsing.

uBO Scope helps by exposing **exactly which third-party servers your browser connected to**, categorizing connection outcomes into:

- **Allowed**: Requests succeeded and fetched resources.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Requests that were blocked stealthily and not visible to the webpage.
- **Blocked**: Requests explicitly blocked and reported by your browser.

This transparency empowers you to diagnose loading issues and recognize false assumptions from misleading adblock tests.

## Workflow Overview

- **Task Description:** Use uBO Scope's popup and toolbar badge to troubleshoot content loading or blocking problems.
- **Prerequisites:** uBO Scope installed and active in your browser; you have visited or are visiting a webpage experiencing content loading issues.
- **Expected Outcome:** Ability to identify which third-party domains are allowed or blocked, interpret stealth blocking effects, and debunk unreliable adblock test results.
- **Time Estimate:** 5-10 minutes per troubleshooting session.
- **Difficulty Level:** Beginner to intermediate.

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Guide

### 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar to open the popup.
- Observe the **domains connected** count displayed prominently.
- Review the three main sections:
  - **Not blocked** — third-party domains your browser connected to successfully.
  - **Stealth-blocked** — domains where connections were blocked stealthily.
  - **Blocked** — domains where connections were explicitly blocked and reported.

#### Expected Result:
You see a categorized list of domains showing their connection status for the active tab.

---

### 2. Identify Missing Content Related Domains

- Cross-reference the missing or failing content on the webpage with domains listed in the popup.
- For images/videos failing to load, check if their source domain is in **blocked** or **stealth-blocked**.
- If the domain appears in **not blocked**, the reason for failure lies elsewhere.

#### Decision Points:
- **Domain in blocked or stealth-blocked:** This indicates content is actively or stealthily blocked.
- **Domain in allowed:** Content was at least fetched; check client-side issues (rendering, scripting).

---

### 3. Verify Badge Count and Meaning

- The numeric badge on the toolbar icon represents the **number of distinct third-party domains allowed**.
- A low badge number corresponds to fewer third-party connections, indicating stronger content blocking.

#### Common Pitfall:
Do not assume a higher block count or badge number corresponds to better blocking effectiveness — the extension reflects **distinct domains connected**, not merely request counts.

---

### 4. Use Findings to Adjust Your Content Blocker

- If unwanted third-party connections appear in the **not blocked** section, consider refining your content blocker’s filter lists.
- If domains are stealth-blocked, understand that traditional filter lists may be bypassed, and some stealth blocking can reduce webpage breakage.
- Use uBO Scope data in combination with your blocker to tune rules for optimal balance between blocking and usability.

---

### 5. Debunk Myths From Online "Ad Blocker Test" Pages

Many adblock test pages attempt to trick content blockers and use unrealistic network traffic.

- Open such a test page with uBO Scope enabled.
- Observe that the test domains may not appear in any category or appear unpredictably.
- Understand that real-world network connections differ from artificial tests and rely on uBO Scope’s real browsing data instead.

---

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Missing Images on News Site

- You see missing article images.
- Open uBO Scope popup, find the article image hosting domain under **blocked**.
- Confirm stealth-blocked domains for known trackers.
- Action: Whitelist image domain or adjust filters to restore content.

### Example 2: Video Playback Issues

- The embedded video player on a site won’t start.
- uBO Scope shows the video provider’s domain as stealth-blocked.
- Recognize stealth-blocking may affect scripts needed for the player.
- Action: Temporarily disable stealth blocking for the site or refine rules.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting Scenarios">
<Accordion title="Empty Popup or No Data Shown">
- Verify uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Reload the active tab and open the popup again.
- Ensure the site uses supported protocols (http, https, ws, wss).
- Check browser permissions for network monitoring.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- Tab switch or reload may be required to refresh data.
- Check for browser restrictions on webRequest API.
- Restart browser if persistent.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Confusing Domain Grouping">
- Domains are grouped based on public suffixes.
- Some domains may appear under different sections due to redirects or network behavior.
- Refer to core concepts documentation for detailed explanation.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
For best results, perform troubleshooting on a clean browser profile without conflicting extensions and test with typical browsing patterns rather than synthetic tests.

## Best Practices & Tips

- Use uBO Scope alongside your existing content blocker for precise insight, not as a replacement.
- Regularly revisit the popup when browsing new sites to understand third-party footprint.
- Recognize that a lower number of allowed domains generally reflects stronger privacy protection.
- Don't rely on block counts or test pages alone to assess blocker effectiveness.
- Consider the effect of stealth blocking as a way to maintain site functionality while limiting trackers.
