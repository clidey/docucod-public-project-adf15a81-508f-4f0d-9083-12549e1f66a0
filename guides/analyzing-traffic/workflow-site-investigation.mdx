# Investigating Which Third Parties Are Contacted by a Website

This step-by-step tutorial guides you through opening uBO Scope on an active browser tab to reveal all network connections attempted or successfully made by the website. You will learn to identify legitimate third-party domains, distinguish unwanted or suspicious connections, and understand their implications for your privacy.

---

## Workflow Overview

- **Task Description:** Learn how to open and use uBO Scope's popup on the current page to view distinct third-party domains contacted by the site.
- **Prerequisites:**
  - Have uBO Scope installed and enabled in your supported browser.
  - Browser tab with the website you want to analyze open and active.
- **Expected Outcome:**
  - Gain visibility into all distinct third-party remote servers your browser attempted to contact from the page.
  - Understand the breakdown of allowed (not blocked), stealth-blocked, and fully blocked domains.
  - Make informed judgments about legitimate vs unwanted connections.
- **Time Estimate:** About 3–5 minutes to open uBO Scope and interpret network connections.
- **Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate

## How to Investigate Third-Party Connections

<u>Follow these steps exactly to uncover which domains are contacted by a website using uBO Scope.</u>

### 1. Ensure uBO Scope Is Installed and Active

- Confirm installation by checking for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- If not present, install from [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).

### 2. Open the Website You Wish to Analyze

- Navigate to the webpage you want to inspect in your browser.
- Allow the page to fully load to capture all network activity.

### 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope extension icon in the toolbar.
- The popup displays a summary of third-party domains contacted by that page.

### 4. Interpret the Displayed Data

- **Domains Connected:** The count next to `domains connected:` shows how many distinct third-party domains were contacted.
- **Sections:** The popup divides domains into three categories:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which content was successfully fetched.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or stealth-blocked (invisible to the webpage).
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests were completely blocked by content blockers or other mechanisms.

### 5. Analyze Domain Entries

- Each domain is listed with the number of connection attempts next to it.
- Domains are shown in punycode decoded format for readability.

### 6. Identify Legitimate vs Unwanted Domains

- Use known legitimate CDN and service providers as references (e.g., Google, Cloudflare, Amazon).
- Be cautious with unknown or suspicious domains that may indicate tracking or unwanted requests.
- Remember, a lower distinct third-party domain count generally means better privacy.

### 7. Monitor the Toolbar Badge

- The number badge on the toolbar icon corresponds to the count of distinct allowed third-party domains.
- A rising badge count may indicate more external connections.

## Practical Example

Imagine visiting your favorite news site:

- Open the site in your browser.
- Click the uBO Scope icon.
- In the popup, you see:
  - **Domains connected:** 7
  - **Not Blocked:** `cdn.newsprovider.com` (10), `fonts.googleapis.com` (3), `analytics.example.net` (2)
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** `tracker.badtracker.com` (4)
  - **Blocked:** `ads.someadnetwork.com` (6)

This tells you the content from the news site fetched assets from 7 distinct third parties. While CDNs and fonts are legitimate, trackers and ads were blocked or stealth-blocked.

## Best Practices & Tips

- Visit multiple pages on the site to get a complete view of third-party connections.
- Reload the page and observe changes in domain counts for dynamic network activity.
- Don't rely solely on block counts; focus on distinct domains contacted for privacy assessment.
- Use this data to refine your content blocker settings or filter lists if needed.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **No Data in Popup:** Make sure the page is active and fully loaded before opening uBO Scope. Network requests outside the scope of the browser’s `webRequest` API won’t be tracked.
- **High Count of Domains:** High third-party connection count can be normal for complex sites but usually impacts privacy negatively.
- **Misinterpretation of Badge Count:** The badge shows distinct allowed domains, not block counts or request totals.

---

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with viewing third-party domains:

- Verify uBO Scope permissions are granted: the extension requires access to `webRequest` and host permissions for HTTP(S) and WebSocket URLs.
- Ensure no other extension or browser setting is blocking uBO Scope's data collection.
- Try disabling other content blockers temporarily to see how the information changes.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Common Issues Guide](../../getting-started/usage-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-common-issues) for detailed steps.
