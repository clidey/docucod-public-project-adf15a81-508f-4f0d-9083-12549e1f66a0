# Verifying Effectiveness of Content Blockers with uBO Scope

## Overview
This hands-on guide helps you understand how to effectively assess the performance of your ad blocker or DNS-level blocking solution using the request outcome data provided by uBO Scope. It addresses common misunderstandings about block counts and guides you on how to interpret the real impact of content blockers on your network connections.

---

## What This Guide Helps You Achieve
- Understand how uBO Scope categorizes connections into *allowed*, *blocked*, and *stealth-blocked*.
- Learn to evaluate your content blocker by focusing on the number of distinct connected third-party domains.
- Debunk common misconceptions about block counts and ad blocker testing webpages.

## Prerequisites
Before you start:
- uBO Scope must be installed and activated in your browser. See the [Installing uBO Scope in Your Browser](../getting-started-with-ubo-scope/installing-ubo-scope) guide for installation instructions.
- You should be familiar with the basic popup UI of uBO Scope. Review [Navigating the Popup Interface](../getting-started-with-ubo-scope/using-the-popup-ui) if needed.
- You should have active web browsing sessions where content blockers are enabled to provide meaningful data.

## Expected Outcome
After completing this guide, you will be able to:
- Reliably verify how well your content blocker is performing in real-world browsing.
- Interpret connection outcome data effectively to identify what resources are truly blocked or allowed.
- Avoid being misled by block counts alone.

## Time Estimate
Approximately 10-15 minutes, depending on your familiarity with uBO Scope and your browsing activity.

## Difficulty Level
Intermediate — assumes you understand basic browsing, extension usage, and privacy concepts.

## Understanding Connection Outcomes in uBO Scope

uBO Scope categorizes all observed network requests per browser tab into three clear groups:

- **Allowed (not blocked):** Connections that successfully fetched resources from remote third-party domains.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked by your content blocker, resulting in error outcomes reported by the browser.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that are redirected or prevented invisibly by stealth techniques, often used by sophisticated blockers to avoid detection.

These categories directly reflect the final fate of network requests and provide a truthful snapshot of what your content blocker is allowing or suppressing.

## Step-by-Step Workflow to Verify Content Blocker Effectiveness

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope's Popup Interface">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel, which summarizes network requests by their outcome groups for the active tab.

**Expected Result:** The popup shows the hostname, domain, and lists of domains under 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' sections along with counts.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the 'Not Blocked' Domains">
Look at the domain list under the 'not blocked' section. These represent third-party connections to remote servers that your content blocker did not block.

**What to Look For:** Ideally, this list contains only essential, trusted domains like CDNs or first-party services.

**Verification:** Fewer distinct domains here generally indicate better privacy protection in terms of third-party access.
</Step>

<Step title="Inspect 'Blocked' and 'Stealth-blocked' Domains">
Review the domains reported as blocked or stealth-blocked. These show what your content blocker stopped.

**Important:** Note that a higher number of blocked requests does not necessarily mean stronger blocking overall (see next section).
</Step>

<Step title="Understand the Toolbar Badge Count">
Observe the badge number on the uBO Scope icon, representing the count of distinct third-party domains for which connections were allowed.

**Goal:** Confirm that the badge reflects the real set of remote servers contacted by your browser tab, not just superficial block counters.
</Step>

<Step title="Avoid Misinterpretations of Block Counts">
Do not equate a higher block count with better content blocking. Use the number of allowed third-party domains as the true measure of effectiveness.

**Reason:** A content blocker showing many blocked requests may still allow connections to many distinct third-party domains.

**Guidance:** Focus on minimizing the allowed domains count for stronger privacy and content blocking.
</Step>

<Step title="Ignore Ad Blocker Test Webpages as Reliable Benchmarks">
Avoid relying on artificial ad blocker test sites as they do not reflect real-world browsing or blocker stealth techniques.

**Alternative:** Use uBO Scope's real-time connection data on your typical browsing sessions for accurate assessment.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Use Real Browsing Sessions:** Perform your verification while actively visiting the websites you want to protect, as this yields realistic connection data.
- **Refresh or Reopen Tabs:** To update connection data accurately, reload pages after changing content blocker settings.
- **Focus on Distinct Domains:** The quality and number of distinct remote domains connected reflect privacy leakage risks better than raw block counts.
- **Check Stealth-Blocking:** Recognize stealth-blocked domains as advanced blocking techniques that reduce detectable network calls.
- **Repeat Checks Over Time:** Some resources might load asynchronously; verify after full page load and during interaction.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with Verifying Content Blockers">
<Accordion title="Block Count Misinterpretation">
Avoid using block counts alone as the success metric—these do not account for the total distinct remote servers contacted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Confusion">
Remember the toolbar badge in uBO Scope represents allowed connections, not blocked ones. Lower badge count is preferred.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Stealth Blocking Is Invisible Elsewhere">
Sophisticated stealth-blocking may not be apparent in other tools or test pages. Trust uBO Scope’s categorization instead.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Data Shown in Popup">
If the popup shows 'NO DATA', ensure uBO Scope is active, you have network activity, and that the tab is the active one. See [Troubleshooting Common Setup Problems](../../getting-started/using-extension/common-issues) for help.

## Real-World Example

Imagine you browse a news website. Without content blockers, dozens of third-party domains for ads, analytics, and trackers may be contacted, leading to a high allowed domains count in uBO Scope.

When activating your ad blocker:
- You may observe many domains under 'blocked' and 'stealth-blocked'.
- The 'not blocked' list shrinks to a few trusted services like CDN providers.
- The toolbar badge number drops, confirming fewer third-party connections.

This practical observation validates your blocker’s effectiveness in reducing your exposure.

---

## Summary
Using uBO Scope’s network request outcomes provides a transparent, realistic means to verify how well your content blocker works. Focus on the number of distinct allowed third-party domains to assess blocking strength, rather than raw block counts which can be misleading. Avoid relying on artificial test pages and instead review results from real browsing. This approach ensures your privacy tools’ effectiveness is grounded in actual network behavior.

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

- If no connection data appears, confirm your browser supports required permissions and that uBO Scope is enabled.
- If the badge count seems stuck, reload the tab and check if network requests are happening.
- Understand that DNS-level blocking may not always reflect as blocked if the browser reports network errors as success; uBO Scope’s categories help reveal this nuance.

Keep these tips in mind to maintain accurate verification of your privacy controls.
