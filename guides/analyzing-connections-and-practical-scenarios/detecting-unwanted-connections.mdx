# Detecting and Investigating Unwanted Connections with uBO Scope

Discover how to harness uBO Scope to expose unexpected or potentially unwanted third-party network connections made by your browser. This guide provides practical steps to identify such connections, investigate their nature, and adopt best practices to reduce your digital footprint.

---

## 1. Understanding the Goal

uBO Scope's core mission is to transparently reveal all third-party remote servers your browser connects to during web page loads, shedding light on connections you might not expect or want. Detecting unwanted connections is essential to maintaining privacy, reducing tracking, and understanding hidden network behaviors.

### What You'll Achieve
- Identify unexpected or suspicious third-party domains contacted by your browser.
- Learn how to investigate these domains to determine their legitimacy or threat level.
- Gain actionable insights to reduce unnecessary network exposure.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and activated in a supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Familiarity with uBO Scope's toolbar badge and popup interface for viewing connection statistics.
- Browser permissions correctly set to allow network request monitoring.

<Check>
Ensure your uBO Scope extension is enabled and actively monitoring network requests as described in the [First Launch & Extension Activation](https://example.com/getting-started/installation-setup/first-launch-setup) guide.
</Check>

## 2. Step-by-Step Workflow to Detect Unwanted Connections

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope on the Active Tab">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon while viewing the website where you want to monitor network connections. This opens the popup interface displaying third-party connection details for the current tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Domain Connection Categories">
Examine the three outcome sections shown in the popup: 
- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains your browser successfully connected to.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that underwent redirection stealth-blocking.
- **Blocked:** Domains where network requests were blocked.

Focus primarily on the **Not Blocked** list when investigating unwanted connections, as these represent active communication.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify Unexpected or Suspicious Domains">
Look for domains that seem unrelated or suspicious compared to the site you are visiting. Use domain knowledge or external lookup tools to check these domains.

For example, if visiting a news site, spotting connection attempts to unknown ad trackers, analytics providers, or unrelated country-specific domains may warrant further scrutiny.
</Step>

<Step title="Research Domain Details">
Use external tools like [WHOIS](https://whois.icann.org/), domain reputation services, or security reports to identify:
- Who owns the domain.
- Whether it is associated with known trackers or malware.
- Its geographic or organizational origin.

This helps differentiate benign third-party services (e.g., CDN providers) from potentially unwanted ones.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Connection Counts and Recurrence">
Observe the **count badges** next to each domain in the popup, representing how many requests were made.

High request counts from an unexpected domain may indicate persistent tracking or unwanted telemetry.
</Step>

<Step title="Use the Toolbar Badge for Quick Assessment">
The toolbar badge number reflects the count of distinct allowed third-party domains connected by the current tab. 
Lower badge counts correlate with a tighter privacy profile.

If you consistently notice a high badge count while visiting sites, it signals numerous third-party connections that might merit cleaning up.
</Step>

<Step title="Cross-Validate with Other Tools or Content Blockers">
Complement your investigation by checking your primary content blocker(s) to see whether these domains are blocked or allowed. uBO Scope reports connections independently of blocklists and DNS-based blocking.

This helps reveal connections that blocklists miss or deliberately allow.
</Step>

<Step title="Take Action to Reduce Unwanted Connections">
Once you identify unwanted or suspicious domains:
- Consider updating your content blocker filter lists to block those domains.
- Disable or reconsider usage of browser extensions or software causing these connections.
- Adjust network or DNS-level blocking if applicable.

Repeat the monitoring steps to verify reduction in unwanted connections.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Practical Example: Detecting an Unexpected Tracker

Imagine you are reading news on https://example-news.com, and uBO Scope reports connections to domains like `unusualtracker.com` appearing in the "Not Blocked" list with a high request count.

**Investigation process:**
- Use a WHOIS lookup: reveals the domain is owned by a tracking company.
- Check reputation databases: flags the domain as associated with ad tracking.

**Action:**
- Manually add a blocking rule for `unusualtracker.com` in your content blocker.
- Refresh the page and observe the popup: the domain now appears in "Blocked" with no allowed requests.
- Toolbar badge count decreases, indicating reduced third-party exposure.

This hands-on approach empowers you to control your privacy actively.

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

- **Regularly Review Connections:** Habitually check the popup UI during browsing, especially when visiting new or unfamiliar sites.
- **Understand Common Legitimate Domains:** CDN providers (e.g., `akamai.net`, `cloudflare.net`) often are necessary for proper site functioning and generally safe.
- **Beware of High Counts:** Numerous distinct domains or high-request counts usually signal a high privacy impact.
- **Combine Data Points:** Use the toolbar badge, popup domains, and connection counts together for a clear picture.
- **Update Content Blockers Consistently:** Keep filter lists current to block known unwanted domains effectively.

<Tip>
Use external domain lookup and reputation tools alongside uBO Scope to fully investigate unfamiliar domains.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Consider setting up DNS-level blocking using services like Pi-hole in conjunction with extension-based blockers for layered protection.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Symptom: No Domains Displayed in the Popup
- Ensure the uBO Scope extension is enabled and granted necessary permissions.
- Verify you are viewing an active tab with network activity.
- Reload the page to trigger fresh data capture.

### Symptom: Suspicious Domains Always Appear in Allowed Section
- Confirm no overriding allow rules exist in your blockers for these domains.
- Check that DNS or network-level blocking hasn’t silently failed.

### Symptom: Badge Count Not Updating
- Wait a few seconds; uBO Scope batches updates every second.
- Reload the current tab and check network activity.
- Review browser compatibility and version requirements.

<Warning>
uBO Scope depends on the browser's `webRequest` API. Some connection types outside its reach will not be reported.
</Warning>
