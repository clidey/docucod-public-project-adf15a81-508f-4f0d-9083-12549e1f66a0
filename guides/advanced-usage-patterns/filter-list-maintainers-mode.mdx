# Using uBO Scope for Filter List Evaluation

Harness uBO Scope as a powerful auditing tool designed specifically for filter list maintainers and privacy professionals who work on devices with limited access to developer tools. This guide walks you through a practical, optimized workflow that helps you collect reliable network connection data, spot gaps in filter coverage, and improve filter lists more efficiently.

---

## Workflow Overview

**Purpose:**
- To empower filter list maintainers to audit and evaluate filter coverage through accurate, categorized network connection data collected by uBO Scope.
- To effectively identify allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party connections on web pages where developer tools are restricted or unavailable.

**Prerequisites:**
- uBO Scope is installed and properly configured on a supported browser. See [Installation Instructions](/guides/getting-started-core-flows/install-configure-browsers).
- Basic familiarity with concepts of content blocking and network request outcomes. See [Core Benefits and Use Cases](/overview/introduction-and-value/core-benefits).
- Access to the uBO Scope popup interface to review domain connection summaries.

**Expected Outcome:**
- You will confidently gather network request data partitioned into three outcomes: `allowed`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked`.
- You will identify third-party domains consistently allowed but expected to be blocked and find missing filter coverage.
- You will understand how to interpret the badge counts and popup data to guide filter list improvements.

**Time Estimate:** Approximately 15–30 minutes per evaluation session.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (requires understanding of filter lists and basic network concepts).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Launch uBO Scope in Your Browser

- Make sure uBO Scope is active and visible in your browser toolbar.
- Open the target webpage you want to audit.
- Confirm that the toolbar badge on uBO Scope shows a count indicating distinct third-party domains connected.

### Step 2: Open uBO Scope Popup to Inspect Network Outcomes

- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup interface.
- Observe the summary section at the top showing the number of connected domains.
- Review the three outcome sections:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains where network requests were successful.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where connections were redirected stealthily by the content blocker.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where network requests were outright blocked.

> Note: The separation between stealth-blocked and blocked is critical — stealth blocking means requests were intercepted in a way that prevents detection by the webpage, reducing breakage but still enforcing block.

### Step 3: Analyze Allowed Domains for Unblocked Third Parties

- Start with the **Not Blocked** list.
- Identify third-party domains that consistently appear here despite being privacy or ad trackers.
- These are potential gaps in your filter list that allow unwanted connections.

### Step 4: Cross-Reference Stealth and Blocked Domains

- Check the **Stealth-blocked** section to verify which domains are being handled stealthily.
- Validate the **Blocked** section to see which domains are outright blocked.
- Ideally, known trackers or unwanted third parties should appear predominantly in stealth or blocked lists, indicating robust filter coverage.

### Step 5: Collect Data Across Pages and Sessions

- Repeat the above steps on multiple webpages and browsing sessions.
- Observe domains which repeatedly show up as allowed, marking high-priority candidates for filter list enhancement.

### Step 6: Export or Record Findings

- Manually record domains from the popup lists flagged for review.
- Use this data to create or refine filter rules in your list.

### Step 7: Validate Updates and Iterate

- After updating filters, reload test pages.
- Use uBO Scope again to confirm that previously allowed domains are now stealth or blocked.
- Continue iterative improvements to maximize privacy coverage while minimizing false positives.

## Practical Examples

### Example: Detecting a Missed Tracker

1. Load a news site known to load multiple third-party trackers.
2. Open uBO Scope popup and see a domain like `track.example.com` under the **Not Blocked** section.
3. Review your filter list; if this domain is not explicitly blocked, add a rule.
4. After adding the rule, reload the page and observe that `track.example.com` shifts to the stealth or blocked outcome.

### Code Snippet: Typical Filter Entry
```plaintext
||track.example.com^$third-party
```

This rule blocks requests to track.example.com as a third party.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Collect Data Over Time:** Don't rely on a single page visit — trackers and third parties may load intermittently.
- **Understand Content Blocker Behavior:** Some connections might appear allowed due to explicit exemptions or essential functionality; verify with filter list rules before blocking.
- **Use Domain Aggregation:** Focus on domains reported across multiple sessions to prioritize.
- **Beware of CDN and Legitimate Services:** Not all third parties are trackers; legitimate CDNs should not be blocked indiscriminately.
- **Regularly Update Public Suffix List:** uBO Scope uses this internally to correctly parse domains. Keep it current for accurate domain grouping.

## Troubleshooting

### The Badge Count Does Not Update
- Ensure uBO Scope has permission to monitor `webRequest` events.
- Reload the target page to trigger network re-evaluation.
- Check browser extension settings for any conflicts.
- See [Troubleshooting & Performance Optimization](/guides/advanced-usage-patterns/troubleshoot-optimizations) for details.

### Networks Appear Allowed Despite Known Filters
- Verify that the filter list is active and up to date.
- Some requests might be cached, try a hard refresh.
- Use additional diagnostic tools to confirm if stealth blocking is occurring.

### Popup Shows No Data
- Confirm you're on an active tab with network activity.
- Restart the browser or reload the extension.
- Verify that no network or browser-level issues prevent monitoring.

<Info>
Remember, the goal is not just to maximize block counts but to minimize the number of distinct third-party domains allowed. A lower badge count indicates better privacy protection.
