# Interpreting Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Outcomes

## Overview

This guide takes you on a detailed journey through the three core outcome categories uBO Scope assigns to network requests: **Allowed**, **Blocked**, and **Stealth-Blocked**. Understanding these categories helps you decode how your browser’s connections are treated in real time — offering actionable insights into site behaviors, privacy implications, and blocking strategies. Whether you're a privacy enthusiast, filter list maintainer, or troubleshooting network anomalies, this page equips you to harness outcome data with confidence.

## 1. What Are Network Request Outcomes?

### Purpose
uBO Scope categorizes each network request made by the browser into one of three outcome types:

- **Allowed**: Requests that successfully reached their destination and fetched resources.
- **Blocked**: Requests that were explicitly prevented from reaching the server.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Requests that were silently redirected or obstructed in a way the site cannot detect.

These categories help you understand which third-party domains your browser actually connects to, which ones are prevented, and which get blocked under-the-hood without breaking site behavior.

### Why It Matters
Insight into network request outcomes uncovers:
- How effective your content blocker or privacy settings are.
- The relationships between your current website and third-party domains.
- Stealth blocking patterns designed to reduce webpage breakage or evade detection.

Being able to interpret these results empowers you to make informed privacy or filter list adjustments.

## 2. Understanding Each Outcome Category

### Allowed Outcomes (`not blocked`)

These are requests your browser allowed through without obstruction.

- **What It Reveals:**
  - Domains listed here successfully served resources (e.g., images, scripts).
  - Fewer allowed third-party domains usually means less tracking and privacy exposure.

- **Example Scenario:**
  Visiting a news website; the allowed list might include the site’s own domain and CDN providers.

<Note>
The count and variety of allowed domains directly affects the badge number on the toolbar icon.
</Note>

### Blocked Outcomes (`blocked`)

These requests were explicitly prevented by your content blocker or security settings.

- **What It Reveals:**
  - Domains shown here are detected as unwanted or harmful by the blocking rules active in your browser.
  - Frequent blocked requests may indicate trackers, ads, or malicious domains.

- **Example Scenario:**
  A social media site requests tracking scripts from advertising networks that you have blocked.

<Tip>
High blocked counts alone do not indicate better blocking. It could mean more requests were initiated from third parties.
</Tip>

### Stealth Outcomes (`stealth-blocked`)

Stealth blocking represents requests that browsers or blockers redirect or suppress so that webpage scripts cannot detect the block.

- **What It Reveals:**
  - These are subtle blocking actions designed to minimize webpage breakage or prevent detection by anti-adblock scripts.
  - This outcome category is crucial for privacy-focused users who want unnoticed blocking.

- **Example Scenario:**
  A tracker request silently rerouted or canceled via internal browser mechanisms rather than outright blocked with an error.

<Info>
Stealth blocking helps avoid false positives and maintain smooth site functionality.

## 3. How uBO Scope Tracks and Categorizes Outcomes

uBO Scope listens to various browser events related to network requests using the `webRequest` API:

- **Redirects:** Logged as `stealth-blocked` if redirected to non-network URLs.
- **Errors:** Logged as `blocked` indicating explicit failure or block.
- **Success:** Logged as `allowed` when the request obtains a valid response.

Requests are aggregated by domain and hostname categories per active browser tab, enabling granular reporting in the popup.

<Callout>
The toolbar badge number always reflects the count of distinct third-party domains successfully connected (allowed).
</Callout>

## 4. Using Outcome Data in Practice

### For Privacy Enthusiasts
- **Evaluate Exposure:** Focus on reducing allowed domains to reduce tracking surface.
- **Spot Stealth Blocking:** Recognize domains stealth-blocked to understand hidden mitigations.

### For Filter List Maintainers
- **Identify Blocked Domains:** Pinpoint accumulated block counts to find frequently blocked domains.
- **Fine-tune Filters:** Use outcome data to adjust blocking rules for optimal balance of privacy and usability.

### For Troubleshooting
- **Unexpected Allowed Domains:** Investigate if some third-party domains remain unblocked unexpectedly.
- **High Stealth Activity:** Confirm if stealth blocking correlates with certain filter rules or browser behavior.

<Warning>
Outcome data alone cannot diagnose all network issues—it’s a tool for visibility, not a definitive firewall log.
</Warning>

## 5. Step-by-Step: Interpreting Outcomes in the uBO Scope Popup

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel showing current tab's network outcomes.
</Step>
<Step title="View Summary Data">
At the top, observe the count of connected domains summarizing all 'Allowed' requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
Explore the 'not blocked' section listing domains that supplied resources to your webpage.
This represents your effective network exposure.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Blocked Domains">
Look into the 'blocked' section to see domains where requests were prevented explicitly.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Inspect the 'stealth-blocked' area to identify requests silently suppressed or redirected.
These may indicate subtle privacy protections at work.
</Step>
<Step title="Cross-reference with Browsing Activity">
Correlate the domain lists with current browsing activity to understand third-party connections.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Refresh or navigate the site to see updated outcomes reflecting the latest session data.
</Tip>

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

### Pitfalls
- **Misinterpreting Badge Counts:** The badge shows allowed distinct third-party domains; a low count is better for privacy.
- **Assuming All Blocked Domains Are Malicious:** Some blocked domains can be benign but filtered for privacy.
- **Expecting Perfect Accuracy:** The extension depends on browser APIs and cannot see requests outside them.

### Best Practices
- **Regularly Monitor Outcomes:** Gain awareness of changes in allowed/blocked domains over time.
- **Combine with Other Tools:** Use alongside filter lists and privacy settings for comprehensive protection.
- **Use Stealth Data to Improve User Experience:** Recognize stealth blocking avoids breakage, balancing privacy and functionality.

## 7. Troubleshooting Outcome Interpretation

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Data Interpretation Issues">
<Accordion title="Why don’t I see any data in the popup?">
- Confirm uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Ensure you are on an active tab with network requests.
- Try refreshing the tab to reload data collection.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is the badge count not zero on new tabs?">
- Some background requests or persistent connections may count towards the badge.
- The popup always shows domains detected so far in the current session.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Blocked domains still appear as allowed?">
- Some servers use redirects or fallback URLs counted as allowed.
- The stealth category may contain domains that don’t appear clearly blocked.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
