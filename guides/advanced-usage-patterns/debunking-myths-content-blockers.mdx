# Fact-Checking Content Blocker Claims & Common Myths

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide empowers you to use uBO Scope’s measurements and popup insights to critically evaluate common claims about adblocking effectiveness, badge count comparisons, and the validity of adblock test sites. By following practical, real-world scenarios, you'll learn how to discern misleading data and separate fact from myth.

### Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and activated in your browser (compatible with Chromium, Firefox, Safari). Refer to [Installing uBO Scope](../getting-started/installation-and-setup/installing-ubo-scope).
- A basic understanding of what badge counts represent in uBO Scope. See [Understanding the Badge Count](../guides/core-workflows/understanding-the-badge-count).
- Familiarity with uBO Scope’s popup interface for inspecting allowed, blocked, and stealth domains. See [Monitoring Domain Connections in Real Time](../guides/core-workflows/monitor-domain-connections).

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will:
- Use uBO Scope’s real-world network data to evaluate blocker claims accurately.
- Recognize why badge count comparisons can be misleading.
- Identify the shortcomings of adblock test sites.
- Apply these insights to improve your privacy tool selection and understanding.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15-20 minutes to work through the practical examples and understand key concepts.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate — assumes basic knowledge of uBO Scope and content blocking concepts.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Understanding Badge Count Misconceptions

Most users encounter claims like _"Blocker A has a higher blocked count than Blocker B, so A is better"_. Here’s how to use uBO Scope to verify this:

1. **Open uBO Scope on the browser tab of interest:**
   - Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.

2. **Observe the badge count and popup data:**
   - The badge number reflects the number of distinct third-party domains that your browser connected to for the active tab.
   - In the popup, inspect the "allowed" domains list — these are the domains your browser contacted successfully.

3. **Compare block counts critically:**
   - A higher block count on another blocker does not necessarily mean fewer connections. Use uBO Scope's allowed domains measurement to see if connections have in fact been prevented or are still occurring.

4. **Example scenario:**
   - Run two content blockers separately and note their badge counts.
   - Use uBO Scope to observe which third-party domains were truly blocked or allowed.
   - Notice cases where a blocker with a higher block count still allows more distinct third-party connections, thus potentially exposing your privacy more.

> **Outcome:** You validate marketing claims by seeing actual network request outcomes instead of relying solely on block numbers.

### 2. Debunking 'Ad Blocker Test' Webpages

Some websites claim to detect your content blocker via embedded test scripts or fake ads. These tests often misrepresent blocker effectiveness.

1. **Access a known ad block test page while uBO Scope is running.**

2. **Open uBO Scope's popup for that tab and review domain connections:**
   - Look into the allowed, blocked, and stealth categories.

3. **Verify the test's reported results against uBO Scope’s real measurements:**
   - Ad block test webpages typically make fabricated requests to domains not used by real websites.
   - uBO Scope shows the actual network requests fired, revealing if the page is genuinely blocked or only superficially altered.

4. **Notice stealth blocking:**
   - Extensions sometimes silently suppress requests in ways invisible to test pages.
   - uBO Scope's stealth-blocked list identifies these subtle outcomes.

5. **Interpretation:**
   - Conclude that test sites cannot reliably measure how well a blocker works in authentic browsing scenarios.

> **Outcome:** You develop a realistic understanding of the reliability of blocker tests and improve your trust in real-world data.

### 3. Applying uBO Scope Outputs to Evaluate Claims

1. **For any blocker claim you encounter:**
   - Use uBO Scope to monitor network requests actively on the same browsing session.
   - Look at aggregated distinct third-party domains connected to.

2. **Check the popup’s detailed domain lists:**
   - Allowed: domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
   - Stealth: requests that were redirected or otherwise altered silently.
   - Blocked: outright blocked domains.

3. **Make informed decisions:**
   - Higher allowed domain count means more third-party connections, which generally impacts privacy negatively.
   - Prefer blockers yielding fewer allowed domains for tighter control.

4. **Record observations to compare blockers effectively:**
   - Repeat for several real-world sites.
   - Combine with your understanding of what domains are legitimate.

## Examples & Scenarios

### Example: Verifying Block Count Claims
Imagine a user is comparing Blocker X (claiming `100` blocks) versus Blocker Y (`60` blocks).

- Using uBO Scope, open a typical news website.
- Inspect the popup to see how many distinct third-party domains were actually allowed by each blocker.
- The user finds Blocker X allowed 15 domains while Blocker Y allowed 8.
- Despite fewer blocks, Blocker Y prevented connections to more unique domains.

**Lesson:** Block count alone is a poor proxy; domain connection counts tell the real story.

### Example: Evaluating an Ad Block Test Site
- User visits an adblock test page showing "ads detected".
- The popup lists no allowed third-party domains but shows stealth-blocked domains.
- This confirms the blocker is silently preventing requests.
- The test’s visible "ads detected" result is misleading.

**Lesson:** Trust uBO Scope’s network data over test pages.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Pitfalls
- **Assuming badge count = number of blocked requests:** The badge shows allowed third-party connection counts, not block counts.

- **Counting blocked domains from badge:** Badge text is not a block count; it shows allowed distinct domains for the tab.

- **Relying on adblock test sites:** These sites simulate unrealistic conditions and don’t reflect normal browsing.

### Best Practices
- Use multiple, diverse browsing scenarios when evaluating blockers.
- Look for blockers that yield consistently lower allowed domain counts.
- Inspect stealth-blocked domains to understand subtle blocking effects.
- Refresh the tab to capture fresh session data.

### Performance Considerations
- uBO Scope runs lightweight listeners using the browser’s native webRequest API.
- Badge updates may have a slight delay (about a second) reflecting real network activity.

### Alternative Approaches
- Combine uBO Scope with network analysis tools or developer console for advanced troubleshooting.
- Use the public suffix-aware domain aggregation from uBO Scope for precise third-party domain counts.

# Appendix: How uBO Scope Supports This Guide

- **Badge Count**: Reflects the *number of distinct allowed third-party domains* per active tab.
- **Popup UI**: Categorizes connected domains into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked outcomes.
- **Session Tracking**: Monitors per-tab network requests, resetting on main frame reload.
- **Outcome Recording**: Uses `webRequest` API listeners for redirects, errors, and successful requests.
- **Public Suffix List**: Accurate domain parsing ensures correct third-party aggregation.

These features combine to give you reliable evidence when evaluating blocker performance claims or test site results.
