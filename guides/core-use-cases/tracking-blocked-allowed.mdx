# Mapping Allowed and Blocked Third-Party Domains

Discover how to visualize and interpret all attempted, successful, and blocked network connections on a target website using uBO Scope. Learn strategies to identify unexpected or problematic third-party domains and how real-time badge counts help you monitor privacy risks effectively.

---

## Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish

This guide enables you to map third-party domains that are either allowed, stealth-blocked, or explicitly blocked by your content blockers when visiting a website. By understanding this mapping, you gain clear insights into external connections your browser attempts, helping you evaluate privacy exposures and the effectiveness of your content blocking.

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your supported browser (Chromium, Firefox, Safari).
- Browsing session loaded on the website you want to analyze.
- Basic familiarity with browser toolbar icons and extension popups.

### Expected Outcome

After following this guide, you will:

- Understand how uBO Scope categorizes network connections.
- Be able to read the popup interface distinguishing allowed, stealth, and blocked domains.
- Use the toolbar badge count as a quick overview of third-party connections.
- Apply strategies to identify suspicious or unexpected third-party domains.

### Time Estimate

Approximately 5-10 minutes for first-time users.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open uBO Scope Popup for the Active Tab

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser.
- The popup will appear showing a summary of connections related to the current active tab.

**What You Should See:**
- The main domain and hostname of the current page.
- Counts and lists of third-party domains categorized as not blocked, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

### 2. Understand the Categorization

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
- **Stealth-Blocked (Stealth):** Domains where network requests were redirected stealthily (e.g., silently altered).
- **Blocked:** Domains for which the network request failed or was explicitly blocked.

Each category lists domains along with the number of connection attempts.

### 3. Interpret the Toolbar Badge

- The badge number on the toolbar icon represents the count of **distinct allowed third-party domains**.
- A **lower badge count indicates fewer third-party remote servers** connected, often correlating with stronger privacy protection.

**Tip:** The badge does not show blocked or stealth domains count; it only reflects allowed third-party connections.

### 4. Analyze the Third-Party Domains

- Review the domain lists in the popup.
- Look for any domains unfamiliar or unexpected in the context of the website.
- Use Unicode decoding (handled automatically in the popup) to identify internationalized domain names clearly.

### 5. Investigate Stealth Domains

- Stealth-blocked domains may represent requests altered or redirected by your content blocker.
- These could hint at hidden tracking efforts bypassing blocking filters.

### 6. Refresh Page and Monitor Updates

- Reload the webpage to refresh connection data.
- Notice how badge count and domain lists update in real time.
- Changes can indicate different third-party requests on navigation or page dynamic loading.

### 7. Use This Data To Inform Privacy Decisions

- Identify third-party domains that you consider privacy risks.
- Cross-reference domains with trusted third-party services like CDNs or analytics providers.
- Adjust content blocker settings or filter lists accordingly (outside uBO Scope capabilities).

## Real-World Example

Imagine you visit a news website and open uBO Scope:

- The badge shows "5", indicating 5 distinct third-party domains allowed.
- The popup lists these under "not blocked": cdn.example.com, analytics.tracker.com, ads.adnetwork.com, fonts.googleapis.com, and static.contentdelivery.net.
- "Stealth-blocked" shows a domain like "redirect.tracker.com" indicating requests redirected silently.
- "Blocked" lists domains that were prevented from loading, like some ad servers.

From this, you see most content comes from known CDNs and analytics, but the stealth and blocked lists indicate tracking attempts you may want to scrutinize or block further.

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **No data shown in popup or badge:**
  - Ensure you have refreshed the page after installing uBO Scope.
  - Confirm that your browser supports the required `webRequest` API.
  - Verify that the extension has appropriate permissions (storage, webRequest, activeTab).

- **Badge number not updating:**
  - Wait a few seconds after page load as data is collected asynchronously.
  - Reload the page to force fresh data collection.

- **Popup shows "NO DATA":**
  - Ensure an active web page is selected.
  - Try switching tabs and reopening popup.

### Best Practices

- Regularly refresh pages when analyzing to get up-to-date connection info.
- Use the badge count as a quick privacy assessment but always check popup details for deeper insights.
- Donâ€™t solely rely on block counts from other extensions; focus on distinct allowed third-party domains.
- Recognize that some third-party domains, like major CDN providers, are normal and usually not privacy risks.

### Performance Considerations

- uBO Scope batches network events to optimize performance; updates to the popup and badge occur with slight delay to avoid overhead.
- Avoid excessive tab switching or refreshing which might overwhelm extension processing.

### Alternative Approaches

- Combine uBO Scope insights with browser developer tools for a comprehensive network analysis.
- Use external domain lookup services to get more info about suspicious domains.

<u>Note:</u> The badge count reflects **distinct allowed third-party domains**, not blocked or stealth counts. This distinction is key to accurately assessing third-party network activity.

## How uBO Scope Maps Domains Internally (For Your Understanding)

- uBO Scope listens to network requests via browser `webRequest` API.
- Each tab is tracked independently with domains classified under three categories: allowed, stealth, and blocked.
- Domains and hostnames are extracted using a robust public suffix list to determine the base domains reliably.
- The toolbar badge shows the count of distinct allowed domains for the active tab.
- The popup interface displays detailed sorted lists of domains per category with request counts.

This mapping allows precise per-tab analysis of remote server connections, helping users visualize privacy exposure in real-time.

## Visualizing uBO Scope's Popup Structure

```html
<h2 id="tabHostname"><span></span><span>NO DATA</span></h2>
<main>
  <section id="summary">domains connected: <span>?</span></section>
  <section class="outcome allowed">
    <h3>not blocked</h3>
    <div class="domains"></div>
  </section>
  <section class="outcome stealth">
    <h3>stealth-blocked</h3>
    <div class="domains"></div>
  </section>
  <section class="outcome blocked">
    <h3>blocked</h3>
    <div class="domains"></div>
  </section>
</main>
```

Each `.domains` div contains a list of rows with domain names and the number of requests.
