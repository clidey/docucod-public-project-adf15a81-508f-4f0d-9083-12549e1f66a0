# Debunking Network Request Myths

## Overview
This guide addresses common misconceptions related to network request metrics visible through uBO Scope, focusing on the extension's badge count, testing pages, and what truly matters when assessing web privacy and content blockers. Understanding these myths will empower you to make better-informed decisions in interpreting uBO Scope's reporting and evaluating website privacy.

## 1. Understanding the Badge Count

### What the Badge Count Actually Represents
- The badge number on the browser toolbar icon represents the **count of distinct third-party remote servers** from which network requests were **allowed** (not blocked).
- A **lower badge count** is generally preferable, indicating fewer third-party servers accessed.
- Note that not all third-party servers are harmful or unwanted; many are legitimate, such as content delivery networks (CDNs).

### Common Misconception

- **Myth:** A higher block count or badge count means better blocking.

- **Reality:** A higher block count can actually mean more network connections to third-party servers before blocking occurs, sometimes reflecting less effective blocking overall.

### Practical Implication
When comparing content blockers or their settings, focus on the **number of distinct allowed third-party servers** rather than simply the number of blocked requests. uBO Scope highlights this nuance clearly.

## 2. Why Avoid 'Ad Blocker Test' Webpages

### The Problem with Test Pages
- Many popular “ad blocker test” pages are **unreliable for evaluating extension-based content blockers**.
- These pages often use **artificial or contrived network requests** that do not reflect real-world browsing.
- They cannot observe stealth blocking methods employed by extensions, such as silent request cancellations or filtering without overt blocking.

### How uBO Scope Helps
- uBO Scope monitors *actual* network requests made by webpages.
- It tracks **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth-blocked** connections accurately.

### Recommendation
- Do not use ad blocker test pages as your benchmark for content blocker reliability.
- Instead, rely on uBO Scope’s real-time network connection insights for effective evaluation.

## 3. Key Terms and Their Meanings

- **Allowed:** Requests that successfully connect to remote servers without interference.
- **Blocked:** Requests terminated or prevented by a content blocker.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests that are silently canceled or redirected in a way intended to avoid detection or webpage breakage.

This classification helps you understand the real impact your content blockers have on network connections.

## 4. How to Use These Insights Effectively

### Step 1: Observe the Badge
- Check the badge count as an indicator of the number of unique third-party servers in use.
- A zero or low number usually means minimal third-party resource fetching.

### Step 2: Open the Popup
- View the detailed popup panel listing domains categorized by Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked.
- Evaluate which domains are allowed — these represent actual network connections made.

### Step 3: Analyze Domain Relevance
- Some allowed domains serve critical roles like content delivery; not all third parties are necessarily tracking or harmful.
- Identify suspicious or excessive third-party domains for further actions such as custom blocking.

### Step 4: Avoid False Conclusions from Test Sites
- Focus on real browsing data rather than contrived network requests on test pages.

## 5. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

| Pitfall | Explanation | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Comparing block counts only | Higher block count may indicate more complex requests, not better blocking | Focus on distinct allowed domains count displayed by the badge and popup |
| Trusting ad blocker test pages | Tests may not reveal stealth blocking or real world connections | Use uBO Scope for real network visualization |
| Ignoring stealth blocking | Stealth-blocking is invisible to most test sites | Use uBO Scope popup to recognize stealth-blocked domains |
|
| Assuming all third parties are bad | Many third-party servers are legitimate and necessary | Analyze domain roles before acting |

---

## 6. Quick Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your browser supports the required `webRequest` API to allow accurate capture.
- Confirm uBO Scope has the necessary permissions to access active tabs and network requests.
- If badge or popup data seems inconsistent, try reloading the page or restarting the browser tab.

For detailed troubleshooting, see the [Validating Your Installation Guide](/getting-started/troubleshooting-support/validate-extension).

---

## 7. Summary
- The badge count shows distinct allowed third-party servers, not the number of blocked requests.
- Ad blocker test pages are unreliable; rely on real network data in uBO Scope.
- Use the popup interface to see a categorized view of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.
- Analyze domains thoughtfully, distinguishing between necessary services and undesired tracking.

<Tip>
Always consider the context of third-party domains and network connections rather than solely relying on metrics such as block counts or test page results.
