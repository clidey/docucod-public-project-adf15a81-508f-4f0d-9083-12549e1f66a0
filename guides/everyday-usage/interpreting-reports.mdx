# Understanding the Popup: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Domains

## Overview
This guide demystifies the key metrics presented in the uBO Scope popup: allowed third-party domains, stealth-blocked connections, and the significance of the badge number. You will learn how to interpret these indicators to accurately assess the privacy impact of content blockers and avoid common misunderstandings.

## Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and active in your browser.
- A webpage loaded with network activity to analyze.
- Familiarity with basic networking concepts such as domains and requests (helpful but not mandatory).

## Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will confidently:
- Understand what each section in the popup represents.
- Know how the badge count corresponds to active network connections.
- Reliably assess the effectiveness of your content blocker and the privacy exposure of web pages.

## Time Estimate
Approximately 10 minutes.

## Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## 1. What the Popup Displays
When you click the uBO Scope browser icon, the popup presents a categorized summary of network connections related to the active tab.

### 1.1 The Badge Number Explained
- **What it Represents:** The number shown on the toolbar badge is the count of distinct third-party domains that your browser connected to for the current tab.
- **Why It Matters:** A lower number typically indicates fewer third-party connections, thus better privacy.

<Check>
The badge number counts **allowed third-party domains only** — domains from which network requests succeeded and were not blocked.
</Check>

### 1.2 Popup Sections
The popup divides domains into three outcome categories:

| Section           | Description                                                                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not blocked**   | Domains from which requests were allowed and successfully connected.                          |
| **Stealth-blocked** | Domains where requests were stealth-blocked — these requests were silently blocked without alerting the webpage. |
| **Blocked**       | Domains where network requests were explicitly blocked and failed to connect.                |

Each domain entry shows the domain name and the count of network requests involving it.

## 2. Step-By-Step Guide to Interpret the Popup

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar while on the webpage you want to analyze.

- **Result:** You will see a popup listing the connected domains.
</Step>

<Step title="Read the Badge Number">
Look at the number displayed on the toolbar badge.

- **Interpretation:** This number equals the count of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to (allowed connections).
- This number excludes domains whose requests were blocked, either stealthily or explicitly.
- **Tip:** If the badge is empty, no allowed third-party connections were detected.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Not Blocked Section">
In the popup, find the 'not blocked' category.

- **Action:** Review the list of domains here. These are the third-party servers your browser contacted successfully.
- **Use Case:** Domains here may be legit services like CDNs or trackers.
- The count next to each domain shows how many requests were made.
</Step>

<Step title="Explore the Stealth-blocked Section">
Locate the 'stealth-blocked' category.

- **Meaning:** These domains’ network requests were blocked silently to prevent detection by the webpage.
- These stealth-blocked connections are typically complex, where the blocker avoids alerting websites about the block.
- Being stealth-blocked may indicate well-crafted blocking rules aiming for seamless privacy.
</Step>

<Step title="Examine the Blocked Section">
Check the 'blocked' category.

- **This section:** Lists domains where network requests were explicitly blocked, and the browser stopped the request.
- These domains may appear when blocking is overt and easily detected, potentially causing website breakage.
- Counts here reflect failed connections that never completed.
</Step>

<Step title="Compare Categories to Understand Privacy Impact">
Compare the domains and counts across the three categories.

- A high number in 'not blocked' means many third-party connections occurred, even if blocking actions took place.
- A large number in 'stealth-blocked' shows that many network requests were silently blocked for optimal privacy.
- If many domains appear in 'blocked' but are absent from 'stealth-blocked', blocking may be more direct but detectable.
</Step>

<Step title="Use the Data to Assess Content Blocker Behavior">
Use these insights to judge how your content blocker performs.

- **Lower allowed domain counts suggest better privacy protection.**
- **Stealth blocking is preferable to breakage-prone explicit blocking.**
- **Note:** A high block count badge may misleadingly suggest better blocking but often means more allowed connections happened.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Practical Example
Imagine you visit example.com, and uBO Scope shows:

- **Badge:** 5
- **Not blocked:** cdn.example.net (20), analytics.tracker.io (3)
- **Stealth-blocked:** ads.annoying.com (10)
- **Blocked:** popup.badads.com (2)

This means:
- 5 distinct allowed third-party domains were contacted successfully.
- Some requests to ads.annoying.com were stealth blocked to avoid breaking the page.
- Popup requests to popup.badads.com were explicitly blocked.

This helps you conclude the content blocker is actively protecting but still allowing some third parties.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge number sometimes seem high even with blocking enabled?">
Because the badge counts the number of allowed distinct third-party domains. If your blocker allows connections to many domains, the number stays high even if some requests are blocked elsewhere.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does 'stealth-blocked' mean exactly?">
Stealth-blocked connections are those blocked silently, so the webpage cannot detect the blocking event. This avoids detection and reducing breakage risks.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why are some domains in the blocked section but not in stealth-blocked?">
Explicit blocking of certain requests causes failures visible to the webpage, so they appear under 'blocked'. Stealth blocking is a more subtle technique used when supported.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some legitimate domains appear in the allowed list?">
Content blockers typically allow essential services like CDNs. Some third-party connections are necessary for website functionality and are low risk.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How often is the popup data updated?">
The popup data is based on the current tab's network activity up to the moment of popup open. Refresh the page or click the toolbar icon again to see updated metrics.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Regularly reviewing the popup helps you stay aware of the effective privacy protection on each website you visit.
</Tip>
