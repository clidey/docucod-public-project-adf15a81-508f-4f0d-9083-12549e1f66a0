# Analyzing Real Websites: Example Scenarios

Explore hands-on examples using popular websites to understand how uBO Scope exposes third-party network activity. This guide helps you differentiate between essential and questionable domains, recognize stealth or blocked connections, and identify privacy-respecting versus privacy-intrusive designs through real-world scenarios.

---

## 1. Overview of Use Cases

### Task Description
This guide walks you through analyzing actual websites with uBO Scope to reveal network connections made during page loads. You will learn to:

- Identify third-party connections and their classification (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked)
- Understand how these connections relate to website functionality and privacy
- Spot differences between benign content delivery and privacy-invasive tracking

### Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and active in your browser
- Basic understanding of uBO Scope’s badge and popup reading (see [Understanding the Badge & Popup](https://docs.example.com/guides/getting-started/using-ubo-scope/interpreting-badge-popup))
- Access to popular websites for testing

### Expected Outcome
By following the scenarios, you will be able to confidently interpret uBO Scope reports for complex web pages, discerning network behaviors that matter for privacy and content blocking.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15-30 minutes per website scenario, depending on depth of analysis.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate — Familiarity with browser extensions and network concepts beneficial but not required.

## 2. How to Analyze Real Websites with uBO Scope

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope Popup on Target Website

1. Navigate to the website you want to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon to open the popup panel.
3. Observe the badge count on the toolbar icon indicating the number of distinct third-party allowed domains.

**Expected result:** The popup displays the current tab’s top-level hostname and domain at the top.

### Step 2: Review the Domain Categories

The popup organizes domains into three categories:

- **Allowed**: Domains where requests succeeded and were not blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Domains where requests were blocked stealthily (e.g., redirects or soft blocking).
- **Blocked**: Domains where requests were explicitly blocked.

Follow these guidelines:

- Identify well-known CDN or service provider domains in **Allowed** (e.g., Google APIs, CDN providers).
- Spot tracking or ad-related domains in **Blocked** or **Stealth-blocked**.
- Use domain counts next to each domain to see how frequently the domain was contacted.

**Expected result:** You clearly see which third parties are considered essential versus questionable.

### Step 3: Compare Site Behavior Across Browsing Sessions

- Reload the webpage with different content blocker settings (e.g., uBlock Origin enabled/disabled).
- Observe changes in domain lists and badge counts.

**Decision Point:** Domains disappearing from allowed into blocked or stealth indicate content blockers’ intervention.

Verify if the number of allowed third-party domains decreases without breaking site functionality.

### Step 4: Spot Privacy-Respecting vs. Privacy-Intrusive Designs

- Domains that serve static content (images, stylesheets) but do not track users often appear in **Allowed**.
- Domains known for ads, tracking, or user profiling typically move into **Blocked** or **Stealth-blocked**.
- Evaluate if the site uses minimal trusted CDNs versus a large number of tracking services.

**Tip:** Use external domain intelligence tools to research unfamiliar domains.

## 3. Example Scenario: News Website Analysis

Let's analyze a typical news website's third-party network activity.

### Step-by-Step

1. Visit the news website.
2. Open uBO Scope popup.
3. Review the badge count showing number of allowed domains (expect a moderate count, e.g., 5-15).
4. Check the **Allowed** domain list for CDNs and content providers.
5. Look at the **Blocked** and **Stealth-blocked** lists for ad networks, trackers.
6. Reload the site with content blocking off and on to observe difference.

### Expected Observations
- Common allowed domains: content delivery (cdn.news.com), analytics (news-analytics.com).
- Blocked domains: advertising networks, trackers (adnetwork.com, tracker.xyz).
- Stealth-blocked: redirects to trackers or ad servers.

### Outcome
Understanding which third parties contribute to site functionality vs. tracking informs decisions on privacy settings.

## 4. Example Scenario: E-commerce Website Analysis

E-commerce sites commonly load multiple third-party scripts and resources.

### Steps
1. Navigate to the e-commerce website.
2. Open uBO Scope popup.
3. Examine **Allowed** domains: payment gateways, CDN, stock checking services.
4. Review **Blocked** and **Stealth-blocked** for marketing and tracking domains.
5. Explore the frequency counts for significant domains.

### What to Look For
- Allowed domains often essential for ordering and payment.
- Blocked domains may include behavioral analytics, personalized ads.
- Confirm that blocking these domains does not break purchasing features.

### Pro Tip
Disable content blocker temporarily to test if site functions properly with blocked domains allowed.

---

## 5. Best Practices for Effective Analysis

- **Always start with your primary domain**: Understand the main domain before analyzing third parties.
- **Use domain counts to prioritize**: Frequent requests may indicate critical dependencies or aggressive tracking.
- **Keep an eye on stealth-blocked domains**: Some trackers use redirection or stealth techniques to evade detection.
- **Cross-reference domain names with known lists**: Utilize privacy resources or filter lists for context.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Network Activity Analysis">
<Accordion title="No Data in Popup or Badge Count is Empty">
- Ensure uBO Scope extension is installed and enabled.
- Confirm you’re on a supported browser and version.
- Reload the webpage.
- Check if the site uses HTTPS or WebSocket URLs that uBO Scope is permitted to monitor.
- Refer to [Troubleshooting Installation and Startup](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/troubleshooting-support/common-issues).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Domains Always Appear Allowed">
- Some third parties are essential CDN or service providers.
- Confirm your content blocking settings with uBlock Origin or similar.
- Examine stealth-blocked and blocked lists carefully for hidden tracking.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Confusing Domain Names or Punycode Encoding">
- uBO Scope decodes internationalized domain names to Unicode.
- Use external WHOIS or domain intelligence sites to understand unfamiliar domains.
- Cross-check with public suffix lists for domain classification.
