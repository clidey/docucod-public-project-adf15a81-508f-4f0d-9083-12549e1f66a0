# Mythbusting Content Blocking Metrics

uBO Scope empowers you to critically evaluate common content blocking metrics and popular ad blocker benchmarks. This guide dismantles misleading assumptions around block counts and test site results, demonstrating how to leverage uBO Scope’s true network connection data to gain accurate insights.

---

## Why This Guide Matters

Web users and filter list maintainers often rely on block counts or ad blocker test pages to judge content blocking effectiveness. However, these metrics can be deceiving or outright inaccurate. Instead, understanding the real connections your browser makes to third-party servers reveals more trustworthy privacy exposure data.

uBO Scope exposes these true connections by monitoring real network activity, independently of any content blocker’s self-reported metrics or artificial test scenarios.

## What You Will Learn

- How block counts on toolbar badges can mislead privacy conclusions.
- Why ad blocker test websites provide unrealistic benchmarking.
- How to use uBO Scope to uncover authentic blocking performance.

---

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and active in your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser.
- Familiarity with the uBO Scope popup panel interface (see [Reviewing Third-Party Connections with the Popup](/guides/getting-started-essentials/review-connections-popup)).
- Basic understanding of third-party connections and terminology (recommended: [Key Concepts and Terminology](/overview/core-concepts/key-concepts-terms)).

## Understanding Block Counts: The Core Myth

Many users assume that a higher block count (the number displayed on a content blocker’s toolbar icon) means better protection. This is incorrect because:

- The block count reflects the number of *block events*, not necessarily the number of distinct third-party domains blocked.
- A blocker reporting more blocks may still allow your browser to connect to more unique third-party servers, meaning your privacy exposure is actually broader.

<u>Example Scenario:</u>

> If AdBlocker A shows 100 blocks but your browser connects to 20 different trackers, and AdBlocker B shows 50 blocks but your browser connects to only 10 different trackers, AdBlocker B may actually provide better protection despite the lower block count.

### Use uBO Scope to Validate Block Counts

1. **Open uBO Scope’s popup panel on a browsing session.**
2. **Observe the "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" categories with domain counts.**
3. **Cross-check the unique third-party domains in the "not blocked" list.**

A lower number here means fewer actual connections, directly correlating with better blocking performance.

Never rely solely on block counts from toolbar badges to evaluate a content blocker’s effectiveness. Instead, use the unique domain connection data from uBO Scope.

## Debunking "Ad Blocker Test" Webpages

Many "ad blocker test" sites claim to benchmark blockers by generating synthetic resource requests and scripts. These pages are unreliable because:

- They perform *engineered* network requests that do not reflect real-world browsing behavior.
- Content blockers employ stealth techniques that evade detection by such test pages, causing false positives or skewed results.
- Real websites load diverse and complex resources that these test sites cannot simulate effectively.

### How to Use uBO Scope for Accurate Assessment

1. **Browse your favorite real-world websites with uBO Scope active.**
2. **Open the popup panel to inspect the connection lists.**
3. **Compare blocking patterns and the counts of allowed domains for those real sites against advertised test results.**

This approach grants true insight into blocking behavior under real browsing conditions.

<Warning>
Avoid trusting any benchmark results solely from synthetic ad blocker test sites. They do not represent genuine blocking quality.
</Warning>

## Walkthrough: Using uBO Scope to Critically Assess Blocking

Follow this actionable sequence to expose and validate blocking claims:

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to the Target Website">
Open a website where you want to analyze third-party connections and blocking.
</Step>
<Step title="Activate uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup panel.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Domain Categories">
Review the three sections — 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'. Look at the domain counts displayed.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Unique Domain Count">
Focus on the 'not blocked' domains. This list reflects distinct third-party servers your browser connected to, despite any content blocking.
</Step>
<Step title="Cross-Reference with Content Blocker Dataset">
If comparing multiple blockers, open uBO Scope while each one is active separately. Notice the variations in 'not blocked' counts.
</Step>
<Step title="Conclude Blocking Effectiveness">
A blocker allowing fewer unique third-party domains is objectively more effective in reducing network exposure.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope alongside your primary content blocker(s) to validate blocking claims substantially.
- Regularly check real websites instead of synthetic test pages to gauge your privacy exposure.
- Understand that some third parties are essential or benign (e.g., CDN providers), so evaluate domains contextually.
- Recognize that 'stealth-blocked' domains are invisible even to the page, indicating subtle blocking methods.

<Tip>
Filtering decisions should focus on unique connected domains rather than raw block counts.
</Tip>

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Assuming a content blocker with a higher toolbar block count protects you better.
- Trusting test sites that create unrealistic and non-representative blocking challenges.
- Overlooking stealth blocking, which may silently block but not show in block counters.
- Confusing the number of blocked requests with the number of distinct tracked domains exposed.

---

## Troubleshooting

If uBO Scope shows unexpectedly high 'not blocked' domains:

- Verify your content blocker is enabled and correctly configured.
- Ensure uBO Scope has necessary permissions and is functioning (refer to [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-steps-and-validation/troubleshooting-setup)).
- Reload the target website to refresh data.
- Review the popup UI to confirm domains are categorized correctly.

---

## Summary

This guide clarifies that neither block counts on toolbar badges nor results from ad blocker test pages accurately reflect real blocking performance.

uBO Scope reveals actual third-party network connections made by your browser, empowering you to make informed choices about content blockers and privacy.

Use uBO Scope to compare blockers by the number of unique third-party domains allowed, yielding meaningful and actionable privacy insights.

# Appendix: Common Misconceptions

| Myth | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| A higher block count equals better blocking | A higher block count can mean more block events but more allowed third-party connections. | 
| Ad blocker test sites reliably measure blocker effectiveness | These sites use artificial scenarios and cannot detect stealth techniques, giving unreliable results. |
| All third-party domains are bad and must be blocked | Many third-party domains serve essential functions or legitimate services, requiring contextual evaluation. |
