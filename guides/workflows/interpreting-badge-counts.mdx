# Making Sense of Badge Counts and Domain Lists

Unlock the true value of uBO Scope by mastering the interpretation of its toolbar badge and the connected domain lists displayed in the popup. This guide walks you through understanding the privacy and security implications inherent in each measure and illuminates how uBO Scope’s network telemetry differs fundamentally from content blockers.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### What this guide helps you accomplish
This guide empowers you to:
- Accurately interpret the toolbar badge count on the uBO Scope icon.
- Distinguish between the categories of domains listed in the popup panel.
- Understand what each category reveals about your web browsing privacy.
- Recognize why uBO Scope offers an independent and more transparent perspective on network connections compared to typical content blockers.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and active in a supported browser ([installation instructions](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope#installation)).
- Basic familiarity with browsing behavior and third-party domains.
- Access to the uBO Scope popup panel by clicking the toolbar icon.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will confidently read and interpret the badge counts, analyze the three domain lists in the popup, and understand their implications for your privacy and web security.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10–15 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate.

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count

### What does the badge count represent?
The toolbar badge shows a single, meaningful number: the count of **distinct third-party domains from which connections were allowed** for the current active tab.

- This count **only includes allowed third-party domains** — domains from which network requests succeeded.
- A smaller number is generally better for privacy, indicating fewer external data connections.
- The badge omits domains for which connections were blocked or stealth-blocked.

### Why focus on domains rather than requests?
Many requests can hit the same third-party domain, so the badge simplifies your view by highlighting how many distinct domains your browser reached.

This approach reflects real privacy impact better than raw block counts.

### Key insight
<uBO Scope’s badge helps you see the unique exposure footprint per webpage, cutting through misleading block counts associated with some content blockers that might still permit many unexpected connections.>

## 3. Exploring the Popup Domain Lists

When you open uBO Scope’s popup by clicking the toolbar icon, you see three distinct sections representing different types of network connection outcomes:

### 1. Allowed ("Not Blocked")
- Lists the third-party domains that successfully connected and delivered resources.
- Each domain is accompanied by a count of how many requests were made.
- Indicates the current network footprint of the page.

### 2. Stealth-blocked
- Shows domains where connection attempts were silently blocked or redirected.
- These “stealth” blocks may not be visible to the webpage itself.
- Helps reveal content blockers’ stealth filtering that avoids outright failures but prevents certain network traffic.

### 3. Blocked
- Lists domains for which connection attempts failed explicitly (errors or denials).
- These are connections definitively blocked, e.g., by the content blocker or browser policies.


### Important distinctions
- The **allowed section** reveals your actual exposure points to third-party servers.
- The **stealth-blocked section** offers insight into subtle, behind-the-scenes blocking often invisible to webpages.
- The **blocked section** shows outright denied network attempts.

This tripartite view enables a more nuanced understanding than any single number.

## 4. How uBO Scope Differs from Content Blockers

Traditional content blockers focus on blocking specific requests and often report block counts derived from how many individual requests were stopped.

<uBO Scope differs in key ways:>
- It shows **all** connection attempts observed by the browser’s webRequest API, independently of whatever content blockers do.
- Network activity reported includes successes, failures, and stealth blocks, providing a full transparency report.
- Badge counts focus on **distinct allowed third-party domains, not block statistics**, offering a clearer picture of your privacy exposure.

This means uBO Scope can debunk myths such as:
- "Higher block counts mean better blocking."
- "Ad blocker tests on fake pages are a reliable measure."

It gives you real, unbiased insight into third-party interactions.

## 5. Step-by-Step: Reading Your Connection Data

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope popup panel">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup panel displaying network connection data for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the toolbar badge count">
Observe the number displayed on the badge. This is the count of distinct allowed third-party domains connected by the page.

- If the count is zero, no third-party servers were reached.
- Higher counts indicate more domains contacted.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine the 'Allowed' domain list">
Review the 'not blocked' section with domains and their request counts.

- This represents the active third-party network footprint.
- Large counts or unexpected domains could signal potential privacy concerns.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the 'Stealth-Blocked' list">
Inspect the stealth-blocked domains.

- These are domains where connections were silently blocked or redirected.
- Even though requests were stopped, the page may not detect these actions.
- Presence of entries here shows your content blocker’s subtle filtering effects.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the 'Blocked' list">
Look at domains where network requests failed directly.

- This indicates explicit blocking, preventing resource fetches.
- Helps identify domains your content blocker prevents from loading.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the overall picture">
Use the three lists combined with the badge count to understand your current tab's network interactions:

- The sum of distinct domains from all lists reflects the total number of third-party domains involved.
- Focus on the allowed list for privacy exposure.
- Review blocked and stealth-blocked to assess blocking effectiveness.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Practical Example

Suppose you visit a news website and see:
- Toolbar badge: **5**
- Allowed domains: cdn.news.com, analytics.net, ads.partner.com
- Stealth-blocked domains: tracker.adservice.com
- Blocked domains: malicious.domain.fake

Interpretation:
- You connected to 5 distinct third-party domains delivering resources.
- Some tracking domains are stealth-blocked, showing subtle filtering.
- Explicit blocking prevented network access to a malicious domain.

You gain an informed view of your privacy exposure and effectiveness of blocking tools.

## 7. Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting & Tips">
<Accordion title="Badge count does not update or shows zero">
- Ensure uBO Scope has necessary permissions (webRequest, storage).
- Reload the tab after installation.
- Confirm the tab is active and the popup is open.
- Review Troubleshooting Common Issues guide.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain lists are empty or missing some sections">
- Some pages may have no network requests or third-party domains.
- Stealth/blocking depends on the content blocker in use and browser support.
- Try visiting different sites to verify.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Multiple requests for same domain not reflected in badge">
- Badge counts unique domains only, not individual requests.
- This is intentional to indicate distinct external connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected domains in allowed list">
- Some required third-party domains serve essential site resources (CDNs, APIs).
- Research domains if concerned; legitimacy varies by website.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Improving privacy using uBO Scope insights">
- Use domain visibility to inform content blocker rule customization.
- Identify unnecessary or suspicious third parties.
- Combine with advanced debugging or filtering techniques.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
