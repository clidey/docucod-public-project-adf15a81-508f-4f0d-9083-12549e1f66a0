# Monitoring Network Connections Per Tab

## Overview

This page helps you understand how uBO Scope captures, categorizes, and displays all outbound network connections for the currently active browser tab. The focus is on interpreting the detailed network activity seen in the popup panel that appears when clicking the extension's toolbar icon.

By following this guide, you will gain clarity on what "allowed", "blocked", and "stealth-blocked" network requests mean within the context of the active tab and how these requests relate to third-party domains. This insight empowers you to make informed privacy and security decisions based on precise network visibility.

---

## What You Will Achieve

- Learn how uBO Scope organizes network requests per tab.
- Understand how to interpret the data displayed in the popup panel.
- Identify which third-party domains are contacted, and their request outcomes.

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and properly activated in your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- Permission granted to allow uBO Scope to monitor network requests (webRequest permission).
- Basic familiarity with web browsing and extension toolbars.

## Time Estimate

You will need approximately 5–10 minutes to open the extension and interpret active tab data.

## Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate

## How uBO Scope Captures Network Data Per Tab

uBO Scope continuously listens to all network requests triggered by webpages through the browser's `webRequest` API. It captures three types of outcomes for requests:

- **Allowed**: Requests that successfully fetched resources.
- **Blocked**: Requests that failed due to blocking (error event).
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Requests redirected or modified by stealth blocking (e.g., filter lists or content blockers operating invisibly).

These requests are tracked **per browser tab**, enabling you to see precisely which network connections each tab initiates.

### Network Categorization Explained

- **Allowed Requests**: These are connections allowed by the browser; their domains appear under the "not blocked" section.
- **Blocked Requests**: These requests have failed explicitly (e.g., DNS failure, content blocked) and are listed under the "blocked" section.
- **Stealth-blocked Requests**: Often harder to detect, these requests are implicitly blocked or redirected to avoid detection by webpages; they appear under "stealth-blocked".

The extension separately aggregates the domain counts and hostnames for each outcome.

## Viewing Network Connections in the Popup Panel

1. **Activate the Tab**
   - Ensure you are on the browser tab whose network connections you want to analyze.

2. **Click the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon**
   - The popup panel appears showing a summary of network connections related to the active tab.

3. **Review the Header**
   - The top line shows the hostname and domain of the active tab.
   - The hostname displays the full domain string including subdomains.
   - The domain is the base domain, stripped down using the Public Suffix List for accuracy.

4. **Summary Section**
   - Displays the total count of distinct domains connected by this tab under all outcomes.

5. **Outcome Sections**
   - Three panels categorize domains by request outcomes:
     - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
     - **Stealth-blocked**
     - **Blocked**
   - Each panel lists domains encountered with the number of requests for each.

### Important Details

- Domains are shown in Unicode, correctly decoding any punycode encoded names.
- The domain counts reflect unique base domains contacted, which provides a clearer picture than just individual hostnames.

## Step-by-Step: Monitor Network Connections Per Active Tab

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Active Tab You Want to Analyze">
  Navigate to the browser tab whose network activity you want to observe.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the uBO Scope Toolbar Badge Icon">
  Click the extension icon near your address bar to open the popup panel displaying network data for that tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Header Information">
  Locate the hostname and domain names at the top, confirming you are viewing the correct tab's data.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Summary of Total Domains Connected">
  Find the "domains connected" count for a quick overview of how many unique third-party domains this tab contacted.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Each Outcome Section">
  Review the three sections titled 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' for lists of domains and request counts.
  These detail allowed and blocked network requests categorized by domains.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips

- **Focus on 'Not Blocked':** Seeing many unique domains here means numerous third-party connections are allowed, which can implicate privacy concerns.
- **Use 'Blocked' & 'Stealth-blocked' Insights:** These help to identify content potentially stopped by blockers or network errors.
- **Domain Grouping:** uBO Scope groups requests by base domains using an up-to-date Public Suffix List, making it easier to assess unique third-party entities.
- **Update Awareness:** The extension stores and saves session data, so reopening the popup shows recent activities.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Network Connections Display">
<Accordion title="No Data Shown for Active Tab">
Ensure the extension has required permissions; verify that the browser supports `webRequest` API and uBO Scope is activated (see Getting Started guides).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains Appear Suspicious or Unexpected">
Remember that many legitimate sites use multiple third-party services (e.g., CDNs, analytics).
Consider researching domain reputations before deciding on privacy risks.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Counts Don’t Match Other Blocker Counts">
Understand that uBO Scope measures distinct domains contacted, not block counts by content filters.
Use counts as a broader privacy indicator rather than blocker performance measure.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding the Data Behind the Scene

While you don't need to know technical implementation details to use uBO Scope effectively, it's helpful to know:

- uBO Scope tracks network requests by listening to browser events (redirects, errors, responses).
- It records successes, errors, and stealth blocks associating them with active tabs.
- Data is processed and stored per tab session to keep the badge and popup information current.
- The Public Suffix List ensures correct domain extraction even for complex domain hierarchies.

---

## Example Scenario

You visit an e-commerce site and want to know what third-party services it connects to.

1. Open the site tab.
2. Click uBO Scope icon.
3. See "not blocked" domains that include the e-commerce server but also advertising, analytics, and CDN domains.
4. Spot blocked or stealth-blocked domains indicating trackers stopped by your content blocker.

This helps you understand which external companies the site interacts with in real-time.

## Summary

uBO Scope reveals detailed, categorized network connections per active browser tab through its popup panel. Understanding these connections helps you gain transparency over third-party interactions and privacy implications on a site-by-site basis.

## Reference: Popup Panel Structure

The popup panel HTML is structured with sections for each outcome, dynamically filled with domain rows:

```html
<h2 id="tabHostname"><span></span><span>NO DATA</span></h2>
<section id="summary">
  domains connected: <span>?</span>
</section>
<section class="outcome allowed">
  <h3>not blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
<section class="outcome stealth">
  <h3>stealth-blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
<section class="outcome blocked">
  <h3>blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains"></div>
</section>

<template id="domainRow">
  <div class="row"><span class="domain">_</span><span class="count badge">_</span></div>
</template>
```

This design supports clear visualization and counts per domain.
