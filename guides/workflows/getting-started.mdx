## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Install uBO Scope on Your Browser

1. Open your browser's official extension store:
   - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) for Chromium browsers
   - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) for Firefox
2. Search for "uBO Scope" or use the links above.
3. Click **Add to Browser** or **Install**.
4. Grant any permissions requested (especially related to monitoring web requests).

<Note>
Granting `webRequest` and `storage` permissions is essential for uBO Scope to monitor network connections effectively.
</Note>

### Step 2: Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

- After installation, find the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar area.
- The icon displays a **badge count** indicating the number of distinct third-party remote servers currently connected by the active tab.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the icon immediately, pin it to your toolbar via your browser’s extension management interface.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- The popup will display a summary of connections made by the current tab, categorized as:
  - **Not Blocked** (allowed connections)
  - **Stealth-Blocked** (requests blocked stealthily by content blockers)
  - **Blocked** (requests explicitly blocked)
- You will also see the domain counts and detailed lists of remote servers.

### Step 4: Verify uBO Scope is Monitoring Correctly

- Visit any website in your browser.
- Observe the badge count increase or update to reflect network connections.
- Open the popup panel to check detailed domain connection information.
- Confirm that data populates dynamically with your browsing activity.

<Check>
If you see **NO DATA** in the popup or no badge count changes, ensure that permissions are granted, and the extension is enabled.
</Check>

## 3. Understanding What You See

- **Badge Count:** Shows the number of unique third-party servers connected by the current tab. Lower counts often indicate fewer tracked or unnecessary third-party requests.
- **Popup Domains:** Connections are grouped by outcomes — allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked — helping you assess network behaviors.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common First-Time Issues

### Issue: Toolbar Badge Not Showing or Always Zero

- Confirm that the extension is enabled in your browser’s extension manager.
- Ensure the site you visit has network activity.
- Refresh the page after installation.
- Check browser permissions for network monitoring.

### Issue: Popup Shows NO DATA

- Wait a few seconds after opening a new tab for data to populate.
- Try visiting sites with more external resources.
- Reload the extension or browser if problems persist.

### Best Practices
