# Analyzing Third-Party Connections on Any Website

## Overview
This guide equips you with practical steps and insights to analyze which third-party servers a webpage communicates with using uBO Scope. By inspecting connection groups such as CDNs versus ad or tracker domains and understanding the badge count, you will deepen your ability to assess your browsing privacy and compare network behaviors across websites.

## Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and enabled in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Basic familiarity with browsing websites and accessing browser extensions.

## Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Open and interpret the uBO Scope popup panel for any active webpage.
- Distinguish between different categories of third-party connections.
- Understand the significance of the badge count as a privacy metric.
- Compare third-party connections across different websites.

## Time Estimate
10-15 minutes for full walkthrough and initial practice.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup on the Website
- Navigate to any website you want to analyze.
- Click on the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- The popup displays detailed connection information for the current tab.

**Expected Result:**
The popup panel opens and begins showing active data. If no data appears, reload the page and retry.

---

### 2. Understand the Connection Breakdown
The popup splits domains into three key outcome groups:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Third-party servers your browser connected to successfully without blocking.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that occurred but were stealthily redirected or impacted (typically by the browser or filter).
- **Blocked:** Connections that were actively blocked and did not complete.

Each group lists domains and how many requests were made to each.

**Tip:** Legitimate CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) often appear in the 'Not Blocked' group as they serve crucial resources. Ad or tracker domains commonly appear under 'Blocked' or 'Stealth-Blocked'.

---

### 3. Interpret the Toolbar Badge Count
- The number displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge represents the count of **distinct third-party remote servers your browser successfully connected to**.
- **Lower numbers indicate higher privacy,** as fewer third-parties are loading resources.

**Important:** Do not confuse this count with block counts from other extensions; uBO Scope focuses strictly on distinct successful connections.

---

### 4. Analyze Domains in Context
- Look at the domain names listed in each section.
- Research unfamiliar domains by visiting [publicsuffix.org](https://publicsuffix.org/) or using a domain lookup service to determine their purpose.
- Identify which domains belong to:
  - Legitimate services like analytics platforms, CDNs, or essential content providers.
  - Potential ad or tracking networks.

**Example:** Domains such as `cloudflare.net` or `akamai.net` usually indicate CDNs, while domains associated with large ad networks may raise privacy concerns.

---

### 5. Compare Connections Across Multiple Websites
- Repeat the process on different websites.
- Notice how the badge count and domain listings change.

**Outcome:**
Compare which websites expose you to more third-party connections.
A site with a **higher badge count and many unfamiliar domains** suggests a greater potential privacy risk.

---

## Practical Scenario
Imagine you visit a news website. You open uBO Scope and see:
- **Not Blocked:** `cdn.news.com`, `cloudfront.net`
- **Stealth-Blocked:** `tracker.ads.net`
- **Blocked:** `adserver.com`

You understand the site relies on CDNs for content delivery but tries to load tracking domains. Your content blocker stealthily intervened on some trackers and actively blocked others. The badge count shows 2, indicating only two successful third-party remote servers. This helps clarify your privacy exposure clearly.

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **No Data Shown in Popup:** Check that the extension has permissions enabled (webRequest, storage, activeTab).
- **Badge Count Does Not Update:** Reload the page or restart the browser to ensure fresh data collection.
- **Unfamiliar Domains:** Use external domain lookup tools to verify and understand domain ownership.

### Best Practices
- Periodically review connection data when visiting sensitive or privacy-critical websites.
- Use the information to refine your filter lists or blocking strategy.
- Avoid judging content blockers solely by block counts; focus on distinct third-party connections as revealed by uBO Scope.

### Performance Considerations
uBO Scope operates efficiently in the background, collecting network data in near real-time without noticeable impact on browsing speed.
