# Interpreting the Badge Count and Results

Understanding the badge count and the detailed results displayed by uBO Scope is crucial to accurately assessing your browsing privacy landscape. This guide walks you through the meaning behind the badge number, why a lower count is generally better, and how to detect stealthy or hidden third-party connections.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you interpret the badge count on the uBO Scope extension icon and understand the detailed categorized connection results shown in the popup panel. You'll learn why the badge count reflects third-party remote servers successfully connected to, the significance of allowed versus blocked connections, and how to recognize stealth-blocked (hidden) connections.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled on your browser.
- Browsing one or more webpages to observe network activity.
- Basic familiarity with the popup panel interface (recommended reading: [First Steps: Analyzing a Webpage](../../guides/getting-started/first-steps)).

### Expected Outcome
- Confident interpretation of the badge count meaning per tab.
- Ability to identify distinct third-party servers involved in network activity.
- Recognition of stealth-blocked connections that may be hidden but still affect your privacy.

### Time Estimate
5-10 minutes to grasp concepts and check current tab results.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate.

## 2. Understanding the Badge Count

### What the Badge Number Represents
The badge number displayed on the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar shows the count of **distinct third-party remote servers that have successfully connected** during your current tab session.

- This is **not** a count of blocked connections or total requests made, but a count of unique remote servers from which resources have been fetched.
- A lower badge count generally indicates fewer third-party servers contacted, which often corresponds to better privacy.

### Why a Lower Count Is Usually Better
- Fewer third-party connections mean reduced exposure to cross-site tracking and less third-party data collection.
- Many legitimate sites use a small number of necessary third parties (such as CDN providers).
- High counts may indicate excessive tracking or advertising services being loaded.

### Caveats
- Not all third parties are harmful or privacy-invasive.
- In some cases, a legitimate service (e.g., analytics, embedded content) may increase the count.
- Use the detailed popup to evaluate each domain connection rather than relying only on the badge number.

## 3. Interpreting the Detailed Connection Results

When you open the uBO Scope popup panel, connections are grouped into three categories:

### Allowed ("not blocked")
- These are third-party domains to which the browser successfully connected.
- Shown in green-highlighted sections.
- You can view the domain names and how many times requests were made.

### Blocked
- Domains for which network requests were blocked by your browser or content blockers.
- Shown in red-highlighted sections.
- No resources from these domains were fetched, enhancing privacy.

### Stealth-Blocked ("stealth")
- Connections that were blocked in a way that tries to hide their blocking status from the webpage.
- Also shown in red but separated from regular blocked domains.
- These stealth-blocked domains may indicate more sophisticated privacy protection as the connection outcome is disguised from web scripts.

## 4. Step-by-Step Instructions to Interpret Results

<Steps>
<Step title="Check the Toolbar Badge">
Open your browser tab while the uBO Scope extension is enabled. Look at the extension icon's badge number.

- **What to expect:** The number represents distinct third-party servers contacted.
- **If blank:** No third-party connections detected yet.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.

- Observe the hostname shown at the top.
- Review the summary count of connected domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
Look under the "not blocked" section:

- Domains here successfully served resources.
- Consider if these are legitimate CDNs or unexpected third parties.
- Higher counts may indicate increased privacy risk.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Stealth-Blocked Domains">
See the "stealth-blocked" section:

- These domains had connections blocked in a stealthy manner.
- Their presence indicates active and advanced blocking.
- Pay attention if this list includes known trackers.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Blocked Domains">
Under the "blocked" section:

- These domains are explicitly blocked with no resource fetched.
- These connections have been prevented successfully.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze Counts and Patterns">
Notice the count badges next to each domain:

- Counts reflect the number of requests per domain.
- Frequency can indicate how persistent a domain tries to connect.
- Use this to understand which third parties are most active.
</Step>
<Step title="Form Conclusions Based on Observations">
- A low badge count with mostly blocked or stealth-blocked domains suggests strong privacy protection.
- High allowed counts require reviewing whether these third parties are necessary or invasive.
- Use this insight to adjust content blocker settings if desired.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Always use the popup panel to contextualize the badge count. The badge alone cannot fully describe the privacy state.
- Keep an eye on stealth-blocked domains to appreciate subtle blocking mechanisms.
- Regularly revisit your browsing patterns and third-party connections, especially on unfamiliar sites.
- Use uBO Scope alongside other blocking tools for broader protection.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

<Tip>
**Misinterpreting a high badge count as a failure:** A high number can sometimes result from legitimate site functionality rather than privacy leaks.
</Tip>
<Tip>
**Assuming all block counts mean better blocking:** Block counts from other tools might be misleading; uBO Scope emphasizes unique remote servers connected, not raw block counts.
</Tip>
<Tip>
**Ignoring stealth-blocked connections:** These are important to recognize, as some blockers hide blocking to enhance privacy.
</Tip>
<Tip>
**Expecting immediate badge updates:** Badge updates may have small delays due to batching network events.
</Tip>

## 7. Troubleshooting Badge and Result Discrepancies

### Badge Not Updating or Blank
- Ensure uBO Scope has necessary permissions (webRequest, storage).
- Refresh the tab or reopen the popup.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions.

### No Domains Shown in Popup
- Verify you are on an active tab with network activity.
- Reload the webpage and watch for badge changes.

### Unexpected Domains in Allowed Section
- Consider if these are essential third parties (CDNs, embedded content).
- Use known domain lists or search the domain online.

## 8. Real-World Example

Imagine visiting a news site:

- The badge shows “5.”
- Opening the popup shows 3 allowed domains (e.g., cdn.news.com, api.ads.com, fonts.provider.com).
- Stealth-blocked domains include tracker.xyz.com.
- Blocked domains include adserver.example.net.

Interpretation:

- The site uses a few allowed third-party services (some possibly ads).
- One stealth tracker was blocked invisibly, demonstrating your privacy protection.
- The number 5 accurately reflects unique third-party servers contacted (allowed + stealth + blocked).

You can decide if you want to tighten blocking or allow some domains.
