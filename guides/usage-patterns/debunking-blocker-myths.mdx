# Debunking Content Blocker Myths with uBO Scope

## Introduction

This guide helps you understand common misconceptions around content blocking tools using uBO Scope's real-world data and analysis. By illustrating typical misunderstandings, such as equating a higher block count with better protection or trusting unreliable "adblock test" websites, you will learn how to make better sense of content blocking realities.

uBO Scope provides transparent visibility into network connections, independent of any content blocker, enabling you to evaluate actual blocking effectiveness and privacy impact.

## Understanding Common Myths

### Myth 1: "A Higher Block Count Means Better Protection"

Many users assume that a content blocker showing more blocked requests is more effective. However, uBO Scope reveals that this is often false.

- **What Happens in Reality:**
  - A higher block count can occur because the browser is trying to load resources from *more* distinct third-party servers.
  - In some cases, extensions that block fewer requests might actually prevent connections to more unique third-party domains.

- **How uBO Scope Clarifies:**
  - The toolbar badge represents the *number of distinct allowed third-party remote domains* per page load.
  - A *lower* badge count means *fewer* third-party connections, indicating better privacy.
  - Simply relying on block count metrics is misleading; what matters is how many unique third-party connections are *allowed*.

#### Example
If Content Blocker A blocks 100 requests but allows connections to 20 unique third-party domains, while Content Blocker B blocks 50 requests but allows connections to only 5 unique domains, Content Blocker B generally offers stronger protection.

### Myth 2: "Adblock Test Websites Are Reliable Benchmarks"

Many so-called "adblock test" sites claim to measure an extension’s blocking capabilities accurately.

- **Reality with uBO Scope:**
  - These test sites generate artificial, contrived network requests that don’t reflect real-world site behavior.
  - Content blockers often use stealth techniques to avoid breaking websites or being detected by web pages.
  - Consequently, these sites cannot see or measure how stealthy content blockers operate.
  - The test results are unreliable and should not be used to judge content blocker effectiveness.

- **Better Approach:**
  - Use tools like uBO Scope that show *actual* connections attempted or blocked on *real* websites.
  - This insight allows you to verify the real blocking behavior without relying on fabricated tests.

## How to Use uBO Scope to Evaluate Content Blocking

Follow these steps to analyze and debunk myths around your content blocker’s effectiveness.

### Step 1: Monitor Real Network Connections

1. Visit a website you want to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon to open the popup.
3. Observe the categorized lists of third-party domains:
   - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which connections were successfully made.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected stealthily by the content blocker.
   - **Blocked:** Domains where requests resulted in errors or explicit blocks.

> The toolbar badge shows the count of *distinct allowed third-party domains*.

### Step 2: Interpret the Badge Count

- A **lower badge count** indicates fewer unique third-party connections, which is typically better for privacy.
- A **higher badge count**, even if accompanied by many blocked requests, often means your browser accessed more third-party domains.

### Step 3: Compare Different Content Blockers

- Switch between content blockers and observe how uBO Scope's popup and badge count change for the same site.
- Beware of block count reported by these blockers' own UIs; a lower badge on uBO Scope is more trustworthy.

### Step 4: Avoid Relying on Adblock Test Sites

- Do not use or trust external "adblock test" sites for assessing content blockers.
- Always prefer direct measurement tools like uBO Scope.

<Tip>
Use uBO Scope on popular websites you frequently visit to get a realistic picture of what connections your content blocker allows or blocks.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: E-Commerce Site Analysis

- Site has a badge count of 8.
- Allowed list includes common CDN providers.
- Stealth-blocked list shows some tracking domains being redirected.
- Blocked list has very few entries.

**Conclusion:** This content blocker effectively prevents most tracking domains and limits connection to essential third-party providers.

### Example 2: News Website

- High badge count of 25.
- Many allowed third-party domains related to advertising and tracking.
- Blocked list shows a comparable number of blocked requests.

**Conclusion:** Despite blocking requests, this content blocker still allows connections to many third-party servers, potentially reducing privacy.

## Best Practices for Using uBO Scope

- **Focus on the Toolbar Badge:** Let uBO Scope’s badge count inform your privacy assessment, not just the block count from other tools.
- **Check Real Site Activity:** Test with real websites rather than synthetic or test pages.
- **Use Stealth Blocking Insight:** Utilize the stealth-blocked category to see silently blocked requests.
- **Repeat Across Browsing Sessions:** View results on multiple pages to get a comprehensive assessment.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### No Badge Count Appearing

- Verify uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Ensure you have granted all necessary browser permissions.
- Reload the webpage to trigger connection logging.

### Unexpectedly High or Low Counts

- Remember that badge count reflects allowed connections, not blocked requests.
- Consider that some content blockers may allow connections to a large number of unique third parties while blocking others.

### Differences Between Browsers

- Some browsers impose restrictions on how webRequest API works, possibly affecting the visibility of network requests.
- Check [System Requirements & Browser Compatibility](../getting-started/installation-basics/system-requirements) for details.
