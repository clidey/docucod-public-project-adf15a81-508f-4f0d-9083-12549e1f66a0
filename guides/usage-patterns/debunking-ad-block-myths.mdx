# Debunking Ad Blocker Myths with uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step guidance on how to use **uBO Scope** to critically evaluate popular claims and metrics about ad blockers. It helps users understand why block counts alone can be misleading and how common "ad blocker test" web pages do not provide reliable assessments of content blockers. By following this guide, you will be empowered to interpret network connection data accurately and make informed judgments about ad blockers.

## What This Guide Helps You Achieve
- Learn why toolbar badge block counts are not reliable indicators of ad blocker effectiveness.
- Understand how to use uBO Scope's connection data to analyze actual network activity.
- Identify pitfalls in popular ad blocker measurements and "test" pages.
- Gain confidence in evaluating content blocking results based on distinct third-party connections.

---

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that:
- You have installed the **uBO Scope** extension in your browser. See [Installing on Your Browser](/getting-started/setup-installation/installing-on-your-browser) for detailed instructions.
- The extension is active and working on the page you want to analyze.
- You are familiar with the basics of accessing the uBO Scope popup interface. Consult [First Steps: Analyzing a Webpage](/guides/getting-started/first-steps) if needed.

## Using uBO Scope to Debunk Myths

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup
1. Navigate to the webpage you want to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
3. The popup panel will display three categories:
   - **Not Blocked** (allowed connections): Domains from which resources were fetched.
   - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections the blocker suppressed quietly.
   - **Blocked**: Connections actively blocked.

### Step 2: Interpret the Toolbar Badge Count
- The badge number on the toolbar icon shows how many distinct third-party remote domains the current tab has connected to and allowed.
- **Lower numbers indicate fewer third-party connections, which is generally better for privacy.**

### Step 3: Understand the Limitations of Block Counts
- Myth: _"Higher block counts mean a better blocker."_
  - Reality: A higher block count can correlate with the blocker allowing more third-party connections overall.
  - Use uBO Scope to see if a blocker with many blocks actually results in fewer allowed connections to third-party domains.
  - Focus on the **number of allowed connections**, not just the number of blocked requests.

### Step 4: Examine the Domains Listed
- Look at the listed domains in the popup under **Not Blocked**, **Stealth-Blocked**, and **Blocked**.
- Identify well-known content delivery networks (CDNs) or necessary third parties which are typically allowed.
- Notice if unfamiliar or suspicious third parties appear under **Not Blocked**, which might indicate leakage.

### Step 5: Be Skeptical of "Ad Blocker Test" Pages
- Many "ad blocker test" sites and pages generate contrived network requests to detect extensions.
- These pages:
  - Cannot detect stealth-blocking methods reliably.
  - Use unrealistic or fabricated scenarios, not representative of real-world browsing.
  - Should not influence your assessment of blocker effectiveness.
- Use uBO Scope on real-world sites to see actual network behavior.

### Outcome
By carefully examining the **actual third-party domains** connected and the distribution across allowed and blocked categories, you can now:
- Avoid overvaluing block counts from toolbar badges.
- Reject unreliable synthetic test results.
- Make privacy decisions based on meaningful network activity data.

## Real-World Example
Imagine checking two browsers with different blockers on the same news site:

- Browser A shows badge "25" and blocks 100 requests.
- Browser B shows badge "12" and blocks 50 requests.

Using uBO Scope:
- You open the popup on both browsers.
- Browser A lists connections allowed to many domains (some unknown).
- Browser B allows fewer distinct third-party domains.

This reveals Browser B is actually more effective despite blocking fewer requests overall.

---

## Best Practices
- Always interpret the badge count as **distinct allowed third-party connections.**
- Use the uBO Scope popup to see detailed connections rather than relying on badge alone.
- Validate blocker performance on real, commonly used websites.
- Ignore results from synthetic "ad blocker test" pages.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting and Tips">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count sometimes change rapidly?">
Network activity varies as sites load resources dynamically. Your badge count updates in real time to reflect distinct third-party domains connected during the current tab session.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why don't some expected connections show up?">
uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API. Some network activity outside its scope (e.g., service workers or browser internals) are not captured.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use uBO Scope to compare different blockers?">
Yes, but ensure you compare by allowed distinct third-party domain counts on real websites rather than block counts or synthetic tests.

## Next Steps

- Explore **[Analyzing Third-Party Connections](/guides/usage-patterns/analyze-third-party-connections)** to dive deeper into connection categories.
- Learn to interpret badge counts in **[Interpreting the Badge Count and Results](/guides/usage-patterns/interpreting-badge-counts)**.
- Consult **[Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/getting-to-first-results/troubleshooting-common-setup-issues)** if you experience problems with the extension.

## Summary
Use uBO Scope to move beyond superficial block counts and understand real browser network activity. By examining the distinct allowed third-party remote servers, you gain truthful insights into ad blocker performance and avoid common misunderstandings perpetuated by misleading popular tests.

## About uBO Scope Popup Interface
The popup interface categorizes domains contacted by the webpage as follows:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which resources were successfully loaded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains blocked in a way that is difficult for webpages to detect.
- **Blocked:** Domains from which resource requests were actively blocked.

This detailed view is essential for understanding what your blocker allows or blocks in real time.

## Practical Tips
- Use the domain lists in the popup to recognize legitimate third parties like CDNs versus potential trackers.
- Remember that stealth-blocking is a sophisticated method that prevents detection by scripts but does not necessarily mean connections were made.
- Refresh webpages and observe changes in the popup to see how content blockers affect network behavior dynamically.
