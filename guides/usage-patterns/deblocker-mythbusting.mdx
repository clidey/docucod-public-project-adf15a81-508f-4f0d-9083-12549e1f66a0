# Debunking Block Count and Ad Block Tests with uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide empowers you to challenge widespread misconceptions about the effectiveness of content blockers by using uBO Scope. It carefully explains why relying on the block count or visiting so-called "ad block test" websites can mislead users and how uBO Scope’s accurate reporting of actual network connections provides clarity and trustworthiness in assessing content blocking performance.

## Why Block Counts and Ad Block Test Pages Misrepresent Reality

### Common Misconception: “More Blocks = Better Protection”
Many users assume that a higher block count on a content blocker’s toolbar icon means better blocking performance. However, this is false because:

- Block counts only indicate how many network requests were blocked, not how many third-party connections were actually prevented.
- A higher block count can result from blocking many requests to distinct third-party servers or many requests to fewer servers, which means fewer servers — not requests — is the true privacy metric.
- It's possible that a blocker with a high block count still allows connections to more unique third-party domains, thus leaking more information.

### Why uBO Scope’s Badge and Popup Reports Matter
The badge count you see in uBO Scope reflects the number of **distinct third-party remote servers your browser successfully connected to**. Lower numbers indicate fewer third-party connections, which directly correlate with better privacy and blocking effectiveness.

<u>Use uBO Scope's connection visibility to see the actual number of third-party servers contacted, not just blocked requests.</u>

### Flaws of Online Ad Blocker Test Websites

- These test pages generate contrived requests that rarely reflect real-world browsing.
- They cannot detect stealth blocking techniques used by modern content blockers (such as uBO Scanner) that silently block without triggering obvious events.
- They often trigger fake patterns that do not map to real ads or tracking scripts.

<u>Relying on ad block test sites leads to inaccurate conclusions about blocker reliability.</u>

## How to Use uBO Scope to Debunk These Myths

Follow these practical steps to explore the truth behind content blocking effectiveness.

### Step 1: Understand uBO Scope’s Purpose
- It measures all network connection attempts from your browser.
- It counts distinct third-party domains contacted, independently of the blocking technique.
- The popup shows connections grouped as allowed (not blocked), stealth-blocked, and blocked.

### Step 2: Observe Block Counts Versus Connection Counts
- Install uBO Scope and navigate to your favorite websites.
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
- Observe the badge showing distinct allowed domains.
- Compare this number to the block count reported by your content blocker’s icon. 
- Notice that a higher block count does not necessarily mean fewer third-party connections.

### Step 3: Explore Stealth Blocking
- The popup includes `stealth-blocked` section to reveal domains silently blocked by the content blocker.
- This gives visibility into otherwise invisible blocking, which ad block test sites cannot detect.

### Step 4: Avoid Ad Block Test Websites
- Instead of visiting artificial test pages, use uBO Scope to analyze real-world browsing activity.
- Use the popup to see actual connections on any page and compare results across multiple sites.

### Step 5: Share and Explain Findings
- Use uBO Scope data to explain to others why simple block counts and test sites do not give accurate protection measures.
- Filter list maintainers and privacy-conscious users can benefit from these insights to improve filter rules and browsing choices.

## Practical Examples

### Example: Comparing Two Content Blockers
Suppose you have two content blockers, A and B, installed separately:

| Content Blocker | Toolbar Badge Block Count | uBO Scope Allowed Connections | Privacy Reality |
|-----------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| A               | 800                       | 30                           | **Better privacy**: fewer distinct third-party origins
| B               | 1200                      | 50                           | Worse privacy: more third-party connections despite more blocks

<u>This demonstrates no direct correlation between block count and privacy gain.</u>

### Example: Viewing Stealth Blocking
1. Browse a website with uBO Scope active.
2. Open the popup from the toolbar icon.
3. See the `stealth-blocked` section listing domains silently blocked by your content blocker.

This reveals blocking invisible to traditional tests.

## Best Practices

- Always trust the number of distinct third-party servers contacted rather than block count alone.
- Use uBO Scope during your daily browsing to understand your true exposure and blocker effectiveness.
- Do not rely on popular "ad block test" websites as benchmarks.

## Troubleshooting and Tips

### Issue: Popup Shows No Data or Inaccurate Counts
- Ensure the browser permissions (`webRequest`, `storage`) are properly granted.
- Verify your browser supports uBO Scope's `webRequest` API monitoring (see [Prerequisites & System Requirements](https://yourdocs/getting-started/onboarding/prereqs-system-requirements)).
- Reload the page and open the popup again.

### Tip: Use uBO Scope in Conjunction with Your Content Blocker
- Combine insights from your blocker’s UI with uBO Scope’s popup for a comprehensive view.

### Tip: For Filter List Maintainers
- Use uBO Scope to test how well your filters perform on real usage scenarios, especially on devices or environments with limited debugging tools.
