# Tips for Filter List Maintainers

uBO Scope empowers filter list maintainers by offering transparency into network requests made by webpages, revealing which third-party domains are contacted and whether requests are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked. This page offers practical guidance for maintainers on leveraging uBO Scope effectively, especially in scenarios where browser developer tools or standard debugging environments are limited or unavailable.

## 1. Why uBO Scope is Valuable for Filter List Maintainers

Filter list maintainers need precise, real-world insights into how filters affect network requests. uBO Scope provides this by independently reporting *every* attempted remote server connection regardless of active content blockers. This granular visibility helps maintainers:

- Validate filter effectiveness beyond just block counts.
- Identify unexpected connections or stealth-blocked requests.
- Understand domain-level connection counts and patterns.

Unlike typical browser developer tools, uBO Scope does not require extensive setup, and its persistent badge and popup interface provide immediate feedback.

## 2. Using uBO Scope When Browser Tool Access is Limited

### Common Scenario

On devices such as mobile platforms or secure environments where developer consoles or full browser debugging tools are unavailable, filter list maintainers can still rely on uBO Scope to monitor network interactions efficiently.

### How to Make the Most of This Situation

- **Monitor the Toolbar Badge:** The badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected. Maintaining a low badge count generally corresponds to effective filtering.
- **Use the Popup Interface:** The popup breaks down connection outcomes into three categories:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains for which connections succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains blocked quietly (often by content blockers that hide their actions).
  - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked.

This classification lets maintainers quickly pinpoint domains that may need attention.

- **Manual Inspection:** Export or manually record observations from the popup when needed for offline analysis.

## 3. Short-Term Strategies for Better Filter List Maintenance

Here are practical steps to optimize your workflow with uBO Scope:

### Step 1: Regularly Load Target Sites

- Open the extension popup after visiting pages to get a snapshot of network connections.
- Refresh pages to compare differences when modifying filters.

### Step 2: Interpret Connection Outcomes

- Focus on domains listed in **Not Blocked** when you expect them to be blocked.
- Investigate **Stealth-Blocked** entries to understand indirect or fallback connections.
- Confirm that unwanted domains are consistently showing under **Blocked**.

### Step 3: Track Domain Counts via Toolbar Badge

- Use the badge as a quick metric of overall filter performance.
- Lower numbers generally mean fewer third-party connections and better privacy.

### Step 4: Identify Patterns and False Negatives

- Spot domains that repeatedly appear allowed despite filter rules.
- Use this insight to refine filters or identify new domains to add.

## 4. Upcoming Features to Support Advanced Request-Level Insights

The current uBO Scope version serves as a foundational tool, with planned enhancements focused on empowering advanced users, including filter list maintainers. Future updates aim to provide:

- **Detailed Request-Level Data:** Access to individual request information for deeper analysis.
- **Filtering Contexts:** Clarity on how filters interact with various request types.
- **Exportable Reports:** For sharing and documenting findings with filter list communities.

Stay informed about these enhancements by following the official repository and release notes.

## 5. Best Practices and Tips

- **Use uBO Scope in Tandem with Your Filter Testing:** Combine it with uBlock Origin or similar blockers to get a real-world view of filtering outcomes.
- **Compare Across Browsers:** Verify if filter behavior is consistent on Chromium, Firefox, and Safari using uBO Scope.
- **Check Frequently:** Monitor changes with each filter update to catch regressions early.
- **Understand Domain Groupings:** uBO Scope uses a public suffix list to group hostnames into domains, helping identify the main parties involved.

<Info>
Remember, a higher block count does not necessarily mean better protection—focus on the number of allowed third-party remote servers as your privacy metric.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Tips for Filter List Maintainers">
<Accordion title="The Toolbar Badge Shows No Count or Zero">
- Verify uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Confirm site activity generates remote connections (some pages may be static).
- Confirm browser version compatibility (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or Stale Data">
- Reload the active tab and then open the popup.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions that might block webRequest API events.
- If data consistently fails to load, consider restarting the browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Allowed Domains Despite Filters">
- Some connections may be stealth-blocked or allowed via fallback mechanisms.
- Review your filter rules for exceptions or domain wildcards.
- Use upcoming features (when released) providing request-level details to isolate cases.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example: Using the Popup to Identify Unexpected Allowed Domains

1. Visit your test webpage.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
3. Review the "not blocked" section to see which third-party domains loaded successfully.
4. If suspicious or unintended domains appear, note them.
5. Adjust your filter list to target those domains.
6. Reload the page and verify the blocked or stealth-blocked sections now include those domains.

<Tip>
This iterative approach helps maintainers tighten filters reliably using real connection data.
