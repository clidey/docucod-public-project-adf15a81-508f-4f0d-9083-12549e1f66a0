# Analyzing Third-Party Connections

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide shows you how to use uBO Scope to identify all third-party remote servers a webpage connects to, understand whether these connections are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked, and evaluate which third parties are legitimate or potentially unwanted.

### Prerequisites
- You have successfully installed and enabled the uBO Scope extension on your supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- You have visited a webpage where you want to analyze third-party connections.
- Familiarity with the uBO Scope popup interface basics. If new, see the [First Steps: Analyzing a Webpage](../getting-started/first-steps) guide.

### Expected Outcome
- You will be able to open the uBO Scope popup to view a categorized list of all third-party domains contacted by the current webpage.
- You will understand the difference between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.
- You will have practical tips to evaluate which connections are necessary and which may be privacy or security concerns.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 5-10 minutes to analyze and get familiar with the interface and connection types.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to intermediate.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope Popup on the Active Tab
1. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup will load connection data for the currently active tab.
3. Observe the header, which displays the main hostname and the domain of the page you are analyzing.

#### Expected Result
You see the top of the popup indicating the tab's hostname and domain.

---

### Step 2: Review the Total Number of Connected Domains
- Look under the “domains connected” summary near the top.
- This number represents the count of distinct third-party domains contacted by the page.

#### Expected Result
A numeric count of unique third-party domains connected during the current tab session.

---

### Step 3: Examine Connection Categories
The popup divides connections into three outcome categories:

- **Allowed (not blocked)**: Domains from which network requests successfully loaded resources without being blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains that were blocked in a way that tries to remain invisible to the webpage (e.g., through redirects or internal rules).
- **Blocked**: Domains for which network requests failed or were explicitly blocked by the content blocker.

Each category lists domains along with a count of connection attempts.

---

### Step 4: Inspect Domains in Each Category
- Expand the lists in each section to see individual third-party domains.
- Counts indicate how many requests were made to each domain.
- Use these details to infer which third parties your page relies on and which are blocked to protect your privacy.

#### Example
If you see `cdn.example.com` listed under **Allowed**, this likely represents a Content Delivery Network supporting the webpage.

---

### Step 5: Interpret the Badge Count in the Toolbar
- The toolbar icon’s badge number correlates with the count of distinct allowed third-party domains.
- A lower badge count typically means fewer third-party connections; higher counts might indicate more external tracking or resource fetching.

Use this number as a quick indicator of third-party exposure per tab.

---

### Step 6: Evaluate Third-Party Legitimacy
- Consider whether listed third-party domains align with the webpage’s expected content (e.g., known CDNs like Cloudflare, AWS, or Google).
- Unknown or suspicious domains might indicate tracking, advertising, or malicious activity.
- Use domain knowledge or perform domain lookups if necessary.

---

### Verification Steps
- Confirm the popup updates when you reload the page or switch tabs.
- Verify the badge count changes accordingly.
- If the data is missing or inconsistent, consult troubleshooting guides.

## Examples & Scenarios

### Scenario: Analyzing a News Website
- Open a news article.
- Launch uBO Scope popup.
- Observe allowed connections to known CDNs (e.g., `cloudfront.net`), analytics domains (e.g., `google-analytics.com`), and social media widgets.
- Review any blocked or stealth-blocked domains, which may include ad servers.
- Decide if interventions (like custom filters) are needed.

### Visualization

| Category       | Example Domains                   | Notes                               |
|----------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Allowed        | `cdn.google.com`, `fonts.gstatic.com` | Usually safe and necessary for content |
| Stealth-Blocked| `tracking.adserver.com`, `redirection.proxy` | Hidden blocking to prevent detection |
| Blocked        | `ads.badads.net`, `malicious.track`       | Explicitly blocked due to privacy/security |

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Popup shows NO DATA**: Ensure the tab is fully loaded and that the extension has permission.
- **Badge count stays empty or inaccurate**: Check if browser supports `webRequest` API fully; some browsers or versions may limit reporting.
- **No domains appearing under allowed or blocked**: Content blocker or browser may be interfering; try disabling other conflicting extensions.

### Best Practices
- Regularly refresh the popup when analyzing dynamically loading sites.
- Use the domain counts to prioritize which third parties to investigate further.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with other tools (e.g., network developer tools) for thorough audits.

### Performance Considerations
- The extension batches updates to avoid browser performance impact; counts may update shortly after network activity.

### Alternative Approaches
- Use uBO Scope together with filter list maintainers’ techniques for precise blocking.

## Appendix: Understanding Domains via the Public Suffix List

uBO Scope uses the extensive Public Suffix List (PSL) to extract the 'registrable domain' part of hostnames. This helps aggregate requests by top-level domains (e.g., grouping subdomains under `example.com`).

This PSL is sourced directly from [publicsuffix.org](https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat), a comprehensive list maintained by the Mozilla Foundation, including all known top-level domains (TLDs), country-code TLDs (ccTLDs), and many branded or specialized suffixes.

By recognizing the PSL, uBO Scope more accurately categorizes third-party connections, avoiding misleading fragmentation by subdomains or uncommon domain suffixes.

<AccordionGroup title="Quick Tips & Common Pitfalls">
<Accordion title="Why is the badge count important?">
The badge count reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains your browser connected to for the active tab, not just raw request counts. This provides a clear perspective on third-party exposure.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can a high badge count mean better blocking?">
No. A high badge count means more third-party domains were contacted successfully. This often indicates weaker blocking, not stronger. uBO Scope helps clarify this misconception.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if a domain appears under stealth-blocked?">
Stealth-blocking means requests were blocked without alerts to the webpage to minimize detection. These generally indicate successful blocking of trackers or ads.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How to handle unknown third-party domains?">
Use online domain lookup tools to research unfamiliar domains. Consider blocking if they seem suspicious or unnecessary, but beware of overblocking legitimate services.
