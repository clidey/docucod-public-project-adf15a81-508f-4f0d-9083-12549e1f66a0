# Debunking 'Ad Blocker Test' Pages with uBO Scope

## Overview

This guide helps you critically evaluate so-called 'ad blocker test' webpages using uBO Scope. It explains why these test pages are unreliable, how they can mislead privacy-conscious users and developers, and how uBO Scope empowers you to gain accurate, real-world visibility of third-party network connections.

By following this guide, you will learn to move beyond misleading block counters and fabricated test scenarios to obtain a truthful picture of your browser's exposure.

---

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and active in your browser (see [Installing uBO Scope]( /getting-started/installing-ubo-scope/installation-guides )).
- Basic familiarity with the uBO Scope popup interface and toolbar badge (see [Interpreting Network Insights]( /getting-started/first-run-setup/understanding-the-popup )).
- Access to a browser that supports uBO Scope (Chromium v122+, Firefox v128+, Safari 18.5+).

## Expected Outcome

- Understand the fundamental flaws of traditional ad blocker test pages.
- Use uBO Scope to verify real network connections made when browsing.
- Debunk misleading claims from test pages by analyzing actual third-party remote servers contacted.

## Time Estimate

Approximately 10-15 minutes.

## Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate

## Why 'Ad Blocker Test' Pages are Misleading

Almost all so-called 'ad blocker test' pages are unable to reliably evaluate content blocker effectiveness for these key reasons:

- **Stealth Blocking Not Detected:** Many modern content blockers use stealth techniques to hide their effects from webpages, avoiding breakage and detection. Test pages relying on direct script detection cannot see stealth-blocked requests.

- **Unrealistic Network Requests:** These pages often trigger network calls to invented or non-standard remote servers that real websites never use, creating false positives or skewed results.

- **Block Count Misinterpretation:** Comparing block counts alone from test pages or blocker badges is a faulty method. A blocker with higher block count can paradoxically let in more distinct third-party connections.

<u>In short, these test pages create a false sense of security or superiority based on artificial metrics.</u>

## How uBO Scope Provides More Accurate Insight

uBO Scope is designed to reveal all network connection attempts made by your browser, regardless of whether they are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked outright by content blockers or other system components.

- It reports the **number of distinct third-party remote servers connected per tab**, giving you a direct measure of your browser's exposure.
- It works transparently alongside any content blocker without interfering.
- It captures outcomes even when the blocker is stealthy.

This impartial and comprehensive reporting enables you to **bypass deceptive test pages and see actual network conditions.**

## Using uBO Scope to Evaluate Ad Blocker Test Pages

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup on the Test Page">
- Navigate to the 'ad blocker test' website you want to evaluate.
- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar to open the popup.
- The popup displays a summary of:
  - Domains connected (not blocked)
  - Domains stealth-blocked
  - Domains blocked outright

Expected Result: The popup lists real third-party domains your browser contacted or blocked on this test page.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret the Popup Data">
- Focus on the "not blocked" domains. Each domain listed represents a distinct third-party remote server your browser contacted.
- Review the "stealth-blocked" and "blocked" sections to understand what connections were prevented.
- Remember: A **lower number in the "not blocked" section is better**, indicating fewer third-party connections allowed.

Expected Result: You see a realistic profile of network connections rather than any artificial test counters.
</Step>

<Step title="Compare with Your Expectations or Other Blockers">
- If the test page reports many blocks but uBO Scope shows many allowed third-party connections, it means the test page's report is misleading.
- Use uBO Scope to view connections on real-world sites you trust to compare.

Decision Point: If the counts confuse you, remember **actual privacy is about how many distinct third-party servers you connect to, not the number of blocks counted**.
</Step>

<Step title="Use Insights to Avoid Misleading Claims">
- Never rely solely on 'ad blocker test' pages or block count badges to judge content blocker effectiveness.
- Use uBO Scope's comprehensive and transparent network visibility to form informed opinions.

Verification: The data in uBO Scope should reflect your browser's real network activity, exposing misleading test pages.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Example

Suppose you visit a common 'ad blocker test' page that claims your blocker is "only blocking 3 ads" out of 10.

- Opening uBO Scope shows 8 distinct third-party domains connected (under "not blocked"), with 2 in stealth-blocked, and 1 blocked outright.
- This reveals that despite a small block count on the test page, your browser still connects to many third-party servers, undermining the test page's claim.

This real-world data helps you understand that block counts on test pages do not equate to better privacy.

---

## Tips and Best Practices

- Regularly check real websites with uBO Scope to observe actual network connections.
- Avoid basing blocker choice solely on block counts or scores from 'ad blocker test' pages.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to verify its impact on distinct third-party domains.
- Be cautious of sites triggering suspicious or fabricated network access; uBO Scope helps detect these.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Expect that stealth-blocked connections will not appear in the allowed list but are still potentially detectable by some web pages.
- Do not confuse domain counts with pure request counts; uBO Scope counts distinct domains to better reflect privacy impact.
- Older or less updated browsers might have limitations with the webRequest API, impacting data accuracy.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Questions">
<Accordion title="I see connections listed but the test page says blockers are perfect. What's going on?">
Many 'ad blocker test' pages rely on simple script detection that cannot see stealth-blocked requests. uBO Scope reports actual network requests observed by the browser, revealing real exposure that test pages hide.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The popup doesn't update when I reload the test page.">
Ensure you close and reopen the uBO Scope popup or reload it after navigation. In some browsers, the popup refreshes only when reopened. Also verify uBO Scope is installed and active.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I use other content blockers. Will uBO Scope still show accurate data?">
Yes. uBO Scope works alongside any content blocker, including DNS-level and stealth blocking, as long as your browser reports network requests through webRequest API.
</Accordion>
