# Filter List Maintainers: Using uBO Scope for Real-World Analysis

---

## Introduction

As a filter list maintainer tasked with ensuring the highest quality and precision of privacy and ad-blocking rules, gaining real-world insights into network request patterns is essential. uBO Scope is an invaluable tool designed to help you observe, analyze, and refine complex third-party network connections in live web environments, especially when working on resource-restricted devices or mobile platforms.

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to harness uBO Scope’s capabilities for filter list maintenance, enabling you to collect actionable data and improve your filtering strategies based on actual browser network behavior.

---

## Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
- Collect and analyze per-tab network connection data, categorized by allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains.
- Assess network request patterns in real-world browsing sessions.
- Identify false positives or missed block opportunities in your filter lists.
- Refine privacy filter rules with concrete evidence obtained from uBO Scope.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and working in your target browser (see [Installing the Extension](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/installing-extension) guide).
- Basic familiarity with browser extensions, domain structures, and privacy filter terminology.
- Access to typical websites you want to analyze.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Observe remote server connection outcomes directly per browser tab.
- Distinguish between domains that are allowed, stealth-blocked (requests intercepted without visible failure), or fully blocked.
- Export or note precise domain counts and frequencies to support filter adjustments.
- Optimize and test new or existing filter rules in situ.

### Time Commitment
15-30 minutes for initial familiarization and data gathering; ongoing use can be incorporated into daily filter maintenance workflows.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate — assumes knowledge of browser networking and content blocking principles.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Start Monitoring Your Target Tabs

- Open the browser where uBO Scope is installed.
- Navigate to the website or web application under review.
- Click the uBO Scope extension icon to open the popup interface.

**What You Should See:**
- The toolbar icon badge will display a number representing distinct third-party domains successfully connected.
- The popup will list domains under three categories: *not blocked*, *stealth-blocked*, and *blocked*.

### 2. Understand Connection Categories

- **Not Blocked:** Domains for which connections succeeded without interference.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains for which requests were redirected or silently blocked (stealth blocking).
- **Blocked:** Domains for which connections failed (e.g., DNS failure or firewall block).

### 3. Analyze Domain Counts and Frequencies

In the popup:
- Review the count next to each domain to understand how many requests occurred.
- Pay attention to domains with unexpectedly high counts, which may suggest excessive or unwanted connections.
- Look for blocked or stealth-blocked domains that might be missed due to current filters or require adjustment.

### 4. Check Domain Hierarchies Using Registrable Domains

- uBO Scope aggregates hostnames into their registrable domains to help identify root organizations behind connections (leveraging the Public Suffix List).
- Use this to correlate whether multiple hostnames belong to a single corporate entity or third party.

### 5. Refine Your Filters Based on Observations

- Incorporate observed domains into your filter list rules when you detect unwanted connections.
- Test changes by refreshing the page and observing updates in uBO Scope.
- Track stealth-blocked requests to identify subtle abuses or leakage.

### 6. Manage and Preserve Your Session Data

- Although uBO Scope automatically persists session data, maintain notes or external records of important observations.
- Restart sessions as needed to test different browsing scenarios or filter impacts.

### 7. Perform Troubleshooting if Data Appears Missing

- Confirm the extension is enabled and has appropriate permissions (storage and webRequest).
- Reload the webpage and check if the popup updates accordingly.
- See [First Troubleshooting Steps](/getting-started/first-use-and-validation/first-troubleshooting-steps) if data remains absent.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Use Consistent Testing Sites:** Ensure you compare data across sites with typical traffic to capture relevant third-party domains.
- **Watch Out for Legitimate Third Parties:** Some domains like CDNs or analytics services may be necessary; distinguish them from trackers.
- **Monitor Badge Counts:** Frequent changes in badge count signal dynamic third-party interactions; cross-check with popup for clarity.
- **Leverage Registrable Domains:** Filter at domain-level when multiple subdomains belong to the same parent, reducing filter complexity.
- **Validate Filter Impact Rapidly:** Use uBO Scope to verify changes in real time, ensuring your lists neither over-block nor allow unwanted connections.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| No Data in Popup | Extension permissions missing or browser API restrictions | Verify extension permissions and browser version; reload extension and page |
| Unexpected Domains Listed | Browsing cleared session or private modes interfering | Reconfirm site access, perform tests in normal browsing session |
| High Allowed Count Despite Blocking | Stealth blocking or DNS-based blocking may not reflect in some cases | Understand difference between stealth and true blocking; use domain details to adjust filters |
| Confusion Over Subdomains vs. Domains | Misinterpretation of domain groupings | Use the registrable domain column and Public Suffix List knowledge for clarity |


---

## Advanced Use Cases

- **Using on Resource-Constrained Devices or Browsers:** uBO Scope's design avoids heavy UI or background processing, making it ideal for mobile or low-end devices where browser developer tools are inaccessible.
- **Cross-Browser Filter Testing:** Utilize uBO Scope to compare connection behaviors across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari to spot browser-specific edge cases.
- **Filter List Quality Metrics:** Aggregate allowed and blocked domain counts over time to measure filter list effectiveness quantitatively.

## Illustrative Example

Imagine you are maintaining a filter list aimed at blocking tracking domains on popular news websites. By opening uBO Scope on a news site tab:

1. You observe the badge counts show `8` connections.
2. The popup lists several known advertisers under "not blocked".
3. The "stealth-blocked" section shows domains detected but not overtly blocked.
4. You recognize some stealth-blocked domains are persistent trackers missed by your current rules.

Taking this insight, you can update your filter list to include these stealth domains explicitly. After applying and reloading the page, uBO Scope reflects a reduced allowed count, effectively improving the filter precision.
