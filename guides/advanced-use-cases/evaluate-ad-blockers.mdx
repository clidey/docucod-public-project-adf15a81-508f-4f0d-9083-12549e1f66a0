# Evaluating Ad Blockers with uBO Scope

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide walks you through using uBO Scope to objectively evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different ad blockers. By setting up controlled tests, observing real network connection data, and debunking misconceptions about blocking metrics, you'll gain a transparent view of how ad blockers truly perform in blocking unwanted third-party connections.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and active in your browser ([Installation Guide](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope#getting-started-installing-extension)).
- At least two different ad blockers installed for comparison (e.g., uBlock Origin, AdGuard).
- Familiarity with opening the uBO Scope popup (see [Understanding the Popup Interface](../getting-started/first-use-and-validation/understanding-the-popup)).
- Basic understanding of third-party connections and network request outcomes ([Core Concepts and Terminology](../overview/getting-started-concepts/core-concepts-terminology)).

### Expected Outcome
You will be able to:
- Run side-by-side tests of ad blockers under identical browsing conditions.
- Interpret the badge count and popup data to analyze which ad blocker allows fewer distinct third-party connections.
- Understand common misconceptions around block counts and test pages.
- Make informed decisions about ad blocker effectiveness based on actual network traffic.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15-30 minutes depending on the number of ad blockers tested and the complexity of your tests.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Browser Environment

- Ensure that uBO Scope is installed and its badge is visible on your browser toolbar.
- Install the ad blockers you want to test. Disable all others to avoid interference.
- Restart your browser to initialize all extensions properly.

### 2. Establish a Controlled Testing Scenario

- Choose a consistent website or set of websites to test. Preferably sites known to load multiple third-party resources.
- Clear your browser cache and cookies before each test to ensure consistency.
- Disable all content blockers except the single ad blocker you want to test in that session.

### 3. Run the Test with the First Ad Blocker

- Open the test website in a new tab.
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
- Observe the badge count: this number reflects the unique third-party domains from which resources were loaded.
- Review the popup interface, focusing on the 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' sections:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains allowed by the ad blocker.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections redirected or stealthily blocked (often invisible to the site).
  - **Blocked:** Connections outright blocked.
- Take note or screenshot the counts for all three categories.

### 4. Repeat Testing with Other Ad Blockers

- Disable the first ad blocker and enable the next one.
- Clear cache and reload the same test website.
- Open the uBO Scope popup and record the data again.

### 5. Compare Results and Interpret Data

- Compare the badge counts from each ad blocker; a lower badge count means fewer distinct third-party domains were connected to, indicating stronger blocking.
- Examine how many domains are listed under 'not blocked' vs. 'blocked' to understand which domains were still allowed.
- Pay attention to the 'stealth-blocked' category as this indicates subtle blocking methods ad blockers may employ.

<Tip>
A higher block count on other ad blockers does not necessarily mean they are better. Some blockers may block less but still allow connections from fewer unique domains, resulting in better privacy.
</Tip>

### 6. Debunk Common Myths

- **Myth:** "Higher block count means better blocking."
  - Reality: uBO Scope reveals the number of unique third-party endpoints connected to, not just blocks. The badge count reflects allowed connections, which is what really matters.
- **Myth:** "Ad blocker test sites are reliable benchmarks."
  - Reality: Many test sites use fabricated or unrealistic requests and cannot detect stealth blocking, making their results unreliable.

### 7. Document and Share Findings

- Keep a log of the test results with clear notes on browser version, ad blocker versions, and website URLs.
- Use uBO Scope data to inform personal decisions or share reports within privacy and filter list communities.

## Real-World Example

Imagine you want to compare uBlock Origin and AdGuard on a popular news website.

- With uBlock Origin enabled:
  - Badge count shows 12.
  - Popup shows 8 domains 'not blocked', 2 'stealth-blocked', 4 'blocked'.

- With AdGuard enabled:
  - Badge count shows 15.
  - Popup shows 10 domains 'not blocked', 1 'stealth-blocked', 6 'blocked'.

Despite AdGuard blocking more connections (6 versus 4), it lets through more unique third-party domains (badge count 15 vs 12), indicating potentially worse privacy protection.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">  
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Shows No Data After Installing an Ad Blocker">  
Make sure uBO Scope has necessary permissions and is enabled. Clear browser cache and reload the test page. Also ensure the ad blocker does not interfere with uBO Scope's webRequest API monitoring.  
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update After Switching Ad Blockers">  
Reload the test tab after enabling/disabling ad blockers. Restart the browser if the issue persists.  
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Inconsistent Domain Counts Between Tests">  
Clear browser cache and cookies between tests. Use private/incognito mode to isolate sessions. Choose websites with consistent content.  
</Accordion>  
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Run tests on multiple websites and at different times to capture a comprehensive profile, since third-party connections can vary due to caching, network conditions, and content updates.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

- Always test one ad blocker at a time to isolate effects.
- Use sites with real-world, varied third-party content rather than synthetic test pages.
- Interpret badge counts as a measure of privacy exposure — fewer unique third-party connections mean better privacy.
- Combine uBO Scope findings with other privacy tools and manual inspection for well-rounded analysis.

## Additional Notes

- uBO Scope counts distinct third-party domains connected to after the blocker’s filtering effect.
- The badge count on the extension toolbar represents the number of unique third-party remote servers contacted successfully.
- "Stealth-blocked" domains are those connections blocked in ways not visible to the website, often by redirects or hidden filtering.
- Block counts shown by other content blockers or test sites can be misleading; focus on third-party connection exposure measured by uBO Scope.
