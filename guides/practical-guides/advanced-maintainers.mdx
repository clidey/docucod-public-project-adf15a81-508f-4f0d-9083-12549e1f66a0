# uBO Scope for Filter List Maintainers

Practical techniques for filter list maintainers and advanced users: using uBO Scope data to review network requests, improve filter accuracy—even on locked-down devices—and prepare for deeper analysis as features evolve.

---

## 1. Understanding the Role of uBO Scope in Filter Maintenance

As a filter list maintainer, your core challenge is accurately identifying third-party domains involved in network requests that should be allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked. uBO Scope provides reliable, per-tab network connection data as reported through the browser's `webRequest` API, independent of your content blocker’s internal logic.

This guide helps you leverage uBO Scope to:
- Review network traffic outcomes on live webpages
- Distinguish domains by request outcome (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked)
- Improve and validate filter rules using empirical data
- Work effectively even on devices where traditional browser dev tools are restricted


---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure:
- You have uBO Scope installed and activated in your browser. Follow installation instructions in the [Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope](guides/getting-started/install-extension) guide.
- You understand basic network request concepts and the classification terms used by uBO Scope: *allowed*, *blocked*, and *stealth-blocked* connections. See [Key Concepts and Terminology](overview/core-concepts-architecture/key-terms-concepts).
- Your browser supports uBO Scope operation as detailed in [Browser Integration & Compatibility](overview/core-concepts-architecture/integration-browser).

## 3. How uBO Scope Reports Connection Outcomes

uBO Scope tracks every network request initiated by webpages and categorizes them based on their fate:

| Outcome          | Description                                                                                       |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Allowed          | Requests that were successfully made and responded to.                                         |
| Stealth-Blocked  | Requests that were redirected or modified to block content silently (without standard errors). |
| Blocked          | Requests that failed due to blocking actions, resulting in error status.                        |

Each connection is counted at the domain level using the Public Suffix List, enabling more accurate grouping of related hostnames.

## 4. Reviewing Network Requests Using the uBO Scope Popup

The popup interface of uBO Scope visualizes the connection outcomes for the currently active tab.

### Steps to Review:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope extension icon on your browser toolbar to open the popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the Current Tab's Domain">
At the top, observe the domain and hostname labels providing context for the page whose requests are being shown.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine the Domains Sections">
The popup lists three sections:
- **Not Blocked**: Domains with successful (allowed) connections.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains with redirected or stealthily blocked requests.
- **Blocked**: Domains where requests explicitly failed due to blocking.

Each domain shows the count of connections recorded.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Domain Counts for Insights">
Look for unusual domains that shouldn't be allowed or confirm legitimate third-party services remain accessible.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Tips:
- Domains with unexpectedly high counts may be critical third-party services or hidden trackers.
- The badge on the extension icon summarizes the number of allowed unique domains; use this as a quick privacy metric.

## 5. Improving Filter Accuracy With uBO Scope Data

Filter list maintenance demands precision. uBO Scope helps you identify domains that your filters may be missing or incorrectly handling.

### Workflow:

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate To a Test Webpage">
Open a webpage where you suspect filtering accuracy can improve.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze uBO Scope Data">
Use the popup to examine the allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify Gaps or Errors">
Look for:
- Allowed domains that should be blocked
- Blocked domains that are false positives
- Stealth-blocked domains indicating subtle blocking
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust Filter Rules Accordingly">
Update your filter list to correct false positives or negatives based on observations.
</Step>
<Step title="Validate Changes">
Reload the page and re-check the popup data to verify improvements.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Practical Example:
Suppose you notice a third-party domain appearing in 'Allowed' that you expect to block. Add or adjust a filter rule targeting that domain. Conversely, if a legitimate CDN is in the 'Blocked' list causing page issues, whitelist it.

## 6. Using uBO Scope on Locked-Down or Restricted Devices

On devices where browser developer tools are limited or inaccessible, uBO Scope offers a straightforward glance into network requests:

- The extension's popup requires no special permissions besides those granted at install.
- Implements its own domain classification independent of other blockers.
- Updates continuously while browsing, capturing real-world network behaviors.

This makes uBO Scope invaluable for:

- Remote debugging filter list performance
- Auditing third-party connections in restricted environments
- Quickly identifying stealth-blocked domains that may affect user experience


---

## 7. Preparing for Future uBO Scope Enhancements

This version of uBO Scope is a solid base designed for immediate practical use. It will evolve with additional features:

- More detailed network request metadata
- Filtering and searching capabilities within the popup
- Historical session data for trend analysis

As a filter maintainer, staying familiar with how uBO Scope organizes and presents data will position you to incorporate new capabilities with ease.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting & Best Practices">
<Accordion title="No Data in Popup or Badge Count Remains Zero">
Check that uBO Scope is active and has the required permissions. Refer to the [Activating and Configuring uBO Scope](getting-started/setup-installation/extension-activation-configuration) guide to confirm setup.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Counts Seem Incorrect or Missing">
Refresh the tab to trigger network activity. Verify that you are viewing data for the correct active tab. Remember that connections are tab-specific.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Domains in Allowed or Blocked Lists">
Validate your current filter rules for overrides. Consider manually reviewing rules affecting the domain and whether stealth-blocking is in effect.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 9. Additional Tips for Effective Use

- Regularly clear or reload your browser tabs and uBO Scope to avoid stale session data.
- Use the domain counts as indicators but always verify with actual user experience.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with your filter list testing frameworks for robust filtering.

## 10. Next Steps

- Explore the [First Look: The uBO Scope Popup Explained](guides/getting-started/first-look) guide to deepen your understanding of the popup interface.
- Read [Debunking Block Count Myths with uBO Scope](guides/practical-guides/debunking-block-myths) to grasp how to interpret badge counts properly.
- Refer to [Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope](guides/getting-started/install-extension) to ensure your setup is optimal.

## Appendix: Example Scenario

Suppose you maintain a filter list aimed to block trackers but also want to ensure key CDNs (content delivery networks) remain accessible. Using uBO Scope, you open a popular media site and observe:

- 15 domains in the Allowed list
- 5 domains in the Stealth-Blocked list
- 3 domains in the Blocked list

You notice a domain with many requests in Allowed that you didn't intend to whitelist. By adding a precise blocking rule for that domain and reloading, you verify the domain moves to either Stealth-Blocked or Blocked while page functionality remains intact. This iterative process improves your list accuracy.
