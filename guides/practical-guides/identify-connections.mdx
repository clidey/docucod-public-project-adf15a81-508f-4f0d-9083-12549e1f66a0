# Identifying All Third-Party Connections On Any Site

## Overview
This guide walks you through using uBO Scope to uncover every remote server your browser interacts with when visiting a webpage. These connections include those that are allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked by content blockers or other privacy mechanisms. Understanding these connections is essential for evaluating your browsing privacy and the behavior of sites you visit.

By following this step-by-step workflow, you will learn how to reveal detailed network activity on a per-tab basis and accurately interpret the results provided by uBO Scope.

---

## Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed on a supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- Extension activated with all required permissions granted (see Installation and Activation guides).
- Basic understanding of browser tabs and accessing extension icons.

---

## What You Will Achieve
- A complete list of all third-party remote servers contacted by the active tab.
- Insight into the connection status: whether each network request was allowed, stealth-blocked (silently blocked), or fully blocked.
- Ability to use this information to assess the third-party connections impacting your browsing privacy.

---

## Estimated Time
5–10 minutes, depending on familiarity with browser extensions.

# Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Open the Webpage to Analyze
Visit the webpage you want to analyze in your browser.

**Expected result:** The page loads normally, and any background network activity begins.

### Step 2: Open the uBO Scope Popup
Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser’s toolbar to open the popup interface.

**Expected result:** The popup displays information for the active tab, starting with the hostname and domain of the loaded webpage.

### Step 3: Review the Domains Connected Summary
At the top of the popup, observe the summary showing the number of distinct domains contacted by the page.

- This number reflects unique third-party domains contacted.
- A lower number usually means fewer external connections, indicating better privacy.

### Step 4: Explore the Categorized Domain Lists
The popup divides connected domains into three categories:

- **Not Blocked (allowed):** Domains where network requests succeeded and were not blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where content blockers silently prevented some requests from completing, usually to avoid page breakage or detection.
- **Blocked:** Domains where network requests were fully prevented due to blocking by content blockers or other privacy measures.


Each category lists domains alongside the count of requests made.

**Expected result:** You see a detailed breakdown of all third-party connections attempted or made by the webpage.

### Step 5: Interpret Domain Names and Counts
uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List to normalize hostnames into registrable domain names:

- Domain names shown represent the effective domain for third-party connections.
- Counts indicate how many requests occurred for each domain.

Interpreting these helps you differentiate between high-frequency legitimate services (like CDNs) and potentially privacy-invading trackers.

### Step 6: Use Toolbar Badge as Active Indicator
Observe the badge count on the uBO Scope toolbar icon:

- The badge shows the number of distinct allowed third-party domains currently connected by the active tab.
- Use this as a quick privacy health indicator for any webpage.

### Step 7: Cross-Reference With Privacy Tools and Browsing Behavior
Leverage uBO Scope data to audit sites:

- If a site connects to many third-party domains, consider whether this fits your privacy expectations.
- Investigate unknown or suspicious domains using external domain lookup services.


---

# Practical Tips
- The number of domains alone does not ensure privacy; review *which* domains are contacted.
- Stealth-blocked domains often represent hidden tracking but may also include necessary resources blocked for stealthiness.
- Frequent domains like major CDN providers might be expected and usually not privacy threats.
- Use clipboard or bookmarking to save the connections list for further analysis.
- When updating content blockers or privacy settings, revisit uBO Scope to measure changes effectively.

---

# Common Pitfalls

- **Empty or no data in popup:** Verify extension activation and permissions.
- **Badge count stuck or incorrect:** Reload browser tab or restart the browser.
- **Misinterpretation of domains:** Remember domain grouping is by the Public Suffix List; subdomains are aggregated under their registrable domain.
- **Counting is only for connections visible to the browser webRequest API:** Some network connections initiated outside this API scope will not appear.

---

# Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Connections Displayed for Active Tab
- Ensure you have navigated to a valid webpage and not an internal browser page.
- Confirm uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (activeTab, webRequest).
- Reload the page and reopen the popup.
- Restart the browser if the issue persists.

### Issue: Badge Count is Missing or Zero Despite Network Activity
- Verify extension activation and that the background service is running.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions.
- Clear browser cache and data related to uBO Scope.

# How uBO Scope Collects Connection Data

uBO Scope listens to all network requests (HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket) initiated by the browser tab. It classifies outcomes as:

- **Allowed (successful requests)**
- **Blocked (failed requests)**
- **Stealth (redirected or silently blocked requests)**

This comprehensive capture helps you see the full scope of external servers contacted on any webpage.

---

# Example Scenario

1. You visit example.com.
2. uBO Scope popup shows:

   - Not blocked: `cdn.examplecdn.com` (10 requests), `analytics.exampletracker.com` (3 requests)
   - Stealth-blocked: `ads.exampleadserver.com` (5 requests)
   - Blocked: `tracker.badtracker.com` (7 requests)

3. Interpretation:
   - The page loads resources primarily from a content delivery network.
   - Some advertising requests are blocked stealthily, unseen by the page.
   - A known tracker is fully blocked, improving privacy.
