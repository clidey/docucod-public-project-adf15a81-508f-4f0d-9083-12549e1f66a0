# Interpreting Domain Data and Counts in uBO Scope

## Overview

This guide explains how to understand the badge count displayed by the uBO Scope extension and the detailed domain lists shown in its popup interface. You will learn why a lower count on the badge indicates better privacy protection, how uBO Scope differentiates between legitimate and unwanted third-party connections, and why traditional block counts or ad blocker test websites can be misleading. This knowledge empowers you to interpret uBO Scope data effectively and make informed decisions about your web privacy.

## 1. Understanding the Badge Count and Domain Lists

### What the Badge Represents

- The uBO Scope badge count shows the **number of distinct third-party domains** that your browser connected to during the current webpage visit.
- It reflects the count of **allowed connections** — network requests that successfully reached remote servers, excluding blocked or stealth-blocked attempts.
- A **lower badge count is better**, indicating fewer third-party connections, which typically means less exposure to tracking and unwanted content.

### Interpreting the Domain Lists in the Popup

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup, you see three sections:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Third-party domains from which connections succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains blocked in a stealthy way, where the request was redirected or otherwise prevented without explicit error.
- **Blocked**: Domains for which connection attempts failed with an error (explicit blocking).

Each domain entry includes a count of how many network requests were made to that domain.

### Differentiating Legitimate Third Parties

Not all third-party domains are harmful. Many legitimate services are commonly used by websites, such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for fast resource loading or trusted analytics providers. These legitimate third parties generally result in a low count of distinct domains.

<u>Example:</u> A website using `cdn.jsdelivr.net` or `cdnjs.cloudflare.com` to serve JavaScript libraries will show these CDN domains in the allowed list, reflecting necessary and benign third-party connections.

## 2. Why a Lower Domain Count Matters

Every connection to a distinct third-party domain increases your exposure and potential tracking surface. While many third-party domains are safe and essential for website functionality, some may track your behavior or inject unwanted content.

<u>Key Insight:</u> The total number of distinct third-party domains connected to is a **more reliable privacy signal** than the sheer number of blocked requests. A content blocker that blocks many but still allows connections to many different third parties might be less protective than one with fewer allowed domains.

### Common User Misunderstandings:

- **Block Count Myths**: A higher block count does not necessarily mean a content blocker is better.
- **Ad Blocker Test Pages**: These pages simulate unrealistic test scenarios and often cannot reveal the stealth blocking or true network behavior of extensions like uBO Scope.

uBO Scope focuses on revealing the unique domains contacted, helping you assess the true exposure beyond simple block counts.

## 3. How uBO Scope Classifies Requests

uBO Scope listens to browser network events and classifies connections into three categories:

- **Allowed**: Requests that succeeded without error.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Requests that were redirected or prevented quietly, often to avoid detection.
- **Blocked**: Requests that explicitly failed with an error.

To determine domains:

- uBO Scope extracts hostnames from each URL.
- It applies the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to derive registrable domains, ensuring domain counting is meaningful (e.g., `images.example.co.uk` maps to `example.co.uk`).

This process avoids miscounting subdomains from the same registrable domain as distinct parties.

## 4. Practical Tips for Effective Usage

- **Check the badge count regularly**: Use the toolbar badge as a quick privacy snapshot whenever you browse.
- **Open the popup for details**: Review allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains to understand your exposure.
- **Identify familiar CDNs**: Recognize common CDN or large platform domains that are usually safe.
- **Investigate unfamiliar domains**: If suspicious or unknown domains appear frequently, consider using specialized lookup tools or privacy guides.
- **Avoid relying on block count comparisons**: Instead, focus on how many unique domains are contacted.

<Tip>
Reducing the number of distinct third-party connections often has a bigger privacy impact than blocking more requests without reducing domains.

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Misinterpretations

### Misreading the Badge as Block Count

Some users confuse the badge number as a count of blocked connections. Remember, it is the count of unique **allowed third-party domains**.

### Using Ad Blocker Test Pages as Benchmarks

Such test pages artificially generate requests and can't capture stealth or accurate blocking. Trust uBO Scope's real-time data monitoring instead.

### Confusing Subdomains for Different Parties

uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List to consolidate subdomains under the same registrable domain properly, preventing inflated counts.

## 6. Step-by-Step: Interpreting Your Current Tab's Domain Data

1. Click the uBO Scope extension icon to open the popup.
2. Observe the large domain count at the top — this is the number of unique third-party domains allowed.
3. Review the **Not Blocked (Allowed)** section to see domains your browser connected to successfully.
4. Check the **Stealth-Blocked** section for connections silently blocked or redirected.
5. Look at the **Blocked** section for connections denied explicitly.
6. Identify any known CDNs or trusted services among allowed domains.
7. Notice domains with high request counts as areas of frequent connection.
8. If needed, research unknown domains to assess their trustworthiness.

This process helps you understand third-party exposure, recognize potential trackers, and evaluate the effectiveness of your content blockers.

---

## 7. Summary

- The badge count denotes unique allowed third-party domains, signaling the breadth of third-party exposure.
- Lower counts mean fewer third-party connections and better privacy.
- uBO Scope differentiates connections into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked, clarifying network outcomes.
- Use the Public Suffix List to accurately group domains, avoiding miscounts due to subdomains.
- Avoid misusing block counts or ad blocker tests as true privacy metrics.

## Appendix: Example Scenario

Imagine visiting a popular news website:

- The uBO Scope badge shows **12** — indicating the site connects to 12 distinct third-party domains.
- Opening the popup, you see several CDN providers like `cloudflare.net` and `akamai.net` in the allowed list — these are typical and expected.
- Some known advertising or tracking domains also appear, increasing your privacy exposure.

By comparing the badge count over time or across sites, you can identify which sites expose you to more third parties and adjust your privacy settings or blockers accordingly.
