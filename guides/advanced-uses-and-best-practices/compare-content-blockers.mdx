title: "Comparing Different Content Blockers Objectively"
description: "Step-by-step guidance for using uBO Scope to evaluate the real impact of various content blockers or configurations. This guide explains how to avoid common misconceptions—such as equating higher block counts with better protection—and shows how to properly interpret the number and type of third-party connections allowed."

# Comparing Different Content Blockers Objectively

## Overview
This guide empowers you to use uBO Scope for a fair and accurate comparison of different content blockers. It walks you through avoiding common misconceptions—specifically the mistaken belief that a content blocker is better simply because it shows a higher count of blocked items. Instead, you'll learn to focus on **the actual impact on third-party connections allowed by each blocker**, clarifying the true level of privacy protection.

## What This Guide Will Help You Achieve
- Understand why block counts alone are misleading.
- Evaluate content blockers based on distinct third-party domains that remain accessible.
- Use uBO Scope to reveal the real protection level your content blocker offers.
- Interpret the data presented in uBO Scope’s popup to make informed decisions.

---

## Prerequisites
Before starting this comparison, ensure:

- You have uBO Scope installed and activated in your browser.
- You are familiar with basic usage of uBO Scope’s popup panel and badge counter (see [Interpreting the Badge Counter and Popup Panel](./interpret-badge-and-popup.md)).
- You have at least two content blockers installed or you can switch configurations easily.

---

## Time Estimate
15–30 minutes, depending on how many blockers or configurations you want to test.

## Difficulty Level
Intermediate — requires understanding of web tracking basics and uBO Scope’s reporting.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare Your Environment">

1. Open your browser and ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
2. Make sure you can switch between content blockers or their configurations (e.g., filters enabled/disabled).
3. Close all non-essential tabs to avoid noise in connection data.

*Expected Result:*

Your environment is clean and ready for reliable monitoring.

</Step>

<Step title="Visit a Consistent Test Website">

1. Choose a real-world website you want to test (avoid synthetic ad-blocker test pages).
2. Load the website with your first content blocker active.
3. Open the uBO Scope popup to observe the network connections.

*Expected Result:*

The uBO Scope popup shows connections categorized as **Allowed**, **Blocked**, and **Stealth-Blocked**.

</Step>

<Step title="Record the Baseline Data for Content Blocker 1">

1. Note the badge count on the uBO Scope toolbar icon — this shows the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected.
2. In the popup, review the listed domains under **Not Blocked**, **Blocked**, and **Stealth-Blocked**.
3. Optionally, export or screenshot the data for comparison.

*Expected Result:*

You have a baseline of third-party connections allowed and blocked for the first content blocker.

</Step>

<Step title="Switch to Content Blocker 2 and Repeat">

1. Disable the first blocker and enable your second content blocker.
2. Reload the exact same test website.
3. Open the uBO Scope popup again and note the badge count and domain lists.

*Expected Result:*

You have comparable data for content blocker 2 showing actual third-party connections and blocking behavior.

</Step>

<Step title="Analyze and Compare Real Impact">

1. Compare badge counts: A *lower* badge count indicates fewer distinct third-party connections — *more privacy*.
2. Review domain lists: Focus on the number and type of third-party domains still allowed.
3. Identify if higher block counts correspond with fewer allowed domains, or if they paradoxically allow more distinct connections.

*Decision Point:*

If the blocker with the higher badge count allows more third-party domains, it may deliver worse privacy despite blocking more requests.

</Step>

<Step title="Evaluate Stealth Blocked Connections">

- Review the **Stealth-Blocked** category, showing requests that were redirected or subtly handled to avoid detection or breakage.
- Consider these in your assessment, as some blockers employ stealth tactics instead of outright blocking.

*Expected Result:*

You gain deeper insight into the blocking strategy differences beyond simple block counts.

</Step>

<Step title="Make an Informed Choice">

- Use your observations to decide which blocker or configuration truly offers the best protection for your browsing.
- Remember that the *quality* of blocking (fewer distinct 3rd-party domains allowed) matters more than the *quantity* of blocked items.

*Success Criteria:*

You confidently select the blocker providing the tightest control over third-party connections based on objective data.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Key Concepts to Remember

- **Block Count ≠ Better Protection:** A higher number of blocked requests might mean the blocker misses fewer requests, but it doesn't guarantee fewer allowed third parties.
- **Allowed Third-Party Domains Matter:** The number of distinct domains still communicating with your browser shows actual exposure.
- **Stealth Blocking:** Some blockers prevent detection and blocking side effects by altering or redirecting requests rather than outright blocking.

## Practical Example

Imagine you compare two popular content blockers:

| Content Blocker | Block Count (Toolbar Badge) | Allowed Third-Party Domains |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Blocker A       | 25                          | 10                          |
| Blocker B       | 40                          | 18                          |

Although Blocker B blocks more requests, it allows connections to more distinct third-party domains, meaning it potentially exposes you to more tracking. Blocker A, with fewer allowed domains, provides stronger privacy despite a lower block count.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or 'NO DATA'">
- Confirm uBO Scope has the necessary permissions and is active.
- Refresh the test webpage after enabling the content blocker.
- Ensure network requests are visible to the browser's `webRequest` API.
- Try with a different website to confirm behavior is consistent.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Counter Does Not Update or Shows Unexpected Values">
- Wait a moment after page load; processing happens within seconds.
- Verify your content blocker is actively functioning.
- Close and reopen the tab/browser if stuck.
- Check for potential conflicts with other extensions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Misinterpretation of Stealth Blocked Domains">
- Understand stealth blocking may not appear as blocked in the traditional sense but prevents direct resource loading.
- Use stealth info to judge blocker sophistication but prioritize allowed third-party domains count.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
When comparing multiple blockers, keep browsing conditions as similar as possible: same website, same browsing session, and no extra interfering extensions.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Avoid using websites designed as "ad blocker tests" for comparisons, as they often create artificial network requests irrelevant to typical browsing.
</Tip>

## Summary
Use uBO Scope to shift focus from superficial block counts to the real story — distinct third-party connections allowed — when comparing content blockers. This approach ensures you choose privacy solutions based on accurate, meaningful data, not misleading metrics.
