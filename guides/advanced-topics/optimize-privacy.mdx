# Optimizing Browsing Privacy with uBO Scope

Enhance your daily online privacy by integrating uBO Scope into your routine browsing habits. This guide presents best practices to monitor your extensionâ€™s badge counts, detect anomalies in domain connections, and adjust your behavior to limit exposure to unnecessary third-party servers.

---

## 1. Understanding Badge Counts and What They Mean

The badge count on the uBO Scope toolbar icon shows the number of **distinct third-party remote domains allowed** in the active browser tab.

- **Lower badge count = better privacy:** fewer third-party connections mean less exposure to remote servers.
- The count reflects domains that served content without being blocked, independent of other blockers or DNS filters.

### Practical Tip

Periodically check the badge count for your most-visited sites. An unexpected increase can indicate new connections to third parties you might want to scrutinize.

---

## 2. Monitoring Domain Activity in the Popup UI

Use the uBO Scope popup to gain granular insight into how websites connect with remote servers. Domains are grouped by connection outcomes:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Connections successfully reached third-party domains.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections attempted but were invisibly blocked (often to prevent page breakage or detection).
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked by content blockers or DNS.

### How to Effectively Monitor:

- Open the popup by clicking the toolbar icon.
- Review the domains listed under each category to identify any unusual or unexpected domains.
- Hover or scan the domain names for authentication providers, analytics, advertising, or trackers you wish to block further.

### Best Practice

Regularly audit stealth-blocked domains since these are often domains attempting to connect but prevented silently, which may indicate tracking or unwanted resource calls.

---

## 3. Identifying Unusual or Unexpected Domain Connections

Pay close attention to:

- Domains you do not recognize or that are unrelated to the content or service you are using.
- Domains with high request counts (displayed as badges) which may indicate heavy communication.
- New domains appearing suddenly that were not previously connected on familiar websites.

### Scenario Example

Imagine visiting your favorite news site usually shows 5 allowed third-party domains, but suddenly you see 20 with many stealth-blocked entries. This may suggest new tracking scripts or third-party services have been integrated.

---

## 4. Adjusting Your Browsing Habits to Minimize Exposure

Based on what you observe in uBO Scope, you can take actionable steps:

1. **Modify Content Blockers:** Add rules or filters targeting suspicious domains found in the popup.
2. **Use Browser Privacy Settings:** Limit third-party cookies, disable unnecessary permissions, or restrict cross-site tracking.
3. **Use Private Browsing Modes:** These can reduce persistent tracking and lower third-party request buildup.
4. **Limit Extensions:** Verify that other browser extensions are not causing excessive network requests.

## 5. Workflow: Integrating uBO Scope in Daily Browsing

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Observe the Badge Count Regularly">
Monitor the badge count as you browse to quickly spot when third-party server contacts grow unusually high.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Open the Popup UI for Details">
Click the extension icon to inspect detailed domain connection outcomes categorized by allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked. Focus on new or suspicious domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Research Domains">
If unclear about certain domains, search online to determine if they are known trackers, ads, or legitimate CDN services.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: Adjust Filters and Settings">
Based on your findings, update your content blocking filters or browser privacy settings to block or limit communication with unwanted domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 5: Verify Changes with uBO Scope">
Reload the website and observe changes in the badge count and popup domain lists. Confirm that unwanted connections are reduced or eliminated.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Privacy Challenges

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting & Tips">
<Accordion title="Unexpected High Badge Counts">
- Confirm that you are viewing the active tab with uBO Scope enabled.
- Check for other extensions that may interfere or cause additional requests.
- Visit different sites to see if the count is persistent or site-specific.
- Reset or reinstall uBO Scope if issues persist.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Inability to Identify Domains">
- Use online domain lookup tools to research unfamiliar domains.
- Remember that some domains may be obfuscated using punycode or internationalized domain names (IDNs). Use the popup UI which converts these for easier reading.
- Consider reaching out to filter list communities or forums for help identifying domain purposes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth Blocking Surprises">
- Stealth blocking is intentional to prevent detection or page breakage, so it's not always obvious why certain domains are stealth blocked.
- Use the 'Diagnosing Stealth Blocking & Network Request Outcomes' guide for deeper understanding and practical guidance.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Quick Reference

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Badge Count | Shows distinct allowed third-party remote domains per tab |
| Popup UI | Categorizes connected domains into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked |
| Domain Insights | Helps identify unusual or new third-party domains |
| Stealth Blocking Awareness | Reveals invisible blocking behavior to better understand privacy |

---

# Practical Example

Suppose you regularly visit example.com and its badge count is consistently around 7. After updating your browser or content blocker, the count jumps to 15 with many stealth-blocked domains now present.

**Action:** Use the popup UI to identify these new domains, research their nature, then update your content blocker or uBO Scope filters to restore your desired privacy level.

This workflow ensures you remain actively informed and capable of minimizing unnecessary remote server exposure.
