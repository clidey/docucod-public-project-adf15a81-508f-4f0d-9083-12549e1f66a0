# Leveraging uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance

## Overview

This guide is designed specifically for filter list maintainers who want to use uBO Scope as a powerful, lightweight tool to identify overlooked third-party domains, validate the effectiveness of existing content blockers, and gather concrete evidence to fine-tune filter lists. This workflow is especially valuable for maintainers using devices with limited access to advanced browser developer tools or network debuggers.

By the end of this guide, you will confidently navigate uBO Scope's interface, extract meaningful data about third-party connections, and systematically approach filter list improvements to enhance web privacy and reduce unintended resource loading.

---

## Prerequisites

- **uBO Scope Installed:** Make sure uBO Scope is installed in your Chromium-, Firefox-, or Safari-based browser. Refer to the [Installing uBO Scope guide](/getting-started/introduction-installation/installing-ubo-scope) if needed.
- **Basic Browser Usage:** Have familiarity with opening and switching tabs in your web browser.
- **Internet Access:** Required to load websites and capture their network connections.

---

## Expected Outcome

- Identify new or missed third-party domains not yet covered by your filter list.
- Validate which domains are effectively blocked or stealth-blocked by your filters.
- Collect evidence with connection counts and domain statuses to prioritize filter tuning.

---

## Time Estimate

About 15–30 minutes, depending on the complexity of the target website and thoroughness desired.

---

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate—best suited for filter list maintainers comfortable with privacy concepts and domain filtering.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using uBO Scope for Filter Maintenance

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Open your browser and navigate to the website you want to analyze.
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup UI, which displays domain connection data relevant to the active tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Domain Connection Outcomes">
Examine the categorized lists:
- **Not Blocked:** Domains currently allowed by your filter list.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains blocked in a way that prevents detection by conventional methods but captured by uBO Scope.
- **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked, with connection attempts prevented.

This color-coded outcome breakdown enables precise understanding of which third-party domains are effectively filtered.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify Overlooked Domains">
Review the 'Not Blocked' list for unexpected or suspicious third-party domains.
If any domains you wish to block appear here, note them for adding to your filter list.
Pay careful attention to domains with higher connection counts, indicating frequent resource loading.
</Step>

<Step title="Validate Filter Effectiveness">
Check the 'Blocked' and 'Stealth-Blocked' categories to verify whether your filter list is catching known trackers or unwanted domains.
Domains in the 'Stealth-Blocked' section often elude less observant monitoring and should be prioritized for confirmation and potential filter refinement.
</Step>

<Step title="Gather Evidence for Filters">
Use the connection counts displayed next to each domain to prioritize which entries may require urgent action.
Export the domain list or manually note domains and counts to support filter tuning discussions or patch submissions.
</Step>

<Step title="Test Filter Changes (Optional)" >
After adding or refining filters based on your discoveries, reload the target website and re-open the uBO Scope popup to verify the changes:
- Verify that previously allowed domains now appear as blocked or stealth-blocked.
- Ensure that no unintended legitimate third-party domains are blocked.
Repeat this iterative testing to achieve balanced filter performance.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Start with High-Impact Domains:** Focus on domains with a high number of connections first for maximum privacy gains.
- **Use Stealth-Blocking Insights:** Domains in the stealth-blocked list are crucial since many content blockers fail to detect or report these.
- **Validate Across Browsers:** If possible, test filter changes on multiple browsers with different content blockers to ensure consistent effectiveness.
- **Document Changes:** Maintain a change log with domain evidence and uBO Scope outputs to support the filter list community.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="No Data Shown in Popup">
- Ensure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (`webRequest`) and the browser is not blocking extension data.
- Refresh the tab or visit a website to trigger network logging.
- Confirm you're viewing the popup for the active tab with relevant network activity.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unexpected Domains Not Blocked">
- Some domains may be allowed due to filter exceptions or incomplete rules.
- Review your filter list syntax and priority.
- Consider the possibility of domains serving legitimate CDN or essential content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Stealth Blocking Misunderstandings">
- Stealth-blocked connections may not appear blocked in conventional tools but do not result in resources being loaded.
- Use uBO Scope's categorization to discern and prioritize these invisible blocks appropriately.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Examples

### Real-World Scenario: Improving a Filter List

1. You visit example.com with your current filter list enabled.
2. Opening uBO Scope's popup reveals a 'Not Blocked' domain tracking.example.net with many connections.
3. After confirming tracking.example.net is unnecessary, you add a blocking rule to your filter list.
4. Reloading example.com and reopening uBO Scope shows tracking.example.net is now stealth-blocked.
5. You document these changes to share with the filter list community.

## Summary
Use uBO Scope to bridge the gap between raw block counts and meaningful privacy improvements. This page empowers filter list maintainers to identify missed domains, validate blocking effectiveness, and iteratively improve filters using clear, evidence-based insights directly from browser connection data. By leveraging uBO Scope, maintainers can better protect users’ privacy even on limited or constrained devices.

## Callout
<Tip>
Always prioritize domains with high connection counts and stealth-blocked status for filter list updates to maximize user privacy gains while minimizing website breakage.
