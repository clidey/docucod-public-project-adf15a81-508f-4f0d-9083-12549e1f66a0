# Validating Filter List Changes and Diagnosing Issues with uBO Scope

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps filter list maintainers and privacy-conscious users verify that new or modified filter lists effectively reduce unwanted third-party network requests. Using uBO Scope, users will confirm whether their filter lists succeed in minimizing network connections to third-party domains. This guide also provides practical advice for environments without developer tools, such as locked-down or mobile browsers.

### Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and activated on a supported browser (Chromium, Firefox, or Safari). Ensure it has the necessary permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).
- Basic familiarity with how to open the uBO Scope popup and interpret the toolbar badge.
- Access to the environments where changes will be tested.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will confidently determine whether filter list adjustments decrease the number of distinct third-party connections your browser makes. You will also learn how to identify patterns and diagnose potential issues in privacy-focused environments or when browser devtools are restricted.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15–30 minutes, depending on the complexity of changes and testing environment.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate – aimed at users with some experience in browser privacy tooling and filter list maintenance.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Testing Environment
- Open your browser with uBO Scope enabled.
- Disable any other privacy or content blocking extensions temporarily to isolate filter list effects.
- Ensure the site or pages to test are refreshable and representative of real browsing.

### 2. Baseline Measurement
- Navigate to a test website before applying any changes to your filter list.
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- Observe the badge count indicating distinct third-party domains connected.
- Note the counts in each outcome category within the popup panel:
  - **Not blocked (allowed)**: third parties the browser connected to successfully.
  - **Stealth-blocked**: requests redirected or modified by content blocking stealth mechanisms.
  - **Blocked**: requests that failed due to blocking.

### 3. Apply Your Filter List Changes
- Update or switch to the new or modified filter list in your content blocker.
- Reload the test website to trigger fresh network activity.

### 4. Validate Changes with uBO Scope
- Open the uBO Scope popup again for the same tab.
- Compare the badge count and detailed domain lists against the baseline.
- Success is indicated by a reduced number of distinct third-party domains under the **allowed** category.
- Review blocked and stealth-blocked lists to understand which domains are now being mitigated.

### 5. Diagnose Inconsistencies or Issues
- If the number of allowed connections remains high, double-check:
  - Filter rules syntax and scope.
  - Whether the browser caches previous connections (try a hard reload or clearing cache).
  - Network and browser proxy/DNS settings that might interfere with blocking.

- For stealth-blocked entries, understand they indicate requests that were redirected or subtly handled to avoid web breakage or detection. Sometimes these are acceptable to keep site functionality.

- Use uBO Scope’s per-tab data to confirm that changes apply to the site and context of interest.

### 6. Testing in Locked-Down or Mobile Environments
- In environments where browser devtools are unavailable:
  - Rely exclusively on the uBO Scope toolbar badge count as your primary indicator.
  - Frequent reloading and comparison of badge counts after filter updates will help assess effectiveness.
  - Keep the uBO Scope popup open in a separate window if possible, for live observation.

- Consider using browser syncing or remote debugging tools where feasible to gain better visibility.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Validating a New Regional Filter List
1. Visit example news site.com.
2. Note badge shows 18 distinct third-party domains.
3. Apply your regional filter list.
4. Reload the site.
5. Badge count drops to 10, with some additional stealth-blocked entries.
6. Confirm that key trackers known to be blocked by your list no longer appear in allowed domains.

### Example 2: Diagnosing Unexpected Persistent Connections
1. Badge count stays at 20 despite robust filter list changes.
2. Open uBO Scope popup and identify domains repeatedly appearing.
3. Cross-reference with your filter list syntax.
4. Discover an overlooked rule exclusion or whitelist entry.
5. Update the list, reload, and observe expected reduction.

## Tips & Best Practices
- **Always compare against a known baseline.** Understanding the previous state helps interpret results accurately.
- **Refresh the page fully** with cache cleared to get up-to-date network data.
- **Use uBO Scope's domain lists** in the popup to identify persistent third-party domains at a glance.
- **Beware of stealth-blocked connections**—these may be intentional compromises for site usability.
- **Remember the badge counts show distinct domains, not raw request counts.** This clarifies true privacy exposure.
- **For mobile or restricted environments, favor simple iterative testing** and badge observation.
- **Keep your public suffix list updated via the background session.** This ensures domain parsing is accurate.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Badge Count Does Not Reflect Filter List Changes
- **Cause:** Browser cache or persistent connection data.
- **Solution:** Perform a hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R), clear cache, or open a new tab.

### Issue: No Data or Empty Popup Panel
- **Cause:** uBO Scope not monitoring this tab or permissions missing.
- **Solution:** Verify extension permissions; reload uBO Scope; check browser extension settings.

### Issue: Stealth-Blocked Domains Appear Unexpectedly High
- **Cause:** Filter list uses subtle block techniques.
- **Solution:** Review stealth-blocked domains to balance privacy and site functionality; adjust filter rules if needed.

### Issue: Unable to Test in Locked-Down Environment
- **Cause:** Absence of devtools.
- **Solution:** Use badge count as proxy, cycle filter list changes carefully, and consider sync/debug tools if accessible.

## Appendix: Understanding uBO Scope Outcomes

| Outcome        | What it Means                                                               |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked    | Successful third-party connections are allowed to proceed by current filter rules or no blocking applies.           |
| Stealth-Blocked| Requests redirected or stealthily blocked to avoid site breakage while preventing tracking or unwanted connections.   |
| Blocked        | Requests failed outright due to blocking, effectively cutting the connection.


---

## Screenshot Reference

The uBO Scope popup panel displays three categories of third-party domains tracked for the current tab:
- Allowed (not blocked)
- Stealth-blocked
- Blocked

Each domain entry includes a count badge representing the number of requests for that domain.

# Using uBO Scope Popup to Validate and Diagnose

1. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in the toolbar to open the popup panel.
2. Review the `domains connected` count for the active tab; this is the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.
3. Examine the three domain outcome sections:
   - **Not blocked:** Domains from which network requests succeeded.
   - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or stealthily handled.
   - **Blocked:** Domains with blocked requests.
4. Verify that, after your filter list changes, unwanted or suspicious third-party domains move from the **Not blocked** column into **Blocked** or **Stealth-blocked**.
5. When the popup shows `NO DATA`, it typically means the tab does not currently have any monitored network request data (e.g., a blank tab).

<Tip>
For the most accurate results, always reload your test pages using a hard refresh after updating filter lists to avoid cached resource effects.
</Tip>

<Note>
On mobile browsers or heavily locked-down desktops where devtools are unavailable, the uBO Scope badge count remains your best real-time privacy indicator.
</Note>
