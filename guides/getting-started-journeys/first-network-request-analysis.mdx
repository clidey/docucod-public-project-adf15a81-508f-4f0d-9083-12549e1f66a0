# Your First Network Request Analysis

This guide walks you through inspecting network requests made by a real web page using uBO Scope. By following practical examples, you'll understand how uBO Scope tracks, categorizes, and presents network connections to third-party remote servers. This hands-on walkthrough empowers you to distinguish between essential connections and unnecessary third-party requests, helping you make confident privacy assessments.

## 1. Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
You will learn how to analyze the network footprint of the currently active web page using uBO Scope’s popup UI. This includes seeing how connections to remote servers are categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, and interpreting what these categories mean for your privacy.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and enabled on your supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- Familiarity with basic browsing and opening the extension popup.
- The page you analyze should be actively loaded in a browser tab.

### Expected Outcome
Upon completion, you will:
- Access and understand the categorized network request lists in the uBO Scope popup.
- Differentiate between first-party and third-party connections.
- Confidently assess which third-party requests are essential and which might represent privacy risks.

### Time Estimate
10-15 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate.

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup for the Active Tab
1. While browsing the web page you want to analyze, click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup opens showing connection information related to that tab.

**Expected Result:**
- The popup shows the domain of the active page prominently at the top.
- Below, three categorized sections will be visible: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Popup Overview
- **Hostname Display:** Shows the full hostname and its base domain. For example, a page on `news.example.com` will display the subdomain and the base domain.
- **Domains Connected Count:** Located near the top under "domains connected", showing the number of distinct third-party domains allowed.
- **Categories:**
  - **Not Blocked:** Connections allowed by the browser or content blocker.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections detected but silently redirected or disguised (e.g., due to redirects).
  - **Blocked:** Connections that failed or were explicitly blocked.

**Tip:**
Lower counts indicate fewer third-party connections, aligning with better privacy.

---

### Step 3: Review the Allowed Connections
1. Expand the **not blocked** section if necessary.
2. Examine the list of domains from which requests succeeded.
3. Look for familiar domains such as content delivery networks (CDNs) or service providers essential for the webpage’s features.

**Decision Point:**
- Domains like `cdn.examplecdn.com` often indicate legitimate resources.
- Unknown third-party domains may warrant further investigation.

---

### Step 4: Explore Stealth-Blocked Connections
1. Check the **stealth-blocked** section for domains with redirected requests.
2. These connections indicate resources that might have been silently redirected or obfuscated to avoid detection.

**Best Practice:**
- Consider the context and necessity of these domains.
- Research domains if unsure about legitimacy.

---

### Step 5: Check Blocked Connections
1. View domains listed under **blocked**.
2. These represent connections that failed to complete, possibly due to content blockers or network errors.

**Pitfall:**
- Discrepancies may occur if your browser or network blocks some connections outside of uBO Scope’s control.

---

### Step 6: Interpret Counts and Connection Frequency
- Each domain row shows a badge count of how many requests were made to that domain.
- Higher counts typically mean the webpage depends more heavily on that third-party resource.

**Verification:**
- Compare counts between categories to understand resource access.

## 3. Practical Example

Imagine analyzing the home page of a popular news site:

| Category       | Domains Found                                    | Notes                                |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Not Blocked    | `examplecdn.com`, `fonts.googleapis.com`        | Essential CDN and font provider     |
| Stealth-Blocked| `tracker.analytics.com`                         | Suspicious tracking domain          |
| Blocked       | `ads.thirdpartyadvertising.com`                  | Clearly unwanted ads provider       |

This suggests the site loads essential resources through CDNs but attempts to track users with analytics and ads, which you may want to block explicitly.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Popup Shows No Data or NO DATA Message:**
  - Ensure the tab is active and fully loaded.
  - Verify that uBO Scope permissions are granted.
  - Reload the tab and reopen the popup.

- **Badge Count Does Not Update Correctly:**
  - The badge counts only distinct allowed third-party domains.
  - Content blocker interactions or browser limitations might affect counts.

### Best Practices
- Always analyze real-world web pages rather than artificial “ad blocker test” pages.
- Combine observations from all three categories for a complete understanding.
- Use domain research (e.g., WHOIS or public suffix knowledge) to classify unknown domains.

### Performance Considerations
- uBO Scope updates data periodically, so waiting a moment for the popup data to appear can help.
- Opening multiple tabs or rapidly changing tabs may temporarily affect data freshness.

### Alternative Views
- For more detailed analysis, refer to advanced guides on interpreting badge counts and running privacy audits.
