## Step-by-Step Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Locate and Install uBO Scope from Your Browser Store

1. Open your browser’s extension or add-on store:
   - Chrome Web Store for Google Chrome
   - Firefox Add-ons for Mozilla Firefox
   - Safari Extensions Gallery for Safari

2. Search for "uBO Scope".

3. Select the official extension named **"uBlock Origin Scope"** by Raymond Hill.

4. Click **Add to Browser** or **Install**.

5. Approve the requested permissions:
   - `activeTab`
   - `storage`
   - `webRequest` and host permissions for URLs (http://*/*, https://*/*, and ws://*/* / wss://*/* where applicable)

<Tip>
Only grant the listed permissions to ensure full network monitoring capabilities. These permissions are necessary for uBO Scope to observe and report all network requests your browser makes.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Confirm uBO Scope is Added Successfully

- After installation, look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. It typically looks like a shield or network node icon with a badge area.

- Hovering over the icon should show the tooltip: **"uBO Scope"**.

- If the icon is not visible, check your browser’s extensions or add-ons menu and enable the extension manually.

<Note>
If you’re using Safari, ensure your system browser version is 18.5 or later to support uBO Scope, as required by the manifest.
</Note>

### Step 3: Launch the uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.

- The popup window will open showing your current tab’s connection summary.

- Initially, the popup may display "NO DATA" until network activity is registered and processed.

<Check>
If the popup remains empty, try refreshing the current web page or browsing to a new site to generate network connections.
</Check>

### Step 4: Verify uBO Scope is Monitoring Connections

- After a few seconds, the badge on the extension icon will display a number representing the count of distinct third-party remote servers your current tab connected to.

- Open the popup again and check:
  - The domain name(s) of the current tab
  - The number of domains categorized as **not blocked (allowed)**
  - The number of domains stealth-blocked
  - The number of domains blocked

- These categories provide transparency into how many distinct remote servers your browser accessed or tried to access through the page.

<Tip>
A lower badge count generally indicates fewer third-party connections, which is preferable for privacy-conscious browsing.
</Tip>

### Step 5: Basic Troubleshooting If Data Is Missing or Badge Is Blank

- Ensure uBO Scope has all required permissions enabled (see Step 1).

- Refresh the active tab to force network requests.

- Restart your browser to reload the extension if needed.

- Check for browser updates and compatibility.

- Consult related troubleshooting guides for deeper assistance.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep uBO Scope Updated:** Use the latest stable browser versions and update the extension regularly via the store.

- **Understand Badge Count:** The badge shows distinct third-party domains connected, not just request counts, offering a clearer privacy indicator.

- **Try Different Websites:** Test with various sites to observe typical connection patterns and spot anomalies.

- **Use in Tandem with Content Blockers:** uBO Scope complements blockers like uBlock Origin by reporting factual network activity independent of blocking rules.
