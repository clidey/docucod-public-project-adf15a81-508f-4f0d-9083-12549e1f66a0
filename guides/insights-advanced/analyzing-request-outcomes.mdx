# Analyzing Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Request Outcomes

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you understand how uBO Scope categorizes network requests into three outcome groups: **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth-blocked**. You will learn the detection mechanisms, the implications of each category for your privacy or filtering effectiveness, and how to interpret these insights in the popup panel and badge.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension must be installed and active in your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Familiarity with basic extension usage, including opening the popup panel and recognizing the toolbar badge.
- A web page loaded in an active tab to analyze network request outcomes.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Distinguish between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked network requests as reported by uBO Scope.
- Comprehend how uBO Scope detects these categories.
- Apply this knowledge to assess your privacy and filter performance more effectively.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10-15 minutes, depending on your familiarity with the extension and network request concepts.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate — requires a foundational understanding of network requests and browser content blocking.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Access the uBO Scope Popup Panel
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser to open the popup panel.
- The panel displays connection data for the active browser tab, segmented by request outcomes.

### 2. Recognize Outcome Categories
Within the popup, observe three distinct sections:
- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Lists third-party domains for which network requests succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Shows network requests that were blocked in a stealthy manner, meaning the blocking occurred silently without triggering typical block responses.
- **Blocked:** Displays requests that were outright blocked, evident from explicit network failures or errors.

### 3. Understand How uBO Scope Detects Each Outcome
- **Allowed Requests:** Network requests completing successfully with positive status codes and resolved IP information.
- **Blocked Requests:** Requests that resulted in errors or explicit network failures, as captured through the browser's `webRequest` API error events.
- **Stealth-Blocked Requests:** Requests redirected in ways that conceal the blocking (e.g., redirects to data URLs or empty responses) that do not raise errors but effectively prevent resource loading.

#### Details:
- uBO Scope listens for network request events such as `onBeforeRedirect`, `onErrorOccurred`, and `onResponseStarted`.
- Redirects that do not lead to a valid network resource counted as stealth-blocked.
- Errors caught by the API mark requests as blocked.
- Successfully completed requests mark as allowed.

### 4. Interpret Domain Counts
- Each category aggregates results by the domain, counting how many requests were recorded for each.
- The badge on the toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains for the active tab.
- A lower badge count indicates fewer allowed third-party connections, which is generally desirable for privacy.

### 5. Correlate Outcomes to Privacy and Filtering
- **Allowed:** These are active connections your browser made, which can impact privacy depending on the third-party domain's trustworthiness.
- **Blocked:** Represents content or connections your filters successfully prevented.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Indicates more advanced blocking techniques that do not reveal blocking through errors but remain effective.

### 6. Use Practical Examples
- Visit a popular website and open uBO Scope’s popup.
- Compare the number of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.
- Notice how well your content blocker is preventing unwanted connections by examining the blocked and stealth-blocked lists.

### 7. Verify and Refresh
- Reload the active tab to update network request data.
- Observe changes in the popup and toolbar badge reflecting new request outcomes.

## Examples & Visualization

### Example: Popup Panel Layout
The popup splits request outcomes into three sections as follows:

| Section         | Description                                               | Example Domain Types            |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Allowed**     | Successfully completed connections to third-party domains | Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), analytics providers |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Requests blocked silently without error messages          | Ads or trackers blocked using redirect tricks       |
| **Blocked**     | Requests blocked with network errors                      | Known ad servers, malicious domains                  |

### Example Scenario
You visit an online newspaper:
- Allowed: cdn.examplecdn.com, fonts.googleapis.com
- Stealth-blocked: tracker.adsnetwork.com
- Blocked: adserver.example.com

This shows some legitimate third-party services allowed, while trackers and ads are blocked or stealth-blocked.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **No data in popup:** Ensure uBO Scope is installed with required permissions (`webRequest`, `storage`) and the tab has loaded network activity.
- **Badge count not updating:** Reload the page or restart the browser to refresh session data.
- **Unexplained allowed domains:** Check if those domains are essential for website functionality or content delivery.

### Best Practices
- Regularly review allowed vs blocked domains to fine-tune your content blocking rules.
- Understand that stealth-blocking aims to reduce detection and web breakage, so some sites may appear to ‘allow’ more but are in fact stealth-blocked.
- Use uBO Scope’s detailed categorization as a complement to your content blocker’s own UI.

### Performance Considerations
- uBO Scope batches network requests for analysis, updating the popup data and badge every second to balance performance and responsiveness.
