# Using uBO Scope with Any Content Blocker

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide teaches you how to use uBO Scope alongside any content blocker to gain reliable visibility into all network connections a web page attempts. It explains how uBO Scope reports network activity regardless of the content blocking technique in use—including DNS-based or stealth methods—and guides you to validate and compare effectiveness between blockers.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and active in your browser.
- A content blocker enabled (e.g., uBlock Origin, DNS-based blocker, or other).
- Basic familiarity with accessing and interpreting uBO Scope's toolbar badge and popup panel.

### Expected Outcome
After following this guide, you will be able to:
- Monitor network requests as reported by uBO Scope even when content blockers block or alter requests.
- Differentiate between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked requests as categorized by uBO Scope.
- Use uBO Scope data to assess blocking effectiveness accurately.
- Troubleshoot and resolve common integration issues when combining uBO Scope with other blockers.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10-15 minutes to read through, perform checks, and interpret results.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate – assumes basic installation and usage knowledge of browser extensions.

## How uBO Scope Works with Content Blockers

uBO Scope relies on browser `webRequest` APIs to monitor network activity. It tracks requests per browser tab and classifies them as:

- **Allowed**: Requests that completed successfully.
- **Blocked**: Requests the content blocker actively blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Those requests internally canceled or redirected stealthily by content blockers to avoid detection.

Because uBO Scope operates independently of content blocker implementations, it can report these outcomes regardless of:

- What blocking technology is used (extension-based, DNS-based, etc.).
- The stealthiness or visibility of the blocking methods employed.

This gives you an objective and comprehensive view of all third-party connections attempted or blocked on any webpage.

<Tip>
uBO Scope reports network connections that the browser's `webRequest` API surfaces; some DNS-based or OS-level blocking methods may bypass this detection and thus might not appear in uBO Scope's data.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Confirm uBO Scope and Your Content Blocker Are Active

- Ensure your content blocker is enabled and protecting sites as intended.
- Confirm uBO Scope is installed and its badge icon appears in your browser toolbar.

### 2. Visit a Website with Your Content Blocker Enabled

- Navigate to a website where you want to evaluate network connections.
- Watch the badge token on the toolbar icon; it shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected to.

### 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar badge icon.
- Observe the popup panel, which categorizes:
  - Domains with **allowed** requests (not blocked)
  - Domains with **stealth-blocked** requests
  - Domains with **blocked** requests

### 4. Analyze the Network Activity

- Compare the domains counted in `allowed`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked` sections.
- Use the counts to assess how many distinct third-party servers your content blocker effectively blocks or lets through.

### 5. Repeat with Different Content Blockers (Optional)

- Disable your current content blocker.
- Enable a different content blocker or DNS-based block method.
- Repeat steps 2–4.
- Compare data from uBO Scope's popup panel across blockers to verify and benchmark blocking effectiveness.

### 6. Troubleshoot Common Issues

Refer to the troubleshooting section below if uBO Scope does not report data accurately or appears incompatible.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Use real-world websites** rather than synthetic ad-blocker test pages, as uBO Scope's data reflects actual network behavior.
- **Stealth-blocked** connections reveal content blockers' behind-the-scenes cancellation or redirection tricks; do not assume these indicate failure.
- Remember that **higher block counts do not always mean better blocking**; focus on a reduction of allowed third-party connections.
- uBO Scope works best when the browser supports `webRequest` APIs fully. Browser updates or restrictions might affect reporting fidelity.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Integration Issues

- **No Toolbar Badge or Empty Popup Data**
  - Confirm uBO Scope has necessary permissions (`webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab`).
  - Check browser compatibility (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
  - Reload or reinstall the extension if data remains missing.

- **DNS-Based or Third-Party Blocking Not Reflected**
  - Some DNS or network-layer blockers operate outside the browser API's visibility. uBO Scope cannot report these requests.
  - Verify blocking method and whether it affects browser's network stack.

- **Popup Panel Domains Not Updating**
  - Allow a few seconds for uBO Scope to process network requests and update.
  - Refresh the webpage or reopen the popup.

- **Mismatch Between Blockers and uBO Scope Data**
  - Remember uBO Scope shows network connection outcomes, not filter list hits.
  - Use it to verify real effective blocking rather than just filter list size.

<Tip>
If unsure about permissions or if uBO Scope appears incompatible with your content blocker setup, start by disabling other extensions and testing fresh.

## Examples & Scenario

### Scenario: Comparing Two Content Blockers

1. Install and enable uBO Scope.
2. Enable content blocker A (uBlock Origin).
3. Visit `example.com` and open uBO Scope popup.
4. Note third-party allowed, stealth, and blocked domain counts.
5. Disable blocker A, enable content blocker B (DNS-based blocker).
6. Repeat visit and open uBO Scope popup.
7. Analyze differences to confirm which blocker reduces connections more effectively.

### Interpreting Data

- A domain marked **allowed** means resources are loaded from that third-party.
- A domain marked **blocked** means requests to it were explicitly blocked.
- A domain marked **stealth-blocked** may have been canceled behind the scenes, making blocking invisible to the page.

This understanding prevents misinterpreting stealth blocking as failures or missed blocks.
