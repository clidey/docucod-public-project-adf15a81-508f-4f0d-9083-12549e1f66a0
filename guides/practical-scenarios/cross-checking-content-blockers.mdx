# Using uBO Scope with Other Content Blockers

## Overview
This guide helps you effectively run uBO Scope alongside other content blockers or DNS-level filtering services. You will learn practical workflows to compare network connections reported by uBO Scope when different blocking solutions are active. This empowers you to precisely identify which third-party domains your browser is connecting to, regardless of the blocking method used.

---

## Why Use uBO Scope with Other Blockers?

uBO Scope is designed to be an observer extension that reports all network connection attempts made by a webpage, including those allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked by content blockers or DNS filters. It complements rather than replaces your existing privacy or blocking tools by providing transparent, accurate insight into the actual third-party domains contacted.

By running uBO Scope alongside other blockers, you can:

- Verify which domains are genuinely blocked or permitted.
- Detect stealth-blocked connections your regular blocker might mask.
- Cross-check blocker effectiveness with DNS filtering.
- Avoid relying on misleading 'block counts' or 'ad blocker test' pages.

<u>Note:</u> uBO Scope relies on your browser's `webRequest` API to observe requests. Connections bypassing this API, such as those blocked at the OS or network layer without browser involvement, will not be visible.

---

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your browser.
  - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- At least one other content blocker or DNS-level filter active (e.g., uBlock Origin, AdGuard, Pi-hole).
- Your browser is a supported version:
  - Chrome v122+ / Chromium-based browsers
  - Firefox v128+ 
  - Safari v18.5+
- Basic familiarity with viewing extension badges and popup interface in your browser.

---

## Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will be able to:

- Use uBO Scope to observe network requests in real time even when other blockers are active.
- Identify which third-party domains are contacted (allowed or blocked) across different blocking setups.
- Compare reports across sessions or configurations to evaluate blocker behaviors and gaps.

Your browser's uBO Scope icon badge will reflect the number of _distinct third-party remote servers_ successfully connected.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Install and Enable uBO Scope

If you have not already installed uBO Scope:

1. Go to the official browser extension store for your browser.
2. Search for 'uBO Scope'.
3. Install and enable the extension.
4. Confirm the extension icon appears in your browser toolbar.


### Step 2: Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup displays lists of domains categorized as:
   - **Allowed (Not Blocked)**: Third-parties your browser connected to.
   - **Stealth-blocked**: Third-parties the content blocker prevented stealthily.
   - **Blocked**: Third-parties where connection attempts failed or were denied explicitly.
3. Confirm you see domain counts and details corresponding to the active tab.


### Step 3: Activate Your Content Blocker or DNS Filter

1. Ensure your preferred content blocker or DNS-level filter is enabled and running.
2. Open or reload a webpage you wish to analyze.
3. Observe the uBO Scope badge count and popup domain lists as the page loads.


### Step 4: Capture and Compare Network Connection Data

1. Use uBO Scope to gather baseline data with only your content blocker active.
2. Optionally, disable the content blocker or switch to a different DNS filter.
3. Reload the webpage and note changes in the uBO Scope reports and badge count.
4. Compare the counts and domain lists to identify:
   - Which domains are blocked or allowed in each setup.
   - Third-party connections missed or stealth-blocked by blockers.


### Step 5: Analyze Blocker Effectiveness

Remember, a higher block count on typical ad blocker badges does NOT necessarily mean better blocking. Use uBO Scope’s count of distinct third-party connections to understand:

- Fewer allowed connections typically mean stricter blocking.
- Stealth-blocking indicates requests silently stopped without visible blocking alerts.
- DNS-level filtering impacts what uBO Scope sees only if requests pass through the browser's `webRequest` API.


### Step 6: Use Insights to Tune Your Blocker

- If you notice suspicious or unwanted third-party connections allowed, consider adjusting your blocker's filter lists.
- Use the domain lists in uBO Scope to report false positives or refine filters.
- Leverage uBO Scope as a transparent monitoring companion for other blocking tools.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Always Verify with Real Websites:** Avoid relying on 'ad blocker test' pages, which fabricate network requests.
  These fake scenarios do not represent real-world blocking effectiveness.

- **Understand Badge Numbers:** 
  The toolbar badge in uBO Scope represents the number of distinct allowed third-party domains, not block counts.
  A lower number means fewer third-party connections, which usually correlates with better privacy.

- **Stealth Blocking is Valuable:** 
  Some blockers silently prevent requests without alerting the user; uBO Scope reveals these attempts.

- **Use Multiple Sessions:** 
  Compare blocking results with and without certain tools enabled to isolate their impact.

- **Permissions Matter:** 
  Ensure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (`webRequest`, host permissions) to observe requests.

- **Browser Limitations:** 
  Some browsers or configurations may limit the visibility of network requests due to privacy controls.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Problems with Using uBO Scope Alongside Other Blockers">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Badge Shows No Count or Data">
- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled and has the required permissions.
- Reload the active tab to trigger new network request monitoring.
- Verify no browser settings block extension access to the `webRequest` API.
- Check if your network or system-level blocking bypasses the browser (thus hidding data from uBO Scope).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains Not Showing as Expected in Popup">
- Refresh the page and reopen the popup for updated reporting.
- Make sure the active tab is selected before opening uBO Scope’s popup.
- Other extensions or browser privacy settings may interfere with request visibility.
- Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Conflicting Content Blockers Causing Issues">
- Disable other blockers temporarily to confirm uBO Scope functionality.
- Review your content blockers for overlapping or contradictory filtering rules.
- Consider the order and impact of DNS-level filtering vs. browser extension blockers.

## Real-World Example Workflow

Imagine you want to evaluate two popular blockers: uBlock Origin and a DNS filter like Pi-hole:

1. Install and enable uBO Scope along with uBlock Origin.
2. Navigate to your favorite news website.
3. Open uBO Scope popup and record the count and list of third-party domains allowed and blocked.
4. Disable uBlock Origin but keep Pi-hole running.
5. Reload the site, watch uBO Scope popup and badge.
6. Compare the two reports: Domains allowed or blocked by uBlock Origin vs. DNS filtering.
7. Identify any domains allowed by one blocker but not the other.
8. Adjust filter lists or DNS rules based on your observations for tighter control.
