# Mythbusting Ad Blocker Claims

uBO Scope offers a powerful, data-driven approach to evaluating the performance and effectiveness of content blockers, especially ad blockers. This guide dismantles common misconceptions about block counts and popular "ad blocker test" websites, helping users gain clarity on what truly matters for privacy and web experience.

## 1. Understanding the Real Story Behind Block Counts

### Why Users Often Misinterpret Block Counts

Many users assume that a higher block count on a content blocker means better protection. However, this is misleading. A high block count indicates *more network requests being blocked*, but it does **not** necessarily mean fewer connections to third-party remote servers.

In fact, a blocker with a higher block count may still allow connections to a greater number of distinct third-party domains, leading to more exposure, not less.

### How uBO Scope Clarifies Connection Transparency

Unlike content blockers, uBO Scope only observes and reports every connection a webpage attempts—whether allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

- The toolbar badge shows the number of *distinct third-party remote servers connected to* (i.e., not blocked).
- Real transparency comes from understanding which connections are allowed - since these are the ones fetching data from your browser.

Rather than relying on block counts, monitoring the badge count and the details in uBO Scope's popup helps users evaluate their true exposure to third-party servers.

## 2. Why "Ad Blocker Test" Sites are Unreliable

### Myth: "Ad blocker test" webpages show accurate blocker performance

Many people use specialized websites claiming to test ad blockers. These sites are:

- Making *fabricated* and *unrealistic* network requests that do not reflect realistic web browsing traffic.
- Unable to detect stealth blocking techniques that many content blockers use to avoid page breakage or being detected by the webpage.

### The Problem with Fabricated Network Requests

Ad blocker test websites generate scripted requests to domains unrelated to actual browsing behavior. This creates:

- False positives or negatives about blocking.
- Misleading results that don't represent how a blocker performs during real use.

### How uBO Scope Enables Real-World Insight

By reporting live network connections from genuine websites, uBO Scope reveals the actual third parties your browser connects to, regardless of blocking technique.

Using uBO Scope, you can:

- See the true number of third-party connections allowed by your content blocker.
- Differentiate between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.
- Avoid drawing conclusions based on artificial test sites.

## 3. How to Use uBO Scope for Better Evaluations

Follow this workflow to move beyond myths and gain transparency:

### Prerequisites

- Have uBO Scope installed and enabled on your supported browser (Chrome v122+, Firefox v128+, or Safari v18.5+).
- Familiarize yourself with the toolbar badge and popup interface.
- For installation instructions, see the [Installing and Enabling uBO Scope](../guides/getting-started/installation-basics) guide.

### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Real-World Webpage">
Navigate to any common website you frequently browse, rather than using an "ad blocker test" page.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon">
Observe the badge number indicating the count of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to on this tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the uBO Scope Popup Details">
Open the popup and view:
- **Not blocked**: domains accessed successfully.
- **Stealth-blocked**: domains blocked in ways that avoid detection by the webpage.
- **Blocked**: domains explicitly blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare Badge Counts Across Blockers or Settings">
Switch your content blocker configuration and repeat the steps to view how the badge counts and domain lists change, reflecting real impact.
</Step>
<Step title="Avoid Using Ad Blocker Test Sites">
Discard results from fake or test websites; rely on actual browsing behavior data from uBO Scope.
</Step>
</Steps>

### What to Expect

- A *lower* badge count means fewer distinct third-party connections allowed and typically better privacy.
- The popup sections provide comprehensive insight into your web traffic beyond just block counts.

## 4. Practical Example: Debunking a Common Misconception

Suppose two content blockers show these badges:

- Blocker A: badge count = 10
- Blocker B: badge count = 25

At first glance, Blocker B might seem better due to frequent blocking announcements. But using uBO Scope, you discover:

- Blocker A allows connections to 10 unique third-party domains.
- Blocker B, despite blocking more requests, still allows connections to 25 unique third-party domains.

Thus, Blocker A provides better actual protection, contradicting the block count myth.

## 5. Tips & Best Practices

- **Use uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blocker** to gain truthful insights.
- **Regularly monitor the badge count on active tabs** to identify unusual spikes or new third-party domains.
- **Understand the difference between block counts and allowed connection counts.** Focus on the badge count's meaning rather than the blocker’s self-reported statistics.
- **Do not trust ad blocker test sites** — they are usually inconclusive or misleading.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Mythbusting with uBO Scope">
<Accordion title="Why am I seeing unexpected third-party connections?">
Websites often load resources from multiple content delivery networks (CDNs) and tracking services legitimately. Use the popup to verify if connections are truly unwanted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="My badge count is always high, is something broken?">
uBO Scope counts distinct third-party domains connected in actual network traffic, which can be many on complex sites. Refer to [Interpreting Toolbar Badge Counts](/guides/practical-scenarios/interpreting-badge-counts) for guidance.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I test uBO Scope with ad blocker test websites?">
Avoid these test sites as they provide fabricated data. For real evaluation, use popular websites you trust or frequent visits.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some connections appear as stealth-blocked?">
Some content blockers use stealth techniques that hide blocking from the webpage. uBO Scope reveals these separately for accurate insights.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
