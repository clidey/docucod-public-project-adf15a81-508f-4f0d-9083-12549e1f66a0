# Making Sense of Badge Counts and Block Metrics

Understanding the numbers you see on the uBO Scope toolbar badge and in the extension's popup interface is crucial for gaining real insight into your browsing privacy and security. This guide clarifies what these counts mean, why fewer third-party connections generally indicate better privacy, and why simple block counts alone are not a reliable measure of protection.

---

## 1. What the Badge Count Represents

The badge number displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon shows the **number of distinct third-party domains** your current browser tab has connected to where the connection was **allowed** (i.e., not blocked).

- **Third-party domains** are remote servers different from the first-party domain of the webpage you are visiting.
- Each distinct domain is counted once, regardless of how many requests were made to it.
- A **lower badge count** is more desirable, as it means fewer third-party connections occurred, reducing potential privacy exposure.

### Why count third-party domains?
Tracking distinct third-party servers provides a more meaningful privacy metric than merely counting individual requests or their block status. This is because each third-party domain can represent a separate entity potentially tracking or profiling you.

<Check>
A badge showing '3' means the current tab has successfully connected to three distinct third-party domains.

## 2. Why Fewer Connections Are Generally Better

Every third-party connection introduces potential privacy and security risks:

- **Tracking and Profiling:** Third parties often collect data to build profiles for advertising or analytics.
- **Data Leakage:** Connections may expose your IP address and browsing patterns.
- **Security Risks:** Each connection is a potential attack surface.

Therefore, **reducing the number of distinct third-party domains connected to is a practical privacy goal**.

### What about legitimate third parties?
Not all third-party servers are inherently harmful; legitimate examples include Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) used to speed up site resources. Typically, legitimate third-party services are fewer in number.

## 3. Why Block Counts Alone Can Be Misleading

You may see block counts (the number of blocked network requests) in other content blockers. However, these are not reliable indicators of better privacy or security because:

- A **higher block count does not guarantee fewer third-party connections**. You might block many small requests but still end up connecting to many distinct third-party domains.
- It's possible for an extension to block many requests but allow connections to **more distinct third-party domains**, increasing potential tracking.
- Some blockers use stealth methods that don’t generate visible block counts but effectively prevent unwanted connections.

<uBOScope>debunks this myth by focusing on the actual number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected to, rather than raw block counts.</uBOScope>

## 4. How uBO Scope Categorizes Connections

The extension classifies network requests in three categories, visible in the popup UI and relevant to badge counts:

| Outcome           | Description                                                      | Effect on Badge Count |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Allowed**       | Requests that succeeded and connected to a third-party domain. | Counted in badge      |
| **Blocked**       | Requests that were blocked by content blockers or DNS filters.  | Not counted           |
| **Stealth-blocked** | Requests that were silently blocked or redirected (via stealth mechanisms). | Not counted    |

These categories help you understand exactly what kinds of network requests occurred and how many third-party domains remain connected.

## 5. Using the Popup Interface for Deeper Insight

uBO Scope’s popup provides a detailed, real-time breakdown:

- **Total distinct third-party domains connected** (matching the badge count).
- Lists of domains for each connection outcome (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked).
- Counts per domain showing how many requests succeeded or were blocked.

### How to interpret domain counts:

- Domains with a high count have more requests and potentially greater influence.
- Seeing many domains listed under **allowed** suggests a higher privacy risk.
- Domains under **blocked** and **stealth-blocked** indicate the effectiveness of your blocking tools.

Visit the popup immediately after loading a webpage to get a snapshot of third-party activity and understand how your privacy tools are performing in real time.

## 6. Practical Tips for Evaluating Your Privacy Posture

- **Aim for a low badge count.** Every distinct third-party domain allowed represents a privacy consideration.
- **Use the popup details to identify suspicious domains** you may want to block manually or by updating filter lists.
- **Don’t rely on block counts alone.** The true measure is how many *distinct* third parties you connect to.
- **Observe changes over time.** If the badge count suddenly spikes, it can indicate new tracking or ad domains on a website.
- **Combine with content blockers wisely.** uBO Scope works alongside blockers and DNS filters to give you the most transparent connection picture.

## 7. Common Misunderstandings and How uBO Scope Clarifies Them

| Myth or Pain Point                              | How uBO Scope Clarifies                                       |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| More blocks = better privacy                    | High block counts can coincide with higher third-party domains connected; uBO Scope reports actual domains. |
| Ad blocker test pages reflect real blocker effectiveness | These test pages make unrealistic network requests; uBO Scope reports actual traffic from everyday browsing. |
| Block counts alone show blocker reliability     | Only distinct third-party domains really matter for privacy; raw block counts don’t reveal this. |

## 8. Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues

If you notice the badge count does not appear or seems stuck:

- Make sure permissions for `webRequest` are granted and the extension is enabled.
- Refresh or reload the tab to force update.
- Verify you are on a standard webpage and not a browser page or blank tab.
- Check if other content blockers or system DNS filters interfere; uBO Scope aggregates data from all.

For detailed troubleshooting, refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](./getting-started/configuring-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-setup.md) guide.

## 9. Summary

Understanding badge counts and connection statistics is essential for making informed privacy decisions.

- The badge number indicates **distinct allowed third-party domains** connected.
- Fewer connections generally mean better privacy.
- Block counts alone are insufficient metrics; focus on the number of unique third-party servers.
- Use the popup to gain a detailed view of who’s connected and who was blocked.

### Example Scenario

Imagine visiting a news website;
- The badge shows “5”. This means your browser successfully connected to 5 different third-party servers, such as ad networks, analytics providers, or CDNs.
- Opening the popup reveals 2 allowed domains are well-known CDNs, while 3 belong to trackers blocked on other sites.
- If the same site shows a badge of “10” next visit, privacy risk has increased due to more third-party connections.
- Use this insight to adjust blocking filters or revisit privacy settings.

Your badge count is your real-time privacy score. Keep it low to keep your browsing safer and more private.
