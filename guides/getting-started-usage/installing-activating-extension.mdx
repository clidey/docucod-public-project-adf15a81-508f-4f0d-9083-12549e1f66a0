## 2. Step-by-Step Installation and Activation

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Your Browser's Extension Store">
Navigate to your browser’s official extension/add-ons store:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Brave): Go to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)
- **Firefox:** Go to [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/)
- **Safari:** Access the Mac App Store and search for Safari extensions or use Safari’s Extensions pane
</Step>

<Step title="Search for 'uBO Scope'">
In the store search box enter 'uBO Scope' to find the official extension maintained by Raymond Hill.

Look for the icon (various sizes from 16x16 to 128x128 pixels) and name "uBlock Origin Scope" or "uBO Scope".
</Step>

<Step title="Install the Extension">
Click the "Add to Browser" or "Install" button to begin installation.

Confirm any permission prompts:

- uBO Scope requests permissions for `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage` to monitor network activity and store session data.
- It requires host permissions for `http://*/*`, `https://*/*` (and WebSocket URLs on compatible browsers).

Accept these to enable full functionality.
</Step>

<Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Icon in Your Browser Toolbar">
After installation, find the uBO Scope icon near your browser’s address bar, usually to the right side.

- The icon displays a badge showing a number indicating distinct third-party domains your browser connected to.
- If the icon is hidden, use the browser’s extension/toolbar management to pin or make it visible.
</Step>

<Step title="Activate the Extension and Verify Permissions">
Depending on browser, you may be asked to activate the extension or grant final permissions:

- Confirm any popups requesting permission to access site data or tabs.
- In some browsers, reload tabs for the extension to start monitoring.
</Step>

<Step title="Visit Some Webpages to Trigger Monitoring">
Open a new tab and browse a few commonly visited websites.

The uBO Scope badge number will update in real-time reflecting the distinct third-party servers contacted.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the Popup Panel for Detailed Insight">
Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup panel.

- You will see a summary count and lists of domains categorized as "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", or "blocked".
- This verifies the extension is capturing and classifying network requests.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Functionality with First Validation">
Confirm the badge updates appropriately and the popup lists domains.

If counts remain empty or the icon disappears:

- Ensure permissions are granted.
- Reload the tab or restart the browser.
- Refer to troubleshooting guides if problems persist.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Understanding the Extension Icon and Badge

- **Extension Icon Location:** Usually right of the address bar next to other extensions.
- **Badge Meaning:** Displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to on the active tab.
- **Lower Badge Number Is Better:** It generally indicates fewer third-party connections, which often suggests better privacy.

<Info>
The badge count differs from content blocker block counts. uBO Scope reports unique third-party domains connected, offering independent visibility into network traffic.
</Info>

---

## 4. Tips and Best Practices

- **Pin the Extension Icon:** Keep it visible for easy access and realtime insight.
- **Grant All Permissions:** Without `webRequest` and host permissions, uBO Scope cannot monitor network requests.
- **Browse Multiple Sites:** uBO Scope tracks connections per tab, so exploring different pages will populate distinct domain data.
- **Use in Conjunction with Content Blockers:** Verify what third-parties are truly loaded despite blockers.

## Appendix: Manifest Permissions Summary (For Advanced Users)

The extension requires the following permissions to operate correctly:

- `webRequest`, to listen and log all network requests.
- `activeTab`, to access the current active tab URL.
- `storage`, to save session and configuration data.
- Host permissions covering all HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket URLs (varies by browser).

This enables uBO Scope to monitor, classify, and report third-party connections accurately.
