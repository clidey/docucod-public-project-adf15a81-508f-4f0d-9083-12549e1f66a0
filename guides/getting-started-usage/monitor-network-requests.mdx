# Monitoring and Analyzing Network Requests with uBO Scope

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide leads you through monitoring and analyzing all network requests a webpage makes using the uBO Scope extension. It shows you how real-time connection attempts and their outcomes are captured, categorized, and presented, helping you identify third-party servers involved in the page load regardless of your content blocker.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed on a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Extension permissions granted, including `webRequest` and host access.
- A webpage loaded in the active browser tab that you want to analyze.

### Expected Outcome
By completing this guide, you will understand how uBO Scope tracks all network requests for the active tab, categorize requests into allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked outcomes, and view detailed domain statistics in the popup panel. This empowers you to assess potential privacy risks by identifying which third-party servers your browser connects to.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 5–10 minutes to observe the extension’s behavior on a website and learn to interpret results.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope and Navigate to a Webpage
- Ensure uBO Scope is active by verifying its icon appears in your browser toolbar.
- Visit the website you wish to monitor in a new browser tab.
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup panel.

**Expected Result:** The popup panel loads and displays the domain of the active tab.

---

### Step 2: Understanding the Popup Panel Sections
The popup divides information into three domain categories:
- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which network requests succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains involved in redirects or stealth blocking mechanisms.
- **Blocked:** Domains from which requests were blocked due to errors or filtering.

Each section lists domains with a badge showing how many requests to that domain occurred.

**Tip:** Allowed domains represent actual third-party connections your browser made.

---

### Step 3: Monitoring Network Request Outcomes in Real-Time
- As you browse, uBO Scope listens to network activity using browser `webRequest` APIs.
- It records events like successes, redirects, and errors.
- These outcomes get associated with domains and summarized in the popup.

**Expected Result:** The badge count on the toolbar updates to indicate how many unique allowed third-party domains the page connected to.

---

### Step 4: Interpreting Domain Counts and Outcomes
- The badge shows the number of unique allowed domains; a smaller number often means fewer third parties contacted.
- Check each section to see which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked (redirects intercepted), or fully blocked.
- This helps you distinguish legitimate CDNs from trackers or problematic domains.

**Decision Point:** Consider whether the connected domains align with your privacy expectations or raise concerns.

---

### Step 5: Inspecting Detailed Domain Data
- Domains are grouped and sorted by frequency.
- Hover over or note domains with high request counts.
- Use this insight to investigate any suspicious domain external to your site.

**Verification:** Confirm the domain names are resolved accurately using the displayed public suffix list normalization (e.g., `example.com`).

---

### Step 6: Refresh and Observe Changes
- Reload the webpage to see updated connection counts and domain outcomes.
- Note any new domains appear or if previously blocked domains become allowed (or vice versa).

**Expected Outcome:** You observe consistent, real-time reflection of network connections and filtering changes.

## Real-World Example

Suppose you visit an online news site.
- Open uBO Scope popup.
- See a badge count of "7" indicating 7 unique third-party domains allowed.
- Popup lists domains such as `cdn.examplecdn.com` under allowed, `tracker.adsnetwork.com` under stealth-blocked, and `malicious.example.net` under blocked.
- This lets you instantly know that while many connections were allowed, one unusual domain was blocked, highlighting protective behavior.


## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Popup shows "NO DATA":** The active tab might not have network requests tracked yet. Refresh the page and ensure permissions are properly assigned.
- **Badge count not updating:** Confirm uBO Scope has `webRequest` and host permissions and that no browser restrictions block its background processing.
- **Domain data looks incomplete:** Some browser or network configurations may bypass `webRequest` API, limiting reporting.

### Best Practices
- Regularly refresh the page and popup to capture recent network activities.
- Be mindful that a higher blocked count does not necessarily mean better privacy, as allowed third-party domain count is the key indicator.
- Use the categorized sections to focus on potentially unwanted connections.

### Performance Considerations
- The extension batches network events and updates the popup and badge with a small delay (~1 second) to remain performant without overwhelming the browser.

### Alternative Approaches
- Complement uBO Scope monitoring with content blocker logs if available, but rely on uBO Scope’s third-party domain counts for clarity.
