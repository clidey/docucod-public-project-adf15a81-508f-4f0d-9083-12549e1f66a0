# Installing and Enabling uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide walks you through installing uBO Scope on supported browsers, enabling the extension, and verifying it's fully operational for real-time monitoring of your browser's network connections.

With uBO Scope active, you gain transparent insight into third-party remote server connections your browser makes, helping you evaluate your browsing privacy.

---

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure the following:

- **Supported Browser**:
  - Google Chrome version 122 or higher
  - Mozilla Firefox version 128 or higher
  - Safari version 18.5 or higher

- **Basic Permissions**: The extension requires permissions for `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and `storage`.

- **Network Availability**: Your browser must be online, as uBO Scope fetches a Public Suffix List and monitors live network activity.

- **Extension Store Access** (recommended): Access to Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari Extensions Gallery for straightforward installation.


## Expected Outcome
After completing this guide, uBO Scope will be installed and enabled in your browser. You will see its icon in the toolbar, with an active badge reflecting network monitoring status, ready for you to reveal and analyze third-party connections.


## Time Estimate
Approximately 5 to 10 minutes, depending on browser and user familiarity with extension installation.

</Tip>


### Step 2: Enable the Extension

After installation:

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It should show the extension's logo.
2. If the icon is hidden, follow your browser’s instructions to pin it to the toolbar:
   - In Chrome, click the Extensions puzzle icon and pin uBO Scope.
   - In Firefox, use the toolbar customization menu.

3. Confirm the extension is enabled by opening the browser’s extensions/add-ons management page.


### Step 3: Verify Permissions and Setup

uBO Scope requires certain permissions to run effectively:

- **WebRequest API Access**: Needed to monitor network requests.
- **Storage Access**: To save session data for ongoing analysis.
- **ActiveTab Permission**: To interact with the current browser tab.

Verify these permissions were accepted during installation.

<Tip>
Most browsers automatically grant requested permissions during extension installation, but double-check in your extension settings if unsure.
</Tip>


### Step 4: Confirm uBO Scope is Monitoring

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar to open its popup interface.
2. The popup will display the current tab’s hostname and summary of connected domains.
3. Visit or refresh various websites and watch the domain counts update in real time.

<Tip>
A lower count means fewer third-party remote servers were contacted, which is typically preferable for privacy.
</Tip>

<Check>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or appears empty for an active browsing session, try refreshing the page or restarting your browser.
</Check>


### Step 5: (Optional) Manual Installation for Advanced Users

If you prefer to install uBO Scope manually or are developing from source:

1. Clone or download the repository from [https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
2. Use the provided platform scripts (`tools/make-package.sh`, `tools/make-firefox.sh`) to build the extension package.
3. Load the unpacked extension in your browser's developer mode (Extensions > Load unpacked).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Installation and Activation Issues">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Icon Not Visible">
Check if the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions manager and pinned to the toolbar. Restart the browser if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or NO DATA Message">
Ensure you have granted all permissions and the current tab is a valid website URL (not a blank tab). Try refreshing the webpage to trigger network monitoring.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
Check if content blocking extensions or firewall software might interfere with network request monitoring. uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API, which may be restricted by other tools.
</Accordion>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep uBO Scope Updated**: Install updates promptly to benefit from fixes and enhancements.
- **Visit Real-World Websites**: To get meaningful network connection data, interact with frequently updated websites.
- **Understand the Badge**: The toolbar badge reflects the number of unique third-party domains contacted — aim for lower counts for better privacy.
