# Interpreting the Toolbar Badge & Popup Categories

## Overview
This guide helps you understand the meaning behind the toolbar badge number and the domain categories shown in uBO Scope's popup UI. You will learn how to interpret the three connection outcomes — **Not Blocked**, **Stealth-Blocked**, and **Blocked** — that appear as domain categories, the difference between allowed and blocked remote servers, and why a low badge count is your privacy goal. This knowledge empowers you to make sense of what uBO Scope reveals about network requests from visited webpages.

## 1. What This Page Helps You Achieve

- **Understanding the badge count**: What does the number displayed on the toolbar icon represent?
- **Distinguishing domain categories**: Learn what the 'Not Blocked', 'Stealth-Blocked', and 'Blocked' categories mean in the popup.
- **Clarifying allowed vs. blocked connections**: Understand the significance of allowed and blocked remote servers.
- **Dispelling common misconceptions**: Avoid confusion about what badge counts and categories imply.
- **Recognizing implications of low badge counts**: Why fewer active third-party servers is a desirable state.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you dive into this guide, ensure you have:

- Installed the uBO Scope extension in your browser and granted the necessary permissions.
- Opened a webpage with uBO Scope active.
- Familiarity with basic browsing and recognizing remote domains.

If you have not completed these, see the [Installation & Setup](../installation-setup/installation-multiple-platforms) and [Getting Your First Results](../first-use-validation/getting-your-first-results) guides.

## 3. How to Read the Toolbar Badge

### What the Badge Number Represents

- The toolbar badge number shows the **count of unique third-party remote server domains that your current tab has successfully connected to and were not blocked**.
- This is **not** a block count — it reports allowed remote domains regardless of any content blocking you may have.
- If the badge is empty or zero, it means no third-party remote servers have been contacted or all such requests were blocked.

### Why the Badge Count Matters

- A **lower badge count means fewer distinct third-party servers are contacted**, which generally equates to better privacy and less tracking exposure.
- Aim for the lowest possible badge count while maintaining full functionality of the webpage.

<Info>
Remember: Not all third-party servers are malicious or trackers. Many are legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics platforms, or essential services.
</Info>

## 4. Understanding the Popup Categories

When clicking the toolbar icon, the popup shows connections grouped into three categories:

### 4.1 Not Blocked

- **Definition**: Domains successfully connected to without interference.
- **What it means**: These remote servers allowed resource downloads or network communications.
- **What you see**: A list of these domains with a count indicating how many times each was contacted.

### 4.2 Stealth-Blocked

- **Definition**: Domains that were redirected or prevented from tracking without outright blocking.
- **What it means**: The extension or browser blocked these in a 'stealth' manner to avoid revealing blocking activity, often to prevent webpage breakage or detection by anti-adblock measures.
- **What you see**: Domains that had attempts to connect but were silently intercepted.

### 4.3 Blocked

- **Definition**: Domains that were blocked explicitly, preventing any connection to them.
- **What it means**: These domains represent network requests that were stopped entirely by uBO Scope or other content blocking mechanisms.
- **What you see**: A list of domains where connection attempts failed or ended as errors.

<Note>
The distinction between stealth-blocked and blocked helps you see not just what was blocked, but how blocking was applied.
</Note>

---

## 5. Practical Interpretation

When you observe the popup:

- **If a domain is in the Not Blocked list, it means your browser fetched resources or data from it during page load.**

- **If a domain appears in Blocked or Stealth-Blocked lists, uBO Scope detected attempts to connect that were prevented or redirected.**

- The badge count reflects only domains in the Not Blocked category.

- Domains can appear in multiple categories over time if connection outcomes change due to navigation or content blocking policies.

### Example Scenario

Say you visit a news website:

- The badge might show "5", meaning 5 unique third-party domains loaded content successfully.
- Popup shows:
  - Not Blocked: `cdn.example.com`, `analytics.example.net`
  - Stealth-Blocked: `tracker.example.org`
  - Blocked: `ads.example.com`

You understand that your privacy is partially protected, with some trackers stealth-blocked or blocked, and content delivery proceeding normally.

## 6. Common Misconceptions Clarified

<AccordionGroup title="Common Misconceptions About Badge Counts and Popup Categories">
<Accordion title="Is a Higher Block Count Better?">
A higher block count in fact does not necessarily mean better protection. It might mean your browser still connects to more unique third-party servers and is blocking more DNS or requests on them, but allowing more overall connections. The badge reports allowed (successful) connections — fewer is better.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does the Badge Count Include First-Party Domains?">
No. The badge reflects the number of unique third-party remote server domains. First-party connections to the main site are not counted in the toolbar badge.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are all Third-Party Connections Bad?">
No. Many third-party connections are necessary for site functionality, including CDNs and critical external services. uBO Scope helps you see what is contacted so you can make an informed judgment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What Does It Mean if the Badge Count is Zero?">
A zero or empty badge means no third-party remote server connections were recorded for the tab or all were blocked. This might occur on very isolated or simple webpages, or when heavy blocking is in place.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Best Practices and Tips

- Regularly monitor the toolbar badge as you browse — aim for consistently low or zero counts on privacy-critical sites.
- Use the popup categories to diagnose unexpected connections and refine your content-blocking strategies.
- Recognize that some stealth-blocked domains may still trigger requests invisibly — the distinction helps understand what your blocker accomplishes without breaking sites.
- When in doubt, compare badge counts and popup lists across different sites and sessions to build familiarity.

<Check>
Aim for a low badge count but also consistent with full webpage functionality. Large counts may indicate privacy exposure or many third-party requests.
</Check>

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 8.1 Badge Does Not Update

- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and has required permissions.
- Try refreshing the webpage to regenerate network requests.
- Verify your browser's `webRequest` API is supported and functional.

### 8.2 Popup Shows No Data

- Check if the tab has loaded any remote content.
- Confirm uBO Scope is active on the current site.
- Try visiting different webpages with rich content.

### 8.3 Unexpected Domains in Not Blocked List

- These might be legitimate third parties or CDN providers; check domain reputations.
- Use the popup categories to cross-reference stealth or blocked domains.

<Warning>
The extension relies on browser APIs to report network activity; some environments or private browsing modes might limit data.
</Warning>

# Appendix

### Example of Domain Categories Displayed in Popup

```plaintext
   domains connected: 7

   NOT BLOCKED
   cdn.example.com      3
   fonts.google.com     2

   STEALTH-BLOCKED
   tracker.site.net     4

   BLOCKED
   ads.adnetwork.com    5
```

This example shows seven unique domains contacted with counts per domain, categorized by connection outcome.

---

### uBO Scope Badge Number Note
- The badge number represents the count of unique **allowed** third-party domains (domains under “Not Blocked”).
- Blocked or stealth-blocked domains are not counted here but appear in the popup’s respective categories.
