# What the Badge Number Means (and Doesn't)

Understanding the toolbar badge number in uBO Scope is crucial for interpreting what the extension reports about your web browsing activity. This guide clarifies the exact meaning of the badge count, addresses common misconceptions, and explains how it relates to your privacy and the behavior of third-party connections.

---

## Overview

The badge number in uBO Scope does **not** represent the total number of network requests, the number of blocked connections, or the number of requests processed by other content blockers. Instead, it reflects the number of **distinct third-party remote servers** to which your browser has connected while viewing a given tab.

This section explains why a lower badge count is generally better, what it tells you about your privacy posture, and why it should not be confused with other commonly misunderstood metrics.

## Key Concepts Behind the Badge Number

### What the Badge Number Represents

- The badge shows the count of **unique third-party domains** your browser connected to during the life of the active tab.
- Third-party domains are remote servers different from the site you are visiting directly.
- Each distinct domain counts only once, regardless of how many requests were made to it.

### What the Badge Number Does *Not* Represent

- It is **not** a count of blocked requests.
- It does **not** include internal or first-party servers.
- It does **not** indicate how many connections a content blocker or filter list has blocked or allowed.
- It does **not** reflect the total number of network connections or requests made by the browser.

### Why Lower Counts Are Preferable

- A lower badge count suggests fewer third-party connections, which generally means:
  - Reduced tracking surface
  - Better privacy protection
  - Fewer external resource fetches that may affect page performance or security
- While not all third-party connections are malicious or harmful—some belong to legitimate services such as CDNs—excessive connections often indicate reduced privacy.

## Practical Examples

Consider you open a news website in a tab:

- The **first-party domain** is the news site's primary domain.
- During page load, your browser attempts connections to various third-party domains for analytics, ads, fonts, or media.
- uBO Scope inspects these connections and groups them by outcome:
  - **Allowed**: Connections successfully made and reached.
  - **Blocked**: Requests actively blocked or failed.
  - **Stealth-blocked**: Redirected or filtered connections not explicitly reported by other blockers.

The badge count on the extension icon corresponds to the number of unique allowed third-party domains.

## Understanding the Privacy Implication

The badge count provides a **transparent glimpse** into your browsing privacy:

- If the count is high, more third parties are observing your activity.
- If the count is low or zero, only the visited site (and few or no third parties) were contacted.

This insight is useful to:

- Evaluate how well your content blockers are restricting external connections.
- Compare privacy impact across browsing sessions or different filter lists.
- Detect unusual or unexpected third-party connections on a page.

## Common Misconceptions

### Myth 1: Higher block counts mean better blocking

- A content blocker might report a high number of blocked requests but still allow many unique third-party connections.
- uBO Scope reveals that allowing many distinct third-party domains can be a bigger privacy risk than the sheer number of blocked requests.

### Myth 2: "Ad blocker test" pages measure blocker effectiveness

- These test pages often create artificial requests that don't reflect real-world browsing.
- They also can't detect stealth blocking techniques used by modern content blockers.
- uBO Scope can show actual third-party domains contacted, giving a more accurate picture.

## How uBO Scope Computes the Badge Number

1. The extension listens to all network requests using browser APIs.
2. It categorizes requests by their outcome: allowed, blocked, stealth.
3. For the active tab, it counts unique allowed third-party domains.
4. The badge on the toolbar reflects this number dynamically.

## Tips for Using the Badge Effectively

- Use the badge as a quick privacy check while browsing.
- Open the popup to see details on allowed, blocked, and stealth domains.
- Pay attention to spikes in badge count when visiting unfamiliar sites.
- Combine badge monitoring with filter list tuning to reduce unwanted third-party connections.

---

## Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues

- **Badge not updating:** Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and has necessary permissions (activeTab, webRequest).
- **Count too high:** Investigate domains listed in the popup for legitimacy.
- **Unexpected zero count:** Some connections may occur outside browser instrumentation and won’t be reported.

## Summary

The uBO Scope badge number is a **concise indicator of distinct third-party remote servers connected during browsing**. It prioritizes privacy awareness by spotlighting unique domains accessed, helping you evaluate your exposure and the effectiveness of your content blockers. Understanding what the badge shows facilitates smarter browsing choices and better privacy management.
