# Monitoring Third-Party Network Connections with uBO Scope

## Overview

This guide walks you through how to effectively monitor third-party network connections on any webpage using uBO Scope. You will learn how to open the extension's popup panel, interpret the connection count displayed on the browser toolbar badge, and understand the distinctions between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.

By the end, you will be able to visualize which third-party domains your browser communicates with — a key step in assessing privacy exposure and content blocker performance.

---

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope must be installed and activated in your Chromium-based, Firefox, or Safari browser. Refer to the [Installation on Supported Browsers](https://your-docs-site/guides/getting-started-usage/installing-activating-extension) guide.
- Ensure that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions granted (webRequest, activeTab, storage).
- You should have visited at least one website in an active browser tab.

---

## Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will:

- Open uBO Scope’s popup to see detailed network connection data for the active tab.
- Understand what the badge count on the uBO Scope icon represents.
- Differentiate between connections categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Locate the uBO Scope Icon on Your Browser Toolbar

- After installation, the uBO Scope icon appears on your browser's toolbar, typically near the address bar.
- The icon displays a numeric badge; this number reflects how many **distinct third-party domains** your browser has connected to on the current tab.

<Check>
If you do not see the icon, verify the installation or toolbar customization settings in your browser.
</Check>

### 2. Observe the Toolbar Badge Count

- The badge count indicates the **number of unique third-party remote servers connected**.
- A **lower count** is generally better as it signifies fewer third-party connections.
- Note that the count only includes **third-party domains**, not the first-party domain of the website you are visiting.

<Tip>
Remember: The badge count is about domains contacted, not the number of requests. Multiple requests to the same domain count once.
</Tip>

### 3. Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup.
- The popup shows detailed connection statistics for the active tab.

### 4. Understand the Popup Panel Layout

The popup panel contains three main sections under the current tab host information:

- **Not Blocked:** Lists third-party domains your browser connected to successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Shows domains where connections were stealthily blocked (hidden blocking to avoid webpage breakage).
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.

Each domain entry includes the domain name and a count of how many connections or requests were made.

### 5. Interpret Allowed, Stealth, and Blocked Connections

| Connection Status | Description | What You Should Do |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Allowed (Not Blocked)** | Connections to third-party domains that successfully retrieved resources or established connections. | Review to identify necessary or suspicious connections. Lower counts are desirable. |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Connections blocked in a way that prevents detection by webpages but still effectively blocks unwanted content. | Understand this as subtle blocking to avoid breaking sites or alerting trackers. |
| **Blocked** | Connections explicitly blocked by the browser or content blocker. | Review to confirm blocking is working as expected. Unintended blocks may cause site issues. |

### 6. Using the Domain Counts

- Large counts next to specific domains indicate repeated connections.
- Regularly seeing unknown or undesired domains here can signify privacy or security risks.
- Use this insight to adjust your content blocking strategies or filter lists.

### 7. Refresh and Monitor Changes

- Reload the webpage or navigate to different sites to see updated connection counts and domains.
- Observe how changes in browsing behavior or content blockers impact these statistics.

## Practical Examples

### Example: Monitoring a News Website

1. Open your browser and go to a popular news site.
2. Observe the uBO Scope badge count; it shows the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
3. Click the icon to open the popup.
4. Review the Not Blocked section for legitimate CDNs or advertising domains.
5. Check Stealth-Blocked and Blocked sections for domains that your blockers have suppressed.

### Example: Diagnosing Unexpected High Connections

- If you see a high badge number, open the popup.
- Compare domains listed to known trackers or ads.
- Use the insights to adjust filter lists or blocking settings.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="The uBO Scope Icon Does Not Appear">
- Confirm the extension is installed and enabled.
- Check your browser’s toolbar customization and add the icon manually if hidden.
- Restart the browser if needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Remains Empty or Zero">
- Ensure you have navigated to a website page (the extension tracks per active tab).
- Refresh the page to trigger network requests.
- Verify the extension has all required permissions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Sections">
- This can indicate no network requests have been recorded for the tab.
- Reload the page and wait a few seconds.
- Check privacy or security settings that might block monitoring (e.g., private browsing modes may affect data).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
uBO Scope provides insight independent of your content blocker. Use it to cross-check your blocker’s effectiveness.
</Tip>

<Tip>
The badge number corresponds only to **distinct domains** contacted, not the total number of requests.
</Tip>
