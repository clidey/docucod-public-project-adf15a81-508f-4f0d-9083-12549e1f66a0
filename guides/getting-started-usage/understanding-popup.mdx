# Exploring the Popup: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Domains

## Overview
The uBO Scope popup provides a real-time, detailed snapshot of all third-party domains connected by the active browser tab. This guide demystifies the popup interface, explaining how to interpret the lists of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains. You will learn how to use this information effectively to understand your browsing connections and enhance privacy awareness.

---

## What the Popup Shows

The popup displays information for the currently active browser tab, divided into three categories based on the outcome of network requests:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked)**: Domains of third-party connections successfully completed.
- **Blocked**: Domains whose connections were prevented by content blockers or errors.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains that were redirected or stealthily blocked, typically to avoid detection by websites.

Additionally, the popup shows the total count of distinct third-party domains connected (allowed only) as reflected by the badge on the extension icon.

---

## How to Access the Popup

1. Navigate to any website in your browser.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon on the toolbar.
3. The popup will open, displaying domain connection information specific to the active tab.

<Tip>
Make sure the tab is fully loaded or refreshed to see the most accurate and current domain data.

## Understanding the Domain Lists

### Allowed Domains
- **Definition:** These are domains for which one or more network requests were successfully made.
- **Display:** Each domain is listed with the count of how many connections have been established.
- **Use Case:** Reviewing allowed domains helps you identify what third-party services your current website is actually connecting to.

### Blocked Domains
- **Definition:** These domains represent requests that failed due to blocking by content filters or network errors.
- **Display:** Listed with counts of blocked connection attempts.
- **Use Case:** Tracking blocked domains confirms your blocking tools are active and informs you about attempted third-party connections.

### Stealth Domains
- **Definition:** Domains associated with network requests that were redirected or stealth-blocked to prevent detection by the visited website.
- **Display:** Listed with counts like other sections.
- **Use Case:** Useful for filter list maintainers or privacy researchers to understand subtle blocking behavior.

---

## How to Interpret the Counts and Domain Names

- **Counts:** Each domain row shows the number of times a connection was attempted or succeeded. Higher counts indicate more frequent communication.
- **Domain Name Display:** Domains are presented in Unicode format (human-readable), converted from punycode if necessary.
- **Hostname vs Domain:** The popup groups requests by their registrable domain (base domain) rather than exact hostnames.

---

## Practical Tips for Using the Popup

1. **Identify Third-Party Services:** Compare allowed domains against known service providers to detect tracking, analytics, or ad networks.
2. **Verify Blocker Effectiveness:** Use the blocked and stealth lists to confirm that unwanted connections are being stopped.
3. **Analyze Suspicious Activity:** Unusually high counts or unexpected domains in the allowed list may require further investigation.
4. **Monitor Changes Over Time:** Reload websites with different content blockers to see how domain lists update in real time.

<Tip>
Use the popup in tandem with the badge count—while the badge shows overall allowed third-party domain count, the popup details provide clarity behind those numbers.

## Step-by-Step: Using the Popup to Inspect Website Connections

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click on the extension icon in your browser toolbar while visiting a website.
</Step>
<Step title="View the Tab Hostname">
Review the header showing the current tab’s hostname and domain for confirmation.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Domain Count Summary">
Look at the summary section to see the total number of distinct allowed third-party domains connected.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Allowed Domains">
Scroll through the 'not blocked' list to see all domains contacted successfully and their request counts.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Inspect the 'stealth-blocked' list, seeing domains with redirected or subtle blocked requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Blocked Domains">
Look at the 'blocked' list to identify failed or blocked connection attempts.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Insights">
Use the gathered data to make informed decisions about privacy or filter lists.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Common Scenarios & Examples

### Example 1: Spotting Legitimate CDN Domains
A popular news website loads images and scripts from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) domain, such as `cdn.examplecdn.com`. You will find this domain under **Allowed Domains** with a count indicating how many times it was contacted successfully.

### Example 2: Detecting Tracker Domains
If ad or tracking domains like `track.adnetwork.com` appear under **Allowed**, it means these trackers were allowed by your current blocker settings.

### Example 3: Seeing Blocked Ad Domains
If `ads.badads.com` shows up under **Blocked**, your content blocker is effectively blocking network requests to that domain.

### Example 4: Identifying Stealth Blocking
Domains listed under **Stealth** may be the result of redirects or advanced blocking techniques designed to hide blocking activity from the website.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues"> 
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or No Domains"> 
Check that the active tab has fully loaded a website and that network requests have been made.
Refresh the tab and re-open the popup.
Verify extension permissions and that no other extension conflicts exist.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Doesn't Match Popup"> 
The badge count indicates unique allowed third-party domains, while the popup divides domains into allowed, blocked, and stealth.
Make sure you interpret the badge specifically as the allowed domain count only.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Names Appear as Punycode"> 
The popup converts punycode to Unicode for readability, but in rare edge cases some domains might appear encoded.
This does not affect functionality.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Update When Navigating Tabs"> 
If switching tabs does not update popup data, close and reopen the popup.
Reload the tab to ensure data capture.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

- Frequently use the popup to remain aware of active third-party connections during browsing sessions.
- Combine insights from allowed, blocked, and stealth lists to build a nuanced understanding of your privacy exposure.
- Utilize the data for troubleshooting unexpected content blocker behavior or suspicious domain connections.
- For advanced users, use the stealth list to assist in filter list maintenance and enhancement.
