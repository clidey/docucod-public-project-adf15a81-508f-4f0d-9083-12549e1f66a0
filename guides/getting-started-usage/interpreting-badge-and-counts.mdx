# Interpreting the Toolbar Badge and Domain Counts

## 1. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

When you install and enable uBO Scope, you will notice a badge on the browser toolbar icon. This badge displays a **number representing the count of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to on the active tab**.

### What the Badge Represents

- The badge number counts **unique third-party remote servers** contacted.
- It reflects **allowed connections**, meaning resources your browser successfully fetched.
- The badge **excludes blocked or stealth-blocked domains**.
- A **lower badge count is better for your privacy**, indicating fewer third-party servers were contacted.

### Why Focus on Third-Party Domains?

Third-party domains are external servers not owned by the site you are visiting. They often include advertising networks, analytics platforms, content delivery networks, and trackers.

Reducing third-party connections:

- Minimizes potential privacy leaks.
- Reduces tracking across websites.
- Helps understand which sites load many external resources.

<Tip>
If the badge shows zero or a very low number, it generally means your browser is making very few third-party connections, which aligns with better privacy.
</Tip>

## 2. Domain Counts Explained

uBO Scope organizes connected domains into three categories visible in the popup:

- **Allowed**: Domains your browser successfully connected to.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Domains that were blocked in a way designed to hide the block.
- **Blocked**: Domains whose connections were explicitly blocked.

The badge count reflects the size of the **Allowed domains** set, essentially how many unique third-party servers loaded resources.

### Reading the Domain List in the Popup

- Domains are grouped and listed with a **count of connection requests**.
- Counts show how many requests succeeded per domain.
- Allowed domains are usually visible in green-highlighted sections.
- Stealth-blocked and blocked domains appear in red sections but do not affect the badge count.

## 3. Making Sense of the Indicator During Browsing

### Scenario: Viewing a Simple Webpage

- You visit a news article with minimal external resources.
- The badge might show a small number, such as **3**.
- This means your browser connected to the primary website plus three distinct third-party servers.

### Scenario: Visiting a Complex Site

- Browsing an advertising-heavy page may show a badge of **15 or more**.
- This indicates many third parties are contacted, potentially including trackers.

### Scenario: Using Content Blocking

- If you use content blockers (such as uBlock Origin), expect the badge to reflect only domains allowed through your filters.
- The badge helps you verify **how many unique third-party servers still succeed** after blocking.

## 4. Practical Tips for Using the Badge as a Privacy Metric

- **Use the badge as a quick proxy** for third-party exposure on each tab.
- Refresh pages to see changes in badge count due to dynamic content.
- Examine the popup list for detailed domain info, combining visual and numeric cues.
- A sudden badge increase could indicate unexpected third-party connections.

<Warning>
The badge count is **not a direct indicator of the total number of blocked requests**. It shows successful connections only.

Avoid assuming that a higher blocker count in another tool means better privacy; focus on the distinct allowed third-party domains.
</Warning>

## 5. Common Misconceptions About the Badge

| Myth | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| "A higher block count means better blocking" | The badge shows distinct allowed third-party domains, which is a stronger privacy metric than counts of blocked requests. |
| "Badge count equals total third parties contacted" | The badge omits blocked or stealth-blocked domains; it only counts allowed connections. |
| "Ad blocker test pages are reliable for judging blockers" | Such tests create artificial network requests and don’t reflect real-world browsing scenarios; the badge reflects actual browsing data. |

## 6. Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues

### Badge Not Updating or Stuck

- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and has correct permissions.
- Reload the page or open a new tab to reset data.
- Restart the browser if needed.

### Badge Shows Unexpectedly High or Low Counts

- Check the popup to see which domains are reported.
- If many legitimate third-party domains are shown (e.g., CDN providers), this is expected.
- If unexpectedly high, consider running with additional blocker filters.

<Tip>
Regularly checking badge counts alongside popup details gives the most complete picture of your browser’s network interactions.
</Tip>

## 7. Summary

The uBO Scope toolbar badge is a powerful, simple indicator of your browser’s third-party connections on any active tab. By understanding that it counts unique allowed third-party domains, you can better assess your exposure and privacy in real time. Use it alongside the popup domain details to get full insight into network requests and refine your privacy strategy.
