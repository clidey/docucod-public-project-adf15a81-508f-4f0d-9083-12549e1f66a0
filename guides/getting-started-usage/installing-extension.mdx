## Understanding Permissions

uBO Scope requires permissions to:  
- Access the active browser tab to monitor network requests on the page you are visiting.
- Use storage to save session data and maintain state between page loads.
- Listen to webRequest events, which provide detailed information about network connections including allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked requests.

These permissions are essential to accurately report third-party connections and cannot be skipped.

## Verifying a Successful Installation

After installation, confirm the extension is working as expected:

1. Locate the uBO Scope toolbar icon:
   - It should appear in the browser toolbar near the address bar.
2. Click the icon to open the popup panel which summarizes connection information.
3. Open any webpage.
4. Observe the badge number on the extension icon, which reflects the count of distinct third-party servers connected.
5. Click the icon again to review categorized domains under the sections: "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked".

If these elements are visible and updating, uBO Scope is installed and functioning correctly.

If the badge count doesnâ€™t update or the popup shows "NO DATA", refer to troubleshooting guides for permission issues or setup verification.
