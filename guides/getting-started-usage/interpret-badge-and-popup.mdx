# Interpreting the Badge Counter and Popup Panel

Understanding the toolbar badge count and popup panel in uBO Scope is essential to make sense of your browsing activity in terms of third-party server connections. This guide walks you through what the badge number represents, how to access detailed connection breakdowns, and how to interpret categorized domain lists — empowering you to assess your network exposure clearly and confidently.

---

## 1. What This Guide Helps You Accomplish

- Understand what the badge count in the extension icon indicates
- Know how to open and navigate the popup panel to see connection details
- Interpret the categorized lists of domains shown as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked
- Use this information to evaluate third-party domain activity on visited webpages

## 2. Prerequisites

- uBO Scope extension installed and activated in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- An active browser tab with a webpage loaded
- Basic familiarity with the concept of domains and network requests is helpful but not required

## 3. Expected Outcome

After following this guide, you will be able to:

- Confidently interpret the badge count shown on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon
- Access the popup panel to view real-time domain connection data for the active tab
- Distinguish between domains that were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked
- Understand how to use this data to assess the third-party connections made by webpages

## 4. Time Estimate

This walkthrough typically takes 3–5 minutes to read and apply.

## 5. Difficulty Level

Beginner – designed for all users with clear, stepwise instructions.

# Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Locate the Toolbar Badge

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- The badge on this icon shows a number representing **the count of distinct third-party remote server domains for which successful network connections were made** by the active browser tab.
  
<Tip>
A lower badge count signifies fewer third-party domains contacted, which generally correlates with reduced exposure to tracking or unwanted connections.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Understand What the Badge Count Means

- The number shown is **not** the total requests or blocked connections.
- It counts **unique remote domains where resources were allowed to load**.
- This count excludes first-party domains and focuses on external third-party servers.

<Note>
The badge count is independent of your content blocker’s specific blocking results; it captures connections seen by the browser’s network layer.
</Note>

### Step 3: Open the Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
- The popup displays detailed breakdowns of domain connections for the current active tab.

### Step 4: Read the Popup Header

- At the top, you’ll see the hostname and domain of the active tab’s webpage.
- This confirms which page’s data you are currently viewing.

### Step 5: Review the Summary Section

- Below the header is a summary showing the **total count of unique domains connected** by this tab.
- This number corresponds closely to the badge count.

### Step 6: Interpret the Three Categorized Sections

The popup shows three domain categories with domain counts: 

#### a. Not Blocked (Allowed)

- Lists third-party domains where network requests succeeded.
- These are connections your browser allowed while loading the page.

#### b. Stealth-Blocked

- Lists domains where the connection was intercepted or stealth-blocked.
- This can include situations where network requests were redirected or altered quietly.
- These domains did not load resources successfully but might not appear as explicitly blocked.

#### c. Blocked

- Domains where connection attempts failed due to blocking (errors).
- These are third-party servers explicitly prevented from serving resources.

Each domain line includes a badge count indicating how many network requests related to that domain were observed.

### Step 7: Use Domain Names for Insight

- Domains are shown in Unicode to handle internationalized domain names correctly.
- The counts help identify domains with the highest activity.

### Step 8: Close the Popup and Watch Badge Updates

- The popup updates when you switch tabs or reload pages.
- Badge counts refresh dynamically to reflect new allowed domain counts.

# Practical Example

Imagine visiting a news website. You click the uBO Scope icon and see the badge number is “5”. Opening the popup reveals:

- **Allowed domains:** 'cdn.example.com' (4 requests), 'analytics.example.net' (2 requests)
- **Stealth-blocked domains:** 'tracker.hidden.com' (1 request)
- **Blocked domains:** 'ads.unwanted.com' (3 requests)

This means the site successfully connected to two external domains, stealthily blocked one potentially tracking domain, and blocked another with trackers.

# Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting & Helpful Tips">
<Accordion title="Why Is the Badge Count Empty or Zero?">
- The active tab may have no third-party connections yet.
- The page might still be loading; wait and refresh if needed.
- Ensure the extension is enabled and permissions are granted.
- Try navigating to another active tab with known network activity.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' in Header">
- This indicates no recorded data for the current tab.
- Reload the page and reopen the popup.
- Verify you are on a valid web page and not a blank or internal browser tab.
- If the problem persists, reinstall the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Counts Seem Unexpectedly High">
- Remember the count is unique domains, not total requests.
- Some legitimate services use multiple domain names (e.g., content delivery networks).
- High counts can indicate many third-party resources, which might raise privacy concerns.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why Are Stealth-Blocked Domains Important?">
- These reflect network requests caught and redirected or blocked quietly without typical failure notifications.
- Monitoring stealth-blocked domains helps understand hidden network activity.
- Don't ignore these; they often represent embedded trackers trying to bypass blocking.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Optimizing Interpretation">
- Focus on allowed domains to understand actual external connections.
- Use stealth-blocked and blocked sections to assess content blocker effectiveness.
- Keep badge counts low for privacy-focused browsing.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Best Practices

- Regularly monitor the badge and popup when browsing new or sensitive sites.
- Use the domain breakdown to investigate unexpected connections.
- Combine insights with content blocking settings to tune your privacy stance.
- Remember that not all third-party domains are harmful; many serve necessary content.
