## 2. Step-by-Step Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Choose Your Browser and Installation Method

**Recommended:** Install uBO Scope from your browser’s official extension/add-on store for ease and security.

| Browser Type         | Installation Source                                    |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium (Chrome, Edge, etc.) | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox             | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |
| Safari              | Safari Extensions Gallery or manual installation for Safari 18.5+ |

**Alternative:** For advanced users, you can build or load the extension manually by cloning from the GitHub repository and following platform-specific packaging scripts.

### Step 2: Install the Extension

1. Open your browser’s extension/add-on store.
2. Search for "uBO Scope".
3. Click ‘Add to [Browser]’ or ‘Install’. Confirm prompts to proceed.
4. Wait for installation to complete.

<Tip>
Installing from official stores is safest and automatically grants the necessary permissions.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Review and Grant Permissions

uBO Scope requires the following permissions to operate correctly:

- `activeTab`: To interact with the current browser tab.
- `storage`: To store session data, like network request information.
- `webRequest`: To listen to network traffic and report connection outcomes.
- Host permissions for all HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).

When prompted during installation, accept these permissions. If no prompt appears, verify permissions have been granted via your browser’s extension management page.

<Check>
If permissions are denied or limited, uBO Scope won't capture network data accurately.
</Check>

### Step 4: Confirm Installation and Locate the Extension Badge

- After installation, look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
- The icon badge is an indicator showing the count of distinct third-party domains with successful network connections.

### Step 5: Perform a Simple Test to Verify Functionality

1. Open any website (ideally one known to involve multiple connections, such as a news or social media site).
2. Observe the uBO Scope badge count. It reflects how many distinct third-party domains the page connected to.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup panel.
4. Review the displayed lists under "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked" categories.

You should see the domains connected displayed dynamically, reflecting network request outcomes.

<Tip>
Refresh the page if the badge remains empty after loading a website. Some network requests track after page load.
</Tip>

### Step 6: Understand the Badge Number

- The number on the badge counts **distinct third-party remote servers with connections** made by the page.
- A **lower number indicates fewer third-party connections** — generally desirable for privacy.
- The badge does NOT count blocked requests but successful (allowed) third-party connections.

<Info>
Remember that some legitimate services may appear as third parties (e.g., content delivery networks).
</Info>

## 3. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Keep uBO Scope enabled** to continuously monitor your browsing activity.
- **Regularly refresh pages** to update domain counts.
- Use the popup panel to **understand which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked**.
- Combine usage with content blockers for improved privacy insights.
