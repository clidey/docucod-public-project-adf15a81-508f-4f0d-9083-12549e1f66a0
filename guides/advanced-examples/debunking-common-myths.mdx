# Debunking Ad Blocker Myths with Real Evidence

uBO Scope offers a unique and practical way to uncover the truth behind common misconceptions about content blockers and ad blockers. This guide provides a hands-on, guided walkthrough demonstrating why widely accepted beliefs—such as relying on badge counts or popular 'ad blocker test' sites—are often misleading. By using uBO Scope effectively, you will learn how to capture and present reliable, real-world evidence of network request behavior to debunk myths with confidence.

---

## 1. Understanding the Challenge

Many users and even reviewers trust simple metrics or test websites to evaluate ad blockers or content blockers. Common pitfalls include:
- **Misinterpreting badge counts** as a measure of blocker effectiveness.
- **Trusting fabricated 'ad blocker test' sites** that simulate unrealistic scenarios.

This page empowers users to move beyond these unreliable methods by teaching how to use uBO Scope to observe real browser behavior and network requests.

---

## 2. What You Will Achieve

By following this guide, you will:
- Gain insights into uBO Scope’s reporting of network connections categorized into **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
- Learn to interpret badge counts correctly, understanding they reflect the number of distinct third-party servers *allowed* through, not how many connections were blocked.
- Analyze real network behavior when visiting webpages instead of relying on contrived test pages.
- Collect compelling, factual evidence to support or disprove claims about ad blocker effectiveness.


---

## 3. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Installed uBO Scope in your preferred browser. Supported browsers include:
  - Chromium 122+ (e.g., Chrome, Edge)
  - Firefox 128+
  - Safari 18.5+
- Refreshed or restarted your browser after installation to ensure extension activation.
- Basic familiarity with browsing and opening extension popups.

For installation instructions, refer to the [Installing uBO Scope in Your Browser](https://docs.example.com/guides/getting-started/installation-browser-setup) guide.

## 4. Step-by-Step Walkthrough for Debunking Myths

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope’s Popup for the Target Page">

1. Navigate to the webpage you want to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon next to the address bar.
3. The popup will load, displaying:
   - The hostname at the top.
   - A summary count of distinct connected domains.
   - Three categorized sections of domains: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.


**Expected Result:** The popup shows the real-time distinct network connections your browser made while loading the page.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret the Badge Count Accurately">

1. Note the badge count number on the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
2. Understand this number represents how many distinct third-party domains your browser successfully connected to, **not how many were blocked**.
3. A **lower badge count means fewer third-party connections**, which generally indicates better blocking.


**Tip:** Don't confuse the block count (often shown on other blockers’ icons) with this badge. A higher block count can sometimes mean *more* allowed remote connections overall.
</Step>

<Step title="Avoid Relying on 'Ad Blocker Test' Websites">

1. Refrain from using popular ‘ad blocker test’ sites as your evaluation benchmarks.
2. These test sites generate synthetic network requests that do not represent real-world browsing.
3. They fail to detect stealth-blocking techniques or distinguish between various types of network request outcomes.


**Best Practice:** Use uBO Scope on your regular browsing sites to observe authentic network request behavior.
</Step>

<Step title="Capture Evidence Across Different Content Blockers">

1. Disable all other content blockers except for uBO Scope in your browser.
2. Visit the same webpage with a different content blocker enabled and observe the uBO Scope popup badge and domain lists.
3. Compare **allowed domain counts** and the **domain lists** in the popup.
4. Use these observations to ascertain the real privacy exposure, not just raw block counts or claims.


**Expected Outcome:** You will see real differences in network requests, clarifying which blocker actually reduces third-party exposure.
</Step>

<Step title="Document and Present Your Findings">

1. Take screenshots of uBO Scope’s popup showing the distinct domains connected to.
2. Note the counts of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains separately.
3. Save these as evidence when reporting or discussing content blocker performance.
4. Use this data to educate others or verify claims objectively.


**Pro Tip:** Annotate your screenshots with explanations to highlight how badge counts are being misinterpreted or how test sites mislead users.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Real-World Example Scenario

Suppose a user reads a blog claiming that "Content Blocker X is better because it blocks more ads according to its block count badge."

Using uBO Scope:

- The user visits the blog with Content Blocker X enabled and opens uBO Scope popup.
- The popup shows a high number of allowed third-party domains, indicating many connections that are not truly blocked.
- The user then compares with Content Blocker Y.
- uBO Scope shows fewer allowed domains when using Content Blocker Y, despite Content Blocker X's higher block count badge.

This evidence clearly debunks the myth that a higher block count equals better blocking.

---

## 6. Tips for Effective Use

- Regularly refresh uBO Scope’s popup after page loads to see accurate network results.
- Understand the meaning of each outcome category:
  - **Allowed**: Connections successfully made.
  - **Stealth-blocked**: Connections intercepted with stealth techniques (not visible to the webpage).
  - **Blocked**: Connections explicitly blocked.
- Factor in stealth blocking when evaluating blockers, as it affects the true exposure.
- Use real browsing sites that you trust or that are common for your use case to gather evidence.
- Avoid jumping to conclusions based on block count badges from content blockers.

---

## 7. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Misinterpreting Badge Counts

- **Mistake:** Thinking the badge number reflects how many connections are blocked.
- **Correction:** It reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.

### Using Synthetic 'Ad Blocker Test' Sites

- **Mistake:** Trusting these pages as reliable measures.
- **Correction:** Avoid them because they simulate unrealistic scenarios.

### Ignoring Stealth Blocking

- **Mistake:** Overlooking stealth-blocked connections that do not appear on other tools.
- **Correction:** uBO Scope categorizes and shows stealth-blocked domains separately for full transparency.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

- If the popup shows "NO DATA," ensure:
  - uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
  - The page has finished loading.
  - You are viewing the popup on the active tab.

- If badge counts don't update:
  - Refresh the page to trigger new data.
  - Restart your browser.
  - Verify permissions and that no restrictions are causing failures (see [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/first-run-validation/troubleshooting-setup)).

- For any issues, consult the [Quick Validation: Is It Working?](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/first-run-validation/validation-quick-checks) guide.
