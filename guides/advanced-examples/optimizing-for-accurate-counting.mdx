# Tips for Accurate Measurement: Ensuring Consistency in Network Request Reporting

uBO Scope provides an unfiltered view of network requests at the browser level, but achieving consistent and reliable measurement requires mindful use and configuration. This guide shares practical tips and best practices to minimize noise, avoid common pitfalls, and optimize your environment so that uBO Scope delivers accurate and repeatable insights into third-party remote server connections.

---

## 1. Why Consistency Matters

uBO Scope counts *distinct third-party remote servers* contacted per tab, aggregating these outcomes into categories: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked. However, inconsistencies in browsing behavior, browser settings, and network conditions can introduce noise that skews these measurements. By following the tips below, you maintain clarity on what is actually happening behind the scenes and avoid misleading interpretations.


## 2. Environment Preparation

### Supported Browsers and Versions
- Use **Chromium 122+**, **Firefox 128+**, or **Safari 18.5+** as supported by uBO Scope.
- Make sure your browser is up to date to ensure the latest WebExtensions APIs and stable behavior.

### Permissions and Extension Setup
- Verify uBO Scope has the required permissions for `webRequest` and host access.
- Confirm the extension is not disabled and properly installed via your browser’s extensions manager.

### Network Environment
- Use a stable and consistent network connection during measurement sessions.
- Avoid caching effects by disabling local cache or using private/incognito browsing modes if accuracy is paramount.

<Tip>
Browser caching can prevent some network requests from appearing during repeated tests. For the most accurate count, perform measurements in a new tab or private browsing window to force fresh network activity.
</Tip>

## 3. Browsing Behavior Recommendations

### Consistent Webpage Interaction
- Perform the same sequence of page loads and user interactions each time you want to compare results.
- Avoid background activity from other tabs or extensions that might generate unrelated network requests.

### Single-Tab Focus
- Restrict measurements to a single active tab for clarity, as uBO Scope tracks network requests per tab.
- Close irrelevant tabs to avoid mixing data or spreading reporting across multiple tabs.

### Disable Other Interfering Extensions
- Temporarily disable extensions that modify network requests or insert additional connections (such as VPNs, proxies, or other content blockers) if you want pure baseline readings.

<Warning>
Multiple extensions interacting simultaneously can cause unexpected network behaviors that skew uBO Scope’s domain counts.
</Warning>

## 4. Browser Settings to Optimize Measurements

### Disable Preloading and Speculative Connections
- Turn off any features that prefetch or preload resources (common in Firefox and Chrome settings) since these create extra network activity unrelated to user navigation.

### Control DNS and HTTP Cache
- Use browser settings or developer tools to disable DNS caching where possible.
- Clear HTTP cache between measurement sessions to avoid cached loads.

### Utilize Private Browsing Mode
- Private/incognito windows typically limit cached content and isolate session data.
- Helps ensure all network requests are freshly captured and not skipped due to cache.

## 5. Avoiding Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall: Misinterpreting Badge Counts
- Remember the badge counts **distinct third-party domains** contacted, not total requests.
- A lower badge count signals fewer unique remote connections, but it does not reflect success or failure of individual requests in isolation.

### Pitfall: Relying on Synthetic Test Pages
- Avoid ad blocker test websites as their artificial requests do not represent realistic network conditions.
- uBO Scope is designed for real-world browsing measurement.

### Pitfall: Overlooking Stealth-Blocked Connections
- Stealth-blocked domains may silently redirect or hide their blocking from typical views.
- Check all domain categories in the popup for a comprehensive view.

### Pitfall: Confusing Hostnames vs Domains
- uBO Scope uses public suffix list logic to group hostnames into domains accurately.
- Being aware that multiple hostnames map to the same domain helps interpret counts correctly.

## 6. Best Practices for Repeatable Results

- **Clear the browser session or restart the browser** between tests to reset stored session data.
- **Document your test process**, including the exact URLs, browser version, extension version, and any additional tool configurations.
- **Use the uBO Scope popup UI actively** to verify current tab connection counts and domain listings.
- **Leverage private windows** for test isolation and reduce external influences.

<Tip>
To verify that data collection is ongoing, watch the badge counter update dynamically with tab activity and confirm domain lists in the popup reflect fresh browsing.
</Tip>

## 7. Troubleshooting Inaccurate Measurements

### Symptom: Badge Count Remains Static
- Confirm that the extension is enabled and has not crashed.
- Reload the tab or open a new tab to reset data capture.
- Restart the browser.

### Symptom: Popup Shows No Data or Outdated Data
- Close and reopen the popup; sometimes updates are delayed.
- Ensure your current tab is active and properly communicating with the extension.

### Symptom: Suspiciously High Domain Counts
- Check for background tabs or extensions causing additional requests.
- Confirm consistent browsing patterns and clear caches.

## 8. Leveraging uBO Scope for Advanced Analysis

- Combine repeated measurements to identify persistent third-party connections.
- Use domain category distinctions (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked) to investigate blocking efficacy.
- Share session data (exported or screenshotted) to compare results across devices or filter lists.
