# Best Practices for Interpreting Results

Unlock the full power of uBO Scope by understanding how to extract meaningful, actionable insights from the data it reveals. This guide will walk you through identifying trustworthy third-party servers versus potentially suspicious ones, reducing unnecessary exposure to remote servers, and appreciating the nuances inherent in how browsers report network activity.

---

## 1. Understanding the Data You See

uBO Scope categorizes every third-party remote server a webpage contacts into three groups:

- **Allowed:** Connections that successfully reached third-party servers.
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked by content blockers or network failures.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were redirected or obfuscated to maintain stealth blocking behavior.

### Why This Matters

The extension's core value lies in transparency. Rather than trusting block counts or test pages, uBO Scope shows you the reality of third-party network interactions regardless of content blockers. Each distinct third-party domain counts toward your exposure surface, making fewer distinct connections generally more privacy-friendly.


## 2. Recognizing Legitimate vs Suspicious Third-Party Servers

### Legitimate Third Parties

- Typically limited to known **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**, analytics providers, or trusted services used by the website.
- Domains often belong to companies you recognize or that are standard in your browsing ecosystem.
- They usually appear consistently across many reputable websites (e.g., `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`, `fonts.gstatic.com`).

### Suspicious or Unnecessary Third Parties

- Domains that are obscure, unrelated to the website's core service, or appear only occasionally may indicate tracking or ad networks.
- Unexpectedly high numbers of distinct third parties often reveal over-exposure.
- Use domain reputation tools or search engines to research unfamiliar domains.

### Practical Tips

- **Cross-reference domains with your browsing context:** Does the page content justify these connections?
- **Beware of new or rare domains:** they might signal unwanted tracking or malicious activity.
- **Check counts:** Sudden spikes in allowed third-party domains point to possible privacy risks.


## 3. Minimizing Unnecessary Exposure

### Goal
Reduce the number of distinct third-party servers loaded without sacrificing core website functionality.

### How to Achieve This

1. **Use Content Blockers Effectively:** Enable reputable content blockers that reduce third-party exposure, knowing uBO Scope will reflect their real impact.
2. **Evaluate Stealth-Blocked Domains:** These show where content blockers actively prevent data leakage without breaking the site.
3. **Limit Permissions for Extensions:** Some extensions or scripts increase third-party calls; review those permissions.
4. **Clear Outdated Storage and Cookies:** They can cause unintended connections or tracking and inflate third-party counts.


## 4. Understanding Browser Network Reporting Nuances

Browsers report network requests through the **webRequest API**, which uBO Scope listens to. A few important points:

- **Not all requests are visible:** Some network activity can occur outside this API’s scope, like certain DNS or caching mechanisms.
- **Redirects are tracked separately:** Stealth-blocked categories include redirects manipulated by blockers to stealthily prevent connections.
- **Badge count reflects distinct domains, not total requests:** Multiple requests to the same domain count as one.
- **Network protocols:** uBO Scope tracks HTTP(S) and WebSocket connections as supported by the browser.


<Tip>
Remember that a zero or unusually low badge count may indicate incomplete monitoring due to browser restrictions or missing permissions. Always verify your setup if results appear unexpectedly.

## 5. Step-by-Step Best Practice Workflow to Interpret Results

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope's Popup for Current Tab">
Click the toolbar badge to open the popup interface showing allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains related to the active webpage.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Allowed Domains">
Note the count and identities of domains that were successfully contacted. Legitimate third parties generally number low.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine the Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Identify domains where connections were stealth-blocked. These domains reflect active blocking efforts without site breakage.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Blocked Domains">
Review blocked domains to understand what the content blocker or network refused.
</Step>
<Step title="Correlate with Browsing Context">
Compare these domains with the webpage’s purpose and your knowledge of common CDNs and trusted providers.
</Step>
<Step title="Research Unfamiliar Domains">
Use external tools or search engines to validate suspicious or unknown domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust Your Content Blocking Configuration If Needed">
Based on your findings, tweak your content blockers or privacy settings to minimize unnecessary exposure.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 6. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall: Misinterpreting High Block Counts as Better Blocking

- Block counts alone don’t correlate with privacy. The key metric is how many distinct third-party domains are actually allowed.

### Pitfall: Trusting Ad-Blocker Test Pages

- Ad-blocker test pages create synthetic scenarios. Use real-world browsing with uBO Scope for accurate insights.

### Pitfall: Ignoring Stealth-Blocked Domains

- These reveal important stealth blocking activity crucial for privacy but often invisible elsewhere.

### Pitfall: Overlooking Browser Limitations

- Not all network requests are visible; be aware of partial blind spots due to browser APIs.


## 7. Practical Tips for Maximizing Benefits

- **Regularly Monitor:** Use uBO Scope during typical web browsing sessions for realistic data.
- **Combine with Other Tools:** Use alongside reputable content blockers and domain reputation checkers.
- **Keep Browsers Updated:** Ensure browser versions meet uBO Scope’s minimum requirements for best results.
- **Check Extension Permissions:** Confirm uBO Scope has the necessary permissions to monitor all relevant traffic.


## 8. Summary

Accurate interpretation of uBO Scope’s data empowers you to decisively understand and control your browsing exposure to third-party servers. Prioritize legitimateness, minimize exposure thoughtfully, and remember the subtle intricacies of network monitoring remain in play.
