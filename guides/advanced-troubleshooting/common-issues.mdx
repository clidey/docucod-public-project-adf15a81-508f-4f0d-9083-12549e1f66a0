# Troubleshooting Common Issues

When using uBO Scope, users may occasionally encounter issues such as missing network requests, zero or unexpected badge counts, or surprising domain listings in the popup interface. This guide helps you diagnose these common problems with clear, actionable instructions so you can restore accurate monitoring and gain trustworthy visibility into your browser's third-party connections.

---

## 1. Overview

This page addresses typical issues that hinder uBO Scope's effectiveness in reporting network requests and domain connections. It guides you through recognizing symptoms, understanding causes, and applying specific solutions.

---

## 2. Common Issues and Solutions

### 2.1 Missing or Incomplete Network Requests

**Symptoms:**
- Popup shows "NO DATA" or very few domains despite active browsing.
- Badge count remains zero when visiting websites known for third-party requests.

**Possible Causes:**
- The extension is not enabled or lacks permissions.
- Browser version or type does not support required APIs.
- Requests are made outside the capability of the `webRequest` API (e.g., certain sandboxed frames).

**How to Fix:**
1. Ensure the extension is installed and enabled:
   - Confirm uBO Scope icon is visible in your browser toolbar.
   - See the [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope#installation-instructions) documentation for your specific browser.

2. Verify browser compatibility:
   - Chromium browsers must be version 122 or higher.
   - Firefox must be version 128 or higher.
   - Safari must be version 18.5 or higher.
   See [System Requirements](../getting-started/quick-setup/system-requirements) for details.

3. Reload the webpage and open the popup again.

4. If still missing:
   - Try opening developer console on the popup (right-click → Inspect) and check for errors.
   - Disable other extensions temporarily to rule out conflicts.

### 2.2 Badge Shows Zero or No Count

**Symptoms:**
- Toolbar badge remains empty or zero when visiting sites with known third-party connections.

**Possible Causes:**
- The extension has no active data for the current tab.
- Browsing in private/incognito mode without explicit permission.
- Network requests are filtered before uBO Scope can monitor them.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Confirm that the extension has permission to run in private windows if using incognito mode.
2. Reload the webpage fully (with network requests initiated after the extension is ready).
3. Check if the page is served over unusual protocols not covered (uBO Scope listens to HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS).
4. Clear browser session or restart browser to eliminate stale session data:

    - Disable and re-enable the extension.
    - Restart your browser.

### 2.3 Unexpected Domains in Allowed, Blocked, or Stealth Sections

**Symptoms:**
- You see domains you did not expect listed under allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

**Understanding Context:**
- uBO Scope categorizes domains per connection outcome, including:
  - **Allowed:** Requests succeeded or were not blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Requests failed or were actively blocked.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Redirected requests that were suppressed silently.

**What to Do:**
- Remember that some legitimate third-party domains (e.g., CDNs, analytics) are common and expected.
- Review your content blockers and DNS filters, as these influence blockage results.
- If suspicious domains appear:
  - Check the domain reputation independently.
  - Verify if your content blocker configuration allows these domains.

### 2.4 Data Persistence Issues After Tab or Browser Restart

**Symptoms:**
- Data resets unexpectedly when switching tabs or after restarting the browser.

**Causes:**
- Session storage is reset or not properly saved.
- A tab was closed prematurely.

**How to Mitigate:**
- Keep the extension enabled and avoid forcibly closing tabs quickly.
- Confirm extension is allowed to use session storage.
- For important sessions, avoid closing tabs or browser before you finish monitoring.

## 3. Diagnostic Checklist

Run through these checks to isolate your problem:

- Is uBO Scope icon visible and enabled?
- Are you using a supported browser version?
- Did you reload the page after installing/enabling the extension?
- Are extensions or privacy protections blocking uBO Scope’s access?
- Are you in private/incognito mode without permission granted for the extension?
- Are network requests over protocols supported by uBO Scope?
- Is the page reloading after installation and not cached from before?

---

## 4. Advanced Troubleshooting Tips

- **Inspect Popup Errors:** Use your browser's developer tools on the popup page (`popup.html`) to catch JavaScript errors.
- **Examine Network Requests:** Use browser devtools Network tab to confirm third-party requests are indeed sent.
- **Disable Conflicting Extensions:** Temporarily disable other network or privacy-related extensions.
- **Verify Permissions:** In your browser's extension settings, confirm uBO Scope has `webRequest` and host permissions.
- **Clear Extension Storage:** Remove session data via browser settings or manually by disabling and re-enabling the extension.

- Avoid relying on ad-blocker test pages; use real-world websites for verification.
- Regularly update your browser to maintain compatibility.
- Grant the extension necessary permissions to ensure uninterrupted monitoring.
- Use uBO Scope alongside minimal interfering extensions to reduce conflicts.

<Tip>
Ensure your browser is up to date and that you have allowed all necessary permissions for the extension to function correctly. Many common issues stem from missing permissions or unsupported browser versions.
</Tip>

<Warning>
uBO Scope relies on the browser's webRequest API, which cannot capture all network requests (such as certain internal browser optimizations or sandboxed content). Missing data in these cases is expected behavior.
</Warning>

<Check>
If you experience persistent issues, always attempt a browser restart and extension reinstallation before deeper troubleshooting.
</Check>
