# Debunking Block Count and Ad Blocker Myths

## Overview

This guide reveals how **uBO Scope** empowers users to cut through common misconceptions about content blockers, specifically the misleading use of block counts and ad blocker test webpages. By focusing on the real network data captured by uBO Scope, users gain clear insights into what truly matters for privacy and blocking effectiveness.

You will learn to interpret uBO Scope's distinct third-party server count and popup outcome categories to confidently assess the efficacy of content blockers.

---

## Why This Guide Matters

Many users rely on superficial metrics or flawed tests to judge ad blockers or content blockers. This frequently leads to:

- Overvaluing high block counts as better protection
- Trusting ad blocker test webpages that use unrealistic scenarios
- Misunderstanding what the toolbar badge count represents

uBO Scope exposes these myths by providing real, observable data from network requests.

---

## Key Concepts Reviewed in This Guide

- **Block Count Myth:** Why a higher block count does not necessarily mean better blocking
- **Distinct Third-Party Domain Count:** The real indicator of privacy exposure
- **Ad Blocker Test Pages:** Why they mislead users and should be avoided

---

## What You Will Need

- uBO Scope installed and activated in your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+)
- Basic familiarity with uBO Scope’s popup and badge count (refer to [Viewing Connections and Understanding the Badge](../getting-started/getting-up-and-running/using-network-monitoring))

---

## Interpreting Block Counts Correctly

### The Myth

> “If this content blocker reports blocking more than another, it must be better.”

### The Reality

- The **badge count in uBO Scope** represents the number of distinct **third-party remote servers actually allowed** through, **not blocked requests**.
- A **high block count can coincide with allowing more servers**, because more network requests overall are being initiated and partly blocked.
- In effect, your content blocker may be allowing connections to more distinct third-party domains despite reporting higher block activity.

### What to Watch For

- Focus on the **number of distinct allowed third-party domains (lower is better)**
- The badge reflects allowed connections from the current page/tab, a solid real-world privacy indicator.

---

## Understanding the uBO Scope Popup Outcomes

The popup splits connections into three categories:

| Outcome Category | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| **allowed**      | Network requests successfully fetched from third-party servers |
| **stealth-blocked** | Network requests blocked or redirected in a way invisible to the page (often stealth blocking by content blockers) |
| **blocked**      | Clear blocked network requests (failed to resolve or blocked at the browser level) |

This classification helps you see not just what was blocked, but what slipped past or was hidden, shaping a clearer picture.

---

## Why You Should Avoid Ad Blocker Test Websites

### What These Tests Do Wrong

- They **generate fabricated network requests** to servers never used by real websites
- Extension-based blockers may use stealth techniques that evade detection by these pages
- Results are often unrealistic and do not reflect real browsing conditions

### Impact on Your Judgment

- Relying on these tests can make you believe an extension is more or less effective than it truly is
- They do not help with understanding actual third-party connection exposure

### Use uBO Scope Instead

- Open the popup on actual websites you visit to observe real-world connections
- Use the distinct domain count and categorized outcomes to measure effectiveness

## Practical Workflow: Using uBO Scope to Debunk Myths

<Steps>
<Step title="Activate uBO Scope on your browser">
Locate the extension icon in your toolbar (see [Activating and Accessing uBO Scope](../getting-started/getting-up-and-running/initial-launch-activation)) and ensure it is enabled.
</Step>
<Step title="Visit the website you want to analyze">
Load a real website you usually browse.
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
Observe the badge count indicating the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine popup connection categories">
Review the distinct domains under the “allowed,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked” sections.
Note that a lower ``allowed`` count signifies better privacy.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare across different content blockers">
Switch between your content blockers (e.g., uBlock Origin, others) and repeat the steps to see differences.
Remember: the block count badge on other blockers is not a reliable measure.
</Step>
<Step title="Avoid reliance on ad blocker test pages">
Stop using test pages claiming to measure extension reliability; instead, use uBO Scope’s real-browser data.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Use distinct servers count, not block events, as your privacy indicator.**
- Observe the nature of blocked vs stealth-blocked connections to understand subtle blocking methods.
- Cross-verify outliers by visiting multiple real-world sites.
- Consider that some allowed third-party servers (e.g., CDNs) are legitimate and safe.
- Use uBO Scope to educate friends or filter list maintainers about real-world blocking effectiveness.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Assuming higher block counts on toolbar icons mean stronger filtering
- Taking ad blocker test page results at face value
- Confusing network requests blocked at DNS level as reported by content blocker
- Missing stealth-blocked connections that might still leak privacy data

---

## Example Scenario

Imagine you have two content blockers:

- **Blocker A** shows a badge with a high block count but also a higher number of allowed third-party domains in uBO Scope.
- **Blocker B** has a lower block count but fewer allowed domains.

Which is better?

uBO Scope’s data reveals **Blocker B provides better real-world blocking**, despite blocking fewer requests in total.

## Troubleshooting Common Misunderstandings

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Myths and Misinterpretations">
<Accordion title="Why doesn't uBO Scope show blocked requests as high badge counts?">
The badge shows the **count of distinct allowed third-party domains**, not just total blocked requests. Blocking many trivial requests across many domains can inflate block counts without improving privacy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I see few allowed domains but still ads appear. Why?">
Some ads come from allowed or stealth-blocked connections. uBO Scope shows connectivity but does not filter. Use reliable filter lists in conjunction with the extension to block at source.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Ad blocker test websites show my blocker failing, but uBO Scope reports few allowed domains. Which to trust?">
Trust uBO Scope as it reflects real browser network activity. Test sites often simulate impractical scenarios that do not align with normal browsing behavior.
</Accordion>
