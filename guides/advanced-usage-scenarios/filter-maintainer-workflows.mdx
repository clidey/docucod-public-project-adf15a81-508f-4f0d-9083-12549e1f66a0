# Workflows for Filter List Maintainers

uBO Scope is an indispensable tool designed for filter-list authors and advanced users who need to observe and analyze network requests that often remain invisible in standard browser developer tools. This guide walks you through leveraging uBO Scope’s unique capabilities to detect stealthy or problematic third-party connections and validate your filtering rules, even on devices where typical web development tools are restricted or unavailable.

---

## 1. Understanding Your Workflow With uBO Scope

### Purpose
This guide enables filter-list maintainers to effectively use uBO Scope to:
- Observe all types of network connections made by web pages, including those stealthily blocked or invisible to conventional tools.
- Identify third-party domains that evade standard blocking or cause unexpected behaviors.
- Validate and tune filtering rules based on real-world data captured by uBO Scope.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and activated in your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with filter list concepts and the goals of third-party domain blocking.
- Access to the uBO Scope popup interface and toolbar badge (covered in [Activating and Accessing uBO Scope](https://example.com/getting-started/getting-up-and-running/initial-launch-activation)).

### Expected Outcome
By completing the tasks in this guide, you will:
- Gain a transparent overview of all network requests initiated by sites under test.
- Detect stealthy or problematic connections that content blockers may not visibly report.
- Confirm the effectiveness and correctness of your filter rules through observed outcomes.

### Time Estimate
Expect to spend about 15–30 minutes per site or scenario, depending on complexity and needed analysis.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate to advanced — intended for users with filter authoring experience and deep understanding of network behavior.

## 2. Step-by-Step Guide for Filter List Maintenance

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope on the Target Site

1. Load the website you want to analyze in your browser.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
3. Observe the badge count, which shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected to (allowed).

**Expected Result:** The popup lists the site’s third-party remote servers sorted into **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** categories.

<Check>
Ensure the badge number updates dynamically as the page loads resources.
</Check>

### Step 2: Monitor All Network Connections Including Stealth-Blocked

uBO Scope uniquely detects **stealth-blocked** connections — those which do not appear in usual network tools or block lists.

- Review the **stealth-blocked** section in the popup carefully.
- Identify domains frequently appearing in stealth-blocked lists across different pages.

**Decision Point:** If a domain consistently appears stealth-blocked, consider revising your filter rules or inspecting their behavior further.

---

### Step 3: Analyze Outcome Counts

Each domain entry includes a count indicating how many requests were made.

- Use these counts to prioritize domains by connection frequency.
- High counts for stealth or blocked domains could indicate persistent issues or evasion attempts.

---

### Step 4: Use Domain Details to Validate or Refine Filters

1. Focus on the domains listed under **not blocked** but suspected as unwanted.
2. Cross-check these domains against your current filter rules.
3. Adjust or add rules to cover unexpected or missed connections.
4. Reload the tested site and observe changes in uBO Scope results.

**Expected Result:** The domains intended to be blocked should move from **not blocked** or **stealth-blocked** to **blocked** category after rule adjustments.

### Step 5: Work Around Limited DevTools Access

On restricted devices or browsers with limited developer tools access:

- Use the uBO Scope’s popup as your primary insight tool for connection visibility.
- Regularly save observations for offline analysis or sharing with filter list collaborators.

<Info>
uBO Scope uses browser's `webRequest` API to capture all network requests independently of content blockers and DNS filtering, meaning you get a more comprehensive view than standard devtools.
</Info>

## 3. Real-World Example: Investigating a Stealthy Tracker

Imagine you notice a persistent high count for a domain appearing under **stealth-blocked**, like `tracker.example.com`.


1. Confirm the domain is not appearing in your block lists or filter rules.
2. Create or update a filter rule targeting this domain.
3. Reload the target webpage.
4. Use uBO Scope again to check if the domain shifts to **blocked**.

If the domain remains stealth-blocked, it might indicate complex redirection or evasion which requires advanced rule writing or blacklist updating.

---

## 4. Tips and Best Practices

- Regularly clear your browser cache and uBO Scope session data to prevent stale results.
- Focus less on number of blocked requests and more on distinct domain counts — a lower count means better privacy.
- Combine observations from uBO Scope with automated tools and live filter testing engines.
- Use the detailed popup domain list to generate reports or snapshots for peer review.

<Warning>
uBO Scope cannot detect network requests outside of what the browser's `webRequest` API reports. Some browser features may bypass this, causing underreporting.
</Warning>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: No Connections Are Reported

- Verify that uBO Scope has appropriate permissions (see [Solving Installation Problems](https://example.com/getting-started/troubleshooting-common-issues/common-installation-issues)).
- Ensure your browser version meets the minimum supported version stated in [System Requirements](https://example.com/getting-started/installation-basics/system-requirements).
- Confirm that the page is fully loaded.

### Issue: Stealth-Blocked or Blocked Counts Seem Inaccurate

- Remember stealth-blocked connections are those detected by uBO Scope but might not be caught by your filters yet.
- Reload the page and confirm timing effects.
- Check if you have conflicting extensions that alter network requests.
