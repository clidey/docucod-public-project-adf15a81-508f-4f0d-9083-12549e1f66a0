# Interpreting Results: Legitimate vs. Risky Third-Parties

## Overview
This guide helps you distinguish between necessary and potentially privacy-invasive third-party domains as shown in uBO Scope's popup connection list. You will learn how to identify common legitimate services such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), analytics providers, or fonts hosts — and separate those from domains that might track you or pose privacy risks.

Understanding these distinctions is key to making sense of the data uBO Scope presents and taking informed action towards better privacy.

## 1. Understanding Third-Party Domains in uBO Scope

### What Are Third-Parties?
Third-party domains are remote servers contacted by a website you visit but are not part of that site's own domain. For example, social media widgets, advertising networks, analytics tools, or content delivery networks.

### Why Are Some Third-Parties Legitimate?
Many third-party domains serve essential functions:
- **CDNs** (Content Delivery Networks): Host common resources like scripts, images, fonts for faster delivery.
- **Cloud Services**: Used by sites to serve functionality reliably.
- **Analytics Providers**: Collect aggregate usage data to improve services.

These are generally low-risk and help websites function smoothly.

### Why Might Some Third-Parties Be Risky?
They could:
- Track your browsing behavior across sites.
- Inject unwanted advertising or content.
- Serve malware or phishing attempts.

## 2. Reviewing the Connections List Intentionally

When you open the uBO Scope popup, domains are categorized into:
- **Not Blocked:** Connections that succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Redirects or connections masked by stealth techniques.
- **Blocked:** Connections unsuccessfully made or prevented.

Your focus is primarily on the **Not Blocked** list to understand what your browser is fetching.

### Key Criteria for Evaluating Domains

| Criterion                 | What to Look For                            | Examples                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------| -----------------------------|
| Domain Type               | Recognizable service or CDN domain         | `cloudflare.com`, `googleapis.com` |
| Frequency Across Sites    | Widely used domains across many sites      | `fonts.googleapis.com`, `cdn.jsdelivr.net` |
| Domain Name Legitimacy    | Avoid suspicious or randomly generated names| Domains with gibberish names or uncommon TLD combinations|
| Association With Known Brands | Match domain with known companies or services| `facebook.net`, `doubleclick.net` |
| Request Count             | High request counts can indicate heavy use | Many hits to `cdn.example.com` for static assets |

## 3. Common Legitimate Third-Party Domains and Use Cases

### Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
These domains provide caching and fast delivery of static content.

- `cloudflare.com`
- `akamaihd.net`
- `fastly.net`
- `jsdelivr.net`
- `maxcdn.com`

### Fonts and Web Assets
Common font hosting, CSS or JS frameworks.

- `fonts.googleapis.com`
- `fonts.gstatic.com`
- `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`

### Analytics & Metrics
Collect aggregate anonymous usage data.

- `google-analytics.com`
- `mixpanel.com`
- `segment.com`

### Social Media & Widget Services
Enable embedded content or social buttons.

- `facebook.net`
- `twitter.com`
- `linkedin.com`

### Cloud Services & APIs
Host APIs or cloud functions for site backend.

- `amazonaws.com`
- `firebaseio.com`
- `cloudflareworkers.com`

## 4. Spotting Potentially Risky or Privacy-Invasive Third-Parties

### Red Flags
- Domains with random strings or non-intuitive names.
- Unfamiliar, low-traffic or uncommon top-level domains (e.g., `.xyz`, `.top`).
- Domains associated with known ad trackers or less reputable advertising networks.
- Multiple subdomains used to circumvent blocking.
- High number of connections in stealth or blocked categories for unknown domains.

### What To Do When You Spot Risky Domains
- Verify the domain in privacy/blocklist communities.
- Consider blocking these domains in content blockers or filters.
- Research the domain ownership, reputation, and user reports.

## 5. Practical Workflow: Evaluate Third-Party Domains

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar to display the list of connected domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
Look at the 'not blocked' section for the domains your browser successfully connected to on the current tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify Common Legitimate Domains">
Check if these domains match well-known CDNs, cloud services, or analytics providers listed in section 3.
</Step>
<Step title="Flag and Investigate Unfamiliar Domains">
For domains you don’t recognize, use these strategies:
- Search online for domain reputation.
- Compare domain names with popular ad and tracking blocklists.
</Step>
<Step title="Make Decisions Based on Risk">
Decide which domains to allow or block depending on your privacy comfort level and whether the domain is necessary for site functionality.
</Step>
<Step title="Update Content Blockers Accordingly">
If appropriate, add risky domains to your content blocker’s custom blocklists or rules.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Examples

### Example 1: Legitimate Domain

| Domain                 | Reason                |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
| `fonts.googleapis.com` | Widely used Google Fonts CDN, crucial for typography display on many websites.

Users typically do not block this unless they want to avoid external font fetching entirely.

### Example 2: Potentially Risky Domain

| Domain               | Reason                                  |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `trackermalicious.xyz` | Unknown domain with suspicious pattern, not in any trusted list.

Recommend further research and blocking if unwanted.

## 7. Best Practices & Tips

- **Don’t jump to conclusions.** Not all unknown domains are harmful; some may be legitimate new services.
- **Keep your blockers updated.** Use community-maintained filter lists to prevent risky connections automatically.
- **Use reverse DNS lookup tools** or services like [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) for suspicious domains.
- **Monitor stealth and blocked categories** for unusual activity which might indicate attempts to bypass protections.
- **Understand the difference between domains and subdomains.** Blocking entire domains may break site features.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting and FAQs">
<Accordion title="Why do I see high counts of 'allowed' but the site still works fine?">
This is typical when sites use several legitimate third-party services like CDNs, analytics, or embedded content providers. A higher count does not necessarily mean bad privacy—it reflects site complexity.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I know if a domain is critical for the site's functionality?">
Test by temporarily blocking the domain and observing site behavior. You can also search for the domain’s purpose or ask in privacy communities.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Should I block all third-party domains to maximize privacy?">
Not necessarily. Blocking essential CDNs or APIs might break website functionality. Balance privacy with usability by selectively blocking based on domain assessment.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
