## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Obtain the Extension

#### For Regular Users
- **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.):**
  - Visit the [Chrome Web Store uBO Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  - Click **Add to Chrome** and confirm installation

- **Firefox:**
  - Visit the [Mozilla Add-ons uBO Scope page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
  - Click **Add to Firefox** and confirm installation

- **Safari:**
  - Install from the Mac App Store or from the Safari Extensions gallery (ensure Safari version ≥ 18.5)

#### For Developers & Advanced Users
- Clone the [uBO-Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope)
- Use the provided `tools/make-package.sh` script to build the extension package specific to your platform (chromium, firefox, safari)
- Load the unpacked extension via your browser's developer mode

<Tip>
Always install uBO Scope from official sources to ensure security and integrity of the extension.
</Tip>

---

### Step 2: Confirm Extension Installation

- Look for the uBO Scope icon on your browser’s toolbar. It should display the uBO Scope logo.
- If not visible, check your browser’s extensions management page and ensure the extension is enabled and configured to show the icon.

<Check>
Confirm the toolbar icon presence as the basic sign that installation succeeded.
</Check>

---

### Step 3: Grant Required Permissions

uBO Scope requires access to monitor web traffic. When prompted:
- Accept the permissions request for:
  - Active Tab Access
  - Web Request Monitoring
  - Storage Access

If permissions are denied, the extension will not function correctly.

<Warning>
If you do not see any permission prompts, manually verify permissions in your browser’s extensions management dashboard and ensure all relevant permissions are enabled.
</Warning>

---

### Step 4: Verify uBO Scope is Monitoring Network Connections

1. Open any website in a new tab (preferably a popular site with multiple third-party content).
2. Observe the badge on the uBO Scope icon:
   - The badge displays a number representing the count of distinct third-party domains connected.
   - A zero or empty badge means no third-party connections have been detected yet.

3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup:
   - Confirm the popup displays the "domain connected" count summary.
   - You will see sections listing domains categorized by their request outcomes: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

4. Navigate to different websites in the active tab to see the badge count update dynamically.

<Note>
The badge count reflects distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to — fewer is generally better for privacy.
</Note>

## 3. Configuration Options

uBO Scope is designed to work out-of-the-box with minimal configuration.

### Browser-Specific Details
- **Chromium browsers:** The extension registers a service worker (`background.js`) and uses `webRequest` permissions.
- **Firefox:** Uses similar service worker and webRequest APIs with minor version requirements (minimum Firefox 128.0).
- **Safari:** Requires Safari 18.5 or later and loads `background.js` as a module script.

### Permissions & Host Access
- The extension requires unrestricted host permissions to monitor HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket connections.
- These permissions are declared in the manifest for each platform, ensuring the extension can observe all relevant network events.

### Data Persistence & Privacy
- Network request data is stored only for the session using browser `storage.session` to avoid lingering data after browser restart.
- uBO Scope does not send data outside your browser and operates fully locally.

## 4. Verifying Installation and Data Flow

After successful installation and initial navigation:

1. Open the popup on an active browser tab.
2. Confirm the details shown:
   - The top-level hostname should correspond to the website in the active tab.
   - Domains listed under **not blocked** represent third parties connected successfully.
   - **Stealth blocked** lists domains where requests were redirected or intercepted without explicit blocking.
   - **Blocked** lists rejected or failed network requests.
3. The badge number on the icon should match the count of distinct third-party domains displayed in the popup.
