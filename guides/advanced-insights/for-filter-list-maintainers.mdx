# uBO Scope for Filter List Maintainers

## Overview
This guide provides best practices and practical workflows for using **uBO Scope** effectively on devices or in environments where browser developer tools are limited or unavailable. It is tailored for filter list maintainers and advanced users who need detailed insights into network requests and third-party connections beyond the visible UI.

By following this guide, you will leverage uBO Scope to uncover connection details that help refine and validate filter lists, boosting their effectiveness across diverse browsing environments.

---

## 1. Getting Started with uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and activated on a supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with browser extensions and content blockers.
- Understanding of domains, hostnames, and the concept of third parties (see [Core Concepts & Terminology](https://your-docs-host/overview/concepts-architecture/core-concepts-terminology)).

### What You Will Achieve
- Gain visibility into distinct third-party domains contacted during web browsing.
- Access categorized connection outcomes: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- Use this data to identify gaps or false positives in filter lists.
- Plan workflows to improve filter list quality in constrained environments.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15-30 minutes for initial familiarization and daily maintenance use.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate to Advanced

---

## 2. Understanding uBO Scope's Detailed Connection Outcomes

The popup interface of uBO Scope classifies third-party connections by outcome:

- **Allowed:** Connections that succeeded without being blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections that were redirected or silently blocked without error notifications.
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked, resulting in errors.

For filter list maintainers, understanding these categories is critical as they reflect the real-world impact of filter lists and browser blocking behaviors.

<Tip>
Lower numbers in 'allowed' domains generally indicate better privacy filtering, but a comprehensive evaluation requires looking at all categories.
</Tip>

Refer to the [Understanding Stealth-Blocking](/guides/advanced-insights/stealth-blocking-details) guide for a deep dive.

## 3. Workflow: Using uBO Scope without Developer Tools

In some environments, especially on mobile or locked-down devices, you can't rely on full developer tools. uBO Scope fills this gap by providing actionable insights directly in its popup UI.

### Step 1: Access the uBO Scope Popup
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- Observe the displayed count of distinct connected third-party domains at the top.

### Step 2: Review Connection Lists
- The popup separates the domains into three sections:
  - **Allowed:** Usually CDN and necessary third-party services.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that were redirected or silently blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked entries.
- Each domain has a badge showing the number of connection attempts.

### Step 3: Interpret the Data
- Focus on **allowed** domains to identify which third parties your current filter list permits.
- Inspect **stealth-blocked** domains to identify potentially under-blocked or circumvention domains.
- Check **blocked** domains to verify expected blocking effectiveness.

### Step 4: Export Data for Deeper Analysis
Since uBO Scope does not provide export features in this version:
- Use screenshots or manual notes from the popup interface.
- Consider contributing to or requesting future feature enhancements for more detailed data access.

### Best Practice
- Visit various representative websites to gather diverse connection profiles.
- Compare results with different filter list versions and configurations to assess their impact.

## 4. Upcoming Features and How They Benefit Filter List Maintainers

While the current version provides a solid foundation, upcoming enhancements aim to deliver:

- **More Detailed Request Metadata:** Enabling maintainers to see precise URLs and request attributes.
- **Improved Filtering Insights:** Identifying stealth-blocking patterns and nuanced request behaviors.
- **Better Session Management:** Allowing detailed session exports and historical analysis.

Stay updated by following the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) and issue trackers.

---

## 5. Practical Tips for Effective Use

- Regularly clear and restart sessions to avoid stale or cached data affecting your analysis.
- Use uBO Scope alongside other tools when available to cross-verify network behaviors.
- Understand that some connections made outside of the browser's `webRequest` API (e.g., service workers, some WebSocket traffic) may not be captured.
- Keep in mind that the badge count reflects unique third-party domains contacted, not raw block counts.
- Combine insights from uBO Scope with knowledge of the public suffix list domain groupings to better analyze domain relationships.

<Note>
uBO Scope is designed to work regardless of other content blockers; hence it reveals real connections rather than filtered or obscured counts.
</Note>

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

| Issue | Description | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **No data in popup** | The popup may show 'NO DATA' or question marks if no network requests are captured for the active tab. | Make sure the tab is active and you have browsed a page making network requests. Reload the page if necessary. |
| **Badge count not updating** | Badge text may not refresh immediately after network events or after switching tabs. | Wait a few seconds, then reload the tab or restart the browser if persistent. |
| **Misinterpretation of domains** | Confusing domains with their registrable parent domains can mislead results. | Refer to the public suffix list explanation and uBO Scope's domain aggregation approach. |

Refer also to [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/essentials/troubleshooting) for a broader coverage.

## 7. Advanced Insights: Leveraging Public Suffix List

uBO Scope uses the Mozilla Public Suffix List (PSL) to group related hostnames under their registered domains. Understanding this is key to:

- Group multiple subdomains and hostnames together, reflecting their ownership.
- Avoid misclassifying subdomains as separate entities.

For filter list maintainers, this helps in recognizing when a filter affects an entire domain versus isolated subdomains.

### What Is the Public Suffix List?

The PSL is a comprehensive list of domain suffixes under which Internet users can directly register names. uBO Scope employs a JavaScript implementation of the PSL to resolve domains.

Learn more about the PSL integration and details in [publicsuffixlist.js](https://github.com/gorhill/publicsuffixlist.js).

## Appendix: Example Scenario — Using uBO Scope for Filter Maintenance

You suspect a filter list allows connections to a third-party server that should be blocked.

1. Visit a site with uBO Scope active.
2. Open the uBO Scope popup and check the **Allowed** domains for unexpected entries.
3. Check the **Blocked** and **Stealth-blocked** lists for entries correlating to domains from your filter list.
4. Document domain counts and compare against previous filter versions.
5. Adjust your filter rules accordingly and retest.

Each observation helps improve list accuracy without needing full developer tools or complex setups.
