# Understanding Stealth-Blocking & Advanced Request Outcomes

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide explains how uBO Scope detects and categorizes stealth-blocked network requests and interprets various request outcomes reported by the browser. You will learn how these outcomes are classified as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, and how to leverage this understanding to analyze real-world network activity and build more robust content filters while avoiding false positives.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and active in your browser.
- Basic familiarity with network requests browsing behavior.
- Understanding of third-party network connections and their impact on privacy.

### Expected Outcome
After completing this guide, you will be able to:
- Distinguish stealth-blocked requests from allowed or outright blocked requests.
- Explain what each type of outcome means in the context of network monitoring.
- Utilize this knowledge to make informed judgments about content blocking effectiveness.
- Debunk common misconceptions around blocker test pages and network request outcomes.

### Time Estimate
10-15 minutes to read and digest the concepts alongside your real-world observations.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate: Requires conceptual understanding of network requests and browser extension behavior.

## Understanding Stealth-Blocking & Network Request Outcomes

uBO Scope categorizes network requests in three key outcomes, each reflecting how the request was treated during page load:

### 1. Allowed Requests
- **Definition**: Network requests that successfully complete without being blocked.
- **Significance**: Indicate third-party resources your browser actually connects to.
- **Example**: Loading resources from a CDN or analytics provider not blocked by content filters.

### 2. Blocked Requests
- **Definition**: Requests that fail entirely due to content blocking, reflected as 'error' events.
- **Significance**: Confirm content blockers or network rules prevented the request.
- **Example**: A request to a known ad server rejected by an extension or DNS filter.

### 3. Stealth-Blocked Requests
- **Definition**: Requests that are redirected or modified in ways to evade detection by web pages, often appearing as 'redirect' events.
- **Significance**: These requests are blocked silently or altered to not alert the requesting webpage, a sophisticated approach many blockers use to avoid breakage or detection.
- **Example**: A request that is rerouted internally by the content blocker before reaching its destination, avoiding common detection methods.


## How uBO Scope Detects and Records These Outcomes

1. The browser `webRequest` API provides event listeners for network requests, capturing `onBeforeRedirect`, `onErrorOccurred`, and `onResponseStarted`.
2. uBO Scope queues these events, processing them in batches to categorize each request as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
3. Hostnames and domains from these requests are tracked distinctly to determine the number of unique third-party connections.
4. Results are aggregated per tab and presented in the popup UI with grouped counts.

<Tip>
Stealth-blocking is an advanced method where requests are intercepted and modified or redirected to prevent the originating page from detecting the block, preserving page functionality without exposing network blocking.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Interpret Stealth-Blocking Data

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup on an Active Tab">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to view the current tab's network connections summary.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify 'Stealth-Blocked' Section">
Locate the "stealth-blocked" heading in the popup. This section lists third-party domains whose requests were stealth-blocked.
</Step>

<Step title="Compare with 'Allowed' and 'Blocked' Sections">
Notice the domains under "not blocked" (allowed requests) and "blocked" (requests prevented outright).
</Step>

<Step title="Understand the Implications">
Recognize that stealth-blocked domains represent connections your browser prevented quietly, potentially without breakage or web page awareness.
</Step>

<Step title="Use This Data to Evaluate Content Blocking">
Leverage this data to verify if filters are working effectively: a stealth-blocked domain indicates high-quality blocking, while allowed domains represent requests passing through.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Real-World Examples

Suppose you visit a news website, and your uBO Scope popup shows:

- Allowed: cdn.example.com, fonts.example.com
- Stealth-blocked: tracking.ads.com
- Blocked: banners.ads.com

This means:
- Your browser requested and received resources successfully from allowed domains.
- Requests to `tracking.ads.com` were intercepted stealthily and blocked silently.
- `banners.ads.com` requests were explicitly blocked and failed.

This mix shows how stealth-blocking helps hide blocks from pages while enforced blocking prevents certain third-party connections entirely.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Regularly Check Stealth-Blocked Domains**: Tracking stealth blocking trends helps understand how your filters perform silently.
- **Avoid Relying on Block Counts Alone**: Focus on allowed and stealth-blocked distinctions instead of raw block numbers.
- **Correlate with Real Browsing Behavior**: Use uBO Scope during normal browsing rather than artificial test pages, which often produce misleading results.
- **Use uBO Scope as a Truth Source**: It reports connection outcomes regardless of the blocking technique, surfacing what connections really occur.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Stealth-Blocking Interpretations">
<Accordion title="Why Don’t Some Blockers Show Stealth-Blocked Requests?">
Some blockers do not stealth-block or do not modify requests silently, so stealth-blocked counts may be zero or absent depending on your content blocker behavior.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can Stealth Blocking Cause Website Breakage?">
Stealth blocking is designed to avoid breakage by not alerting the webpage to blocked requests; however, unexpected issues may still occur if the blocking rules are too strict or incomplete.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why Are Some Requests Listed as Redirects?">
Redirect events typically indicate stealth-blocking, where requests are rerouted internally to block or hide network calls.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Popup Shows No Data or Incomplete Data for a Tab">
Ensure uBO Scope is running properly; check the Quick Validation guide to confirm installation and permissions are correct.
