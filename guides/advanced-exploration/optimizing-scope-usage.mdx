# Best Practices for Using uBO-Scope Effectively

Discover how to harness the full potential of uBO-Scope with expert tips and strategies designed to elevate your privacy analysis workflows. This guide focuses on interpreting stealth blocks, understanding limitations inherent in browser APIs, and integrating uBO-Scope insights into broader privacy and content blocking strategies.

## 1. Understanding Stealth Blocks: What They Mean and How to Interpret Them

uBO-Scope categorizes connections into **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**. While "allowed" and "blocked" are straightforward, "stealth-blocked" requires thoughtful interpretation.

- **Stealth blocking** occurs when a network request was redirected or altered such that from the browser's network perspective it did not complete as originally intended but without the extension explicitly blocking it.
- It often indicates subtle or indirect blocking methods employed by content blockers or browser mechanisms to avoid resource loading or fingerprinting.

### Tips for interpreting stealth blocks:
- Consider stealth blocks as *potential* but not guaranteed blocks; they represent connections altered or rerouted in a way that may protect privacy but are less explicit.
- Compare stealth blocks against your content blocker’s behavior to understand which resources are silently prevented or masked.
- Remember stealth blocks still count as connections initiated but effectively prevented or changed.

### Practical scenario:
A CDN domain may appear in stealth-blocked if the content blocker uses redirection or surrogate responses instead of outright blocking, thereby preserving webpage functionality while limiting unwanted tracking.

## 2. Recognizing the Limitations of the webRequest API

uBO-Scope relies heavily on the browser's `webRequest` API to observe network requests. Understanding its constraints is critical for accurate analysis.

- **Partial Coverage:** Not all network activity is visible through `webRequest`. Some requests may bypass this API, such as those initiated by service workers or certain browser internals.
- **No Full Visibility of DNS or OS-level Blocks:** If blocking happens at the DNS or operating system layer, uBO-Scope cannot detect those requests.
- **Asynchronous and Delayed Reporting:** Network requests are queued and processed after short delays (e.g., 1 second), which means the badge and popup data update shortly after the actual request.

### Best practices:
- Use uBO-Scope as a complementary tool rather than the sole source for network analysis.
- Validate findings alongside other browser developer tools when necessary.
- Keep in mind some stealth or blocked connections may show delayed or missing entries due to API restrictions.

## 3. Integrating uBO-Scope Into Your Privacy Workflow

uBO-Scope shines as a transparency and validation tool for real-world network behavior. To maximize its value:

1. **Verify Content Blocker Effectiveness:** Use uBO-Scope to audit which third-party domains are truly connected versus just blocked superficially by your content blocker.
2. **Debunk Misleading Block Metrics:** Compare badge counts and detailed popup lists to understand real privacy exposure beyond generic block counts.
3. **Refine Filter Lists:** Filter list maintainers can cross-reference uBO-Scope's detailed domains and counts to tune blocking rules more effectively.
4. **Monitor Changes Over Time:** Regularly check multiple sites to identify emerging trackers or new third parties.
5. **Combine With Other Tools:** Use alongside browser developer tools, DNS-based blockers, or network monitoring solutions for a multi-layered approach.

### Workflow example:
- Open a privacy-sensitive site.
- Open uBO-Scope popup to review allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Cross-check blocked domains with your content blocker’s filter list.
- Adjust filtering or investigate stealth blocks for further privacy refinement.

## 4. Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls

### Tips
- **Reload pages when testing:** Network connections are recorded per page load; reload to refresh data.
- **Interpret badge count as distinct third-party domains connected:** Lower is better for privacy.
- **Use Unicode domain display feature:** uBO-Scope converts punycode domains to Unicode for better readability.
- **Focus on domains, not hostnames:** Privacy exposure relates more closely to distinct domains than to subdomains or specific hosts.

### Pitfalls
- **Do not rely solely on block counts:** High block counts do not imply better blocking.
- **Avoid testing with fake ad block test sites:** They generate unrealistic traffic not reflective of normal browsing.
- **Watch out for browser-specific quirks:** Some browsers handle webRequest API and redirects differently, affecting what uBO-Scope detects.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues During Usage

If you encounter unexpected behaviors or discrepancies:

- **No badge or popup data:** Ensure uBO-Scope is installed, enabled, and has the necessary permissions.
- **Delayed or missing entries:** Refresh the page or wait briefly for network request processing.
- **Unexpected empty sections (allowed, stealth, blocked):** Confirm you have active network activity on the tab and you are viewing the correct tab in the popup.
- **Stealth block confusion:** Review what stealth blocking means and consider browser or content blocker implementations causing it.
