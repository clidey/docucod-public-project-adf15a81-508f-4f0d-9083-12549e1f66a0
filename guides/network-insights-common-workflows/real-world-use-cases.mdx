# Real-World Use Cases: Tracking and Troubleshooting with uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide walks you through practical scenarios for using uBO Scope to monitor and analyze network connections in real time. You will learn how to identify unwanted trackers, understand website resource usage, and validate the effectiveness of filter lists. These examples provide a hands-on approach to making uBO Scope a powerful tool for privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers alike.

---

## 1. Identifying Unwanted Tracking Domains

### Intent
Pinpoint third-party trackers or suspicious domains that your browser connects to while visiting a website.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope is installed and running on your supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- You have a basic understanding of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked outcomes in the uBO Scope popup.

### Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Visit the Target Website">
Navigate to the webpage you want to analyze in your browser.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup interface showing connection data for the current tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Domain Counts and Categories">
Observe the summary section indicating the number of distinct domains connected.
Open each category section: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Spot Tracking Domains">
Look for unexpected or unknown domains listed under "allowed" or "stealth-blocked" domains.
These may include trackers or analytics services.
</Step>
<Step title="Investigate Domains">
Use external resources (like https://publicsuffix.org/ or domain lookup tools) to research unfamiliar domains.
If serious tracking or potential privacy issues are suspected, consider updating your filter lists or blocking these domains.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Success Criteria
You successfully identify third-party domains categorized by uBO Scope and assess which ones may represent unwanted tracking.

## 2. Analyzing Website Resource Usage

### Intent
Understand which third-party services a visited site relies on and how connections are permitted or blocked.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and operational.
- Familiarity with basic web privacy concepts.

### Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to the Website">
Open the website you want to analyze.
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope popup">
Click on the extension icon to view the popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Note Connection Outcomes">
Review the domains listed under each category:
  - Allowed: Connections that were successful.
  - Stealth-blocked: Connections that were silently blocked (redirects).
  - Blocked: Connections explicitly blocked by the content blocker.
</Step>
<Step title="Count the Distinct Domains">
Check the 'domains connected' count in the summary to quantify network exposure.
</Step>
<Step title="Correlate Domains to Website Features">
Use domain knowledge to map listed domains to website features such as CDN usage, ad networks, analytics.
This helps in understanding which services are integral and which may be third-party add-ons.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Success Criteria
You gain a clear picture of the network footprint of the website, differentiating essential services from potential tracking or ad-related domains.

## 3. Validating Filter List Effectiveness

### Intent
Confirm that your privacy or content blocking filter lists effectively reduce third-party connections by analyzing allowed vs blocked domains.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled.
- A content blocker active with custom or standard filter lists applied.

### Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Clear Current Session Data">
Close or reload tabs to reset uBO Scope’s tracking for a fresh start.
</Step>
<Step title="Browse a Target Site with Filters Enabled">
Visit a site where your filters are expected to block trackers or ads.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup and Observe Counts">
Check the domains connected and review the lists under allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare Domain Counts with and without Filters">
If possible, temporarily disable your content blocker and repeat the visit.
Compare the domain counts and categories between runs to assess blocking effectiveness.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify False Negatives or Positives">
Look for domains that were expected to be blocked but appear under allowed or stealth-blocked.
This may guide filter list adjustments.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Success Criteria
You validate that the filter lists are reducing the number of distinct third-party connections, or identify domains that may need blocking.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices
- **Use the Badge Count:** The toolbar badge indicates distinct connected third-party domains. A lower count typically means better privacy protection.
- **Understand Stealth Blocking:** Domains under stealth-blocked indicate redirect-type blocking, which may not be obvious on the webpage.
- **Check Domain Names Carefully:** Utilize services like the Public Suffix List (uBO Scope uses this internally) or domain lookup websites to investigate suspicious domains.
- **Reload Pages for Accurate Data:** Refreshing pages after changes to filters or extension settings ensures current data reflects your configurations.
- **Session Persistence:** uBO Scope stores data per tab; closing tabs clears relevant session data.

---

## Common Troubleshooting Scenarios

### Issue: Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Sections
- Ensure you have navigated to a webpage in the active tab with network requests.
- Confirm uBO Scope has the required permissions (activeTab, webRequest).
- Reload the tab to trigger fresh network activity.
- Restart the browser if issues persist.

### Issue: Toolbar Badge Does Not Update
- Verify your content blocker or other extensions are not interfering with uBO Scope.
- Check that uBO Scope is enabled and running.
- Try disabling and re-enabling the extension.

### Interpreting Unexpected Domains
- Some legitimate third-party domains like CDNs or analytics are normal.
- Use research tools before blocking to avoid breaking site functionality.

## Advanced Workflows

- **Filter List Maintenance:** Use uBO Scope to audit sites by capturing extensive domain connection data and identifying missed trackers.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Analyze multiple browsers or different filter configurations to benchmark privacy levels.
- **Session Analysis:** Correlate network connection counts across user sessions to detect changes in site behavior or filter efficacy.
