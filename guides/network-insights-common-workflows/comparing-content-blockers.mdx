# Comparing Content Blockers with Connection Counts

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you use uBO Scope as an objective instrument to compare the effectiveness of different content blockers by analyzing the toolbar badge number representing network connection activity. It explains how to interpret the connection counts, debunk common misconceptions about block counts, and assess privacy impacts when evaluating content blockers.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope must be installed and properly configured in your browser.
- A basic understanding of what content blockers do and familiarity with uBO Scope's UI, especially the toolbar badge and popup.
- Different content blockers installed in your browser or separate test environments for comparison.

### Expected Outcome
You will be able to:
- Interpret the uBO Scope badge count accurately as the number of distinct third-party remote servers connecting through the current webpage.
- Understand the implications behind allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Confidently compare content blockers based on real network connection data, avoiding misleading metrics.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10-15 minutes for initial comparison and interpretation.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Testing Environment
- Open your browser with uBO Scope installed.
- Ensure at least one content blocker is active.
- If comparing multiple content blockers, set up separate profiles or sessions where each blocker is enabled individually.

### 2. Navigate to the Website for Testing
- Choose a website to test (ideally one with typical third-party content).
- Load the page fully to allow all network connections to complete.

### 3. Observe the uBO Scope Badge
- Look at the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge number.
- This number shows the count of distinct third-party remote servers to which the browser connected for that page.
- A **lower number indicates fewer third-party connections allowed**, generally implying better privacy enforcement.

### 4. Open the uBO Scope Popup for Detailed Domain Data
- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
- Review the lists of domains organized under these categories:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains the browser connected to.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains whose connections were redirected or otherwise stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked**: Domains actively blocked by the content blocker.

### 5. Repeat Testing Across Different Content Blockers
- Switch to the next content blocker.
- Reload the test website.
- Observe and record the badge count and popup domain lists again.

### 6. Compare Results Based on Distinct Remote Server Connections
- Focus on the **number of allowed third-party domains (badge number)** rather than total block counts.
- Beware that fewer blocks do not necessarily mean poorer protection if fewer third-party connections occur.

### 7. Interpret the Privacy Implications
- A content blocker allowing connections to fewer third-party servers typically offers better privacy.
- High block counts do not equate to better blocking if the overall number of connections to third parties remains high.

## Understanding the Badge Number

- The badge shows the count of **distinct third-party remote servers contacted during page load**.
- This count includes all successful connections visible via the browser's `webRequest` API.
- It does **not** represent how many requests were blocked, but how many domains successfully served resources.
- This focus on distinct servers is critical because multiple blocked requests might occur for a few domains, but privacy risk comes from how many unique third-party servers your browser contacts.

---

## Debunking Common Myths

### Myth 1: "Higher block count means better protection"

- uBO Scope reveals that a high block count can paradoxically be associated with more third-party connections allowed.
- Block counts may reflect multiple attempts targeting the same domains, but the risk depends on how many unique third-party servers actually serve content.
- Always evaluate based on distinct allowed connections, not block count alone.

### Myth 2: "Ad blocker test pages accurately assess blocker reliability"

- Such test pages generate artificial network requests that rarely reflect real-world browsing.
- Many real blockers use stealth techniques undetectable by test pages.
- Trust authentic network activity measurements like those from uBO Scope instead.

---

## Practical Tips for Effective Comparisons

- Test across different types of websites to see real-world content blocker impact.
- Use uBO Scope's **popup lists** to identify which domains are connected or blocked.
- Don't rely on a single site; patterns over multiple sites give stronger insight.
- Clear browsing data or use private sessions to avoid caching skewing results.
- Consider both allowed domains and stealth-blocked domains to understand nuanced blocking behavior.

## Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

### Issue: Badge Count Not Updating
- Ensure the page reloads fully with the tested content blocker enabled.
- Verify uBO Scope has necessary permissions and is not disabled.
- Consult the "Validation & Troubleshooting" guide for detailed checks.

### Pitfall: Comparing Across Browsers Without Accounting for Differences
- Different browsers have different network stacks and APIs.
- Keep comparisons within the same browser family for accuracy.

### Issue: Misreading Stealth-Blocked Domains
- Stealth-blocked domains are not simply blocked; connections were altered or redirected silently.
- Understand that this form of blocking can be more privacy-respecting in some scenarios.

## Real-World Example

Imagine you want to compare uBlock Origin and another content blocker:

1. Enable uBlock Origin and open `example.com`.
2. See uBO Scope badge shows **15** allowed third-party domains.
3. Open popup and note the detailed domains.
4. Disable uBlock Origin, enable the other blocker.
5. Reload the same site and check the badge showing **18**.
6. Despite the other blocker showing higher block counts in its interface, uBO Scope reveals it allows connections to more distinct third-party domains.

**Conclusion:** uBlock Origin provides stronger privacy in this case due to fewer unique third-party connections, despite potentially lower raw block counts.

## Summary
- The badge count is a reliable measure of **distinct allowed third-party server connections**.
- Avoid focusing on blocked request counts alone when judging blocker performance.
- Use uBO Scope popup details to contextualize domain-level network activity.
- Test on real websites in consistent environments for objective comparison.

<Tip>
When comparing content blockers, always prioritize the number of distinct third-party servers your browser contacts over the raw number of blocked requests.

<Warning>
Do not trust automated "ad blocker test" websites to gauge blocker quality. Rely on real network data from tools like uBO Scope.
