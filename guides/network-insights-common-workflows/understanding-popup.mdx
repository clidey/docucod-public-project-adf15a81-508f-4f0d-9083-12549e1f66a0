# Understanding the Popup: Domains and Connection Statuses

## Overview

The uBO Scope popup interface is your gateway to understanding the third-party network connections made by the active browser tab. This page provides a detailed explanation of the popup UI elements, the categorization of domains, and how to leverage this information to assess third-party activity and privacy exposure on webpages.

## What You Will Learn

- The structure and components of the uBO Scope popup interface
- The meaning and significance of Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked domains
- Understanding domain categorization with examples
- How the popup supports informed decisions about network exposure
- Tips for interpreting domain counts and connection data

## 1. The Popup Interface Structure

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup opens, showing a snapshot of network activity related to the current tab. The popup contains the following key elements:

### Current Page Identification

At the top, the popup displays the hostname and domain of the active tab:

- The full hostname is shown, often split into the subdomain and the main domain parts.
- The domain shown uses the Public Suffix List to differentiate registrable domains from subdomains.

> **Example:** For a tab's hostname like `ads.tracker.example.com`, the popup separates and displays `ads.tracker` as the subdomain part, and `example.com` as the main domain.

### Summary Section

- Shows the total **number of distinct domains** contacted by the page.
- This count corresponds to the combined domains under all connection outcome categories.

### Domain Outcome Sections

The popup groups domains into three categories, each with its own section:

| Outcome          | Description                                                            | UI Section Class          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Allowed**      | Domains from which network connections were allowed successfully.      | `.outcome.allowed`        |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains for which connection requests were redirected or otherwise stealth-blocked, making these requests invisible to the page. | `.outcome.stealth`        |
| **Blocked**      | Domains where network connection attempts failed or were explicitly blocked. | `.outcome.blocked`        |

Within each section, a list of domains contacted by the page in this outcome category is shown, each paired with the count of requests made.

> The counts next to each domain represent how many connection attempts were made to that domain during the current page session.

### Domain Entries

- Each domain appears as a text label next to a numeric badge showing request count.
- Domains are displayed in Unicode for readability, using Punycode decoding for internationalized domains.

## 2. Domain Categorization Explained

The categorization into Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked domains reflects the outcome of network requests originating from the page:

### Allowed Domains

- These domains represent connections that successfully completed or were allowed by the browser or any installed content blocker.
- Typically includes first-party domains and third-party domains legitimately loaded by the page.

### Stealth-Blocked Domains

- Requests redirected or blocked in a way that the webpage cannot detect the blocking.
- These stealth mechanisms are commonly used by content blockers to prevent the webpage from detecting blocking activity.
- This category helps reveal invisible network activity intended to be hidden from scripts running on the page.

### Blocked Domains

- Domains where the browser or a content blocker outright blocked or failed the connection attempt.
- Can include ad servers, tracking domains, or other unwanted remote servers.

> Understanding these categories allows you to know not just what connections happen, but also what the webpage attempts invisibly and what your blockers prevent.

## 3. Using Domain Counts and Connection Data

- The toolbar badge reflects the **number of distinct allowed domains** contacted by the active tab.
- Lower badge counts generally indicate fewer third-party exposures, which is desirable for privacy.
- Domains listed under stealth-blocked and blocked sections reflect attempted connections that were suppressed or redirected.

### Practical Example

Suppose you visit a news website:

- The **Allowed** section lists the news site’s CDN and essential third-party services for content delivery.
- The **Stealth-Blocked** section might include analytics or ad platforms whose requests were hidden by your blocker.
- The **Blocked** section shows explicit connections to known ad networks or trackers that were prevented.

## 4. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Review domain entries regularly** to identify unintentional exposure to third parties.
- Use the popup data to assess the effectiveness of your content blockers.
- Remember, some third-party domains in Allowed may be critical for site functionality (e.g., CDN providers).
- The separation into domains rather than individual URLs simplifies spotting the entities involved.

## 5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Do not assume all listed domains are harmful; some legitimate services will always appear.
- The absence of a domain in the popup does not guarantee no connection occurred—this only covers what the browser’s webRequest API reports.
- The extension measures connections in real time; refreshing the popup is needed to see updated results.

## 6. Troubleshooting Popup Data Issues

- **Popup shows "NO DATA" or empty lists:**
  - Ensure you have actively loaded a webpage in the active tab.
  - Confirm the extension has necessary permissions.
  - Reload the tab to allow uBO Scope to capture network events.

- **Badge count not updating:**
  - Wait a moment after loading the tab, as data is processed asynchronously.
  - Disable conflicting extensions that may interfere with webRequest API.

- **Internationalized domains show Punycode:**
  - The popup decodes these automatically; if you see encoded versions, try refreshing the popup.

## 7. Summary

The uBO Scope popup interface provides a clear, categorized view of network domains contacted during the page load. Understanding allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains gives you insights into third-party activity and the effectiveness of content blocking. Use this information to make privacy-conscious decisions and better understand your web exposure.

<Tip>
Always interpret the popup data contextually: a lower count of allowed domains suggests better privacy, but some allowed third parties may be required for proper website function.
</Tip>

<Note>
The popup updates asynchronously after page load; giving it a few seconds ensures accurate network connection counts.
</Note>

<Warning>
Do not rely solely on the block count or domain names to judge if a content blocker is effective. Focus on the distinct allowed third-party domains for a true picture.
</Warning>
