# Debunking Myths: Evaluating Content Blockers with Best Practices

## 1. Understanding the True Meaning Behind Block Counts

### Why Block Counts Are Misleading

Many users judge content blockers based on the block count shown on toolbar badges or test pages. This guide clarifies why this metric is unreliable and how uBO Scope provides a more accurate picture of real-world privacy exposure.

- **Block count is not a quality indicator.** A blocker displaying a higher block count is not necessarily better. In fact, a blocker with a lower block count might be blocking more effectively by preventing connections to a smaller set of third-party servers.
- **What matters is the number of *allowed* distinct third-party servers.** More allowed third-parties means more potential privacy exposure.


### The Correct Metric to Watch

- uBO Scope measures and reports **distinct third-party remote servers connected to by the active webpage.**
- The toolbar badge number represents this count: fewer allowed third-party servers means better privacy.

> **Example:** A content blocker that blocks many requests but still allows connections to numerous third-party servers will have a higher badge count, indicating less privacy protection despite a seemingly higher block count.


## 2. Why "Ad Blocker Test" Webpages Are Unreliable

### What Makes Ad Blocker Test Pages Misleading

- **Fabricated scenarios:** These pages generate network requests to fake or unrealistic server endpoints not commonly found in real websites.
- **Stealth features aren't detected:** Modern blockers use stealthy techniques to block content silently without letting the webpage notice, but test pages often fail to capture these.
- **Not representative of real-world browsing:** Patterns of blocking and allowed connections on these pages don’t reflect typical web usage.


### Practical Impact

Avoid relying on these pages for evaluating or comparing content blockers. Real insights come from monitoring genuine browsing sessions, which is exactly what uBO Scope facilitates by showing actual connections.


## 3. How uBO Scope Helps You Accurately Assess Privacy Exposure

### What uBO Scope Reports

- **Allowed:** Connections that succeeded and were not blocked.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked by content blockers.
- **Stealth:** Requests the blocker intercepted and silently suppressed to prevent detection by webpages.


### Why This Matters

uBO Scope’s reporting helps you:

- See true third-party network connections caused by websites.
- Distinguish between outright blocked connections and stealth-blocked ones that evade detection.
- Avoid basing privacy assessments on block counts or synthetic tests.


### Immediate Value for Users

- Get a realistic measure of your privacy exposure on any webpage.
- Debunk misconceptions about block counts and test page results.
- Validate content blockers using reliable, meaningful data.


## 4. Step-by-Step Guide to Using uBO Scope for Privacy Assessment

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup on an Active Tab">
  Click the browser toolbar icon to open the uBO Scope popup panel on the current tab.
  
  <Check>
  Verify that the popup displays the hostname of the active tab at the top.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret the Distinct Domains Count">
	Locate the "domains connected" summary near the top.
	
	<Info>
	This number shows how many unique third-party domain connections were allowed by your content blocker on this page.
	</Info>
	
	<Check>
	A lower number indicates fewer distinct third-party connections, which is usually more desirable for privacy.
	</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Review Allowed, Stealth, and Blocked Domain Lists">
  Scroll through the three sections:
  - Allowed (not blocked)
  - Stealth-blocked
  - Blocked

  Each shows domains contacted along with the count of requests.

  <Tip>
  Domains in ‘stealth-blocked’ demonstrate blocking that is silent and undetectable by webpages, an advanced privacy protection.
  </Tip>

  <Check>
  Confirm whether any unexpected domains appear as allowed, indicating possible privacy gaps.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>


## 5. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Do not compare block counts across different blockers;** look at allowed distinct third-party counts instead.
- **Avoid ad blocker test pages** for benchmarking; rely on real browsing data.
- **Use uBO Scope regularly** to monitor privacy as you visit common and sensitive websites.
- **For filter list maintainers:** use uBO Scope to detect stealth connections and improve filters.


## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### Pitfall: Misinterpreting High Block Counts as Better Blocking
- Remember that more blocks can mean more allowed distinct third-party connections.
- Assess privacy exposure by focusing on allowed domain counts, which uBO Scope highlights.

### Pitfall: Relying on Synthetic "Test" Pages
- Test pages fail to replicate real browsing scenarios and blocker stealth techniques.
- Trust live browsing data instead.

### Troubleshooting: Popup Shows No Data or "NO DATA"
- Ensure uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled.
- Confirm that you are on an active tab making network requests.
- Reload the page and reopen the popup.
