# Understanding the Badge and Popup Panel

## Overview
This guide walks you through the two main user interface elements of uBO Scope: the **toolbar badge** and the **popup panel**. You will learn how to interpret the badge count, understand the meaning behind the categorized domain summaries displayed in the popup, and navigate the panel to gain insights into the current browser tab's network connection activity.

By mastering these components, you'll be empowered to monitor and evaluate third-party connections detected by your browser, enhancing your awareness of privacy and security implications.

## What the Badge Represents

When you install uBO Scope, the extension's icon on the browser toolbar features a badge that prominently displays a number. This number is:

- **The count of unique third-party domains that successfully made connections in the context of the active browser tab.**

### Why This Matters

- A **lower badge count** means fewer third-party connections — often a stronger privacy posture.
- The badge **excludes blocked or stealth-blocked domains**, focusing only on those from which your browser actually received data.
- This count updates dynamically as you browse, reflecting the third-party domains contacted by the current tab.

<Check>
Keep in mind: the badge measures connected third-party domains, not total block counts or individual requests. This delivers a clear and actionable signal about your exposure to third-party resources.

## Breakdown of the Popup Panel

Clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon opens the **popup panel**, which expands on the badge by showing detailed summaries about connection outcomes for the active tab.

### Key Sections in the Popup

1. **Page Host and Domain Header**
   - Shows the full hostname and the registered domain of the current tab.
   - Example: For `news.example.co.uk`, hostname might show the full string and domain as `example.co.uk`.

2. **Summary Count of Connected Domains**
   - Displays total third-party domains contacted (matching the badge count).

3. **Detailed Outcome Sections** (each lists domains and connection counts)

   The popup separately lists distinct domains categorized by their connection outcome:

   - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
     - Domains your browser connected to without interference.
     - These count towards the badge number.

   - **Stealth-Blocked**
     - Domains whose requests were redirected stealthily (e.g., failed or silently altered connections).
     - These do not count towards the badge.

   - **Blocked**
     - Domains where requests were explicitly blocked or failed to complete.
     - Also excluded from badge count.


### Interpreting the Domain Lists

Each domain row includes:
- The domain name itself (decoded for human readability).
- The count of requests to that domain during the tab session.

This helps identify which third parties are actively connecting or being blocked in your current browsing session.

This categorization gives clear visibility into the nature of third-party connections, letting you make informed decisions about which domains may warrant closer scrutiny or filtering.

## Step-By-Step: Using the Badge and Popup Panel

### 1. Observe the Badge Count

- The number on the badge indicates how many unique third-party domains your active tab has connected to.
- If the badge is empty, no third-party connections have been detected yet.

### 2. Open the Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- The popup will display:
  - The current page's hostname and domain.
  - The total connected domains count.
  - Three collapsible lists of domains by their allowed, stealth, or blocked status.

### 3. Explore Allowance and Blocking Details

- Inspect which domains were allowed connections — these are actively exchanging data.
- Review stealth-blocked and blocked domains to understand what resources were prevented or silently rerouted.

### 4. Use the Request Counts

- The number next to each domain tells you how often your browser requested data from that domain during the tab's lifetime.
- Large counts for suspicious domains may indicate tracking or excessive third-party content.

### 5. Relate Badge to Popup Summary

- The badge number equals the count of distinct domains listed under "not blocked" (allowed).
- If you encounter discrepancies, refreshing or reopening the popup can help ensure data is up-to-date.

<Warning>
The badge and popup data only reflect connections visible via the browser’s webRequest API; some network traffic methods may bypass this and won’t be reported.
</Warning>

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Monitor the badge frequently:** Watch for unexpected spikes in third-party connections when visiting new websites.
- **Use the popup panel to investigate:** If the badge count is higher than expected, open the popup to identify which domains contribute to it.
- **Look for stealth-blocked and blocked domains:** Understanding these can help you evaluate the effectiveness of your content blockers or privacy setup.
- **Remember legitimate third parties:** Some connections are essential (like CDNs); the goal is transparency, not simply zero connections.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Badge and Popup Panel Issues">
  <Accordion title='No Badge Count or Popup Data Shows Up'>
    Check that uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your browser. Verify permissions to access webRequest are granted. Reload the tab to trigger connection tracking.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='Badge Shows Unexpectedly High Counts'>
    Open the popup and review the allowed domains list. Identify if unfamiliar or suspicious domains are generating excessive requests. Consider tightening content blocking or using filters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='Popup Panel Displays "NO DATA" or Empty Sections'>
    This can occur if the tab has just loaded and connections data isn't yet gathered. Reloading the popup or the tab usually refreshes the data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='Counts Not Updating as Expected'>
    The badge and popup update on a short delay (about 1 second). If data seems stale, close and reopen the popup or refresh the tab.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How the Badge and Popup Fit Into Your Workflow

The badge serves as an **at-a-glance privacy indicator**, while the popup panel offers a **detailed investigative view**. Together, they enable:

- Rapid evaluation of third-party exposure by domain count.
- Deep dives into specific domain activity during tab sessions.
- Informed adjustment of privacy tools based on observed connections.

Use these in combination to maintain transparency and control over your browsing network footprint.

## Appendix: Understanding Domain Grouping and Outcomes

uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List to accurately group domains by registered domain names. This means multiple subdomains like `a.example.com` and `b.example.com` count under the single domain `example.com`.

### Connection Outcome Categories Explained

| Category        | Meaning                                                                 | Badge Count Inclusion |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Not Blocked     | Requests succeeded and data was received                                | Yes                   |
| Stealth-Blocked | Requests that were redirected or silently prevented                     | No                    |
| Blocked         | Requests explicitly blocked or failed to complete                       | No                    |

Tracking these outcomes per tab provides the foundation for both the badge display and the popup's detailed report.

## Visual Example

When you browse to a site, imagine your badge shows `4`. Clicking the icon opens the popup that lists:

- `allowed` domains: `cdn.example.com` (15 requests), `ads.publisher.net` (3 requests), `fonts.googleapis.com` (8 requests), and `analytics.example.org` (1 request)
- `stealth-blocked`: `tracker.evil-site.com` (5 requests)
- `blocked`: `badads.malicious.net` (7 requests)

This tells you the 4 distinct domains you’re connecting to, while some suspicious domains are being stealth-blocked or blocked.

Use this visibility to balance your browsing performance and privacy.
