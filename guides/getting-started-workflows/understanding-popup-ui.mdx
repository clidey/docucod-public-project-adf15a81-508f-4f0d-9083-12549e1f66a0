# Exploring the Popup UI: Domains and Statuses

## Overview
This guide helps you understand how to read and interpret the information shown in the uBO Scope popup interface for the active browser tab. You will learn what the different domain groups mean—`Allowed`, `Stealth-blocked`, and `Blocked`—and how to assess third-party remote server connections effectively.

By mastering the popup UI, you gain clear insight into which third-party domains your current webpage communicates with, whether those connections succeeded, were stealthily blocked, or fully blocked.

## 1. Understanding the Popup Interface

When you click the uBO Scope extension icon, a popup window appears showing connection details for the active tab. The popup is divided into several sections:

- **Tab Hostname**: Displays the main hostname and its parent domain for the current webpage.
- **Summary**: Shows the total number of distinct third-party domains connected to by the active tab.
- **Outcome Sections**: Three categorized lists of domains grouped by connection outcome:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
  - **Stealth-blocked**
  - **Blocked**

Each domain listed also shows the count of distinct requests observed for that domain.

<Tip>
The tab hostname at the top helps confirm which site you are inspecting. If unfamiliar, it can alert you to third-party connections originating from embedded content.
</Tip>

## 2. Section-by-Section Breakdown

### Tab Hostname
- Shows the full hostname and its registered domain.
- Example: For `example.cdn.cloudflare.net`, it might display `example.cdn.` as a prefix and `cloudflare.net` as the base domain.
- This helps identify the primary webpage origin.

### Summary: Domains Connected
- Indicates the distinct count of third-party domains with successful connections.
- This number corresponds to the badge count on the browser toolbar icon.
- A lower count typically means fewer third-party connections, which is desirable for privacy.

### Allowed Domains (Not Blocked)
- Lists third-party domains from which resources were successfully retrieved (network requests with outcome "success").
- These connections may include assets like scripts, images, or ads that were allowed through.

### Stealth-blocked Domains
- These domains represent connections that were redirected or somehow stealthily blocked.
- "Stealth-blocked" means the connection attempt was hidden from the webpage, typically by content blockers or browser network filtering.
- The webpage is not made aware of these blocked attempts.

### Blocked Domains
- Domains here correspond to fully blocked connections (requests that failed or errored out).
- These could be blocked by content blockers, browser policies, or network errors.

<Tip>
Comparing the `Allowed`, `Stealth-blocked`, and `Blocked` lists can give a nuanced view of how many third-party connections are fully successful, partly hidden, or fully denied.
</Tip>

## 3. How to Read the Domain Lists

- Each domain entry shows the domain name (decoded if punycode was used).
- The numeric badge next to each domain shows how many distinct requests to that domain were observed.
- Domains within an outcome category are sorted alphabetically for easier lookup.

<Info>
Domains with counts indicate repeated network activity (e.g., multiple images, scripts).

## 4. Practical Example

Imagine you visit a news site and open the uBO Scope popup.

- The **Tab Hostname** shows `news.example.com`.
- The **Summary** reports `15` domains connected.
- Under **Allowed**, you see domains like `cdn.adsnetwork.net` and `images.cdn.example.com` with request counts.
- **Stealth-blocked** includes domains like `tracking.analytics.com`, indicating attempts the content blocker hid.
- **Blocked** lists `ads.badtracker.com`, showing outright blocked requests.

This snapshot tells you which third parties are active on the current page and how the content blocker responded.

---

## 5. Tips for Effective Use

- **Refresh the page** after installing or enabling uBO Scope to collect fresh data.
- Use the **popup view alongside the toolbar badge** to cross-check connection counts.
- Understand that **some stealth-blocked domains may not appear as blocked to the page itself**, indicating a stealthy blocking method.
- **Look for unexpected domains** you don't recognize for potential privacy concerns.

---

## 6. Common Questions and Troubleshooting

### Why do some domains appear in multiple categories?
- Domains won't appear in multiple categories simultaneously in the popup for the same tab session because the extension categorizes each network request by its final outcome.

### The popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty lists; what should I do?
- Ensure the active tab has fully loaded and network traffic occurred.
- Reload the webpage to trigger fresh data capture.
- Verify the extension is active and has required permissions.

### Why is the badge count different from the sum of domain counts shown?
- The badge reflects the count of distinct allowed third-party domains only, not summing stealth or blocked connections.

## 7. Next Steps

Once comfortable with interpreting the popup UI:

- Explore how the badge counts relate to actual connection data in the guide [Interpreting Toolbar Badge Counts and Metrics](guides/getting-started-workflows/interpreting-badge-counts).
- Review [Core Concepts & Terminology](overview/architecture-concepts/core-terminology) to deepen your understanding of outcomes and third-party definitions.
- Use the information to compare different content blockers by following [Comparing Content Blockers Using uBO Scope](guides/practical-analyses-advanced-usage/analyzing-content-blockers).
