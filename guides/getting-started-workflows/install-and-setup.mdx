## 2. Installation Steps

### Step 1: Choose Your Browser

Confirm your browser version meets the minimum supported release:

| Browser              | Minimum Version      |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Chromium-based       | 122.0 or later       |
| Firefox (desktop & Android) | 128.0 or later       |
| Safari               | 18.5 or later        |

If your browser is not up to date, please update before proceeding.

### Step 2: Install From Official Extension Store

Locate uBO Scope in your browser's official extension store using the links below:

- **Chromium (Chrome Web Store):** [uBO Scope on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- **Firefox:** [uBO Scope Add-on on Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

For Safari, installation is typically done through the App Store or via developer provisioning compatible with Safari Web Extensions.

### Step 3: Add the Extension

- Click the **Add to Browser** or **Install** button.
- Approve any permission requests presented:
  - Access to active tabs.
  - Access to web requests (`webRequest` permission).
  - Storage permissions for saving session data.

These are essential for uBO Scope to monitor network requests and record its data.

### Step 4: Confirm the Extension is Enabled

- Verify the uBO Scope icon appears in your browser toolbar.
- Ensure the icon does not show a disabled or grayed-out state.

If the icon is missing after installation, enable the extension through your browser's extensions or add-ons management page.

## 3. Initial Setup and First Actions

### Step 1: Understand Permissions

Upon activation, uBO Scope asks for access to monitor web requests across all HTTP/HTTPS URLs. This access is mandatory for its core functionality of reporting remote connections.

<Tip>
Granting these permissions ensures the extension can observe requests to all domains, including third-party servers, enabling comprehensive reports.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Access the Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- The popup panel will open, showing an overview of network connections for the current active tab, including:
  - Domains contacted without being blocked ("not blocked" section).
  - Stealth-blocked domains.
  - Completely blocked domains.
  - Summary count of distinct third-party domains contacted.

### Step 3: Verify Initial Data Collection

- Visit a trusted website or a site you frequently use.
- Open the uBO Scope popup panel.
- Observe that domain counts and domain lists populate, reflecting active network connections.

### Step 4: Check Badge Behavior

- Notice the badge count on the toolbar icon updates to show the number of distinct third-party remote servers allowed.
- A lower badge count generally indicates fewer third-party connections, reflecting better privacy.

### Step 5: Basic Configuration (If Applicable)

uBO Scope currently does not require or offer configuration settings upon installation. It operates transparently with default settings.

## 4. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Keep uBO Scope enabled alongside your primary content blocker (e.g., uBlock Origin) to gain independent and detailed network visibility.
- Use the popup panel regularly to audit third-party connections on sites you visit.
- Remember that some connections reported as allowed are legitimate services (e.g., content delivery networks).
- Do not judge content blocker performance solely on “block count” badges; instead, focus on the distinct remote connections count.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Installation Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Extension Icon Not Visible in Toolbar">
- Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extension management page.
- If hidden, pin the extension icon to the toolbar.
- Restart the browser if changes do not reflect immediately.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- Wait a few seconds after loading a webpage for the badge to update as network requests are processed asynchronously.
- Verify the extension has permissions to observe web requests.
- Disable conflicting extensions temporarily to check for interference.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title='Popup Panel Shows No Data or "NO DATA" Message'>
- Confirm you have an active tab with network activity.
- Refresh the current tab and reopen the popup panel.
- If persistent, reinstall the extension to reset session data.
</Accordion>
