# Reviewing Third-Party Connections with uBO Scope

Discover exactly which remote domains your browser connects to while browsing a website. This guide walks you through opening the uBO Scope popup, understanding the categories of connection outcomes, and evaluating potential privacy implications of these third-party connections.

---

## 1. Understanding Third-Party Connections

When browsing the web, your browser often connects not only to the primary website's domain but also to multiple third-party domains, such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), analytics, trackers, or other services. uBO Scope reveals these connections, allowing you to see which domains are involved, whether connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or explicitly blocked.

<u>Key concepts:</u>
- **Allowed domains**: Third-party servers your browser successfully connected to.
- **Stealth-blocked domains**: Domains where connection attempts were blocked in a stealthy manner, meaning the browser or content blocker prevented the connection without the webpage detecting the block.
- **Blocked domains**: Domains where connection attempts explicitly failed or were blocked and identifiable.

Understanding these categories helps you differentiate between benign third parties and potentially privacy-invasive connections.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before reviewing third-party connections, ensure:

- uBO Scope is installed and active in your browser (see [Installation and Activation](https://docs.example.com/guides/getting-started-workflows/installation-activation)).
- You have navigated to the website you want to inspect.
- You are aware of the basic interpretation of the toolbar badge (see [Interpreting the Badge and Popup](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/getting-value-quickstart/interpreting-badge-popup)).

---

## 3. Accessing the uBO Scope Popup

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

Find the uBO Scope extension icon on your browser's toolbar. Its badge displays a number indicating the count of distinct third-party domains connected for the active tab.

### Step 2: Open the Popup

- Click on the uBO Scope icon.
- The popup panel will open, displaying detailed connection information for the current browser tab.

> The popup automatically fetches real-time data about the active tab’s connections using the browser's webRequest API.

### What You Should See

- The primary domain of the current tab prominently displayed.
- A summary count of connected domains.
- Three sections listing domains by their connection outcome:
  - **Not Blocked** (allowed)
  - **Stealth-Blocked**
  - **Blocked**

---

## 4. Interpreting the Domain Lists

### Allowed Domains (Not Blocked)

These are third-party domains your browser successfully connected to. This list typically contains legitimate services such as CDN providers, analytics platforms, or trusted content sources.

- Each domain is accompanied by a request count indicating how many connection attempts were made.
- Keep an eye out for unexpected or suspicious domains here.

### Stealth-Blocked Domains

Domains where connection attempts were blocked silently by content blockers or privacy extensions.

- These connections never reached the server, and the blocking is hidden from the webpage to avoid detection.
- High counts in this list can indicate strong privacy enforcement.

### Blocked Domains

Domains where connection attempts led to errors or explicit blocking events.

- These may be connections blocked by network filters, browser security, or manually.
- This list helps identify connections that failed or were deliberately prevented.

## 5. Step-by-Step Walkthrough: Review a Website’s Connections

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Target Website">
Go to the website whose network connections you want to review. Allow the page to fully load so that all network requests can be captured.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser. This opens the popup panel showing connection details.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the Main Tab Domain">
At the top of the popup, confirm the domain representing the current browser tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Connections">
Look at the “not blocked” section. These domains represent third-party servers your browser successfully connected to. Note the request counts for each domain.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Examine domains under the “stealth-blocked” heading. Understand which requests were blocked silently, preventing potential page breakage or detection.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Blocked Domains">
Review the “blocked” domains. A domain appearing here means connection failures or explicit blocks occurred.
</Step>
<Step title="Evaluate Privacy Risks">
Identify any unexpected or suspicious third-party domains, especially in the allowed domains. Consider investigating these domains further or adjusting your content blocking to manage them.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Regularly monitor third-party connections** especially on privacy-sensitive websites.
- **Use the badge count as a quick privacy indicator**, but always review detailed popup data for context.
- **Recognize benign third parties**, like major CDNs, which typically have low privacy risk.
- **Look for unusual domains in allowed connections** that might represent trackers or ads.
- **Be aware of stealth-blocked domains as a measure of your content blocker’s effectiveness.**
- **Clear the session** or reload the browser tab if data seems outdated or inconsistent.

## 7. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Third-Party Connection Reviews">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or 'NO DATA'">
- Ensure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions.
- Reload the browser tab to allow new network data capture.
- Confirm that the browser supports webRequest API for your extension.
- Verify that you have the latest version installed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
- Reload the tab and try again.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions that might block network monitoring.
- Confirm internet access is stable.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Domains in Allowed List">
- Some third-party domains are legitimate but may appear unfamiliar.
- Lookup these domains online to understand their role.
- Adjust your content blocker or filter lists if necessary to block unwanted connections.

## 8. Advanced: Understanding Connection Categories

| Category        | Description                                                        | User Impact                                   |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Allowed         | Connections successfully completed to third-party domains         | May include trackers or useful resources      |
| Stealth-Blocked | Connections silently blocked by content blockers without detection | Strong privacy protection without breakage   |
| Blocked         | Connections blocked or failed explicitly                           | Visible block events, user can verify blocking|

This categorization helps you precisely interpret the network activity and effectiveness of your privacy controls.
