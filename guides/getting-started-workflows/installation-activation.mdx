## 2. Step-by-Step Installation and Activation

<Steps>
<Step title="Install uBO Scope from Your Browser's Extension Store">
Follow the appropriate instructions based on your browser:

- **Chrome:**
  1. Go to the [Chrome Web Store page for uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
  2. Click **Add to Chrome**.
  3. Confirm any prompts to add the extension.

- **Firefox:**
  1. Visit the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
  2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
  3. Allow necessary permissions when prompted.

- **Safari:**
  1. Open the [Safari Extensions section](https://apps.apple.com/app/ubo-scope-extension) in the App Store (or your configured source).
  2. Download and install uBO Scope.
  
**Expected Result:**
The uBO Scope icon appears in your browser toolbar, ready for activation.

**Tip:** Pin or keep the extension icon visible for easy access to its popup view.
</Step>

<Step title="Activate uBO Scope and Grant Permissions">
After installation:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your toolbar.
2. If your browser requires permission confirmation (e.g., access to active tabs or storage), grant these permissions.
3. Reload any open webpages where you want to monitor connections.


**Expected Result:**
- uBO Scope is fully activated.
- It begins monitoring network requests within each browser tab.

**Important:**
The extension relies on `webRequest` permissions to track network traffic accurately. Without these, uBO Scope cannot report connection details. Make sure you accept all permission requests.

</Step>

<Step title="Verify uBO Scope is Operational">
Ensure uBO Scope is correctly tracking network activity by:

1. Clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup UI.
2. Visiting a live website with network activity (e.g., a news site, social media, or your favorite portal).
3. Observing the badge count on the extension icon — this number represents the distinct third-party domains contacted.
4. In the popup, verify that the domains are categorized under **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

**Successful Verification Means:**
- You see a non-zero badge count on active pages.
- The popup presents domain counts and details.
- The displayed data updates when you navigate browser tabs or reload pages.

**If No Data Appears:**
- Reload the page and try again.
- Check browser permission settings.
- Review troubleshooting tips below.
</Step>
