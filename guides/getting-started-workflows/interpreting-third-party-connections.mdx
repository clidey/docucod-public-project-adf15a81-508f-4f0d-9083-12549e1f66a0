# Interpreting Third-party Connections and Outcomes

## Overview
This guide helps you understand how to analyze the uBO Scope popup report and toolbar badge. You will learn to distinguish between legitimate third-party domains and those that may impact your privacy. Using this knowledge, you’ll be empowered to make informed decisions about your browsing habits and refine your content blocker settings.

**Intended users:** Privacy-conscious individuals, filter list maintainers, and anyone desiring deeper insight into browser network activity as reported by uBO Scope.

## What This Page Covers
- How to read the popup panel's categorized connection lists
- Understanding the badge count and its significance
- Differentiating first-party from third-party connections
- Identifying allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections
- Using these insights to adjust browsing and content-blocking behavior


---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### What You Will Accomplish
You will be able to interpret the detailed lists of remote servers your browser connects to for each active tab, as shown in the popup panel, and understand what each connection outcome means. This allows you to evaluate which third parties are legitimately part of your browsing experience and which might pose privacy risks.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope is installed and active in your browser (Chromium, Firefox, or Safari).
- You have basic familiarity with how extensions show the badge icon and popup.
- You are viewing a website with active network requests.

### Expected Outcome
By the end, you will confidently use the uBO Scope popup to:
- Understand the number of unique third-party domains contacted
- Recognize the difference between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections
- Leverage this to improve your privacy setup

### Time Estimate
About 15 minutes to gain working familiarity

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## 2. Understanding the Popup Panel and Badge

### The Toolbar Badge
- Displays a numeric count showing **how many unique third-party domains are connected** by the current active tab.
- A *lower* number signals fewer external connections and typically better privacy.
- The badge does **not** indicate blocks but counts allowed remote servers contacted.

### The Popup Panel Breakdown
When you click the badge, the popup displays:

1. **Domains Connected Summary**
   - Shows the total number of third-party domains contacted.

2. **Not Blocked Section**
   - Lists domains that the browser connected to successfully without obstruction.
   - These constitute the active third-party connections delivering content.

3. **Stealth-blocked Section**
   - Lists domains whose network requests were redirected or otherwise handled stealthily.
   - These do not appear blocked outright but are modified silently to prevent tracking.

4. **Blocked Section**
   - Lists domains where network requests were explicitly blocked.
   - These connections never completed, often due to content blocker enforcement.

## 3. Step-by-step: Interpreting Results

### Step 1: Open the Popup Panel
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar badge to launch the popup panel for the active tab.
- The page hostname is displayed at the top.

### Step 2: Read the "domains connected" count
- This number reflects all distinct third-party domains your browser contacted.
- Remember, this includes only *remote servers*, excluding the page's own origin.
- Use this as a quick privacy barometer.

### Step 3: Examine the "not blocked" domains
- These domains represent third-parties serving content to the page.
- Common legitimate domains include large CDN providers or services you recognize.
- Investigate unfamiliar domains to assess if they might track or serve ads.

### Step 4: Review "stealth-blocked" domains
- Requests here might be redirected or altered by your content blocker to suppress tracking.
- These often include trackers or ad servers.
- Stealth blocking is a subtle privacy feature to avoid page breakage while limiting data leaked.

### Step 5: Check "blocked" domains
- These are explicitly denied connections by content blockers.
- A high number indicates aggressive blocking but does not necessarily correlate to better privacy if many allowed connections remain.

### Step 6: Look for counting badges next to domains
- Each domain shows a count of how many connection attempts occurred.
- Higher counts might indicate persistent or repeated tracking attempts.

## 4. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Focus on Third Parties:** The badge counts only third-party domains, so any allowed domain here is external and potentially privacy-impacting.
- **Recognize Legitimate CDNs:** Many large websites load assets from Content Delivery Networks like `cloudflare.net` or `akamai.net`. These typically appear as allowed domains.
- **Investigate Unknown Domains:** Use domain lookup tools and lists to investigate obscure or suspicious domains.
- **Use the Information to Adjust Content Blockers:** If you identify allowed domains that are trackers or ad servers, you may want to add or tune your content blockers accordingly.
- **Remember Stealth Blocking Intention:** Don’t be alarmed if some domains appear in stealth-blocked; this is a privacy-preserving action taken by filters.
- **Regularly Check the Badge:** A change in badge count while browsing signals different third-party exposures.

## 5. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Misinterpreting Badge as Block Count:** The badge shows allowed third-party domains, not blocked ones. More blocks does not always mean better protection.
- **Assuming All Third Parties Are Bad:** Many third-party connections are essential for website functionality.
- **Confusing Subdomains and Domains:** uBO Scope groups counts by domain using the Public Suffix List, so subdomains of the same domain aggregate counts.
- **Ignoring Stealth Blocking:** Lack of domain in the blocked list does not mean it’s allowed; stealth blocking might have handled it quietly.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **No Data in Popup or Badge Is Empty:** Ensure uBO Scope is installed correctly and tracking is enabled.
- **Unexpectedly High Badge Count:** Visit a simpler website to compare; some sites use many third-party resources.
- **Domains Appear in Multiple Sections:** Domains are grouped by outcome per tab load; rendering might update over time.
- **Unicode Domain Names:** Some domains use international characters; uBO Scope translates these to readable form.

## Illustrative Example

Imagine you’re browsing `example.com`. Opening the uBO Scope popup reveals:

- Badge count shows `12` — twelve unique third-party domains detected.
- Not blocked domains include known CDNs like `cloudflare.net` and `cdn.examplecdn.com`.
- Stealth-blocked domains show trackers such as `ads.tracker.com` quietly redirected.
- Blocked domains list `badads.example.net` where requests are outright refused.

Armed with this information, you confirm your privacy filters are working effectively but decide to add a custom filter to block one stealth domain that caught your eye.

## Summary
The "Interpreting Third-party Connections and Outcomes" guide empowers you to analyze the detailed network activity per tab reported by uBO Scope. It explains the meaning behind the badge count and the connection categories within the popup panel, guiding you to differentiate essential third-party services from potential privacy risks. This knowledge is vital for optimizing your browsing privacy and refining content blocker configurations.
