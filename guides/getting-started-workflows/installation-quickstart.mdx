## 2. Step-by-Step Installation and First Use

### 2.1 Install uBO Scope on Your Browser

1. **Choose Your Browser:**
   - Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)
   - Mozilla Firefox
   - Apple Safari

2. **Install Via Official Store:**
   - Chromium: Visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp), click **Add to Chrome**.
   - Firefox: Visit [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/), click **Add to Firefox**.
   - Safari: Install manually from source or Safari Extensions Gallery, ensuring browser version is 18.5 or higher.

<Tip>
For Safari users, due to platform restrictions, manual installation may require additional steps such as enabling developer mode or loading the extension temporarily.
</Tip>

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - After installation, the uBO Scope icon (a stylized badge) should appear in the browser toolbar.

### 2.2 Understanding uBO Scope Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network connections:

- **activeTab:** Allows the extension to access data related to the active browser tab.
- **storage:** Enables the extension to save and retrieve session data locally.
- **webRequest:** Grants the ability to observe and report network requests.
- **host permissions:** Access to all http(s) and websocket URLs to monitor network traffic.

<Note>
These permissions are essential for uBO Scope’s transparent monitoring of third-party connections. No content is blocked or modified; this is a reporting tool.
</Note>

### 2.3 Accessing the uBO Scope Popup

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.

2. The popup panel will open showing:
   - The domain of the active tab.
   - Counts of connected domains grouped by **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth-blocked**.
   - Detailed lists of domains under each category.

3. The toolbar badge displays the count of distinct third-party remote domains allowed on that tab.

### 2.4 Confirming uBO Scope is Working

1. Open any website you trust and want to analyze.

2. Observe the toolbar badge number — this reflects third-party domains contacted.

3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup and view detailed connection outcomes.

4. Verify that domain names and counts appear correctly under their respective sections.

<Check>
If the popup shows “NO DATA” or is empty, refresh the page or try visiting a different site to generate network requests.
</Check>

### 2.5 Best Practices for a Smooth First Use

- Start with frequently visited, stable websites to see predictable connection patterns.
- Understand that a lower badge number indicates fewer third-party connections — generally better for privacy.
- Refresh pages after installing uBO Scope to generate accurate network data.

Each domain entry includes a count of requests.
