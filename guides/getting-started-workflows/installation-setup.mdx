# Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope

This guide provides all the steps needed to install uBO Scope on your browser (Chromium-based browsers or Firefox), understand the required permissions, and perform your initial configuration. Once complete, you'll be ready to monitor third-party network requests and visualize connection details directly from the browser toolbar popup.

## 1. Installation Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Achieves
You will successfully install uBO Scope, configure essential permissions, and confirm the extension is actively capturing remote server connection data across your open browser tabs.

### Prerequisites

  - **Firefox:** Version 128.0 or higher
- Stable internet connection to download the extension
- Access to the browser's extension/add-on store or permission to side-load extensions (optional manual install)

### Expected Outcome
- uBO Scope is installed and visible in the browser toolbar
- Browser permissions are granted for activeTab, webRequest, and storage access
- The extension badge is ready to display distinct third-party connection counts

### Estimated Time
Approximately 5–10 minutes depending on your browser and familiarity with extension installation.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner-friendly with clear, step-by-step instructions.

## 2. Step-by-Step Installation and Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose Your Browser and Install uBO Scope">
<ul>
<li>Go to the official store for your browser:</li>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome Web Store (Chromium)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox Add-ons</a></li>
</ul>
<li>Click ‘Add to Chrome’ or ‘Add to Firefox’ and follow prompts to complete installation.</li>
<li>If you prefer manual installation (e.g., development or custom builds), follow the build instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a>.</li>
</ul>
<Check>
Ensure the extension icon appears in your browser toolbar after installation.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Review and Accept Extension Permissions">
<ul>
<li>uBO Scope requires the following permissions to function correctly:</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>activeTab</strong>: To access data for the current active tab.</li>
<li><strong>webRequest</strong>: To listen to all outgoing network requests performed by webpages.</li>
<li><strong>storage</strong>: To store session and configuration data locally.</li>
<li><strong>host permissions</strong>: To monitor network requests made to any HTTP, HTTPS, or WebSocket URLs.</li>
</ul>
<li>Your browser will prompt to grant these permissions during installation; accept them to proceed.</li>
</ul>
<Note>
These permissions are fundamental for uBO Scope to monitor connections fully and display accurate metrics.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Installation and Access uBO Scope Popup">
<ul>
<li>Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.</li>
<li>The popup interface will open, initially showing the current tab’s connected domains and their statuses.</li>
<li>If seeing "NO DATA" or empty results at first, reload the current tab to start capturing network requests.</li>
</ul>
<Check>
The popup should display the domain of the current webpage at the top along with three sections: <em>not blocked</em>, <em>stealth-blocked</em>, and <em>blocked</em>.</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Basic Settings After First Launch">
<ul>
<li>Currently, uBO Scope does not require complex manual configuration.</li>
<li>The extension automatically tracks network requests and updates the badge count indicating distinct third-party domains connected without being blocked.</li>
<li>Make sure your browser’s content blocking or privacy settings do not interfere with the extension's permissions or webRequest access.</li>
</ul>
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Understanding Extension Permissions

uBO Scope needs broad network permissions to deliver its core purpose:

- **activeTab:** Allows uBO Scope to query and show data related to your current browsing tab.
- **webRequest:** Critical permission enabling uBO Scope to listen to network events in real-time for all HTTP(s) and WebSocket connections, including redirects, errors, and successful requests.
- **storage:** Allows saving session information so data persists during your browsing and across tabs.
- **Host Permissions:** Specific URL scope `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, and `ws://*/*` ensures all network requests on the web are monitored.

<Tip>
Without these permissions, uBO Scope cannot monitor and report the network activities that are central to its value.
</Tip>

## 4. Post-Installation Validation

To make sure uBO Scope is capturing connections correctly:

1. Open any webpage in your browser.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to view its popup.
3. If the page’s hostname appears with connected domains in the allowed, stealth, or blocked sections, the extension is working.
4. If no data is shown, reload the page and verify permissions.
5. The toolbar badge number reflects the count of distinct third-party domains the page connected to without being blocked.

<Check>
Reloading webpages and checking popup updates confirms proper installation and setup.
</Check>

## 5. Tips for a Smooth Installation Experience

- **Keep browser updated**: Older browser versions might not support the required webRequest APIs fully.
- **Extension conflicts**: Some privacy or security extensions may restrict uBO Scope's permission to listen on webRequest; evaluate potential conflicts.
- **Clear browser cache** if you experience stale data display.
- **If performing manual installation**, ensure you load the correct manifest file for your browser platform (Chromium or Firefox).
- **Restart your browser** after installation if the extension icon or functionality does not appear immediately.
