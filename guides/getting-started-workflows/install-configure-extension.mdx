## 4. Initial Configuration and Permission Verification

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to capture all webpage network activity precisely. This step ensures the extension has the necessary access.

### 4.1 Overview of Required Permissions

- **webRequest**: Allows the extension to monitor all web requests the browser processes.
- **activeTab**: Grants temporary access to interact with the active webpage.
- **storage**: Enables storing session and configuration data.
- **host permissions** on `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and websocket URLs (`ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) to observe relevant traffic.

These permissions are crucial for accurate and comprehensive monitoring, unaffected by other content blockers or DNS filtering.

### 4.2 Steps to Verify Permissions

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
2. If prompted by your browser, approve any permission requests.
3. Open your browser's Extension Management page:
   - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/` or via menu > Extensions
   - Firefox: `about:addons` > Extensions
   - Safari: Safari Preferences > Extensions
4. Locate uBO Scope and verify it has the permissions listed above. In manifest files:
   - Chromium and Firefox versions explicitly request `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
   - These are visible in permissions or details sections.

### 4.3 Confirm Initial Extension Behavior

- The toolbar icon will not show a badge if no network activity is detected.
- Upon navigating to a webpage, the extension records network connections and updates badge counts.

## 5. Practical Installation and Configuration Example

3. Observe the badge count increase, indicating the number of distinct third-party connections.
4. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup and see detailed domain listings sorted by connection status (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).

This practical example demonstrates how installation and configuration enable immediate network visibility.
