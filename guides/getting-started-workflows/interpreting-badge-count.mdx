# Interpreting the Badge Count and Results

## Understanding the Badge Count

When you install and activate uBO Scope, the toolbar icon badge immediately becomes a powerful indicator of your browser’s network connections. The badge count displays **the number of distinct third-party remote servers** contacted by the currently active webpage.

- **Third-party remote servers** are any domains different from the main website domain you are visiting.
- The badge reflects **only those domains with successful or attempted network connections**.

A key user insight is that a **lower badge count is more desirable**. Why? Because contacting fewer third parties typically means fewer external entities can track or interact with your browsing session.

> **Note:** A high badge count often signals a webpage contacting many third-party servers, which could impact privacy, performance, and security.

---

## What Does the Badge Count Represent?

uBO Scope categorizes third-party connections into three outcomes:

- **Allowed**: Connections that were completed successfully.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Connections that were silently redirected or altered, usually by content blockers or other browser mechanisms.
- **Blocked**: Connections that were explicitly blocked or failed due to network errors.

**Only the "Allowed" category contributes to the badge count**, representing third-party domains that actually exchanged data with the browser.


### Why Focus on Distinct Domains?

Many webpages contact the same third-party domains multiple times (for resources like ads, analytics, fonts, or tracking).

- Showing only distinct domains prevents inflated counts that misrepresent the real scope of third-party exposure.
- For example, contacting one third-party CDN multiple times counts as **one** domain, not many.

## Assessing Your Online Privacy Posture Using the Badge

1. **Evaluate the Number:**
   - **Low count (e.g., 1–3)** usually indicates minimal third-party exposure.
   - **Moderate to high count (e.g., 10 or more)** suggests increased connections to various third parties, potentially increasing tracking risk.

2. **Review the Details in the Popup:**
   Click the toolbar icon to open uBO Scope’s popup panel. It breaks down connections by their outcome categories:
   - **Allowed**: Domains from which resources were loaded.
   - **Stealth-blocked**: Domains where connection attempts were subtly redirected or stealthily blocked.
   - **Blocked**: Domains explicitly blocked (often by your content blocker).

3. **Identify Legitimate Third Parties:**
   - Commonly legitimate third parties include content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics services, or essential resource servers.
   - These usually appear with low counts and are often trustworthy.

4. **Spot Suspicious or Unnecessary Third Parties:**
   - Advertising networks, trackers, or unfamiliar domains are potential privacy risks.
   - High counts combined with many stealth or blocked outcomes suggest active content blocking and a crowded third-party ecosystem.

## Best Practices for Interpreting The Badge and Results

- **Aim for the lowest possible badge count without breaking website functionality.**
- Use the popup panel regularly to review all distinct third parties connected by websites you visit.
- Recognize that **not all third parties are bad**, but a large number often correlates with increased tracking or ads.
- Regularly validate the content blocking rules in your browser, using uBO Scope’s data to ensure they are effective.

## Step-by-Step: Using uBO Scope to Interpret Badge Counts

<Steps>
<Step title="Observe the Badge Count on the Toolbar">
The badge shows a numeric value or is empty if no third-party connections are detected.

- A count of "0" or no number means no third-party connections were detected.
- Any positive number shows how many distinct external domains your browser connected to for the current tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Badge to Open Popup Panel">
This panel breaks down third-party domains into 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' categories to give detailed insight.
</Step>
<Step title="Review 'Not Blocked' Domains">
Focus first on domains under this section.

- These are the domains your browser successfully connected to.
- Low counts here indicate fewer external entities tracking or serving content.
</Step>
<Step title="Check 'Stealth-blocked' and 'Blocked' Domains">
Analyze domains here to understand what your content blocker or other protections prevented.

- A large number in stealth-blocked indicates active redirection or silent blocking.
- Blocked domains are failures or intentional blocks.
</Step>
<Step title="Evaluate Domain Legitimacy">
Compare domains you recognize (e.g., googleapis.com, cdn.example.com) against unknown or suspicious ones.

- Legitimate domains usually align with site functionality.
- Unknown domains warrant investigation or additional blocking if privacy is prioritized.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Common Scenarios to Guide Badge Interpretation

| Scenario                          | Badge Count Meaning                          | User Action                     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| New tab with blank or local page | Badge is empty or zero                      | No third-party activity         |
| News or media site               | Moderate to high badge count expected       | Review trusted vs unknown domains |
| Privacy-focused site             | Low badge count expected                      | Confirm minimal third-party exposure |
| Sites with many ads or trackers | High badge count, many stealth or blocked   | Consider additional blocking or site avoidance |

## Troubleshooting Unexpected Badge Counts

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Badge Issues">
<Accordion title="Why is my badge count unexpectedly high?">
- The webpage may legitimately contact many third-party services.
- Some services might use multiple subdomains counted as distinct domains.
- Consider reviewing the popup’s domain list to identify heavy third-party usage.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count show zero on a site I know loads third parties?">
- The webRequest API may miss network requests made through non-standard methods.
- Browser version and permissions affect data capture.
- Verify your extension has necessary `webRequest` permission and is properly configured.
- Check that the page is fully loaded and active tab is current.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if the badge count does not update after navigation?">
- The extension updates badge periodically (approx. every second).
- Switching tabs or reloading the page forces recount.
- Ensure you have the latest version of uBO Scope installed.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Practical Example: Interpreting the Badge on a News Website

Imagine you visit a news website with a badge showing **15**.

- Opening the popup, you see:
  - Allowed (not blocked): 10 domains
  - Stealth-blocked: 3 domains
  - Blocked: 5 domains

Interpretation:
- The site loads content from 10 distinct third parties that are allowed.
- 3 other domains were stealth-blocked – misbehaving or tracking attempts silently redirected.
- 5 domains completely blocked by your content blocker.

Action:
- Investigate the domains listed to identify trackers or unnecessary ad servers.
- Adjust blocking rules or add custom filters if needed to improve privacy.

# Summary

The uBO Scope toolbar badge delivers an immediate, clear measurement of third-party network connections on the active webpage. Understanding this count and the detailed breakdown in the popup empowers users to assess their online privacy exposure effectively. Lower badge counts generally signify better privacy, while the categorized domain lists help pinpoint which third parties are allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked.

By regularly interpreting these results, users can make informed decisions about content blockers, web usage, and privacy enhancements.
