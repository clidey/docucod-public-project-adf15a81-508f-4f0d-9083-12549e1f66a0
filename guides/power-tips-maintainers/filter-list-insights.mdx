# Using uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how filter list maintainers can harness the unique capabilities of uBO Scope to detect connections that are either unblocked or stealth-blocked—categories often invisible to conventional browser developer tools. By following this workflow, maintainers can verify the true effectiveness of filter lists and uncover blind spots, even when working on devices with limited or no access to detailed developer tools.

---

## What this Guide Helps You Accomplish

- Understand how uBO Scope reveals nuanced network request outcomes for domains.
- Use the extension's data to validate and improve filter list effectiveness.
- Identify stealth-blocked connections that evade ordinary inspection.
- Apply practical techniques for filter testing on devices with restricted dev tool access.

---

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure the following:

- uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your browser. Refer to [Install and Set Up uBO Scope]( /guides/getting-started-guides/installation-setup ) for installation instructions.
- You are familiar with filter lists and how they operate within content blockers like uBlock Origin.
- Basic understanding of network request types and domain structures (knowledge of public suffixes is helpful but not required).

---

## Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will be able to:

- Open the uBO Scope popup and interpret the detailed lists of domains categorized as allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked.
- Detect third-party connections your filter lists may be missing.
- Confirm stealth blocking behavior that maintains privacy without alerting webpages.
- Use this insight to iteratively refine your filter lists for enhanced accuracy and coverage.

## Time Estimate

This process can be completed in about 15-30 minutes depending on the complexity of the site you test and your familiarity with filter list maintenance.

---

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate — assumes knowledge of browser extensions, network requests, and content blocking concepts.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Trigger Network Activity on Your Target Page">
To analyze filter effectiveness, start by loading the website or webpage you are maintaining the filter list for. Generate typical user actions that cause the page to load various resources, such as navigating menus or interacting with page elements.

**Expected result:** The extension will capture network requests initiated by the page and their outcomes.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup Interface">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.

**Expected result:** The popup displays the domain lists under three categories: "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked," along with counts indicating distinct third-party servers connected during page load.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret the Domain Categories">
- **Not blocked:** Domains to which your browser successfully connected without interference.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were actively blocked by your filter list or content blocker.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where requests were stealthily blocked—your filter silently stopped these connections without triggering error signals or alerts to the page.

Focus your maintenance efforts especially on the stealth-blocked category to discover connections that traditional dev tools or filter testing methods may miss.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify Unexpected Allowed or Stealth Domains">
Review the popup's domain lists and identify domains that:

- Should be blocked according to your filter list but are appearing as "allowed".
- Are in the stealth-blocked list but are surprising or unknown.

**Tip:** Use domain knowledge and externally verified public suffix lists to understand these domains' relationships.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Using uBO Scope on Limited Devices">
If your testing device has restricted or no developer tools (e.g., mobile browsers with limited dev console access), rely on uBO Scope’s data to spot unblocked or stealth-blocked connections.

This approach is especially useful for filter list maintainers testing on real-world user setups where standard debugging tools aren't available.
</Step>

<Step title="Update Filter Lists and Retest">
Based on your findings, update your filter list rules to address domains incorrectly allowed or stealth-blocked.

Repeat the above steps after applying updates to validate that the filter list correctly blocks or stealth blocks connections as intended.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Example

Suppose you maintain a filter list targeting tracking servers on a popular news website.

1. Visit the news website with uBO Scope active.
2. Observe the popup; the "not blocked" section shows a domain `track.example.com` you expected to block.
3. The "stealth-blocked" section shows a domain with a suspicious subdomain like `cdn.hiddentracker.net`.
4. Since `track.example.com` is allowed, you realize your filter rule might be missing or malformed for that domain.
5. You add or correct the filter rule to block `track.example.com`.
6. Retest and confirm it moves to the blocked or stealth-blocked list, reducing unblocked connections.

This stepwise validation ensures your filter list covers all intended tracking domains effectively.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Popup shows no data or "NO DATA":** Make sure you have visited a website generating network requests after uBO Scope installation; the extension requires active network requests to collect data.
- **Suspicious domains remain in "not blocked":** Double-check filter rules syntax and domains. Confirm domain matching precision using the Public Suffix List knowledge.
- **Stealth blocking seems inconsistent:** Understand stealth blocking relies on silent request failures or redirects invisible to web pages. Some browser or network configurations might affect detection.

### Best Practices

- Regularly update and consult the Public Suffix List to correctly resolve domain boundaries, improving filter accuracy.
- Use uBO Scope alongside standard filter list testing tools; the extension reveals invisible stealth blocks and blind spots.
- Retest on devices with limited developer tools to confirm real-world filter effectiveness.

### Performance Considerations

Working with uBO Scope does not substantially impact browser performance as it runs efficiently in the background service worker or background page, batching network request processing.

### Alternative Approaches

For deep debugging, use browser DevTools Network tab combined with uBO Scope data for a comprehensive view of request outcomes.
