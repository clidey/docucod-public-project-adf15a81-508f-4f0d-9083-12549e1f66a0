# Using uBO Scope to Evaluate Content Blockers and Filter Lists

## Overview
This guide shows you how to use uBO Scope to compare the effectiveness of different content blockers or filter lists. It explains how to interpret the data shown by uBO Scope, highlights common misconceptions about blocker efficacy, and demonstrates how to leverage uBO Scope's insights to tune filter lists for better performance.

---

## Prerequisites
- **Installed uBO Scope Extension:** Ensure uBO Scope is installed on your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- **Basic Familiarity with uBO Scope:** You should understand how to interpret the popup UI and badge count. See [Exploring the Popup](../getting-started-usage/understanding-popup) and [Badge Number Interpretation](../getting-started-usage/interpreting-badge-count) for foundational knowledge.
- **Different Content Blockers or Filter Lists to Compare:** Have two or more content blockers enabled, or different filter lists prepared for testing.
- **Active Browsing Session:** Use uBO Scope on a website or set of websites that are relevant to your test scenario.

---

## What You Will Achieve
- Identify which content blockers or filter lists minimize connections to third-party domains more effectively.
- Understand how uBO Scope categorizes network requests: allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked.
- Use factual uBO Scope data to debunk common myths about content blocker performance.
- Gain actionable insights to refine filter lists based on real network outcomes.

---

## Time Estimate
15-30 minutes, depending on the number of blockers or lists you wish to compare and the complexity of websites tested.

---

## Difficulty Level
Intermediate — requires some familiarity with content blockers, filter lists, and network request concepts.

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Prepare Test Environment
- Disable all content blockers except the first one or apply your first filter list.
- Navigate to a representative website where you want to evaluate blocking performance.

### 2. Open uBO Scope Popup
- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open its popup panel.
- Observe the number of third-party domains connected (shown in the "domains connected" summary).
- Review the three domain lists displayed:
  - **Allowed:** Domains from which network requests were successfully allowed.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains that were blocked invisibly, using stealth mechanisms.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests were actively blocked and reported.

### 3. Record Observations
- Note the count of third-party domains connected and the composition of each list.
- Export or manually record these domain lists if needed for detailed comparison.

### 4. Repeat with Different Content Blocker or Filter List
- Disable the first content blocker or switch filter lists.
- Enable the second content blocker or apply the second filter list.
- Reload the same website.
- Open the uBO Scope popup again and note the new results.

### 5. Compare Results
- Evaluate differences in the number of allowed third-party domains.
- Check which domains are consistently blocked or allowed.
- Analyze stealth-blocks for any changes in blocking behavior.

### 6. Interpret the Results Objectively
- A lower number of allowed third-party connections generally indicates better blocking performance.
- Beware of common myths that claim higher block counts always mean better blocking — these counts can be misleading.
- Consider the nature of connected domains: legitimate CDNs may be allowed by design, while ad or tracking servers might be effectively blocked.

### 7. Using uBO Scope to Tune Filter Lists
- Use domain data from the popup to identify unblocked undesirable domains or false positives.
- Modify filter lists accordingly to block missed domains or whitelist necessary ones.
- Reapply the refined filter list and validate improvements with uBO Scope.

## Understanding Key Concepts in the Popup

| Outcome Type     | Description                                                                                      | User Insight                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Allowed          | Domains from which resources were fetched successfully.                                        | Indicates connections that passed blocking. |
| Stealth-blocked  | Domains blocked using stealth techniques that minimize website breakage or detection.          | Shows sophisticated blocking behavior.       |
| Blocked          | Domains actively blocked with clear network errors or request failures.                        | Directly prevented resource loading.         |

## Common Myths Debunked Using uBO Scope

### Myth 1: "More Blocks Mean a Better Content Blocker"
<u>Reality:</u> uBO Scope counts distinct connected third-party domains, not individual blocked requests. Some blockers reporting higher block counts may actually allow more domains to connect, increasing privacy risk.

### Myth 2: "Ad Blocker Test Pages Accurately Measure Effectiveness"
<u>Reality:</u> These tests often produce unrealistic network behaviors and cannot detect stealth blocking, leading to misleading conclusions.

---

## Practical Tips for Effective Evaluation

- Always measure blocking effectiveness by the **number of distinct allowed third-party domains**, as shown by uBO Scope.
- Test on **real-world websites** with diverse and typical third-party connections.
- Consider the impact of stealth blocking; some domains may not appear blocked but still be effectively disabled.
- Use uBO Scope consistently across tests to maintain reliable comparison data.
- Combine quantitative domain counts with qualitative domain analysis to understand the nature of connections.

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Data or Incomplete Results in Popup
- Verify that you navigated to a website with network activity.
- Check that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (activeTab, webRequest).
- Ensure the extension is properly installed and enabled.

### Unexpected High Domain Count
- Confirm no other extensions or VPNs affect network requests.
- Check for background page or filter list issues.

### Discrepancies Across Browsers
- Understand that uBO Scope relies on the browser’s webRequest API.
- Some browsers may limit visibility of certain connections.

## Example Scenario

Imagine you want to compare two filter lists: List A (default) and List B (custom tuned).

1. Enable List A in your content blocker.
2. Visit example.com.
3. Open uBO Scope popup and note 15 allowed third-party domains.
4. Switch to List B and reload example.com.
5. Open uBO Scope again and observe 10 allowed domains.
6. Note that 5 domains were successfully blocked by List B compared to List A.
7. Analyze what those 5 domains are—if they are trackers or ads, List B is more effective.
8. Continue refining List B based on unblocked domains shown.

<Tip>
Using uBO Scope data shifts evaluation from misleading metrics like raw block counts to actual insights about distinct third-party connections, empowering you to make confident decisions about which content blockers or filter lists truly enhance your privacy.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Never rely on ad blocker test webpages or toolbar badge block counts alone to compare blockers; uBO Scope provides the transparent domain-level visibility required for reliable analysis.
