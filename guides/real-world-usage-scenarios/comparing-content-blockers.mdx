# Comparing Content Blockers with uBO Scope

A practical walkthrough to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different content blockers using uBO Scope’s measurement tools. This guide clarifies how uBO Scope’s resource fetch counts and badge indicators offer a more reliable and meaningful assessment than traditional block counters or ad blocker test pages.

---

## 1. Understanding the Challenge

Third-party network connections are often the focus when judging content blockers. Traditional block counts reported by these blockers do not always reflect actual performance or privacy efficacy.

Imagine two content blockers:
- Blocker A reports a high number of blocks but still allows connections to many third-party servers.
- Blocker B reports fewer blocks but effectively stops more third-party connections.

Here, a high block count is misleading; what truly matters is how many distinct third-party remote servers the browser ultimately connects to.

<u>uBO Scope helps you see the truth behind these numbers by showing real network connection outcomes independent of any content blocker.</u>

---

## 2. What You Will Learn and Achieve

- **Why block counts are misleading** and how to interpret network connection outcomes instead.
- How to use **uBO Scope’s toolbar badge and popup panel** to measure the actual connections allowed by different content blockers.
- How to compare content blockers based on the **count of distinct third-party domains connected to**, not just block counts.
- Practical steps and tips for **valid, realistic assessments** that avoid traps like fake ad blocker test pages.

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed on your browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- At least two content blockers installed to compare.
- Basic familiarity with uBO Scope’s popup and toolbar badge (if not, see [Using the Popup Panel](https://example.com/overview/feature-glance/popup-overview)).

### Expected Outcome

You will confidently differentiate which content blocker more effectively limits unwanted third-party connections by evaluating real network request data rather than misleading block counts.

## 3. Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Your Browsing Environment

- Open your browser with uBO Scope enabled alongside the content blockers you want to compare.
- Ensure uBO Scope’s extension icon is visible on the toolbar.
- Confirm each content blocker is activated one at a time for clean comparison.

### Step 2: Choose a Real-World Website

- Use a genuine, popular website (avoid ad blocker test pages which are misleading).
- Pick a site that commonly loads third-party content (news portals, social media platforms).

### Step 3: Measure Connections Without Content Blockers

- Disable all content blockers except uBO Scope.
- Visit the website.
- Click the uBO Scope icon and note the **toolbar badge number** — this represents the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected.
- Open the popup panel to see the detailed breakdown:
  - **Not blocked (Allowed)** third-party domains.
  - **Stealth-blocked** and **Blocked** connections.

### Step 4: Measure Connections with Content Blocker A Enabled

- Enable Content Blocker A and disable other content blockers.
- Refresh the website.
- Note uBO Scope’s toolbar badge count again.
- Open the popup for the full summary of domains connected.

### Step 5: Measure Connections with Content Blocker B Enabled

- Switch to Content Blocker B and disable other content blockers.
- Refresh the website.
- Observe and record uBO Scope’s badge count and popup panel summary.

### Step 6: Compare Results and Interpret

- The content blocker that **results in the lower uBO Scope badge count** is effectively allowing fewer distinct third-party connections.
- Review the popup panel domain lists to see which domains are still connected despite blocking.
- Treat block counts displayed by content blockers with skepticism — let uBO Scope’s connection counts guide your evaluation.

## 4. Why uBO Scope's Approach is Superior

| Traditional Block Counts | uBO Scope’s Connection Counts |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Measures requests a blocker *attempts* to block. | Measures actual third-party servers reached *after* blocking. |
| Does not reflect connections outside browser's reach or stealthy blocking. | Shows network requests regardless of blockers’ stealth or technique. |
| Blockers can report inflated or misleading counts to appear effective. | Reports genuine network activity from the browser's webRequest API. |

> This makes uBO Scope a trustworthy transparency tool to evaluate the true impact of content blockers.

## 5. Tips & Best Practices

- **Avoid fake ad blocker test pages:** These webpages simulate blocking scenarios with unrealistic resource fetches, skewing results.
- **Use real websites:** Test on actual sites to expose true content blocker effectiveness.
- **Test multiple times:** For consistency, perform several refresh cycles.
- **Consider legitimate third-party connections:** Some CDNs and services are harmless, focus on suspicious or unnecessary third-party connections.
- **Use uBO Scope's popup details:** Understanding which domains remain connected can inform privacy decisions.

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues When Comparing Content Blockers">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Toolbar Badge Not Updating">
- Ensure uBO Scope has the required `webRequest` permission.
- Confirm you are using a supported browser version (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Restart the browser if badge remains stuck.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Content Blocker Blocking Conflicts">
- Disable all other content blockers when testing a single one to avoid interference.
- Some blockers may use stealth techniques not detectable by some tools but uBO Scope reports real network requests regardless.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or NO DATA Message">
- Refresh the page after opening the popup.
- Ensure the tab is active and selected.
- Verify uBO Scope is enabled and not disabled for the site.

## 7. Real-World Example

Suppose you test two content blockers on example.com:

| Content Blocker | uBO Scope Badge Count | Number of Allowed Third-Party Domains |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Blocker A       | 15                    | 15                                   |
| Blocker B       | 8                     | 8                                    |

From this, Blocker B stops connections to more third-party servers than Blocker A, regardless of reported block counts. You can expand the popup panel lists to evaluate which domains remain connected.
