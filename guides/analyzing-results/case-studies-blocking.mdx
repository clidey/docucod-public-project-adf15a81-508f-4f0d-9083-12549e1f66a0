# Case Studies: Comparing Blocking Tools and Assessing Privacy

Explore real-world scenarios using uBO Scope to compare different content blockers, debunk common misconceptions about badge counts, and improve your privacy auditing practices. This guide provides actionable workflows for using uBO Scope data effectively, highlights the limitations of synthetic 'ad blocker tests,' and demonstrates how to make informed decisions based on actual network connection observations.

---

## 1. Understanding the User Intent

When using uBO Scope for privacy analysis, users typically want to:

- Compare how different content blockers affect the number and nature of third-party connections.
- Validate claims made by blockers about their effectiveness beyond raw block counts.
- Avoid common pitfalls from relying on synthetic or unrealistic test pages.
- Assess privacy exposure in realistic browsing scenarios.

This guide focuses on helping you achieve those goals step-by-step.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure:

- uBO Scope is installed and properly set up in your browser (see [Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope](/guides/getting-started/install-setup)).
- You understand how to interpret the badge and popup UI results (refer to [Understanding the Toolbar Badge and Popup Data](/guides/analyzing-results/understanding-badge-popup)).
- Your content blockers (e.g., uBlock Origin, AdGuard) are installed and enabled.
- You have access to real websites for testing, avoiding synthetic 'ad blocker test' pages.

## 3. Workflow: Comparing Content Blockers Using Real Websites

Follow these steps to conduct an effective comparison:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Representative Real Websites">
    Choose sites you typically visit or that are known for third-party tracking, such as news sites, social media, or ecommerce platforms.

    <Tip>Choose multiple sites to get a broader picture. Avoid artificial test pages designed to trigger specific blocking behaviors.</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Baseline Measurement Without Content Blockers">
    1. Temporarily disable all content blockers.
    2. Visit each site, open uBO Scope's popup and observe the total count of third-party domains connected.
    3. Record the badge number and lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

    <Check>This baseline shows the full exposure of third-party connections.</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Measurement With Content Blocker Enabled">
    1. Enable your content blocker.
    2. Navigate to the same sites without refreshing the browser or closing tabs to keep data consistent.
    3. Observe uBO Scope badge counts and popup data.
    4. Compare the number and identity of third-party connections allowed or blocked.

    <Warning>Do not rely solely on the block count reported by the content blocker badge; use uBO Scope data instead.</Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Interpret Differences and Patterns">
    1. Look for changes in the distinct allowed third-party domains count displayed by uBO Scope.
    2. Review domains categorized as stealth-blocked or blocked.
    3. Identify if fewer third-party domains connect or certain trackers are missing.

    <Tip>Pay special attention to domains that remain allowed but are unwanted or unusual.</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Swap Content Blockers and Repeat">
    1. Repeat the above steps with different content blockers.
    2. Use uBO Scope to observe how the set of distinct third-party connections changes.

    <Info>Lower numbers of allowed third-party domains typically indicate better privacy protection.</Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Debunking Common Myths Using uBO Scope Data

<uBOScope> helps clarify the true impact of content blockers beyond surface metrics. Here are widely held misconceptions disproven using uBO Scope insights.</uBOScope>

### Myth 1: "Higher Block Count Means Better Blocking"

- Content blockers sometimes report high block counts but still allow more unique connections.
- uBO Scope counts distinct allowed third-party domains, showing true exposure.
- A block count alone doesn’t measure privacy - fewer distinct allowed servers mean better protection.

### Myth 2: "Synthetic ‘Ad Blocker Test’ Pages Are Reliable Benchmarks"

- Such pages send unrealistic or fabricated network requests.
- Real-world browsing involves different third-party domains and patterns.
- uBO Scope shows real network connections, exposing these artificial tests' limitations.

<Note>Always prioritize real-site testing with uBO Scope over synthetic benchmarks for accuracy.</Note>

## 5. Practical Examples

### Example 1: News Site Analysis

| Scenario         | Allowed Domains | Blocked Domains | Observations                             |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| No Blocker       | 25              | 0               | Wide third-party exposure                |
| uBlock Origin    | 5               | 20              | Most trackers blocked, fewer allowed    |
| AdGuard          | 7               | 18              | Slightly higher allowed count vs uBO    |

### Example 2: Social Media Site

- Baseline: 30 third-party domains connected.
- uBO Scope shows stealth-blocked connections representing requests silently redirected or suppressed.
- Content blockers with stealth blocking often show fewer visible block events but reduce exposure effectively.

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- **Use uBO Scope badge as your primary privacy indicator.**
- **Check the popup UI for detailed domain-specific insights.**
- **Test multiple sites and blockers to see consistent trends.**
- **Document your findings to track blocker effectiveness over time.**
- **Don’t base decisions on blocker badge counts or synthetic test results alone.**

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Case Studies">
  <Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or Zero Counts">
    - Ensure uBO Scope has necessary permissions (see [Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/setup-introduction/prerequisites-requirements)).
    - Refresh the tested webpage after blocker changes.
    - Confirm the tab is active; background tabs do not update badge data immediately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Confusing Stealth-Blocked Entries">
    - Stealth-blocked domains may appear less visible but still attempted connections.
    - Review the [Core Concepts & Terminology](/overview/architecture-group/core-concepts-terminology) documentation to understand stealth outcomes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Badge Counts Differ from Content Blocker Badges">
    - This is expected; uBO Scope counts distinct third-party domains, not raw block counts.
    - Avoid comparing these directly; use uBO Scope data for true exposure assessment.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
