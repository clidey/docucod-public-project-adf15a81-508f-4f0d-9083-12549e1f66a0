# Guide for Filter List Maintainers

## Overview

This guide is tailored specifically for filter list maintainers and advanced privacy auditors who want to leverage **uBO Scope** as a powerful diagnostic tool. It equips maintainers with the know-how to observe real-world network behavior, cross-check the effects of their filter lists, and gather solid evidence on connection outcomes, especially valuable in locked-down environments where standard developer tools are limited or inaccessible.

## Prerequisites

- Have the **uBO Scope** browser extension installed and enabled in your browser.
- Basic understanding of browser network requests and content blocking/filter lists.
- Familiarity with terms such as third-party domains, blocking, stealth-blocking, and allowed connections.
- Access to target webpages or test domains relevant to your filter list evaluation.

## Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Interpret uBO Scope's popup to distinguish between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party connections.
- Detect discrepancies or unintended consequences in filter list enforcement.
- Collect empirical data on network requests even in environments where developer tools are restricted.
- Use uBO Scope findings to refine or validate your filter lists effectively.

## Time Estimate

Setup and initial inspection can be completed within 10–15 minutes. Deeper analysis workflows may vary depending on the scope.

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate to Advanced

## Using uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance

### Step 1: Launch uBO Scope on the Target Page

1. Navigate to the webpage you want to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
3. The popup appears, showing the domain name of the page and the count of distinct third-party domains connected.

**Expected result:** The badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party domains allowed to connect.

### Step 2: Understand the Outcome Categories

The popup UI divides observed domains into three categories:
- **Not blocked (allowed):** Domains from which network requests succeeded.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or handled in a stealthy manner by a content blocker.
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed or were outright blocked.

Use this to identify which domains your filters are impacting and how.

### Step 3: Examine Domain Counts and Patterns

- Review the count badges next to each domain to understand frequency of requests.
- Look for unexpected third-party domains appearing as allowed, which may signal gaps.
- Identify stealth-blocked domains, indicating subtle interference or redirection by other blockers.

### Step 4: Cross-Check Filter List Effects

- Correlate allowed and blocked domains with your filter list rules to see if intended targets are correctly blocked.
- Investigate stealth-blocked domains for any signaling or fallback failures.
- In locked-down environments without devtools access, rely on uBO Scope’s data as the primary source to audit real network behavior.

### Step 5: Collect and Export Evidence

- Document domain names and counts displayed in each section.
- Use screenshots or copy domain lists for reports.
- Repeat the process on different pages or under varying filter configurations to detect consistent behavior.

### Step 6: Repeat and Refine

- Adjust your filter rules based on observed patterns.
- Re-test using uBO Scope to verify changes.
- Use this iterative process to improve filter accuracy and minimize false positives or negatives.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Focus on Distinct Domains:** The badge count corresponds to unique third-party domains allowing connections. Lower counts typically mean better privacy.
- **Beware of Stealth Blocking:** Stealth-blocked domains might still perform some actions. Verify if these precisely match your filter intentions.
- **Test Across Environments:** When devtools are unavailable due to enterprise policies or browser restrictions, uBO Scope enables stand-alone analysis.
- **Use Real-World Sites:** Avoid synthetic test pages; real browsing sessions reveal genuine connections your filter list affects.
- **Regularly Update the Public Suffix List:** uBO Scope uses this list to normalize domains and accurately track domains. Keep it current to avoid mismatches.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Checklist">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or 'NO DATA'">
- Ensure you have the active tab selected before opening uBO Scope.
- Check that the browser permissions for uBO Scope include webRequest access.
- Reload the page and try reopening the popup.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected High Count of Allowed Domains">
- Confirm no conflicts with other blocking extensions causing inaccuracies.
- Investigate whether networks use CDNs or proxy domains frequently.
- Cross-check if some domains are whitelisted intentionally.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth-Blocked Domains Are Unclear">
- Understand stealth blocking means requests were redirected or modified subtly by the blocker.
- Check your content blocker’s documentation to interpret stealth behaviors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Data Not Updating After Navigation">
- Close and reopen the popup after navigation as the data refreshes asynchronously.
- Verify that uBO Scope’s background service worker or background script is active.
- Restart the browser if the issue persists.
</Accordion>

## Real-World Scenario

_Suppose you maintain a filter list blocking ad and tracking domains on an e-commerce website._

1. Open the e-commerce site.
2. Open the uBO Scope popup.
3. Notice an unexpected allowed domain such as `cdn.exampletracker.com` frequently showing up in the allowed list with many requests.
4. Check your filter list and find that `exampletracker.com` is missing.
5. Add filtering rules to block `exampletracker.com` and its subdomains.
6. Reload the e-commerce site and inspect uBO Scope again.
7. Confirm the domain moves from allowed to blocked, and the overall badge count decreases.

This immediate feedback loop accelerates your filter list tuning.
