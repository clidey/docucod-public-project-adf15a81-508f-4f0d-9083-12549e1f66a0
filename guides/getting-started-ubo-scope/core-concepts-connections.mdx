# Understanding Third-Party Connections and Badge Counts

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you understand how uBO-Scope defines and tracks remote network connections made by your browser during web browsing sessions. It explains the distinctions between first-party, third-party, and CDN hosts, and clarifies how the toolbar badge count correlates to these connection types — empowering you to better assess the privacy posture of the pages you visit.

### Prerequisites
- uBO-Scope extension installed and active in your browser.
- Basic knowledge of browsing tabs and interpreting browser extension badges.

### Expected Outcome
After following this guide, you will:
- Grasp the definitions uBO-Scope uses for third-party connections.
- Understand how hosts (domains and CDNs) are categorized.
- Be able to interpret the toolbar badge count and relate it to real-world privacy implications.

### Time Estimate
Less than 10 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate.

## How uBO-Scope Defines Remote Connections

### First-Party vs Third-Party Connections
When you visit a webpage, your browser establishes connections to servers hosting that site's content. uBO-Scope distinguishes these as:

- **First-Party Connections:** Network requests made to the original domain of the webpage you're visiting (e.g., visiting `example.com` connects to servers within `example.com` domain).
- **Third-Party Connections:** Requests made to any other domains that the webpage loads resources from, such as advertisers, analytics providers, or content delivery networks.

This distinction matters because third-party connections often represent tracking entities or external asset providers affecting your privacy.

### CDN Hosts and uBO-Scope
Many websites utilize Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) — specialized servers geographically distributed to efficiently serve content. Although CDNs are third-party hosts technically, they may be legitimate and essential for website functionality.

uBO-Scope treats CDNs as third-party hosts but does not inherently label them as malicious or undesirable. Understanding whether your connections involve genuine CDNs helps in accurately assessing privacy risks.

## Tracking Connections and Outcomes

uBO-Scope listens to network events reported by your browser independently of any content blockers. It tracks every network request outcome as:

- **Allowed:** Requests successfully connected.
- **Blocked:** Requests prevented from completing by content blockers or network errors.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests redirected or blocked in a manner designed to be unobtrusive or invisible to the website.

The extension aggregates these connection results on a per-tab basis, grouping domains contacted under these categories.

---

## Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count

The **toolbar badge** on the uBO-Scope icon displays:

> The number of unique third-party domains from which connections to remote servers were allowed for the currently active browser tab.

This count excludes the first-party domain of the page and highlights how many distinct third-party hosts your browser actually connected to while loading the page.

### Why a Lower Badge Count is Better
- A **lower count** usually indicates fewer third-party connections, which often correlates to enhanced privacy since fewer external entities are contacted.
- A **higher count** means more third-party connections, increasing potential for cross-site tracking.

<u>Important:</u> This count reflects the _distinct_ third-party domains, not the total number of requests or block events. Therefore, multiple requests to the same third-party domain count as one.

### Common Misunderstandings

Many assume that a higher block count or badge number relates directly to content blocker effectiveness or privacy strength. uBO-Scope clarifies that what truly matters is how many distinct third-party domains were _allowed_ (connected) because: 

- An extension with a higher block count can still allow more third-party domains to connect,
- Fake or fabricated network requests (like from ad-blocker test sites) do not reflect real browsing behavior.

## Examples

| Scenario                                      | First-Party Domain   | Third-Party Domains                                               | Badge Count Displayed |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Visit `news.com` with ads and analytics       | news.com            | adtracker.com, analytics.net, cdn.fastcdn.com                    | 3                     |
| Visit `blog.example` with essential CDN usage | blog.example        | cdn.fastcdn.com                                                  | 1                     |
| Visit `shop.site` with no third-party scripts | shop.site           | *none*                                                          | 0 (badge hidden)       |

## Tips and Best Practices

- Use the badge count as a quick indicator to evaluate how many third-party connections a site initiates, not as a measure of block counts.
- Investigate the popup UI (via clicking the extension icon) to view detailed lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Remember that some third-party domains are legitimate CDNs or necessary service providers.
- Be cautious interpreting results from ad-blocker test pages — they often do not reflect real browsing behavior.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Mistaking badge count for blocks:** The badge reflects allowed third-party domains, not blocked counts.
- **Ignoring stealth-blocking:** Some requests are stealth-blocked — invisible to websites but silently blocked by content blockers.
- **Assuming all third parties are bad:** Not all third-party connections are harmful; many are essential.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If the badge count does not appear or seems incorrect, verify the extension is active and permissions are granted.
- Ensure that the active tab has fully loaded; partial loads might temporarily distort counts.
- Review the popup details to spot domains with unexpected connection outcomes.
