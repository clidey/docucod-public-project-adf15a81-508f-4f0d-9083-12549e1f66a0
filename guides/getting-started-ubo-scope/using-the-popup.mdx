# Understanding the Popup: Viewing Domain Connections

## Overview
This guide walks you through using the **uBO Scope** extension popup to inspect and interpret the list of third-party remote server connections initiated by the current browser tab. The popup provides real-time insight into network requests, categorized as *allowed*, *blocked*, and *stealth* connections, helping you understand which external domains your active webpages talk to and the status of those connections.

### What You Will Achieve
- Identify which third-party domains your active tab is communicating with.
- Understand the categorization of connection outcomes: allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked.
- Interpret the summary and detailed lists of connections.
- Use this data to assess privacy exposure or troubleshoot network-related issues.

### Prerequisites
- Have **uBO Scope** installed and active in your supported browser (Chrome v122+, Firefox v128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- You have loaded at least one website in a browser tab where you want to view connection details.

### Time Estimate
5-10 minutes

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## Using the Popup: Step-by-Step

### 1. Open the Popup
- Click the **uBO Scope** icon in your browser toolbar.
- The popup shows a snapshot of remote connections initiated by the currently active browser tab.

### 2. Recognize the Summary Panel
- **Badge Count**: At the top, the badge shows the number of distinct allowed third-party domains connected by the current tab.
- **Summary Categories**:
  - **Allowed**: Domains that are successfully connected.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where connections have been intentionally blocked.
  - **Stealth**: Domains where connections were redirected or prevented from revealing themselves.

### 3. View the Detailed Connection List
- Each category expands to reveal domains involved in the network activity.
- For every domain, you will see counts representing how many times connections were attempted or succeeded.
- Domains are listed in descending order based on recent activity, giving priority to the most relevant connections.

### 4. Interpret Domain Outcomes
- **Allowed Domains** represent servers your browser successfully connected to from the page.
- **Blocked Domains** correspond to remote servers your content blocker or privacy tools prevented your browser from talking to.
- **Stealth Domains** typically arise from redirections or behaviors aiming to obscure connection origin or destination.

### 5. Understand Live Updates
- As you continue browsing or the page loads assets, the popup dynamically updates.
- The badge count increments or decrements reflecting changes in allowed connections.
- You can open the popup anytime to check the current connection status.

### 6. Use Filters and Sorting (If Provided)
- Some versions of the popup may allow filtering by outcome or sorting by connection count.
- Use these features to focus on domains you find suspicious or relevant.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Focus on the Badge**: Use the badge as a quick privacy indicator reflecting how many third-party domains your tab connects to.
- **Start with Allowed Domains**: Investigate which domains your active site contacts, noting those unfamiliar or unexpected.
- **Check Blocked and Stealth Lists**: These categories uncover connections that were prevented or obscured, potentially revealing trackers or unwanted requests.
- **Refresh the Popup**: If the list appears outdated, close and reopen the popup to force the latest connection snapshot.
- **Use in Conjunction With Filter Lists**: Combine connection data with blocking rules to validate your privacy setup.

## Common Scenarios and How to Address Them

| Scenario                                             | Explanation                                   | Action                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No domains appear in popup after opening             | The active tab’s page did not initiate network connections or extension is not active | Reload the page and open the popup again. Confirm uBO Scope is enabled in your browser. |
| Badge count is zero but popup shows allowed domains  | Badge sometimes represents unique domains, popup shows granular counts                | Trust the popup list for details. Badge is a summary indicator.                          |
| Blocked domains list is empty on privacy-heavy sites | Some sites have no network calls or all connections allowed                            | Check if blocking is active in other extensions or settings.                             |
| Popup not updating after navigation                   | Extension might be temporarily paused or inactive                                     | Reload the tab or restart the browser. Check extension status.                           |

## How It Works (Under the Hood - User Perspective)
- uBO Scope monitors all network requests made by the active tab, using built-in browser webRequest APIs and session tracking.
- Each request is categorized based on outcome: allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- The popup provides a user-friendly visualization of this live data, reflecting recent network activity.

> You do not need to worry about internal scripts or configuration to benefit from this view. Just open the popup and monitor your tab’s network connections immediately.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="I see no data or the popup is empty">
- Make sure uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled.
- Verify you have navigated to a page that initiates network connections (e.g., visit popular websites).
- Reload the active tab to trigger new network events.
- Confirm your browser version meets the minimum supported version (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count does not match popup details">
- The badge shows distinct allowed domains count, sometimes ignoring blocked or stealth connections.
- The popup shows full details. Focus on popup for comprehensive insights.
- Some network connections may be ephemeral or redirected; allow a few seconds for popup to update.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup data seems outdated or incomplete">
- Reload the popup by closing and reopening the popup window.
- Restart the browser if issues persist.
- Ensure no other extensions interfere with network monitoring APIs.
