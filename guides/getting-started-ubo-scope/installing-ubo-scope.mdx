## 3. Verifying Installation

Once installed, verify that uBO Scope is active and ready:

1. Click on the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup panel.
2. You should immediately see data reflecting network connections for the active tab or a message indicating data availability.
3. The badge number on the toolbar icon will display the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected by the active tab.

<Check>
If you see "NO DATA" in the popup, try refreshing the active tab or visiting a well-known website with external content. This triggers network requests for uBO Scope to monitor.
</Check>
