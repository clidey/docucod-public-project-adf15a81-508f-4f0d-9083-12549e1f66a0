# Your First Connection Analysis

Discover how to open the uBO Scope popup for the first time, interpret its badge count, and read the detailed breakdown of server connections your browser made while loading a typical webpage. This guide breaks down the core interface elements and teaches you how to identify third-party domains, empowering you to understand your browser's real network exposure.

---

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you perform your first network connection analysis using uBO Scope by launching the extension’s popup, understanding the badge icon on your toolbar, and interpreting the connection status breakdowns displayed.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your browser (see [Installing uBO Scope](../getting-started/introduction-and-installation/installing-ubo-scope)).
- A webpage loaded in your active browser tab.
- Basic familiarity with browser extensions and tabs.

### Expected Outcome
By the end of this guide, you will:
- Successfully open the uBO Scope popup.
- Understand what the badge count on the toolbar icon represents.
- Interpret the lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains connected to by the current webpage.
- Identify third-party domains and assess typical connection behavior.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 5 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup
1. Locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar; it is usually near the address bar.
2. Click on the icon to open its popup window.

**Expected Result:** The popup opens displaying the hostname, summary count, and domain lists categorized by connection status.

### Step 2: Interpret the Toolbar Badge
- The badge shows a number indicating the count of **distinct third-party domains** your current tab connected to without being blocked.
- This count reflects unique domains involved, **not total requests**.

**Why it matters:** A lower count generally implies fewer external third-party connections, which can indicate greater privacy.

### Step 3: Understand the Popup Header
- At the top, you'll see the hostname of the page you are currently analyzing.
- The header breaks down the full hostname into its subdomain and base domain to clarify domain hierarchy.

### Step 4: Explore the Domains Summary Sections
The popup is divided into three categories, each containing domains listed with the number of occurring requests:

| Section          | Meaning                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **not blocked**  | Domains with successful connections      |
| **stealth-blocked** | Domains where connections were stealthily blocked (redirects or other indirect blocks) |
| **blocked**      | Domains where connection attempts were blocked outright |

- Each domain entry shows the domain name and a count badge indicating how many requests were made.
- Domains are sorted alphabetically.

### Step 5: Identifying Third-Party Domains
- The main hostname at the top is your primary domain.
- Any domain listed under the three categories that differs from the base domain is a third-party domain.
- These often represent external services such as CDNs, analytics, ad servers, or other resources.

### Step 6: Reading the Domain Counts
- The count informs you how many times your browser requested resources from that domain.
- A high count may indicate frequent content loading or tracking activity from that source.

### Step 7: Confirm the Accuracy of the Displayed Data
- Ensure the popup finished loading data (no loading spinner visible).
- If you see "NO DATA" or a zero count, refresh the webpage and open the popup again.

<Tip>
Network request data is gathered in near real-time; small delays may occur after page load. Refreshing the popup provides the latest snapshot.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Basic Page with Common Third-Parties
You visit https://example.com and open uBO Scope:
- Badge shows `5`.
- The header displays: subdomain "www." and base domain "example.com".
- Under "not blocked" you see domains like `cdn.example.net`, `fonts.google.com`, `analytics.example.org`.
- "stealth-blocked" is empty.
- "blocked" shows `ads.example.com`.

Interpretation:
- Your page loads content from 5 unique third-party domains.
- Some connections to ad servers were blocked.
- You can estimate your privacy exposure and content blocker effectiveness.

### Example 2: No Third-Party Connections
You open a simple local or private page.
- Badge is blank (zero).
- Popup shows only the page’s base domain.
- All categories except "not blocked" are empty.

Interpretation:
- No third-party network activity detected.
- Your browsing is contained within the site itself.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Popup shows "NO DATA" or empty sections:**
  - Refresh the current tab to generate network data again.
  - Verify permissions are granted to uBO Scope.

- **Badge count doesn't update:**
  - Switch to another tab and back.
  - Restart the browser extension by disabling and enabling it.

- **Domains look unfamiliar or confusing:**
  - Use an online tool to verify domain ownership or purpose.
  - Remember some domains serve CDN or security functions.

### Best Practices
- Regularly review the popup while browsing to build an understanding of your typical connection profile.
- Use the badge count as a quick privacy gauge.
- Combine this analysis with other privacy tools for full coverage.

### Performance Considerations
- The popup loads domain lists sorted and grouped for clarity.
- Extension uses efficient session caching to minimize performance impact.

### Alternative Approaches
- For deeper technical details, consult the [Understanding the Popup: Domains and Connection Statuses](../network-insights-common-workflows/understanding-popup) guide.
- Use development tools for network inspection for advanced troubleshooting.

## Additional Reference

The extension relies on the Public Suffix List (https://publicsuffix.org/) to accurately determine base domains for third-party identification. This ensures that subdomains are properly attributed when counted.
