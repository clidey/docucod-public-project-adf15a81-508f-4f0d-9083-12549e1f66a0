# Using the Popup: Viewing and Interpreting Results


## 1. Overview of the Popup Panel

The uBO-Scope popup panel provides a clear, categorized snapshot of all remote server connections made by the active browser tab. When you click the toolbar icon, the popup opens instantly, displaying detailed domain connection data with counts and blocking outcomes. This guide walks you through reading the data, understanding connection statuses, and getting the most value from this essential interface.


## 2. Prerequisites

- uBO-Scope extension must be installed and active in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
- There must be an active tab with network activity for the popup to display data.


## 3. What You'll Achieve

By following this guide, you will:
- Know how to interpret the popup breakdown of network connections.
- Distinguish between “allowed,” “blocked,” and “stealth-blocked” requests.
- Understand how the badge count relates to the connections shown.
- Gain tips for spotting privacy-relevant network activity at a glance.


## 4. Time Estimate

Viewing and understanding the popup typically takes less than 5 minutes for most users.

## 5. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the Popup Panel
- Click the uBO-Scope toolbar icon in the browser.
- The popup appears with data regarding the active tab’s remote connections.
- If the page has no connection data, the popup will indicate "NO DATA".

### Step 2: Identify the Tab Hostname and Domain
- At the top, see the hostname split between the subdomain and the base domain.
- Example: For `ads.example.com`, "ads." is shown separately from "example.com."
- This helps you recognize the source tab you’re inspecting.

### Step 3: Understand the Summary Count
- Directly below the hostname, you’ll find a summary reading like: `domains connected: 12`.
- This represents the number of unique domains contacted from third parties.
- Note: A lower number here usually indicates better privacy.

### Step 4: Review Connection Categories
- The popup divides domains into three distinct sections, reflecting the outcomes of network requests:

  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains the browser successfully connected to without interference.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were silently redirected or stealthily blocked without obvious error messages or user alerts.
  - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked, with connection failures or errors.

- Each section lists domains and the count of network requests to each.

### Step 5: Interpret Domain Rows
- Under each category, every domain is displayed with a badge showing how many requests were made.
- Example: `cdn.example.net` with a count `5` means 5 allowed connections.

### Step 6: Relate Popup Data to Toolbar Badge
- The badge on the toolbar icon shows the count of unique third-party domains with **allowed** connections.
- If you see many domains in the "allowed" list, expect a matching or similar badge count.


## 6. Tips for Effective Use

- **Lower Is Better:** Aim for fewer allowed third-party domains to improve privacy.
- **Watch Stealth-Blocked:** This category highlights requests that were silently redirected or blocked stealthily; it's critical for spotting subtle privacy protections.
- **No Data?** If the popup shows "NO DATA," ensure you have an active tab with network activity and the extension is running properly.


## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA">
- Make sure you have an active tab open that performs network requests.
- Refresh the page to generate network activity.
- Verify the extension is enabled and properly installed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Lists Are Empty or Do Not Update">
- Your browser might restrict `webRequest` API access, especially in privacy-locked or incognito modes.
- Disable conflicting extensions that might interfere.
- Restart your browser to reset extension states.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Match Allowed Domains">
- Badge count only reflects unique allowed domains for the current tab.
- Popup shows detailed counts per domain; badge number is total unique domains.
- If mismatch persists, reload the tab or extension to sync data.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 8. Real-World Usage Scenario

Imagine you visit a news website. You open the uBO-Scope popup to see which third-party domains the site connects to:
- The "not blocked" list shows domains like `cdn.news.example` and `analytics.tracker.com`.
- The "stealth-blocked" section lists a domain redirecting your requests silently to `tracker.ads.net`.
- The blocked section shows several ad servers explicitly blocked.

This information helps you understand where your data goes and verify your content blockers’ effectiveness at a glance.
