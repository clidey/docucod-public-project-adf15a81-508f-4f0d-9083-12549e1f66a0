# Understanding the Toolbar Badge

## Overview

The toolbar badge on the uBO Scope extension icon is a concise yet powerful indicator of your current webpage's network activity. It shows the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** that your browser connected to — regardless of whether those connections were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked. Understanding what this badge counts and why a lower number is preferable provides key insights into your browsing privacy and content blocking effectiveness.

---

## What the Badge Represents

- **Distinct Third-Party Remote Servers Count:** The badge number reflects the unique count of third-party domains with which your current browser tab initiated network connections.
- **Third-Party Domains:** These are domains different from the main website domain you’re visiting. They typically represent ads, trackers, CDNs, or other external services.
- **Actual Network Connections:** uBO Scope tracks real network requests captured via the browser's `webRequest` API. This means the badge represents *what actually* happened at the network level — not just what filters or blocklists attempted to do.

<Tip>
The badge count does **not** reflect total requests but unique third-party domains contacted.
</Tip>

## Why a Lower Badge Count Is Better

- **Fewer Third-Party Connections Means Less Exposure:** Each remote server your browser contacts creates a potential privacy or security surface area. Fewer third-party servers imply less risk of cross-site tracking or data leakage.
- **Indicator of Effective Blocking:** When using content blockers, the goal is to reduce unwanted third-party connections. A lower count shows that the blocker is actively limiting network access from external domains.
- **Distinguishing Myths From Reality:** Many users mistakenly assume that a higher block count is better. However, uBO Scope focuses on *allowed* connections; a high block count can coincide with many allowed connections, meaning the blocker may be less effective.

<Info>
The badge count aids in debunking the myth: 'Higher block counts mean better blocking'. Instead, focus on the number of allowed third-party connections.

## How the Badge Works in Everyday Use

1. **Visit a Webpage:** As you browse, uBO Scope monitors all network requests initiated by the page.
2. **Counting Connections:** The extension groups requests by third-party domain, tracking their outcomes.
3. **Badge Update:** The badge shows the count of unique allowed third-party domains contacted during the current tab’s session.
4. **Interpreting the Badge:** A visible number means active third-party network connections; a blank badge indicates zero detected third-party connections.

### Example Scenario
Consider a news website that loads images and scripts from CDN providers and several ad domains. The badge might show "3", indicating it connected to three distinct third-party domains. If you enable a content blocker and the badge drops to "1", this reflects a reduction in external connections.

## Step-by-Step: Monitoring and Using the Badge

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a New Tab and Navigate">
Begin by opening a new browser tab and loading a website of interest.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Toolbar Badge">
Look at the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. Notice the number displayed.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Badge for Details">
Click the icon to open the popup panel showing detailed breakdown of connected domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Understand the Count">
Note the count of distinct third-party domains listed. Compare this to the badge number.
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust Content Blocking Settings">
If you use other blockers, adjust their settings and reload the page. Observe any change in badge count.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

- **Use the Badge as a Privacy Indicator:** Regularly check the badge while browsing to monitor unexpected third-party connections.
- **Combine with Popup Exploration:** Use the popup panel to identify which domains are connected and how they are categorized (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked).
- **Beware of Misleading Tests:** Avoid relying solely on ad-blocker test sites to assess badge numbers — real-world browsing yields more accurate insight.

<Warning>
The badge does not count requests made outside the browser’s `webRequest` API reach, such as certain DNS-based blocking or internal app traffic.
</Warning>

## Common Misconceptions

| Myth | Reality |
| -------- | -------- |
| High block count on a blocker means better privacy protection. | Block count is not the same as allowed connection count; a high block count can coincide with more allowed connections, meaning less effective blocking overall. |
| Ad blocker test sites accurately reflect network blocking effectiveness. | These test sites often make unrealistic requests and cannot detect stealth blocking, making their results unreliable. |

## Troubleshooting Badge Visibility

- **Badge Not Showing:** Ensure that uBO Scope is installed and active.
- **Badge Always Blank:** You might be on a page with no third-party network connections or browser permissions are limited.
- **Mismatch With Popup Data:** Reload the page to sync data and confirm there are no extension conflicts.

## Summary
The toolbar badge on uBO Scope is a clear quantitative indicator of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connects to on each tab. Interpreting this number as a network transparency and privacy metric empowers you to understand and optimize your content blocking setup. Lower numbers typically equate to stronger privacy and less unwanted tracking exposure.
