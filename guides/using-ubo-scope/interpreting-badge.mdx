# Understanding and Interpreting the Badge Count

## Overview

The toolbar badge on the uBO Scope extension icon is a concise yet powerful indicator of your browsing session's third-party remote server exposure. It displays **the number of distinct third-party domains with which your browser has successfully established a network connection on the active tab**. This metric helps you understand at a glance how many unique external servers your current web page is interacting with.

A **lower badge count is desirable** because it means your browsing session is connecting to fewer third-party servers, reducing potential privacy risks and network overhead. This page guides you step-by-step on how to interpret this badge, understand what it reveals about your network connections, and use this insight to improve your browsing privacy.

## 1. What the Badge Count Represents

- **Distinct third-party domains connected:** The badge count reflects the total number of unique third-party domains (not the number of individual requests) from which your browser has fetched resources or attempted to connect.
- **Successful connections only:** Only those connections which were actually allowed (not blocked) and reported by the browser's `webRequest` API count towards the badge.
- **Per active tab:** This count is context-sensitive, representing the network activity related to the currently active browser tab.

<u>Example scenario:</u> When visiting a news website, your badge count might be `5`, indicating five different third-party domains delivered content such as ads, tracking scripts, or content delivery networks.


## 2. Why a Lower Number is Better

- **Privacy protection:** Fewer third-party connections mean less exposure to trackers or unwanted data sharing.
- **Reduced attack surface:** Minimizing remote connections decreases potential vectors for attacks or leaks.
- **Performance gains:** Less external resource fetching often leads to faster page loads and less bandwidth usage.

<u>Keep in mind:</u> Some third-party domains are necessary and beneficial, such as CDNs hosting scripts or fonts. The key is to be aware of these connections and decide what you trust.


## 3. How uBO Scope Determines the Badge Count

uBO Scope hooks into your browser's network events using the `webRequest` API and performs the following:

- Monitors all network requests initiated by the active tab.
- Categorizes them based on outcome: `allowed`, `stealth-blocked`, or `blocked`.
- Counts only the distinct third-party domains with allowed connections for the badge.

The extension uses an internal mapping of tab IDs to track these domains dynamically. When new allowed connections are detected, the badge updates in real-time.


## 4. Reading the Badge Count in Practice

1. **Visit a website or web app.**
2. Watch the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar:
   - A number appears representing distinct 3rd-party allowed domains.
   - No number means no third-party connections have been established, or the tab has no network activity.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup for detailed connection information.


## 5. Using the Badge Count to Assess Your Network Exposure

- **High badge count:** Indicates the page loads resources from many distinct third-party domains, which could be a privacy risk.
- **Low badge count:** Suggests minimal third-party exposure, typically preferred.
- **Unexpected changes:** If the badge count spikes unexpectedly, it may reflect newly included trackers or ad servers.


## 6. Practical Tips for Managing Badge Count

- Use uBO Scope alongside a content blocker to observe how changes affect your badge count.
- Regularly check the badge when visiting sensitive or financial websites for suspicious third-party connections.
- Use the popup lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains to audit connections contributing to the badge.


## 7. Common Pitfalls and Misinterpretations

<Warning>
The badge count is **not** a measure of how many requests are blocked or allowed overall — it strictly counts distinct allowed third-party domains.
</Warning>

<Warning>
A higher block count in a content blocker does not necessarily mean better privacy; uBO Scope’s badge helps differentiate actual exposure.
</Warning>

<Note>
The badge count does not include first-party domains or local networks; it focuses on third-party remote servers outside the site’s own domain.
</Note>

<Note>
Some connections reported as "allowed" might be critical infrastructure (e.g., CDNs). Review domain names carefully before deciding what to block.
</Note>


## 8. Step-by-Step: Verify Badge Count Updates

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a New Tab and Visit a Website">
Navigate to a news site or a frequently visited webpage.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the uBO Scope Icon">
Watch the toolbar icon for the badge count number—this updates as the page loads and connections are made.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Icon to See Details">
Open the popup to view the list of allowed third-party domains contributing to the count.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload the Page with a Content Blocker Enabled">
If you use a separate content blocker, reload and observe changes in the badge count to gauge effectiveness.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 9. Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Badge Count Problems">
<Accordion title="Badge Not Updating or Showing">
- Ensure the extension has the required permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).
- Confirm you are on a supported browser and version.
- Check that the tab you are viewing is active and has web content loaded.
- Reload the tab or restart the browser if the badge remains static.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Seems Incorrect or Unexpected">
- Some websites load many third-party resources; check the popup domain list for insight.
- Some network connections may fail silently; only successful allowed domains count.
- Confirm the extension is enabled and not disabled by the browser or conflicts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Shows Zero Despite Network Activity">
- The badge counts distinct third-party domains; if all resources come from first-party domains, badge stays empty.
- Some connections might not be reported if made outside the browser's `webRequest` API scope.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 10. Advanced Understanding: Relationship to Other uBO Scope Features

- The badge complements the detailed popup UI, which breaks down connections into **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** categories.
- Understanding the badge count alongside domain lists helps debunk myths about content blocker reliability.
