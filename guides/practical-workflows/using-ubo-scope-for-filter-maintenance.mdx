# Using uBO Scope as a Tool for Filter List Maintenance

## Introduction
Welcome to this practical guide designed specifically for filter list authors and privacy enthusiasts. Here, you'll learn how to leverage uBO Scope to audit network requests effectively and refine content-blocking filter lists. With step-by-step instructions and real-use scenarios, this guide transforms uBO Scope from a passive monitoring tool into an active asset for maintaining and improving filter lists.

## 1. Understanding the Role of uBO Scope in Filter List Maintenance

### What is uBO Scope?
- A browser extension that provides transparent, accurate information about all third-party network connections initiated by your browser.
- It detects every attempted or successful network request regardless of active content blockers.
- Provides a real-time badge count and a categorized popup interface showing which domains were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

### Why Use uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance?
- Helps identify third-party domains that bypass or evade existing filter lists.
- Supports ongoing audits to confirm which connections are truly blocked or stealth-blocked.
- Enables filter list authors to discover new domains or request patterns that require attention.

---

## 2. Preparing Your Setup

### Prerequisites
- Install uBO Scope on one of the supported browsers: Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
- Ensure the extension has been granted all required permissions (webRequest, activeTab, storage).
- Have a filter list loading in your content blocker (for example, uBlock Origin) that you want to audit or improve.

<Tip>
If you haven’t installed uBO Scope yet, start with the [Installing uBO Scope on Your Browser](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/guides/getting-started/installing-ubo-scope.mdx) guide.
</Tip>

### Expected Outcome
- You will be able to perform live audits on network requests.
- You will understand how to interpret the three classification categories shown by uBO Scope.
- You will identify actionable next steps to update or enhance your filter list.

### Time Commitment
- Initial setup and familiarization: ~10 minutes.
- Full audit and refinement cycle varies depending on site complexity.

## 3. Step-by-Step Filter List Maintenance Workflow

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope on Your Target Website
1. Navigate to the website you want to audit.
2. Click the uBO Scope browser toolbar icon to open its popup interface.

**Result:**
- uBO Scope will display the current page’s third-party network connections categorized as:
  - **Not blocked (Allowed)**
  - **Stealth-blocked**
  - **Blocked**


### Step 2: Review the Allowed Domains
- Investigate domains listed under 'not blocked'.
- Ask yourself:
  - Are these domains expected or legitimate third parties (e.g., CDNs)?
  - Are any suspicious or unknown domains present that might warrant blocking?

<Tip>
Pay special attention to high-frequency domains or those unfamiliar to you — these might be evasive tracking servers or malicious hosts.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Examine Stealth-Blocked Domains
- Stealth-blocked domains correspond to network requests canceled or altered by your filter list or blocker without the server being aware.
- These are often more stealthy forms of blocking that help avoid page breakage.
- Verify if the stealth-blocked domains align with your filter intentions.

### Step 4: Confirm Blocked Domains
- Check the blocked list for domains your filter list targets.
- Ensure there are no unexpected misses or false negatives.

### Step 5: Cross-Reference with Filter List Rules
- For any allowed or stealth-blocked domains of concern, check your filter list rules.
- Identify if rules are missing, too lenient, or fail to cover subdomains or variations.

### Step 6: Update and Refine Your Filter List
- Add new blocking or exception rules based on your findings.
- Consider adding full or partial domain blocking, or using stealth-block approaches in your filter list syntax.
- Test changes by reloading the page and observing uBO Scope results.

### Step 7: Iterate and Validate Regularly
- Use uBO Scope over a range of real-world websites to capture broad third-party patterns.
- Repeat your audits periodically to catch new domains or changes in third-party behavior.

## 4. Real-World Example: Auditing a News Website

1. Visit the news site with uBO Scope active.
2. Open the uBO Scope popup; observe 15 domains under 'not blocked', 5 under 'stealth-blocked', and 3 under 'blocked'.
3. Recognize legitimate CDN and analytics providers in the 'not blocked' list.
4. Notice unknown domain `tracker.example-xyz.com` under 'not blocked'.
5. Check your filter list; no existing rule blocks `example-xyz.com`.
6. Add a blocking rule targeting `||example-xyz.com^`.
7. Reload the page and observe that the domain now moves to 'stealth-blocked' or 'blocked'.
8. Confirm the page functions correctly.

---

## 5. Best Practices and Tips

- **Start with Known Domains:** Differentiate between common third-party services (CDNs, fonts, analytics you approve) and trackers.
- **Leverage Stealth Blocking:** Use stealth-block where possible to minimize site breakage.
- **Use Domain Outcome Categories:** Always consider allowed, stealth, and blocked categories when analyzing to avoid blind spots.
- **Test Incrementally:** Make small filter list changes and test frequently with uBO Scope to ensure no unintended side effects.
- **Document Your Rules:** Keep notes on filter rules changed after audits for easier maintenance and collaboration.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: No Data Shown in uBO Scope Popup
- Check that the browser extension is enabled and has all required permissions.
- Verify you are on a tab where network activity has occurred.
- Reload the page to generate fresh network requests.

### Issue: Unexpected Domains in the Allowed List
- Confirm if a filter list is active and up to date.
- Inspect if your filters have exceptions or whitelist rules.
- Make sure no other content blockers or DNS modifiers interfere.

### Issue: Badge Count Does Not Update
- Wait briefly as updates are batched approximately every second.
- Reload the targeted tab to refresh data.
- Restart the browser if persistent anomalies occur.

## Appendix: Overview of the uBO Scope Popup Interface

| Section           | Description                                      |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Summary           | Count of distinct third-party domains allowed  |
| Not Blocked       | Domains with unrestricted network access        |
| Stealth-Blocked   | Domains where network requests are silently blocked or canceled |
| Blocked           | Domains fully blocked by filter lists           |

Clicking or hovering over each domain provides a count of requests made, helping prioritize which domains are most active and impactful.
