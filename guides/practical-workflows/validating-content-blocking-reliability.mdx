# Validating Content Blocking: Myths and Realities

## Overview

This guide empowers you to use uBO Scope to gain a clear, unbiased view of your browser's actual network activity and assess how effective your content blockers truly are. It helps you move beyond misleading block count metrics or unreliable 'ad blocker test' webpages by independently verifying which connections were actually blocked or allowed.

## Why Validation Matters

Many users mistakenly equate a higher block count in their content blocker with better protection. However, block counts only reflect how many requests were blocked — not the number of distinct third-party servers your browser ends up connecting to. A high block count can coincide with more third-party connections allowed, indicating weaker actual blocking.

Similarly, 'ad blocker test' webpages simulate unrealistic scenarios and cannot detect stealthy blocking behaviors used by modern content blockers, making them unreliable benchmarks.

uBO Scope, by revealing every network connection regardless of other blockers or DNS filters, cuts through these illusions and lets you verify real-world blocking effectiveness.

---

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and active in your browser.
- At least one content blocker enabled (e.g., uBlock Origin).
- Basic familiarity with the browser toolbar and uBO Scope's popup interface (refer to [Overview of the Popup and Toolbar Badge](/guides/getting-started/overview-of-the-ui)).

---

## What You Will Achieve

- Understand how to interpret uBO Scope's domain connections relative to block counts reported by content blockers.
- Independently identify which third-party domains are truly blocked or allowed.
- Debunk common misconceptions about content blocker performance.
- Learn best practices to validate your content blocking setup accurately.

---

## Time Estimate

Approximately 10-15 minutes to complete this validation and gain confidence in your content blocker’s performance.

---

## Step-by-Step Validation Workflow

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope browser extension icon in your toolbar.
- The popup will display the active tab's hostname and summary counts of connected third-party domains.

<TaskOutcome>See the tab’s hostname clearly displayed, along with three domain categories: 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'.</TaskOutcome>

### Step 2: Review the Toolbar Badge Count

- Check the badge number on the uBO Scope icon. It shows how many distinct third-party domains your current tab connected to without being blocked.
- Remember: A **lower** badge count means fewer third-party connections allowed, indicating better blocking effectiveness.

<TaskOutcome>Confirm the badge is visible and updating as you browse.</TaskOutcome>

### Step 3: Compare with Your Content Blocker's Block Count

- Open your content blocker’s interface in the same tab.
- Record the number of blocked requests it reports.

<TaskOutcome>Understand that the block count only measures blocked HTTP requests, while uBO Scope counts distinct connected domains. Discrepancies can occur.</TaskOutcome>

### Step 4: Use uBO Scope's Domain Categorization

- **Not Blocked**: Domains with network connections allowed by your content blocker.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where content blockers use stealth techniques to silently block connections or redirects.
- **Blocked**: Domains where network requests were explicitly blocked or failed.

<TaskOutcome>You gain clear insight into what the content blocker actually blocked and what passed through stealthily or was allowed.</TaskOutcome>

### Step 5: Assess Whether Block Counts Reflect True Blocking Effectiveness

- If your content blocker reports many blocked requests but uBO Scope shows many allowed third-party domains, your content blocker may be less effective than its block count suggests.
- Conversely, a lower block count with fewer allowed connections can indicate more effective blocking.

<TaskOutcome>Make an informed judgment about your content blocker beyond superficial block counts.</TaskOutcome>

### Step 6: Validate in Real-World Scenarios

- Browse several commonly visited websites.
- Observe how the allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains change in uBO Scope.
- Check if the behavior aligns with your expectations and content blocker claims.

<TaskOutcome>Confirm your content blocker’s real behavior on typical sites, avoiding fake test pages.</TaskOutcome>

### Step 7: Repeat After Adjusting Blocker Settings

- Modify your content blocker's rules (e.g., add or remove filters).
- Repeat steps 1-6 to observe changes in uBO Scope’s reports.

<TaskOutcome>Validate the effect of your settings changes on actual third-party network connections.</TaskOutcome>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Do not rely on block counts alone.** Always verify with uBO Scope’s domain count for a clearer picture.
- **Avoid 'ad blocker test' pages.** These sites often use contrived or rare domains that don't reflect actual browsing.
- **Use uBO Scope’s categorized domain lists to detect stealth blocking.** This reveals hidden blocking your content blocker may perform.
- **Compare results across multiple real websites.** This ensures your conclusions are robust.
- **Regularly monitor updates to your filter lists** to keep blocking effective against emerging trackers.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Assuming a high block count means aggressive blocking: It may mean many superficial requests were blocked, but allowed domains remain numerous.
- Expecting test pages to reflect real-world blocking: Test pages do not emulate real complexities and often miss stealth techniques.
- Misreading the uBO Scope badge: It shows allowed third-party domains, not blocked requests—interpret inversely.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Content Blocking Validation">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Badge is Missing or Incorrect">
- Confirm uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Refresh the active tab or reopen the popup to trigger updates.
- Check for browser compatibility or permission issues with uBO Scope (see [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-run-validation/troubleshooting)).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Lists Not Populating in Popup">
- Make sure you have active network requests on the page.
- Reload the page and open the uBO Scope popup fresh.
- Confirm content blocking extension is enabled and working.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Discrepancies Between uBO Scope and Content Blocker Counts">
- Recognize the difference in what is counted (allowed 3rd-party domains vs blocked requests).
- Compare results on multiple sites to determine patterns.
- Update filter lists if you suspect outdated rules.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Real-World Example

Imagine you visit `example.com` with uBlock Origin enabled.

- uBlock Origin reports `500` blocked requests.
- uBO Scope badge shows `10` allowed third-party domains.

When opening uBO Scope's popup:

- **Not Blocked**: CDN providers like `cdn.examplecdn.com` are listed, indicating essential content was allowed.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Tracking domains like `tracker.adnetwork.com` appear here, showing they were silently blocked.
- **Blocked**: Aggressive ad servers like `ads.tracker.com` show up here, indicating explicit blocking.

This comprehensive viewpoint corrects the false perception that blocking 500 requests equals superior blocking, revealing the true third-party exposure of your browsing.
