# Identifying Third-Party Remote Connections with uBO Scope

Discovering which third-party servers your active browser tab connects to is essential for understanding your online privacy footprint and the behavior of websites you visit. uBO Scope empowers you to uncover these external connections clearly and effectively, helping you to distinguish legitimate network requests from questionable or unwanted ones.

---

## Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish

This guide walks you through practical, step-by-step instructions for using the uBO Scope popup to identify third-party remote servers accessed by your currently active tab. You will learn how to interpret the badge count on the toolbar icon, explore the domain connection lists inside the popup interface, and apply real-world examples to differentiate between expected and suspicious domains.

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope extension must be installed and enabled in your supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with browsing using tabs.
- You should have some privacy awareness or interest in monitoring third-party connections.

### Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will be able to:
- View all distinct third-party domains accessed by the active browser tab.
- Understand the significance of the badge count on the extension toolbar.
- Identify which domains were allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked.
- Investigate connection origins to make informed privacy decisions.

### Time Estimate

Approximately 5 to 10 minutes for initial exploration and basic interpretation.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

1. Find the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. It looks like the uBO logo and may display a numerical badge.
2. The badge number represents the count of distinct third-party domains your active tab connected to.

> **Tip:** A lower badge count typically indicates fewer third-party server connections, which is generally better for privacy.

### Step 2: Open the uBO Scope Popup

1. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup window.
2. The popup displays details about the active tab’s network connections.
3. If the popup shows 'NO DATA', wait a few moments or reload the active tab and try again.

### Step 3: Interpret the Popup Interface

The popup is sectioned into three main categories of domains:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains your browser successfully connected to without blocking.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were stealth-blocked. This means some connection attempts were intercepted or redirected but not fully blocked, helping content blockers remain undetectable.
- **Blocked:** Domains for which connection attempts failed or were explicitly blocked by content blocking mechanisms.

Each category lists domains along with the number of individual connection attempts.

### Step 4: Understand the Tab Hostname Display

At the top of the popup, the domain of the current active tab is shown, helping you verify which website’s connections you are inspecting.

### Step 5: Analyze Domain Origins and Legitimacy

1. Examine the domains under **Not Blocked** carefully. Legitimate domains usually include:
   - Your active tab’s own domain or its subdomains.
   - Recognized content delivery networks (CDNs) such as `cloudflare.net`, `akamai.net`, or `amazonaws.com`.

2. Domains in **Stealth-Blocked** and **Blocked** sections often indicate third parties blocked or hidden by your content blocker.

3. Use domain knowledge and external lookup:
   - Search domains online to understand their purpose.
   - Consider that small counts for known CDN or trusted service providers are expected.

### Step 6: Use the Badge Count as a Privacy Indicator

Remember, the badge number is the count of distinct allowed third-party domains. A higher number could indicate more extensive third-party tracking or resource fetching.

### Step 7: Refresh and Monitor

For a fresh analysis, reload the active tab or navigate to a new site. The badge and popup data update dynamically reflecting the current page’s connections.

> **Note:** uBO Scope reports connections regardless of your content-blocker’s filtering and can reveal attempts even when content blockers claim to block requests.

## Examples to Illustrate Domain Statuses

### Example 1: Legitimate Domain Connections

Suppose you visit `example.com`. The popup shows:

- **Allowed:** `example.com`, `cdn.cloudflare.net`
- **Stealth:** (empty)
- **Blocked:** (empty)

Interpretation:
- The active tab connects to its own domain and a known CDN, which is typical and expected.
- No suspicious or blocked domains are detected.

### Example 2: Suspicious or Questionable Domains

You visit a news site and see:

- **Allowed:** `news-site.com`, `ads.exampletracker.xyz`
- **Stealth:** `unknown-tracker.net`
- **Blocked:** `malicious-domain.bad`

Interpretation:
- The main site domain is allowed.
- A suspicious tracking domain is allowed, possibly collecting user data.
- Some stealth-blocked domains indicate stealthy blocking attempts.
- Blocked domains imply potential threats or unwanted connections stopped by filters.

Use this information to assess the privacy risk and consider fine-tuning content blockers.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Popup Shows No Data:**
   - Reload the active tab and open the popup again.
   - Ensure the extension has permission to access the active tab.
   - Confirm that you are on a valid web page (not internal browser pages).

- **Badge Count Does Not Update:**
   - Refresh the tab.
   - Restart the browser.
   - Check if any other extensions conflict with uBO Scope.

### Best Practices

- Regularly check new tabs to monitor unusual third-party connections.
- Cross-reference domains with reputable domain information services when unsure.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your primary content blocker to gain accurate insight into your browser’s network behavior.

### Performance Considerations

uBO Scope collects data asynchronously and updates the badge and popup with slight delay (about 1 second buffer), ensuring minimal impact on browser performance.

# Appendix: Technical Note on Badge Count and Domain Aggregation

The badge number represents the **number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections** for the active tab. uBO Scope groups connections by domain to provide meaningful insight, ignoring repeated hits to the same domain to avoid inflation of numbers.

Domains are parsed using a public suffix list to distinguish organizational domains from subdomains.

This design ensures the badge count faithfully reflects unique third-party entities contacted, serving as a concise privacy metric.
