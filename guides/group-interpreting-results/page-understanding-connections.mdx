# Understanding Connection Types and Outcomes

## Overview
This guide helps you understand the three core connection categories shown by uBO Scope — **Allowed**, **Blocked**, and **Stealth-Blocked** domains — as they appear in the extension’s popup UI. You will learn how to interpret what these outcomes mean for your browser's network activity, typical scenarios where they occur, and why tracking third-party domain counts is key to insightful privacy analysis.

---

## 1. What This Guide Covers
- **Meaning of Connection Types:** Clarifies what "Allowed", "Blocked", and "Stealth-Blocked" signify in real browsing conditions.
- **Contextualizing Outcomes:** How to interpret these results meaningfully for privacy evaluation.
- **Third-Party Domain Counts:** Why the distinct count of third-party domains connected to reflects your exposure surface.
- **Practical Scenarios:** Examples illustrating what you might see and what it indicates.

## 2. Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure:
- You have uBO Scope installed in a supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- The extension has permissions granted and is actively monitoring traffic.
- You know how to open and navigate the extension's popup panel showing domain connection summaries. (See the guide [Navigating the uBO Scope Popup](https://docs.ubo-scope/guides/group-getting-started/page-navigating-popup-ui.md))

## 3. Expected Outcome
By the end of this guide, you'll:
- Confidently interpret each connection type shown in the UI.
- Understand what counts of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains indicate about your browsing privacy.
- Recognize typical situations that produce these outcomes.
- Use domain counts as a practical metric to assess third-party exposure.

## Understanding Connection Types

### Allowed Domains ('not blocked')
When uBO Scope categorizes a domain under **Allowed**, it means your browser successfully connected to that third-party domain and received data without interruption.

**Why it matters:**
- These are domains your browser fetched resources from.
- Lower counts here typically reflect a smaller third-party footprint.
- Not all allowed third-party domains are malicious or problematic — some are necessary CDNs or service providers.

**Typical scenario:**
You visit a news website using a content delivery network (CDN) to serve images and scripts. These domains appear in the _Allowed_ list because resources were fetched.

---

### Blocked Domains ('blocked')
Domains shown here represent third-party connections your content blocker (or networking layer) prevented successfully connecting.

**What this means:**
- Requests to these servers failed or were rejected.
- These domains did not deliver content.
- A domain in this list contributes to privacy by reducing trackers or unwanted resource loads.

**Typical scenario:**
A tracker domain known for user profiling is blocked by your content blocker, so although your browser tried to connect, it never succeeded, and thus the domain is counted as blocked.

---

### Stealth-Blocked Domains ('stealth-blocked')
Stealth-blocking denotes domains where the connection was silently redirected or modified such that the browsing context did not realize a block happened.

**Explanation:**
- These are connections that fail or redirect without raising errors visible to the webpage.
- Your content blocker stealthily prevents connections to avoid webpage breakage or detection.
- They appear separately because, from the webpage’s perspective, no block was detected.

**Why it’s important:**
- They reflect advanced blocking techniques.
- Helps distinguish between overt and covert blocking behavior.

---

## How to Contextualize These Outcomes

uBO Scope provides a **distinct count of third-party domains connected**, which should be your primary metric to understand exposure surface:

- **Low allowed domain count** generally means fewer active external connections, reducing tracking and data leakage.
- **Blocked and stealth-blocked counts** indicate attempts to contact domains that were stopped — useful to verify content blocker effectiveness but shouldn’t be solely relied on.

> **Important:**
> uBO Scope emphasizes domain counts over raw block counts because a higher block count may paradoxically coincide with more third-party domains being contacted, increasing privacy risks.

### Practical tip:
Focus on the **number of distinct allowed domains** (green section) shown in the popup UI. This number reports the actual third-party remote servers your browser connected to successfully.

## Examples of Typical Scenarios

| Scenario                                         | Allowed Domains                | Blocked Domains                | Stealth-Blocked Domains         | Interpretation                             |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| News website with CDN and trackers               | Few CDNs + necessary services  | Tracker domains blocked        | Some stealth trackers blocked   | Typical mixed exposure and blocking        |
| Privacy-focused browsing with strict filters     | Very few allowed domains      | Multiple blocked domains       | Stealth blocking active            | Good privacy hygiene reflected              |
| Visiting a heavily tracked ad-heavy site         | Many allowed third-party domains | Blocked trackers but many allowed | Stealth blocking of trackers   | Increased exposure; blocks partially effective |

## Step-by-Step: Interpreting Your Popup UI Connection Results

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope popup panel">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup displaying domain connection summaries for the active tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the 'domains connected' count">
At the top, note the distinct number of third-party domains your browser connected to (Allowed domains count).
</Step>

<Step title="Examine the 'not blocked' section">
This lists all domains from which your browser retrieved data during the page load. Consider how many legitimate service providers (e.g., CDNs) versus potential trackers are present.
</Step>

<Step title="Check the 'blocked' section">
Observe which third-party domains were blocked explicitly by your content blocker. Multiple entries here indicate active network filtering.
</Step>

<Step title="Look at the 'stealth-blocked' section">
Recognize domains stealth-blocked to avoid page breakage or detection. Presence here confirms your content blockers use advanced blocking.
</Step>

<Step title="Contextualize the overall results">
Reflect on the combined counts to assess your browsing privacy surface and content blocker effectiveness.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions and Issues">
<Accordion title="Why do some domains appear under stealth-blocked and not blocked?">
Stealth-blocked domains are connections silently redirected or blocked without visible errors. This prevents websites from detecting blocking to avoid breakage, distinguishing them from overtly blocked domains.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can allowed domains be harmful?">
Not necessarily. Many allowed domains are legitimate services like CDNs or analytics platforms essential for website functionality. However, excessive or unknown allowed third parties could indicate privacy risk.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why should I focus on domain counts rather than block counts?">
Block counts reflect number of blocked requests, but a high block count can coincide with more allowed domains contacted, meaning more exposure. The domain count metric better reflects actual privacy impact.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I see no domains in 'blocked' or 'stealth-blocked', is that a problem?">
Not necessarily. This could mean your content blocker is permissive or the page is very clean. Evaluate allowed domain counts for exposure.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How frequently does the domain list update?">
The popup reflects network requests related to the active tab and updates in real-time as you browse.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Regularly monitoring the allowed domain count in the popup ensures you remain aware of your browsing exposure to third parties and can adjust your content blocking strategy accordingly.
</Tip>
