# Common Use Cases: Privacy Auditing and Filter List Maintenance

## Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish

This guide walks you through practical workflows to leverage uBO Scope for privacy self-auditing and maintaining filter lists. You will learn to identify unnecessary third-party connections during browsing, compare how different content blockers impact your network requests, and use uBO Scope’s detailed connection data to support filter list improvements—especially on platforms with limited browser tools.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Basic understanding of browser network requests and the roles of third-party domains.
- Familiarity with popup UI navigation (see related guides).

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Accurately audit your browsing privacy by tracking distinct third-party domains contacted.
- Understand the difference between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.
- Perform direct comparison of different content blockers based on third-party server connections.
- Utilize uBO Scope data to inform filter list maintenance and validation workflows.

### Estimated Time Commitment
Approximately 15-30 minutes to complete initial auditing and comparison.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate — requires attentive analysis and familiarity with privacy concepts, but no programming required.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Begin Privacy Self-Auditing on a Website

1. Open your browser with uBO Scope enabled.
2. Navigate to the website you want to audit.
3. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
4. Observe the **badge count** — it indicates the number of distinct third-party domains from which resources were fetched.
5. In the popup, review the three domain sections:
   - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains with allowed connections.
   - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains detected and stealthily blocked (e.g., redirects).
   - **Blocked**: Domains for which the connection was explicitly blocked.
6. Note any unexpected or suspicious third-party domains in the **allowed** list, especially if you are unaware of their role.

> **Tip**
> Focus primarily on the count of distinct allowed third-party domains for assessing your privacy exposure. Fewer is better.

### 2. Compare Content Blockers by Monitoring Third-Party Domains

1. With uBO Scope active, enable your first preferred content blocker.
2. Visit the target website and open the uBO Scope popup.
3. Record or take a screenshot of the badge count and connected domain lists.
4. Disable the first content blocker and enable a secondary blocker.
5. Refresh the website and reopen the popup.
6. Compare domain counts and domain names across the allowed, stealth, and blocked sections.

> **Warning**
> Do not rely solely on block counts reported by content blockers as an indicator of effectiveness. A higher block count can coincide with higher allowed third-party connections.

### 3. Use uBO Scope Data to Support Filter List Maintenance

1. When you identify third-party domains that should be blocked but appear in the **allowed** list:
   - Consider these domains candidates for filter list inclusion.
2. Conversely, domains in the **blocked** or **stealth-blocked** lists confirm your filter list is effectively targeting these domains.
3. Use this information especially on devices or browsers where direct developer tools are limited.
4. Collect domain counts and names over multiple browsing sessions if necessary, as uBO Scope maintains session data during active tabs.
5. Share data with filter list maintainers or update your custom lists accordingly.

> **Note**
> uBO Scope’s categorization helps differentiate between outright blocked connections and stealth blocking (such as redirect blocks), enabling granular filter evaluation.

### 4. Interpret the Data for Actionable Insights

- Focus on domains with frequent allowed connections — they are the largest contributors to third-party exposure.
- Cross-reference these domains with known filter lists and whitelist entries to avoid overblocking.
- Recognize legitimate third parties (e.g., CDNs like cloudflare.net) to avoid unnecessary filtering.

### Verification of Success
- After making filter list changes, reload relevant websites.
- Confirm that domains previously allowed now appear in the blocked or stealth-blocked sections.
- The toolbar badge count should decrease or reflect your intended privacy level.

## Examples and Scenarios

### Example: Auditing a News Website

You visit `https://news.example.com` with uBO Scope enabled:

- Badge count is 15, meaning 15 distinct third-party domains are contacted.
- Checking the popup, you notice unexpected analytics domains allowed that you didn't expect.
- You disable a content blocker and see the badge count jump to 30, indicating more third-party exposure.
- You identify two domains frequently seen in the allowed list that your filter list does not block.
- You add these domains to a custom filter and verify they move to the blocked section on refresh, reducing the badge count to 13.

### Scenario: Filter List Maintenance on Locked-down Platforms

On devices restricting developer tools (such as certain mobile browsers), uBO Scope lets filter list maintainers:
- Easily enumerate third-party connections by tab.
- Detect domains slipping through current filter lists.
- Report or update lists without needing complex tooling.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **No data in popup or badge not updating**:
  - Ensure uBO Scope has all required permissions.
  - Restart browser or reload extension.
  - Visit supported websites that make network requests.

- **Unexpected high counts despite blocking**:
  - Remember stealth-blocked domains indicate redirect or stealth blocking mechanisms.
  - Some legitimate CDNs may appear as third-party domains.

- **Domains with IDN (Internationalized Domain Names) appear encoded**:
  - uBO Scope attempts to convert them to Unicode for legibility.

### Best Practices
- Use uBO Scope together with your content blocker(s) for full context.
- Focus on distinct allowed third-party domains, not just block counts.
- Regularly check stealth-blocked domains to refine filters.
- Consider the browsing context: some domains are necessary for site functionality.

### Performance Considerations
- uBO Scope operates with minimal overhead by using session storage.
- Frequent page reloads or switching tabs should not slow down the extension.

### Alternative Approaches
- Use uBO Scope’s popup alongside native browser developer tools for deeper network inspection.
- Export or screenshot popup data to document suspected privacy leaks.
