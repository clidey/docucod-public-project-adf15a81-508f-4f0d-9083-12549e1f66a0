# Debunking Block Count Myths: Using uBO-Scope for Reliable Analysis

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you use uBO-Scope effectively to avoid common misconceptions about content blocker effectiveness based on block counts. You will learn to focus on the count of distinct third-party domains rather than raw block numbers to gain a true understanding of your browser’s network exposure.

### Prerequisites
- uBO-Scope installed on a supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with launching and using the uBO-Scope popup interface.
- Active browser tabs to analyze.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Accurately interpret the domain counts reported by uBO-Scope.
- Recognize why block counts alone can be misleading for assessing content blockers.
- Use third-party domain exposure as a reliable metric for privacy evaluation.

### Time Estimate
5 to 10 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate.

## Understanding The Myths

Before diving into uBO-Scope usage, it’s critical to understand two widespread myths:

1. **"Higher block count means a better content blocker."**
   - In reality, a high block count can coexist with *more* third-party connections. This means some blockers that show many blocks may still allow connections to numerous distinct third-party domains.

2. **"Ad blocker test webpages show reliable results."**
   - These test sites often do not simulate real-world web browsing accurately and cannot detect stealth blocking techniques used by content blockers. They generate fabricated network requests that don’t represent actual web behavior.

<u>uBO-Scope shines by showing the count of distinct third-party domains contacted — the true measure of network exposure and privacy risk.</u>

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the uBO-Scope Popup
- Click the uBO-Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup.
- The popup shows details of network requests related to the currently active browser tab.
- If no data shows immediately, refresh the active tab or wait a few seconds for data collection.

### Step 2: Review Dropdown Sections — Understanding Outcomes
- The popup categorizes domains by connection outcomes:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were silently blocked or redirected without the page’s knowledge.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests were explicitly blocked by the content blocker.

### Step 3: Focus on Unique Third-Party Domains
- Observe the "domains connected" summary count at the top of the popup. This number reflects the total *distinct* third-party domains contacted, **not** the number of blocked requests.

### Step 4: Analyze Domain Counts Instead of Block Counts
- Use the count of allowed domains as the main indicator of exposure.
- Realize that a content blocker allowing connections to fewer distinct third parties protects your privacy better.

### Step 5: Compare Across Content Blockers (Optional)
- Test multiple content blockers by repeating these steps.
- Compare the domain counts rather than just badge block numbers or block counts.

### Step 6: Refresh and Validate
- Refresh the tested webpage to ensure data is current.
- Verify the domain and hostname information matches the active tab.

## Real-World Example

Imagine you visit a popular news site:

- Content Blocker A shows a badge with a block count of 30 but allows connections to 15 distinct third-party domains.
- Content Blocker B shows a badge with a block count of 20 but allows connections to 25 distinct third-party domains.

Despite the higher block count in Content Blocker A, it actually exposes you to fewer unique third-party connections and is therefore more privacy-protective. uBO-Scope makes this visible by focusing on domain counts.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Popup Not Showing Data">
- Make sure you have a tab active with network activity.
- Refresh the active tab to trigger data collection.
- Confirm uBO-Scope has necessary permissions (webRequest API).
- Review the Troubleshooting Installation Issues guide if the popup never populates.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Empty or Incorrect">
- Badge count reflects distinct allowed third-party domains only.
- If content blockers use stealth blocking or external DNS-based blocking, raw block counts may differ from what uBO-Scope shows.
- Use the popup for reliable counts rather than the badge alone.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Misinterpretation of Block Counts">
- Avoid thinking higher block counts always mean better blocking.
- Check both blocked and allowed domain counts to understand exposure.
- Remember stealth-blocked domains might not appear in block counts but are still restricted.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Always consider the context and aim for the *lowest number of allowed third-party domains*. This is the most reliable indicator of reduced privacy risk.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

- Use uBO-Scope alongside your preferred content blocker to audit real browsing behavior.
- Regularly monitor domain counts, especially on frequently visited sites.
- Share findings with filter list maintainers to help improve blocking effectiveness.
- Avoid relying on third-party "block count" metrics and ad blocker test sites.
