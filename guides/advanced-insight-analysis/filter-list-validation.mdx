# Validating Filter Lists with uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide enables filter list maintainers and privacy enthusiasts to confidently leverage uBO Scope for validating the effectiveness of filter lists. By using practical methods to analyze connection outcomes—especially on devices where traditional debugging may be restricted (e.g., locked-down or mobile environments)—users will learn how to interpret stealth-blocked requests, blocked connections, and allowed domains.

uBO Scope surfaces valuable visibility into network requests beyond the limitations of typical block counts, allowing you to adjust and refine your filter lists based on observed network behavior.

---

## Prerequisites
- **uBO Scope installed and enabled** in your preferred supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Basic familiarity with network requests and filter list terminology (allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains).
- Access to the uBO Scope popup panel and badge for your active browser tabs.

For installation and setup, see [Install uBO Scope](/getting-started/installation-basics/extension-installation) and [Launching uBO Scope](/getting-started/first-run-and-configuration/starting-extension).

---

## Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Use uBO Scope's popup panel to read connection summaries and classify requests.
- Identify stealth-blocked connections and understand their significance.
- Analyze blocked requests to spot gaps or over-blocking in your filters.
- Adjust or validate filter rules based on real network request outcomes.
- Effectively debug filter lists even on restricted devices.

---

## Time Estimate
Approximately 15 to 30 minutes, depending on your familiarity with filter lists and uBO Scope's interface.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open uBO Scope for the Target Browser Tab
- Click the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar to open the popup panel for the active tab.
- Observe the tab hostname displayed at the top—this reflects the main domain under inspection.
- Verify that the domain count at the summary section updates to reflect connected domains.

### 2. Understand the Breakdown of Connection Outcomes
uBO Scope groups domains by outcomes:
- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains whose requests were permitted.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Requests blocked silently such as redirect attempts or requests with no visible response.
- **Blocked**: Requests explicitly blocked, typically by filter rules.

Each section lists domains contacted and the count of requests.

### 3. Identify Stealth Blocked Domains
- Stealth blocking indicates connections that were attempted but did not complete normally and were blocked quietly.
- Use stealth outcomes to spot connections circumventing filters via redirection or hiding.

### 4. Analyze Blocked Connections
- Blocked sections reveal domains where filter rules blocked requests outright.
- A high count here indicates active filtering but does not reflect what got through.

### 5. Analyze Allowed Connections
- Allowed domains are those requests permitted, potentially unintended or missed by filters.
- Cross-reference these domains with your filter list to ensure that critical third-party connections are covered.

### 6. Use Connection Outcomes to Adjust Filters
- Inspect the domains in each outcome section.
- If suspicious or unwanted domains appear in "Allowed," consider creating or refining filter rules targeting these domains.
- Monitor stealth-blocked domains for attempts to bypass filters; refine filter rules accordingly.

### 7. Verify on Locked-Down or Mobile Devices
- uBO Scope works even where developer tools might be limited or unavailable.
- Use the extension’s popup and badge on mobile browsers to validate filter effectiveness.

### 8. Iteratively Test and Refine
- Repeat the inspection after each filter list adjustment.
- Look for reductions in allowed or stealth-blocked connections to confirm improvements.

## Practical Tips

- **Badge Count Reflection**: The toolbar badge reflects the number of unique allowed third-party domains; a lower count is desirable for privacy.
- **Stealth vs. Blocked**: Do not confuse stealth-blocked connections with plain blocked domains; stealth-blocked are often harder to detect and may indicate filter evasion tactics.
- **Check Request Context**: Correlate domain patterns with your filter lists and known tracking domains to prioritize filter refinement.
- **Use Real Browsing Sessions**: Test with actual web pages that represent typical user activity to capture realistic network traffic.
- **Leverage Public Suffix List (PSL)**: Recognize domain relationships accurately, as uBO Scope uses PSL to identify registered domains.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Stealth and Filter Validation">
<Accordion title="No Data or Empty Popup">
- Ensure uBO Scope has proper permissions granted.
- Verify the page has made network requests; reload if necessary.
- Confirm you are looking at the active tab for which uBO Scope is reporting.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpectedly High Allowed Domains Count">
- Double-check your filter list for missing rules.
- Consider that some legitimate connections might not be blockable without breaking functionality.
- Test with different sites to rule out site-specific behaviors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth-Blocked Domains Not Showing as Blocked">
- Stealth block indicates connection attempts not recorded in standard block metrics.
- Review your filters for redirect-based or script-based block rules.
- Update uBO Scope and filter lists to latest versions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Badge Not Updating">
- Reload the browser tab and uBO Scope popup.
- Check extension status and permissions.
- Consult logs or refresh session data as per [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](/getting-started/setup-support/troubleshooting-setup).
</Accordion>

## Real-World Example

Imagine maintaining a filter list for a popular news website. After installing uBO Scope:

1. Visit the news site, open uBO Scope popup.
2. Notice "Allowed" domains include an unfamiliar tracking domain.
3. Stealth-blocked section shows connections attempting redirection through third-party ad servers.
4. Create a rule blocking the suspected tracking domain.
5. Reload the site.
6. Observe the tracking domain shifts to blocked and stealth-blocked domains reduce.
7. Badge updates reflect improved privacy.

This workflow empowers practical and data-driven tuning of your filter rules.

## Summary
Leveraging uBO Scope to validate filter lists provides real, actionable insights into which connections are truly blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed. This empowers maintainers to refine filters to improve privacy protections, especially where developer tools are inaccessible.

Use the structured workflow above to effectively validate filters in everyday and restricted environments.
