# Comparing Content Blockers: Myths & Reliable Results

## Overview

This guide helps you use uBO Scope to accurately compare the effectiveness of different content blockers. It explains why relying on toolbar badge block counts alone can be misleading and provides best practices to conduct apples-to-apples evaluations of content blockers’ real-world privacy impact. 

## What This Guide Will Help You Accomplish

- Understand the true meaning behind uBO Scope’s badge counts.
- Recognize common myths when comparing content blockers.
- Perform consistent, fair comparisons to measure actual blocking effectiveness.
- Interpret connection summaries to distinguish allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked network requests.

## Why Badge Counts Are Misleading

Many users assume a higher block count (the number displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar badge) means a better content blocker. This assumption is false. 


- **Badge Count Meaning:** uBO Scope’s badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains from which resources were **allowed** (not blocked) to load.
- **Lower Is Better:** A lower number means fewer third-party remote servers reached by your browser — a better privacy outcome.
- **Misconception:** A content blocker with a higher block count might actually be **less effective** if your browser ends up connecting to more unique third-party domains overall.


<Tip>
Always interpret the badge count as an indicator of unique allowed connections, **not** of how many requests were blocked. 
</Tip>

## Myth: "More blocks means better blocking"

Content blockers can implement stealthy blocking strategies or different filtering methods. A blocker showing more blocked requests may still allow connections to more third-party domains, increasing your privacy exposure unintentionally.

### Real-World Example

| Content Blocker | Blocks Reported | Unique Allowed Domains | Privacy Exposure |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Blocker A       | 120             | 15                     | Lower exposure   |
| Blocker B       | 90              | 25                     | Higher exposure  |

Here, Blocker A blocks more requests but allows fewer unique domains, offering better privacy despite what a simple block count might suggest.

## Myth: "Ad blocker test pages show reliable results"

Specialized "ad blocker test" webpages are poor benchmarking tools:

- They request artificial or fabricated resources not typically used in real websites.
- They do not account for stealth-blocking techniques used by modern content blockers.
- Webpages cannot see or replicate the underlying network blocking mechanisms accurately.

Therefore, don't rely on these test pages for meaningful comparisons.

## Using uBO Scope to Compare Content Blockers Accurately

### Step 1: Install and Enable uBO Scope

Ensure uBO Scope is installed and active in your browser (Chromium, Firefox, or Safari). Visit the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/essentials/installation) if needed.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Testing Environment

- Use the same browser version for each test.
- Clear browser caches and cookies between tests to avoid cached resource influence.
- Disable other extensions that might affect network requests.
- Use consistent website URLs or sets of real-world sites.

### Step 3: Load the Website Under Test

- Open the website(s) you want to compare.
- Wait for the page to fully load to capture all network activity.

### Step 4: Observe the uBO Scope Badge and Popup

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
- Look at the domain counts and connection outcomes:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections silently redirected or stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Connections outright blocked.

### Step 5: Record and Compare

- Note the number of distinct allowed domains (badge count).
- Compare with your results from other content blockers under the same conditions.
- Pay special attention to stealth-blocked domains to understand subtle blocking differences.

<Tip>
Consistency is key. Use the same sites and clean browsing state each time you test a different blocker to ensure apples-to-apples comparison.
</Tip>

## Understanding Connection Outcomes in uBO Scope

- **Allowed:** Network requests that completed successfully, allowing resource load from that domain.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests that were intercepted or silently redirected, often by blocking DNS or extension stealth techniques.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed with errors due to the content blocker actively blocking them.

These categories help you comprehend the nuances of how each content blocker operates beyond mere block counts.

## Best Practices for Reliable Comparisons

1. **Focus on Unique Allowed Domains:** Trust the badge count as the primary privacy-impact metric.
2. **Use Realistic Websites:** Test on common, real websites rather than synthetic test pages.
3. **Repeat Tests:** Perform multiple test runs to account for network variability.
4. **Document Context:** Record browsing conditions, blocker versions, and test URLs.
5. **Check Stealth Block Data:** Include analysis of stealth-blocked domains to catch subtler differences.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Badge count doesn't update:** Reload the page and verify uBO Scope is active.
- **No connection data shown in popup:** Confirm the content blocker and uBO Scope permissions are intact.
- **Inconsistent results:** Ensure caches are cleared and tests run under identical conditions.

Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/essentials/troubleshooting) guide for detailed help.

## Summary

Using uBO Scope correctly enables you to see beyond misleading block count badges and unreliable ad blocker test pages. Focus on unique allowed domains to accurately gauge content blocker effectiveness.
