# Analyzing Network Requests with uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide empowers you to use uBO Scope to uncover which remote servers a webpage connects to and understand their role in your browsing experience. You will learn how uBO Scope distinguishes between first-party and third-party requests and how it classifies connection outcomes as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked. This knowledge enables you to gain transparency into network activity and assess the privacy impact of visited websites.

---

## What This Guide Helps You Achieve
- Identify all remote servers contacted by the current webpage.
- Distinguish between first-party and third-party connections.
- Understand the significance of connection outcomes: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- Interpret the limits of what uBO Scope can detect.

## Prerequisites
- uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser.
- You have basic familiarity with browser extensions and accessing their popup interfaces.
- Your browser supports the `webRequest` API, and uBO Scope has the necessary permissions.

## Outcome After Following This Guide
You will be able to open uBO Scope, analyze the domains your browser connects to upon loading a webpage, and understand what portion of these connections are allowed versus blocked in various forms. This insight gives you a clearer picture of actual network activity beyond typical adblocker block counts.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open uBO Scope's Popup
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser.
- The popup displays connection data for the active tab.

### 2. Identify the First-Party Domain
- At the top, observe the hostname of the current tab’s webpage.
- The first party domain is the primary site you are visiting.

### 3. Review Connections by Outcome
- The popup breaks down domains contacted into three categories:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains from which your browser successfully fetched resources.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains that uBO Scope detects were blocked in a subtle manner, often via redirects or other stealth techniques.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where connection attempts were outright blocked.
- Each category lists domains contacted along with the count of requests per domain.

### 4. Distinguish First-Party vs. Third-Party
- uBO Scope reports the number of distinct third-party domains connected, not just the total requests.
- The first-party domain typically matches the website you are visiting, while third-party domains belong to other entities.

### 5. Understand What uBO Scope Can See
- uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor network requests.
- It can report on requests visible to this API, including those blocked or redirected by content blockers.
- Requests made outside the `webRequest` API’s reach (e.g., some DNS-level blocking) will not be reported.

### 6. Tips for Interpreting the Data
- A **lower count of distinct third-party domains** in the Allowed category generally indicates better privacy protection.
- Stealth-blocked domains indicate more sophisticated blocking methods and should be interpreted as blocked but possibly hidden from webpage detection.
- Blocked domains are explicit connection failures.

### 7. Refresh and Verify
- Reload the webpage to see updated connection data.
- Compare connection outcomes after changing privacy or content blocker settings to observe their effect.

## Real-World Example
Suppose you visit a news site and open uBO Scope:

- The first-party domain is `examplenews.com`.
- You observe in **Not Blocked** a few domains like `cdn.examplenews.com` and `fonts.gstatic.com`.
- In **Stealth-Blocked**, you see `tracker.adnetwork.com` indicating tracker requests were stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked** contains `ads.exampleads.com` which were completely blocked.

This tells you the site loads its own resources plus some content from Google Fonts, successfully blocks most ads and trackers, but some tracker requests use stealth-blocking.

## Common Questions

### How does uBO Scope separate first-party from third-party domains?
It uses the Public Suffix List to determine the main domain of your active tab and compares connected domains against it. Domains not belonging to the main domain are considered third-party.

### Why don’t I see all requests I expect?
Some network requests bypass the `webRequest` API or occur outside the browser's monitoring scope, so they won’t appear.

### What does stealth-blocked mean?
It denotes requests blocked by advanced techniques such as silent redirects or rewrites that prevent the webpage from detecting the block.

### Can uBO Scope replace my content blocker?
No. uBO Scope reports network activity and is designed to work alongside content blockers, giving you transparent insight.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If the popup shows no data or outdated data, reload the active webpage and reopen uBO Scope.
- Verify your browser supports the necessary APIs (`webRequest` and Manifest v3).
- Ensure uBO Scope has permissions for the current site.
- Clearing browser extension data or restarting your browser may resolve persistent issues.

## Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope regularly to audit network connections on sensitive websites.
- When adjusting content blockers, verify changes in uBO Scope to understand their real-world impact.
- Combine insights from uBO Scope with other privacy tools for comprehensive coverage.
