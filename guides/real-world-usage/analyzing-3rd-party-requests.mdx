# Analyzing Third-Party Connections on Any Site

Understanding the external domains a website connects to is critical for evaluating privacy risks and web performance. This guide focuses on how to use uBO Scope's popup interface to identify and analyze all third-party domains contacted by the active webpage. By following this guide, you will learn how to spot potential privacy concerns and distinguish between essential and non-essential external connections.

---

## 1. Why Analyze Third-Party Connections?

Websites today often rely on several external services such as content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics, advertising platforms, and social media widgets. Some connections are necessary for proper site functionality, while others may track your browsing or introduce security risks. Using uBO Scope to inspect these connections helps you to:

- Gain transparency into every external domain your browser contacts when loading a webpage.
- Evaluate the legitimacy and necessity of third-party resources.
- Detect potentially invasive or unnecessary connections.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before beginning this analysis, ensure that:

- uBO Scope is installed and enabled in your browser.
- You have a webpage loaded that you want to analyze.
- You understand the basic interface of the uBO Scope popup (see [Your First Look: How to Use the uBO Scope Popup](./your-first-use.md)).

## 3. Expected Outcome

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

- Open uBO Scope’s popup for the current tab.
- Understand and interpret the categorized lists of connected third-party domains.
- Identify privacy risks associated with stealthy or blocked connections.
- Make informed decisions about which domains might be essential or invasive.

## 4. Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup panel displaying the network request summary for the active tab.

**Expected Result:** You see the domain name of the current webpage at the top and the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
</Step>

<Step title="Refresh the Webpage to Collect Connection Data">
If you just installed uBO Scope or need fresh data, refresh the webpage in your browser. The extension captures and categorizes network requests as the page loads.

**Expected Result:** The popup updates with real-time data reflecting all third-party connections, updating badge counts.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Summary of Connected Domains">
Observe the total number of unique third-party remote domains under "domains connected." This count indicates how many distinct external domains the webpage contacted during loading.

**Tip:** A lower count generally means fewer third-party data exposures.
</Step>

<Step title="Understand the Domain Categorization">
The popup lists domains under three sections:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains your browser successfully connected with.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections redirected, typically by stealth blocking implemented by content blockers to hide requests without breaking webpage behavior.
- **Blocked:** Connections that failed or were explicitly blocked.

Review each list to understand the nature and volume of connections with those domains.

**Decision Points:**
- Is a domain critical for site functionality (e.g., CDN)?
- Is a blocked or stealth-blocked domain related to tracking or advertising?
</Step>

<Step title="Analyze Domain Names Carefully">
Look at the domain names. Use your judgment or external research to identify:

- Legitimate essential services (e.g., `cdn.example.net`, `fonts.googleapis.com`).
- Suspicious or unknown domains that may pose privacy risks.

Use the fully qualified domain names shown; uBO Scope normalizes internationalized domains for clarity.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Connection Counts per Domain">
Each domain row displays a count badge indicating how many distinct hostnames within that domain were contacted.

**Expected Results:**
- Higher counts can signify heavier use or multiple resources loaded from that domain.
- Domains with multiple hostnames may warrant further investigation.
</Step>

<Step title="Make Privacy-Informed Decisions">
Based on your analysis:

- Allow connections to necessary third parties critical for content or performance.
- Consider blocking or investigating stealth-blocked or blocked domains further.

**Best Practice:** Combine this analysis with filter lists or privacy tools to fine-tune your browsing safety.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Real-World Example

Imagine visiting an online news article:

- The **not blocked** list includes domains like `cdn.newswebsite.com` and `fonts.gstatic.com`, which are necessary.
- The **stealth-blocked** list shows `ads.tracker.com` and `analytics.datahub.net`, indicating trackers are hidden but being contacted.
- The **blocked** section has some ad or social media domains your content blocker actively filtered out.

You identify that the number of third-party domains is relatively high. You decide to investigate the stealth-blocked domains further by reviewing filter lists or blocking them explicitly if undesired.

## 6. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Refresh when unsure:** Connection data is captured per page load.
- **Use domain knowledge:** Legitimate CDNs and service providers usually have recognizable domains.
- **Beware of redirects:** Domains in the stealth-blocked category may be hidden via redirects to evade detection.
- **Understand badge counts:** The badge on the extension icon shows distinct third-party domains, not the number of requests.
- **Cross-check with filter lists:** Compare suspicious domains with popular privacy blocklists.

## 7. Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues While Analyzing Third-Party Connections">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists">
- Ensure the active tab is a website that performs network requests.
- Refresh the page to trigger data capture anew.
- Confirm uBO Scope is properly installed and has necessary permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count is Zero Even Though Connections Seem Present">
- Some browser APIs limit visibility; consider verifying with developer tools or other extensions.
- Other blockers or DNS filters may interfere with request reporting.
- See [Integration & Compatibility](../overview/features-at-a-glance/integration-and-compatibility) for details.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Names Appear as Punycode or Encoded">
- uBO Scope converts internationalized domain names for clarity.
- Hover or review domain names carefully; no user action needed.
</Accordion>

## 8. Additional Resources & Next Steps

- Review [Your First Look: How to Use the uBO Scope Popup](./your-first-use.md) for detailed UI understanding.
- Learn about badge counts and domain classification in [Interpreting Badge Counts and Domains List](./interpreting-badge-counts.md).
- Understand core terminology in [Core Concepts & Terminology](../../overview/concepts-architecture/core-concepts-and-terminology).
- Explore how the extension integrates in your browser environment in [Integration & Compatibility](../../overview/features-at-a-glance/integration-and-compatibility).

Use this guide as a foundation for deeper investigation into site third-party behavior and enhancing your browser privacy posture.

## 10. Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup title="FAQs on Third-Party Connection Analysis">
<Accordion title="Why does the number of connected domains differ between uBO Scope and typical content blockers?">
The badge count in uBO Scope reflects distinct third-party domains contacted, regardless of blocking outcome, including stealth-blocked connections. Content blockers may count blocked requests differently or may not show redirected or stealth-blocked connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I distinguish between necessary and tracking-related third-party domains?">
Primarily by domain knowledge and research—CDNs and popular service providers are usually safe, while unfamiliar or tracker-related domains often appear in the stealth-blocked or blocked lists. Using filter lists alongside uBO Scope improves accuracy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is every blocked domain a privacy risk?">
Not necessarily. Some blocked domains could be benign or part of overblocking. Consider the context and whether the domain serves essential content or tracking.
