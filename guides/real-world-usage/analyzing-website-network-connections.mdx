# Analyzing Website Network Connections

## Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
This guide walks you through using **uBO Scope** to analyze live network connections initiated by any webpage you visit. It focuses on real-time discovery of remote server connections, helping you distinguish between first-party and third-party requests, and interpreting the outcomes of those requests as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that uBO Scope is **installed and active** in your compatible browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Familiarize yourself with how to open the uBO Scope popup interface from your browser toolbar.
- Understand basic networking terms like domain, hostname, request, and the distinction between first-party and third-party servers.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- View all remote server connection attempts made by the current webpage.
- Identify which requests were successfully allowed, which were blocked, and which were stealth-blocked.
- Distinguish between the main site domain and third-party domains.
- Use uBO Scope's detailed reporting to enhance privacy awareness and auditing of websites.

### Time Estimate
~ 5 to 10 minutes to perform initial analysis and interpretation per website.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner - intermediate. Basic understanding of web browsing and domains expected.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup
1. Navigate to the webpage you want to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
3. Wait a moment for the popup to load and display connection data.


### 2. Understand the Popup Header
- The header shows the website's hostname and domain, clearly separating what is considered first-party.
  - For example, if the hostname is `news.example.com` and the domain is `example.com`, the popup visually distinguishes the subdomain from the main domain.


### 3. Review the Summary Section
- The summary displays the **number of distinct domains** connected to by the webpage.
- This count reflects third-party domains contacted, which signals the network exposure caused by the website.


### 4. Explore Domain Connection Outcomes
The popup groups connected domains into three outcome categories:

#### Allowed (Not Blocked)
- These are domains that the browser successfully connected to from the webpage.
- Typically includes legitimate first-party servers and essential third-party services.


#### Stealth-Blocked
- Domains in this category are those where connections were redirected or somehow stealthily blocked by the content filtering mechanism or browser.
- The extension captures these to indicate requests that were attempted but prevented from fully reaching their target.


#### Blocked
- These domains represent connection attempts that were explicitly blocked (failed) according to the webRequest API observations.


### 5. Analyze Domains and Connection Counts
- Each domain is listed along with a count showing how many requests were made to that domain during the session.
- Sort and compare these counts to identify domains with heavy or suspicious network activity.


### 6. Recognize First-Party vs. Third-Party Connections
- The domain in the popup header is considered the **first-party domain** (the website you access).
- All other domains shown in the Allowed, Stealth, or Blocked lists are considered **third-party** and represent external services.


### 7. Interpret Badge Counts on the Toolbar Icon
- The toolbar badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains contacted (Allowed domains count).
- Lower badge counts generally indicate fewer third-party connections, which can mean better privacy.


### 8. Refresh and Revisit
- Reload the website to collect fresh connection data.
- Reopen the uBO Scope popup to analyze new or changing network requests.

## Examples & Scenarios

### Example: Analyzing a News Website
Suppose you visit `https://news.example.com`:
- The popup header will show `news` as the hostname and `example.com` as the domain.
- Under Allowed, you might see `cdn.example.net` with a count of 25, representing content delivery network requests.
- Under Stealth-Blocked, domains like `trackers.example.org` may appear, indicating blocked tracking attempts.
- The badge count might show `5`, meaning 5 distinct third-party domains were contacted successfully.


### Example: Identifying Excessive Third-Party Connections
On an e-commerce site, seeing dozens of different third-party domains in the Allowed list may raise privacy concerns or indicate many tracking and advertising services.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Use Public Suffix List Awareness:** uBO Scope uses the public suffix list to accurately detect domain boundaries; this prevents misclassification of domains.
- **Check Consistency:** Domains contacted repeatedly across sessions may be core services; random or one-off domains could be suspicious.
- **Monitor Badge Counts Regularly:** Sudden spikes or higher-than-expected counts might signal unwanted tracking or ad networks.
- **Combine with Filter List Insights:** Use alongside content blockers to validate if domains you want blocked are actually not contacted.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### No Data Shown in Popup
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and has the required permissions.
- Refresh the webpage to trigger network activity.
- Check browser compatibility and minimum version requirements.

### Badge Count Not Updating
- Switch browser tabs or refresh the page to refresh data collection.
- Confirm extension is not disabled or conflicts with other extensions.

### Domain Names Appear Punycode-Encoded
- The popup automatically converts punycode to readable Unicode; if you see encoded names, this might be a display glitch or rare configuration issue.
