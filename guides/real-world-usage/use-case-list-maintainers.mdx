# Workflows for Filter List Maintainers

## Overview
This guide is tailored specifically for filter list maintainers or advanced users who want to analyze network requests in detail using uBO Scope. It walks you step-by-step through workflows to review stealth-blocked connections, distinguish between allowed and blocked third-party domains, and gain practical insights into the effectiveness of content blocking rules.

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
- Understand how to use uBO Scope's popup interface for detailed network request analysis.
- Identify stealth-blocked domains versus allowed and outright blocked domains.
- Leverage network connection outcomes to refine and validate filter lists.
- Gain actionable insights into how content blockers interact with various third-party domains.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed on a supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with uBO Scope's popup interface and terminology (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).
- Recommended: Review the [Core Terms & Concepts](https://yourdomain/overview/architecture-core-concepts/core-terms-concepts) and [Understanding the Popup Interface](https://yourdomain/guides/getting-started/understanding-popup) documentation before proceeding.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to systematically interpret and utilize the data uBO Scope provides, allowing you to:
- Differentiate actual blocking from stealth blocking.
- Identify which domains your filter list allows or blocks.
- Effectively troubleshoot and optimize filter rules.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15 to 30 minutes depending on the depth of analysis.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate to Advanced.

## Step-by-Step Workflows

### 1. Open and Prepare uBO Scope Popup
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup window.
- Confirm the active tab's hostname is displayed at the top.
- Review the summary showing the total number of distinct third-party domains connected.

> The popup categorizes third-party domains into three sections:
> - **Not Blocked** (allowed)
> - **Stealth-Blocked**
> - **Blocked**


### 2. Analyze Allowed Domains
- Expand the **not blocked** section.
- Examine the list of domains and their badge counts, which represent number of requests.
- Identify legitimate CDNs or services that are purposefully allowed.

> **Tip:** Filter list maintainers often expect certain low-count, known safe domains to remain allowed. Large or unexpected allowed domains may warrant investigation.


### 3. Investigate Stealth-Blocked Domains
- Expand the **stealth-blocked** section.
- Understand that stealth blocking means requests were intercepted and modified (often redirected) to hide blocking from the webpage.
- Identify domains that are stealth-blocked as these represent subtle but effective blocking behaviors.

> **Best Practice:** Verify that stealth block entries correspond to intended filter list rules. Unexpected stealth blocks could indicate overly aggressive or misconfigured rules.


### 4. Review Blocked Domains
- Open the **blocked** section.
- This list shows domains for which requests have failed or been explicitly blocked.
- Cross-reference with known filter rules targeting these domains for confirmation.


### 5. Cross-Reference Domain Data with Filter Lists
Use observed domain statuses to validate and refine your filter list:
- Allowed domains with high request counts might be candidates for blocking if privacy concerns exist.
- Domains stealth-blocked might require rule adjustment to avoid unnecessary site breakage.
- Blocked domains confirm your rules are effective.


### 6. Use Badge Counts for Prioritization
Look at badge counts (number next to domain names) to prioritize:
- High count domains represent more frequent connections and potential privacy impact.
- Low count domains may be less critical but should still be monitored for relevance.


### 7. Troubleshooting and Verification
- If expected blocks or stealth blocks do not appear, check permissions and extension configuration.
- Reload the webpage and promptly open the popup to ensure fresh data capture.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Initial Setup](https://yourdomain/getting-started/first-steps-and-validation/troubleshooting-setup) guide for issues like no popup data or badge count mismatches.


## Examples

### Example: Detecting Unintended Allowed Domains
Suppose you see "example-analytics.com" listed under **not blocked** with a high badge count.
- Investigate your filter list to check if this domain is explicitly blocked.
- If not, consider adding or updating a rule.
- After updating, reload the page and observe if the domain moves to blocked or stealth-blocked sections.


### Example: Confirming Stealth-Blocking Effectiveness
You notice "tracker.xyz" is in the stealth-blocked list.
- This indicates your filter silently redirected or canceled this request.
- Confirm that your stealth block rules are active.
- Use this insight to ensure stealth blocking is balanced between invisibility and website functionality.


## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Popup shows NO DATA:** Refresh the active tab or check extension permissions.
- **Badge count is zero despite known trackers on page:** Content blocker might use techniques outside webRequest API detection.
- **Domains not categorized as expected:** Make sure you are running the latest version and that permissions include `webRequest`.


### Best Practices for Filter List Maintainers
- Periodically reset and reload browsing contexts to test new or updated filter rules.
- Cross-check stealth-blocked vs blocked domains to balance user privacy and browsing experience.
- Make use of badge counts to gauge domains that have the greatest network footprint.


### Performance Considerations
- uBO Scope processes network requests asynchronously in batches, so slight delay in data updates is normal.

## Appendix: uBO Scope Popup Interface Overview

Your primary interface for these workflows is the uBO Scope popup window, which displays for the active tab the third-party domains categorized by their connection status:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which resources were fetched successfully.
- **Stealth Blocked:** Domains where requests were intercepted and rerouted or hidden from the page.
- **Blocked:** Domains for which requests failed or were explicitly blocked.

Each domain entry shows a badge count indicating the number of requests associated with it.
