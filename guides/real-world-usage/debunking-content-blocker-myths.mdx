# Debunking Content Blocker Myths with uBO Scope

Understanding how well a content blocker protects your privacy can be challenging, especially when relying solely on metrics like block counts or test webpages. This guide uses uBO Scope’s objective measurements to confront two common misconceptions about content blockers, empowering you to evaluate blocker effectiveness based on real network connection data rather than misleading metrics.

---

## 1. Why Connection Counts Matter More Than Block Counts

Many users assume that a higher number of blocked requests (block count) means better privacy protection. However, this is a misconception. uBO Scope tracks the number of **distinct third-party remote servers** your browser connects to, providing a clearer understanding of your actual network exposure.

### Key Points:
- **Block Count vs. Distinct Server Connections**: A blocker reporting a high block count might still allow connections to many different third-party servers, increasing your exposure.
- **uBO Scope Badge Count**: The toolbar badge shows how many unique third-party domains your browser connected to — a lower count means fewer external connections and generally better privacy.

### Practical Impact:
When comparing content blockers, focus on the number of unique third-party domains contacted rather than raw block counts. uBO Scope reveals this by monitoring all network requests independently of the blocking tool.

<Tip>
The badge count represents distinct third-party domains that your browser contacted, not just the number of blocked requests. Aim for the lowest possible number on this badge to maximize privacy.
</Tip>

## 2. Avoid Using "Ad Blocker Test" Pages as Reliability Benchmarks

Websites claiming to test ad blockers often use artificial or exaggerated network requests. These tests can be misleading because:

- Many content blockers use stealth or partial blocking techniques to prevent detection, meaning test sites can't measure blocking reliably.
- Test pages generate unusual or unrealistic network requests that do not represent normal browsing behavior.

uBO Scope measures all network requests your browser makes during real browsing sessions, providing accurate data on actual third-party connections.

<Tip>
Disregard "ad blocker test" webpages as they provide no reliable indication of content blocker effectiveness.
</Tip>

## 3. Understanding uBO Scope’s Objective Data

### What uBO Scope Does:
- Monitors **all network requests** launched by your browser,
- Identifies whether each request was allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked,
- Counts distinct third-party domains separately for each category,
- Updates the toolbar badge with the real-time count of distinct allowed third-party domains.

This approach provides a transparent and unbiased view of your browser’s network activity.

### Example Scenario:
Imagine visiting a news website which loads resources from 5 distinct third-party domains. Content Blocker A blocks many requests but still allows connections to 4 unique domains. Content Blocker B blocks fewer requests but allows connections to only 2 unique domains. uBO Scope would show a lower badge count for Content Blocker B, revealing it provides better control over network exposure despite the lower block count.

## 4. Step-by-Step Guide to Validate Blocker Effectiveness

<Steps>
<Step title="Install uBO Scope">
Install the uBO Scope extension from the official browser store:
- For Chromium, visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- For Firefox, visit [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

Ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
</Step>

<Step title="Browse Target Site">
Navigate to a website you want to evaluate for third-party connections.

Watch the uBO Scope toolbar badge to see the live count of distinct third-party domains contacted.
</Step>

<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup UI.

Review the lists under:
- Not blocked (allowed connections)
- Stealth-blocked
- Blocked

Each lists distinct domain names and counts of requests.
</Step>

<Step title="Compare with Other Blockers">
Repeat the test using other content blockers on the same site.

Observe the badge count differences.

Focus on which blocker results in the lowest number of distinct third-party domains connected.
</Step>

<Step title="Avoid Relying on Test Pages">
Ignore ad blocker test pages and instead repeatedly test across real-world sites to get an authentic performance snapshot.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Best Practices for Evaluating Privacy Protection

- Use uBO Scope’s badge count as your primary indicator of actual exposure to third-party networks.
- Remember that some blocking techniques might not increase block counts but improve domain-level privacy.
- Trust real browsing data, not synthetic tests or block count metrics alone.
- Regularly monitor uBO Scope reports during your browsing to detect unexpected third-party activity.

<Tip>
Combine uBO Scope with a content blocker to gain an unmatched view of your true network exposure and blocker effectiveness.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Misinterpretations

<AccordionGroup title="Common Misconceptions and Resolutions">
<Accordion title="Why Does a Higher Block Count Not Always Mean Better Blocking?">
Block counts represent total blocked requests, which can include many requests to the same domains. The actual privacy impact depends on how many unique third-party domains are contacted, which is what uBO Scope counts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My Blocker Shows Fewer Blocks, So Is It Worse?">
Not necessarily. Some blockers reduce background noise requests but prevent connections to more unique domains, resulting in fewer blocks but better privacy.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ad Blocker Tests Show Different Results Than uBO Scope">
Ad blocker test pages use non-realistic requests and detection evasion; uBO Scope measures actual network connections during real browsing, providing more trustworthy data.
</Accordion>
