# Debunking Badge and Adblock Test Myths with uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide helps users understand common misunderstandings about the badge counts shown by content blockers and the reliability of third-party adblock test pages, using **uBO Scope** as a practical tool. 

You will learn how to interpret the badge number, what it really means about your browser's connection behavior, and why popular adblock test websites give misleading results. Using uBO Scope’s detailed measurements, you will gain clarity on these myths and learn real-world practical advice.

---

## Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and working in your browser. 
- Basic familiarity with browsing websites and viewing the browser extension icon (toolbar badge).
- Access to a webpage you want to analyze (preferably one you know uses ads or third-party trackers).

## What You Will Achieve
By following this guide, you will:
- Understand what the uBO Scope toolbar badge count represents.
- Learn why larger block counts do not necessarily mean better blocking.
- Recognize why third-party adblock test sites are unreliable.
- Use uBO Scope to gain accurate insights into your browser’s network connections.

## Time Estimate
5–10 minutes

## Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## Understanding the Badge Count Myth

### What Does the Badge Number Mean?
The badge shown on the uBO Scope toolbar icon reflects the **number of distinct third-party remote domains your browser connected to and were allowed** on the current webpage.

- **Lower numbers indicate fewer third-party servers contacted, which generally implies better blocking or fewer third-party resources loaded.**
- The count is not about the total number of blocked requests but about allowed distinct domains.

### Why Block Counts Can Be Misleading
Many users assume that a content blocker showing a higher number of blocked requests (block count) is better. This is a misconception:

- A high block count does not guarantee fewer third-party domains are being connected.
- It is possible that a blocker with a high block count still allows connections to *more* third-party domains overall.
- uBO Scope reveals this by showing actual allowed third-party domains, providing the ultimate measure of content blocker effectiveness.

<Tip>
Use the badge count as your trustworthy measure of how many third-party connections your browser ultimately allowed — not the block count other extensions might show.

## Why Third-Party Adblock Test Pages Are Unreliable

### How Adblock Test Pages Work
These test websites attempt to showcase whether your ad blocker is working by loading artificial ad scripts or elements hoping to be blocked visibly or recorded.

### Why They Fail to Reflect Reality
- Many content blockers (including uBO Scope’s companion blockers) use stealth techniques to block or hide requests without triggering obvious blocking.
- Test pages generate network requests to *fake or unusual servers* not normally contacted during real browsing.
- They cannot simulate the complexities of real-world browsing environments, leading to false positives or false negatives.

### How uBO Scope Helps
uBO Scope **measures actual network connections your browser tries**, regardless of stealth methods or DNS-level blocking, providing real data rather than contrived test results.

<Warning>
Avoid relying on 'adblock test' pages as proof of your content blocker's effectiveness. Instead, use uBO Scope to inspect genuine network requests per site.
</Warning>

## How to Use uBO Scope to Debunk These Myths

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope Popup on a Webpage
1. With a webpage loaded, click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup will display:
   - The badge count representing distinct allowed third-party domains.
   - Lists categorized as `not blocked`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked`.

### Step 2: Interpret the Categories
- **Not blocked:** Domains your browser connected to and were allowed.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or blocked stealthily, generally invisible to the webpage.
- **Blocked:** Domains that were explicitly blocked (error events).

### Step 3: Analyze the Badge Count
- A lower badge number indicates fewer third-party domains connected.
- Compare this across websites to see which sites load more or fewer third parties.

### Step 4: Validate Against Adblock Test Pages
- Open popular adblock test webpages while uBO Scope is active.
- Observe the popup data and badge count. Notice discrepancies with the test's visual or reported results.
- Understand that test pages often use domains not present in real browsing, leading to misleading conclusions.

### Step 5: Form Realistic Expectations
Use uBO Scope data to set expectations on blocking effectiveness:
- Focus on controlling third-party domain connections, not just blocking requests.
- Recognize that stealth techniques are common and legitimate blockers avoid detection to reduce site breakage.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the extension icon to see third-party domain data for the current page.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Badge Count">
Note the number of allowed distinct third-party domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Categorized Domain Lists">
Check which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked explicitly.
</Step>
<Step title="Visit Adblock Test Pages for Comparison">
Observe that badge count and actual connections don’t always match test claims.
</Step>
<Step title="Trust Real Data Over Test Pages">
Use uBO Scope to monitor real third-party connections to form a true picture.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Example: Debunking a Block Count Comparison

Imagine two content blockers show the following block counts:

- Blocker A: 150 blocked requests
- Blocker B: 80 blocked requests

Assuming Blocker A is better might lead you astray. Using uBO Scope, you check the allowed domains:

| Blocker | Badge Count (Allowed Domains) |
|---------|------------------------------|
| A       | 30                           |
| B       | 10                           |

In this case, despite Blocker A blocking more individual requests, it still allows connections to 3 times as many domains compared to Blocker B, meaning Blocker B provides stronger third-party blocking overall.

---

## Tips & Best Practices
- Always interpret the badge count as distinct allowed third-party domains, not blocked requests.
- Use uBO Scope regularly to see the real network behavior instead of relying on conventional block counts.
- Understand stealth blocking is a feature to balance both privacy and website functionality.
- Ignore adblock test pages; they are not a valid benchmark.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Badge Count Does Not Appear
- Ensure uBO Scope has permission to monitor web requests.
- Check that your browser supports the required APIs (Chrome, Firefox, Safari recent versions).

### No Data Shown in Popup
- Refresh the webpage after opening uBO Scope popup to allow data to populate.
- Confirm that you have allowed permissions and uBO Scope is enabled.

### Unexpected High Badge Count
- Verify if you are browsing a site known to load many third-party resources.
- Use the categorized domain lists to identify which domains contribute most.
