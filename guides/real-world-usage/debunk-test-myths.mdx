# Debunking Ad Blocker Test Myths

uBO Scope empowers you to evaluate content blockers based on real privacy outcomes rather than superficial block counts or unreliable "ad blocker test" webpages. This guide clarifies why conventional metrics and test sites often mislead users and how to validate content blocker effectiveness using meaningful, observable network connection data.

---

## Why Relying on Block Counts Is Misleading

Many users assume that a higher block count shown by a content blocker directly translates into better protection. However, this is a misconception rooted in how block counts are reported and what they represent:

- **Block count measures number of blocked requests, not actual third-party connections.** A blocker may count many blocked requests but still allow connections to more third-party servers.
- **uBO Scope focuses on distinct third-party remote servers contacted, providing a clearer privacy metric.** A lower badge count (fewer distinct third-party domains requested) generally means better privacy.
- **High block counts can correlate with worse privacy if more third-party servers are contacted.**

<u>Practical implication:</u> Use uBO Scope’s distinct third-party domain count to assess privacy, not just block numbers reported by other blockers.

## Why "Ad Blocker Test" Webpages Should Be Avoided

Many popular "ad blocker test" webpages claim to evaluate how well blockers perform. These pages are often inaccurate and do not reflect real-world browsing:

- **They use unrealistic or fabricated network requests** that normal websites never perform.
- **Extension-based blockers use stealth techniques** that these webpages cannot detect.
- **These tests focus on superficial banners or scripts, ignoring genuine third-party connections.**

<u>Result:</u> Such test webpages falsely inflate or deflate perceived blocker performance, misleading users about true privacy protection.

## How uBO Scope Approach Offers Real-World Insights

uBO Scope measures actual network requests the browser makes, categorizing outcomes and grouping connections by domain:

- **Tracks all network requests visible to the browser’s webRequest API.**
- **Categorizes connections as _allowed_, _stealth-blocked_, or _blocked_.**
- **Aggregates by distinct third-party domains, highlighting privacy impact.**

This gives you an accurate picture of which third parties your browser contacts while browsing, regardless of which content blocker settings or DNS blocking are in effect.

## Workflow: Validating Content Blocker Effectiveness with uBO Scope

Follow this simple process to validate your content blocker’s true privacy protection:

<Steps>
<Step title="Install and Enable uBO Scope">
Ensure uBO Scope is installed on your browser and all required permissions are granted. See the [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/guides/getting-started/install-extension.mdx) guide.
</Step>
<Step title="Browse to a Target Website">
Open any webpage you want to analyze privacy for, preferably one with varied third-party content (e.g., news sites or popular social media).
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup Interface">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to view connection summary for the current tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Badge Count and Domain Lists">
The badge shows the count of distinct third-party domains contacted. In the popup, inspect the lists:
- <strong>Allowed:</strong> Domains successfully connected.
- <strong>Stealth-blocked:</strong> Connections rerouted or hidden.
- <strong>Blocked:</strong> Connections explicitly blocked.

A lower allowed domain count indicates better privacy.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare Across Content Blockers">
Optionally, switch between blockers or change their configurations and repeat the steps above. Compare uBO Scope's domain counts, not block counts on other toolbars.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Real-World Example

Suppose you have two blockers:

- Blocker A shows a block count of 50
- Blocker B shows a block count of 30

Using uBO Scope:
- Blocker A results in 15 distinct third-party domains seen in the allowed list
- Blocker B results in 10 distinct third-party domains

<u>Interpretation:</u> Despite Blocker A reporting more blocked requests, it allowed connections to **more** third-party domains, indicating lower privacy. Blocker B yields better real-world protection.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Mistaking block count for privacy:** Always verify distinct third-party connections using uBO Scope's badge and popup.
- **Trusting synthetic ad blocker tests:** Avoid relying on test webpages designed to detect blockers; use real browsing data instead.
- **Ignoring stealth-blocked domains:** These represent connections redirected or hidden; analyze their presence for comprehensive insights.

---

## Best Practices

- Regularly monitor your browsing sessions with uBO Scope to understand third-party connections.
- Use the data to fine-tune your blockers or filter lists for optimal privacy.
- Combine insights from the popup interface and badge counts to get a holistic privacy picture.

<Note>
Remember: Real privacy assessment comes from measuring what third-party servers your browser actually connects to—not from fabricated block counts or test pages.
