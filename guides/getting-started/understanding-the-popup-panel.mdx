# Using the Popup Panel: Reading Connection Summaries

## Overview
The popup panel in uBO Scope is your immediate window into the network activity of the current browser tab. It summarizes connection attempts and outcomes by categorizing third-party domains into **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth-blocked** sections, providing a clear and concise view of what remote servers your browser connected to or attempted to connect.

This guide will walk you through how to open the popup panel, understand its layout, interpret the data it displays, and use these insights to quickly assess the privacy and connection health of any webpage you visit.

## 1. Workflow Overview

### What You Will Achieve
- Open and navigate the popup panel
- Quickly interpret the connection summary for the active browser tab
- Understand the significance of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked lists
- Use the summary count to assess third-party connection exposure

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope must be installed and enabled in your browser
- The active browser tab must have network activity recorded by uBO Scope
- Required permissions (`activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`) granted during installation

### Time Estimate
5 minutes for familiarity and initial usage

### Difficulty Level
Beginner-friendly — no technical knowledge needed

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel">
To open uBO Scope’s popup panel:

1. Click the uBO Scope extension icon on your browser’s toolbar.
2. The popup panel will appear displaying connection data related to the active tab.

**Expected Result:** The popup window loads showing a header with the current tab’s hostname and three domain lists: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret the Hostname Header">
At the top of the popup, observe the hostname section:

- The full hostname of the active tab’s webpage is displayed.
- If the hostname includes a subdomain, it is shown alongside the domain for clarity.

**Why It Matters:** This tells you exactly which website’s connections you are inspecting.

**Verification:** The hostname matches the active browser tab’s URL.
</Step>

<Step title="Read the Domains Connected Summary">
Below the hostname, the summary line shows the count of distinct third-party domains contacted by the webpage:

- This total includes all domains that were allowed and connected to.
- A lower count generally indicates fewer third-party exposures.

**Success Criteria:** The count is a number reflecting the variety of domains connected.
</Step>

<Step title="Explore the Allowed Domains List">
The **not blocked** section lists domains from which the page successfully loaded resources:

- Domains are sorted alphabetically for quick scanning.
- Each domain shows a count indicating how many requests were allowed.

**Use Case:** Understand which third parties the page actively uses.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Stealth-Blocked Domains List">
The **stealth-blocked** section shows domains where connections were redirected or silently blocked:

- These requests tried to load but were stopped without explicit error.
- Useful for advanced users auditing subtle network behaviors.

**Tip:** Domains here might indicate stealthy blocking mechanisms or redirects.
</Step>

<Step title="Examine the Blocked Domains List">
The **blocked** section lists domains where requested connections failed or were explicitly blocked:

- These failures can signal active blocking by content blockers or network issues.
- The count shows how many requests were blocked per domain.

**Why It Helps:** Knowing which domains are blocked helps you verify blocker effectiveness.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
All domain names are displayed in their Unicode format for easy recognition, even if originally punycode-encoded.
</Note>

<Warning>
If the popup shows **NO DATA** or empty lists, verify that the active tab has network activity, and permissions have been granted to the extension.
</Warning>

## 3. Practical Examples

### Example: Interpreting a Popup Panel

- Hostname Header: `news.example.com`
- Summary Line: `domains connected: 18`
- **Not Blocked:** domains like `cdn.example.net (12)`, `images.example.org (3)`
- **Stealth-Blocked:** domains like `trackers.adservice.com (1)`
- **Blocked:** domains like `analytics.badtracker.com (2)`

### What This Tells You
- The page fetched resources from 18 distinct domains.
- Some third parties were silently blocked or redirected.
- A few domains were explicitly blocked, indicating active content blocking.

**Use this insight** to decide if the page exposes you to too many third parties or if your content blocker is functioning well.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Popup Shows No Data or Empty Lists:**
  - Ensure you have navigated to a webpage with network activity.
  - Confirm that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions.
  - Try refreshing the page and reopening the popup.

- **Counts Seem Unusual (Too High or Too Low):**
  - Remember the badge count and popup summary count reflect distinct domains only, not individual requests.
  - Domains may include service workers or background connections.

### Best Practices

- Use the popup summary regularly to audit the privacy of websites you visit.
- Combine insights from allowed, stealth, and blocked lists to get a full picture of connection activity.
- Refresh popup after page reloads to update the connection snapshots.

### Performance Considerations

uBO Scope is lightweight and fetches data asynchronously; slight delays in popup data loading can occur but resolve quickly.
