# Understanding the Popup Panel

Harness the full power of uBO Scope by mastering its popup panel — the window into the network activity of your current browser tab. This guide walks you through using the popup panel effectively, helping you quickly assess which third-party servers your active tab is connecting to, and how those connections are categorized.

---

## 1. What the Popup Panel Shows

The popup panel provides a real-time breakdown of third-party connection attempts and outcomes for the active browser tab. It summarizes domain connections into three clear categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which connections were successfully established.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were silently blocked without alerting the webpage.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were explicitly blocked.

This categorization helps you understand which external servers your browser talks to while visiting a website, and how content blockers or network filters interact with those attempts.

## 2. Accessing the Popup Panel

To open the popup panel:

1. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser's toolbar.
2. The panel will appear, displaying the hostname for the current tab and connection statistics.

If the panel displays "NO DATA," it means no connection data for the current tab is available yet. Try refreshing the page or verifying installation if this persists.

## 3. Reading the Popup Header

At the top, you’ll see the tab's hostname and domain displayed distinctly:

- The **left span** shows the hostname prefix (if different from the domain).
- The **right span** shows the main domain.

For example, if the full hostname is `sub.example.com`, the panel shows `sub.` on the left and `example.com` on the right. If the hostname and domain are the same, only the domain portion shows.

## 4. Interpreting the Summary Section

Below the header, the **Summary** section displays:

- The total number of unique **domains connected** for the current tab.
- This count equals the number of distinct third-party domains for which at least one successful connection occurred.

A lower number here generally indicates fewer third-party connections, which is often beneficial for privacy.

## 5. Exploring Connection Outcome Sections

The panel divides connection outcomes into three clearly marked sections with color-coded headers:

### a) Not Blocked (Allowed)

- Lists all domains where connection requests succeeded.
- Each domain row displays the domain name and the count of connection attempts.
- The background and badge use subtle green shading to convey success.

### b) Stealth-Blocked

- Displays domains that were stealthily blocked — network requests prevented without webpage notification.
- This stealth blocking prevents detection by sites relying on client-side scripts.
- These domains are highlighted with soft red tones.

### c) Blocked

- Shows domains with openly blocked requests.
- These blocked attempts are generally visible to the webpage's client-side scripts.
- This section also uses distinct red shading.

### Note:

Sections are hidden when empty, so if you see fewer than three, some categories had no connection attempts.

## 6. Domain Rows Explained

Each section contains one or more rows, representing domains:

- **Domain:** The registered domain name (e.g., `cdn.example.net`). Displayed right-aligned with word break to handle long names.
- **Count Badge:** Displays the number of requests made to that domain.

This immediate glance helps you identify dominant third-party servers interacting with your current webpage.

## 7. How the Badge Count Relates to the Popup

The uBO Scope toolbar icon badge displays the count of distinct third-party domains with at least one allowed connection in the active tab.

- This number matches the count shown in the summary section.
- If the badge is blank, no allowed connections were detected.

Understanding this badge alongside the popup's detailed breakdown allows you to assess your connection exposure at a glance and then deep dive into details.

## 8. Practical Tips for Using the Popup Panel

- **Refresh for fresh data:** Switching tabs or reloading pages updates the panel with new data.
- **Pay attention to stealth-blocked domains:** These may indicate silently intercepted connections, crucial for privacy auditing.
- **Use domain counts to spot heavy third parties:** High counts may reveal frequently contacted CDNs or trackers.
- **If data is missing:** Ensure the extension has all required permissions and the page has initiated network requests.

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Popup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Panel Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Sections">
- Verify that you opened the popup on a fully loaded page with network requests.
- Reload the current tab to trigger data collection.
- Confirm the extension has access permissions (see installation and troubleshooting guides).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count and Popup Do Not Match">
- The badge counts allowed distinct domains, while the popup distinguishes allowed, stealth, and blocked.
- Badge count excludes stealth and blocked connections.
- If discrepancies persist, consider reloading the tab or reinstalling the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Connections Seem Missing or Incomplete">
- Content loaded or cached before activation may not appear.
- Some WebSocket or non-HTTP(s) protocols might be underreported depending on browser support.
- Check browser compatibility notes for your platform.

## 10. Summary

The uBO Scope popup panel is your immediate window into the network connections made by the active tab. By understanding the categorization of domains and connection outcomes — allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked — you gain transparency into third-party resource loading and filtering effectiveness.

Use this panel to quickly evaluate third-party exposure, troubleshoot network behaviors, or audit content blocker performance in real time.

## Appendix: Example Popup Panel View

```text
---------- Popup Header ----------
[ sub.        ] [example.com]   

------ Summary ------
domains connected: 12

----- Not Blocked (Allowed) -----
cdn.example.net          15
assets.examplecdn.com     5

----- Stealth-Blocked -----
ads.tracker.com          2

----- Blocked -----
thirdparty.badsite.org   3

```

This view indicates 12 unique third-party domains contacted, with 15 requests to `cdn.example.net` successfully loaded, 2 stealth blocks on `ads.tracker.com` and 3 outright blocks for `thirdparty.badsite.org`.
