# Using the Popup: Navigating the Dashboard

## Overview

The uBO Scope popup UI is your central window into the network activity of the active browser tab. It visually classifies all third-party connections made by the current webpage into three categories: **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**. This guide will help you interpret each section of the popup dashboard, understand what the data represents, and how to leverage this information to assess your browsing privacy and content blocking effectiveness.

---

## What This Guide Helps You Achieve

- **Understand the popup UI structure** and the meaning of each section and metric.
- **Learn how uBO Scope categorizes network connections** and what allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked mean.
- **Interpret domain-level data** to pinpoint third-party interactions on any site.
- **Use insights from the popup** to make informed privacy or troubleshooting decisions.

---

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope extension installed and active in your browser.
- An active browser tab with some network activity (i.e., visiting a webpage that loads third-party resources).
- Basic familiarity with browser tabs and extension toolbar icons.

---

## Popup UI Structure and Key Components

The popup interface is composed of the following parts:

### 1. Tab Hostname Header

- Displays the current page's hostname and domain at the top.
- Helps you confirm which site’s network activity you are examining.

### 2. Summary Section

- Shows the total number of distinct third-party domains connected during the tab's lifetime.
- The number corresponds to the count of allowed third-party domains (distinct remote servers from which resources were loaded).

### 3. Outcome Sections (Three Categories)

Each outcome section groups domains based on connection results:

- **Allowed**: Domains from which network connections succeeded and were not blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were redirected or blocked stealthily by the browser or content blockers, typically without obvious errors.
- **Blocked**: Domains where connection attempts explicitly failed or were denied by the content blocker or browser.

Within each category:
- The domains are listed in rows.
- Each row shows the domain name and a count of how many network requests succeeded or were blocked for that domain.

#### Visual Cues

- Green shading for **Allowed** sections.
- Red shading for **Stealth-Blocked** and **Blocked** domains.

## How uBO Scope Categorizes Connections

uBO Scope classifies network requests based on the browser's network events:

| Category       | Meaning                                                                                         |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Allowed        | Requests that successfully connected to the domain (no blocking or redirection).               |
| Stealth-Blocked| Requests that did not complete normally but were silently redirected or blocked without error. |
| Blocked        | Requests explicitly blocked or failed with an error event reported by the browser extension.  |

Each category reports on distinct third-party domains associated with those requests, aggregating counts.

## Step-by-Step: Interpreting the Popup

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup">
Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar to reveal the popup dashboard. Ensure you are focused on a tab with active webpage content.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify the Current Site">
At the top header, confirm the hostname of the current tab. This tells you which site’s network activity is being displayed.
</Step>

<Step title="Check the Summary">
Note the total count displayed under “domains connected.” This number represents distinct allowed third-party domains reached in the tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
Look in the "not blocked" (allowed) section:
- These are domains contacted successfully.
- Each domain has a count indicating how many requests succeeded.
- Green shading indicates trusted, unblocked communication.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Explore the "stealth-blocked" section:
- These domains had connections redirected or hidden from the page.
- May indicate blocking by stealth techniques or DNS filtering.
- Red shading warns of potential hidden blocking.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Blocked Domains">
Check the "blocked" section:
- These domains had explicit connection failures.
- Counts indicate the number of blocked requests.
- Red shading highlights explicit block events.
</Step>

<Step title="Analyze Counts and Domains">
Use the domain lists and their associated request counts to understand which specific third parties are active, stealth-blocked, or blocked on the page.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Verify the hostname matches your target site** before making privacy assessments.
- **Use the allowed domains list** to spot legitimate third-party services such as CDNs or analytics.
- **Examine stealth-blocked domains carefully** to identify invisible blocking affecting your browsing.
- **Blocked domains are often easy to spot** as known trackers or ad servers.
- **Refresh the page and reopen the popup** to see updated data as you interact with different sites.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- If the popup shows "NO DATA" or is empty, ensure the extension is properly installed and active.
- The domain counts reflect third-party connections; first-party domains (your site) are tracked separately and do not appear in these sections.
- Some network requests may not be reported due to browser API limitations or permissions.

## Troubleshooting Popup UI Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Rendering and Data Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty content">
- Ensure you are viewing an active tab with loaded network activity.
- Reload the tab to generate fresh data.
- Confirm uBO Scope has the required permissions and is enabled.
- Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/validation-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-common-issues) documentation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain counts seem inconsistent with expected connections">
- Remember the count reflects distinct third-party domains connected, not total requests.
- Content blockers or DNS filters may stealth-block some connections, reflected in the stealth section.
- Consult [Mythbusting on Block Counts](/guides/best-practices-expert-tips/mythbusting-block-counts) for detailed explanations.
</Accordion>

## Summary

The uBO Scope popup provides a real-time, domain-level breakdown of the network connections your current browser tab initiates, classified clearly by whether connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked. Understanding this dashboard empowers you to monitor your exposure to third-party servers, troubleshoot content blocker effectiveness, and gain transparency on your browsing privacy, all in a simple, easily navigable interface.
