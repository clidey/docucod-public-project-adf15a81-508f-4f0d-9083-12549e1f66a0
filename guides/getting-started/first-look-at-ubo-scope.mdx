# Your First Look at uBO Scope

Discover how to open the uBO Scope popup, interpret domain connection lists, and understand the three distinct network connection statuses: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked. This guide helps you start reading the toolbar badge, domain summaries, and the purpose behind connection groups so you can monitor third-party network activity immediately.

---

## 1. What This Guide Helps You Achieve

When you open the uBO Scope popup, it presents a clear summary of the third-party remote servers your browser interacts with on the current tab. This guide walks you through:

- Accessing the extension popup to view live network data per tab.
- Reading and interpreting the three connection status sections.
- Understanding the badge count and how it relates to domain activity.
- Getting started with the key concepts behind each grouping.

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser.
- At least one active browser tab loaded with a webpage.
- The browser extension has been granted necessary permissions to monitor network requests.

### Expected Outcome

After following this guide, you will:

- Open the uBO Scope popup and see detailed domain connection summaries.
- Recognize what each status category means and how it affects your privacy monitoring.
- Understand how the badge count reflects allowed third-party connections.

### Time Required

Approximately 5 minutes to open the popup and familiarize yourself with its core interface and terminology.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner — no previous knowledge of network monitoring needed.

## 2. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

The popup is your primary view into uBO Scope’s insights.

### Steps

1. Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It shows a numeric badge indicating active third-party connections on the current tab.
2. Click the icon to open the popup panel.
3. Wait a second for the panel to load data related to the active tab.

### What You Should See

- The hostname of the current tab displayed clearly at the top.
- A summary section showing the count of connected domains.
- Three distinct sections below the summary titled:
  - **Not Blocked** (Allowed connections)
  - **Stealth-Blocked**
  - **Blocked**

<Tip>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or remains empty, try refreshing the active tab and reopening the popup. Also, ensure you have granted all necessary permissions to the extension.
</Tip>

## 3. Interpreting the Domain Connection Sections

The core value of uBO Scope is its clear categorization of the domains your browser contacts.

### Allowed (Not Blocked)

- Lists third-party domains that your browser successfully connected to when loading the page.
- The badge count on the toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct third-party domains here.
- This count signifies the legitimate number of unique remote servers resources are fetched from.

### Stealth-Blocked

- Domains where network requests were redirected or altered stealthily by content blockers.
- These connections are intercepted to hide their presence from the webpage, preserving privacy without breaking site functionality.
- Domains here are not counted as allowed, but they generally indicate requests affected by advanced blocking techniques.

### Blocked

- Domains explicitly blocked by content blockers or network errors.
- Resources from these domains do not load, which may prevent tracking or prevent unwanted content.
- This section helps you identify where blocking is effective.

### How the Sections Work Together

uBO Scope shows these categories side by side to give you a full picture of every distinct third-party domain contact:

- The **allowed** list tells you actual connections your browser made.
- The **stealth-blocked** list reveals subtly handled connections.
- The **blocked** list shows failed or denied connections.

Understanding these helps you evaluate the real impact of content blockers beyond just counting blocked requests.

## 4. Reading Domain Counts and Badge

Each domain listed has a count next to it, representing how many times that domain was contacted during the page load.

- Counts help prioritize which third-party domains are most active.
- The toolbar badge count equals the number of unique domains in the **allowed** section.
- A lower badge count generally means fewer third-party servers your browser connects to, which is preferable for privacy.

### Practical Example

Imagine visiting a news website:

- The **allowed** section might list `cdn.example.com` with count 5, meaning five resources loaded from this CDN.
- The **stealth-blocked** section might show a tracking domain silently redirected or blocked.
- The **blocked** section might enumerate ad servers or known trackers your content blocker prevented.

This view lets you see the actual third-party network footprint for that tab.

## 5. Tips for Effective Use

- **Refresh the webpage and reopen the popup** to get updated network state as you browse.
- If the badge count suddenly spikes, check the popup to identify new third-party domains loaded.
- Use uBO Scope side-by-side with content blockers to confirm blocking effectiveness by watching connection statuses change.
- Remember that not all domains listed as allowed are problematic; many are from legitimate content delivery networks.

<Tip>
Hover over domain rows for better visibility or copy domain names to research suspicious connections.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<Troubleshooting>

- **Popup shows NO DATA or empty lists:**
  - Ensure the tab is fully loaded.
  - Verify extension permissions in your browser settings.
  - Refresh the tab and try reopening the popup.

- **Badge count doesn't update or seems stuck:**
  - Close and reopen the tab.
  - Try disabling and re-enabling uBO Scope.

- **Domains expected to be blocked appear as allowed:**
  - Confirm your content blocker is active.
  - Evaluate stealth-blocked domains section for redirected connections.

If problems persist, consult the [Quick Validation Steps](getting-started/quick-validation/quick-validation-check) and [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](getting-started/quick-validation/troubleshooting-setup) guides.

## Appendix: Popup Layout Breakdown

| Section            | Description                                       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Tab Hostname       | Shows the current tab's hostname and domain.    |
| Summary            | Displays total connected domains count (allowed).|
| Allowed            | Lists connected third-party domains that loaded resources successfully, with counts.
| Stealth-Blocked    | Lists domains with network requests stealthily blocked or redirected.
| Blocked            | Lists domains where requests were explicitly blocked or failed.

Each domain row shows:

- **Domain name:** Unicode-compatible rendering.
- **Count badge:** Number of connections observed.
