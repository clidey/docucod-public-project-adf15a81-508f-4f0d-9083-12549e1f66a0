# Investigating Connections on Your First Webpage

## Introduction

This guide walks you through opening the uBO Scope popup panel to investigate the network connections your browser makes when loading any webpage. You will learn how to interpret the summary of third-party domains, understand the distinctions between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections, and use badge feedback to quickly identify unwanted or unexpected network activity.

Understanding these details empowers you to gain immediate insight into the privacy and security implications of the websites you visit.

---

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope must be installed and enabled in your browser. For installation instructions, refer to [Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope](./installation-setup).
- Your browser must be supported and meet minimum version requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+). See [Prerequisites & System Requirements](../../getting-started/installation-setup/prerequisites-requirements).
- You should have navigated to the webpage you wish to analyze in an active browser tab.

---

## What You Will Achieve

- Access the uBO Scope popup panel for the current tab.
- Decode the badge count on the toolbar icon showing distinct connected third-party domains.
- Understand the categorization: **Allowed**, **Blocked**, and **Stealth-Blocked** domains.
- Explore domain lists with request counts to identify network behaviors clearly.

## Time Estimate

About 5 minutes to open the popup and familiarize yourself with the connections reported.

## Difficulty Level

Beginner (no technical knowledge required).

# Step-by-Step: Exploring Connections on Your First Webpage

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon">
uBO Scope's icon appears on your browser's toolbar typically near the address bar. It shows a badge with a number or remains empty if no connections are detected. uBO Scope uses this badge to signal how many unique third-party domains your browser connected to during page load.
</Step>

<Step title="Click the Toolbar Icon to Open the Popup">
Clicking the icon opens the popup panel displaying detailed information about the network connections made by the current tab.

Expected Result: You see the popup window with sections for 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' domains, plus the main domain of the tab at the top.
</Step>

<Step title="Read the Tab Hostname Display">
At the top, the popup shows two parts of the tab's host:

- The subdomain or prefix (e.g., ‘www’ or custom parts)
- The main registered domain

This tells you which website's connections you’re investigating.

Verification: The hostname and domain are displayed in readable format using Unicode decoding for internationalized domains.
</Step>

<Step title="Understand the Summary Count">
Below the hostname, look at the summary "domains connected" count.

This number indicates how many distinct third-party domains your browser successfully connected to on this page. The lower this count, the fewer third-party connections were made.

Important: This count reflects *allowed* domains only, not blocked ones.
</Step>

<Step title="Explore the Allowed (Not Blocked) Domains List">
The "not blocked" section lists third-party domains your browser connected to successfully.

Each domain shows a badge count of how many requests or connections were made to it.

Use this to spot legitimate third parties like CDNs or suspicious ones.

Tip: Domains are sorted alphabetically for easy lookup.
</Step>

<Step title="Investigate the Stealth-Blocked Domains">
The "stealth-blocked" section lists domains identified as being redirect-blocked or handled stealthily by content blockers.

These connections may have been attempted but are silently blocked to avoid detection by the webpage.

Understanding stealth-blocked domains helps reveal hidden tracking attempts that might not be obvious otherwise.
</Step>

<Step title="Check the Blocked Domains Section">
This list shows domains where network requests were clearly blocked by a content blocker or resulted in errors.

Blocked domains also display counts representing the number of blocked request attempts.

This helps you identify where blockers prevented connection attempts explicitly.

Warning: A large blocked list can indicate aggressive blocking or extensive tracking attempts.
</Step>

<Step title="Use the Badge Count to Gauge Privacy Impact">
Return to the toolbar icon and note the badge number.

This number matches the count of distinct allowed third-party domains from the popup summary.

Lower badge counts generally indicate better privacy stance by reducing external exposure.

If suspicious connections appear in the popup, consider adjusting your content blocking or privacy settings.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Example

Imagine visiting a news site and opening uBO Scope popup:

- You see "domains connected: 5" in the summary
- The allowed list shows domains like 'cdn.newsprovider.com' and 'images.cdn.net'
- The stealth-blocked list shows 'tracking.ads.com'
- The blocked list contains 'unwanted.tracker.com'

From this, you conclude that the site loads a few essential third parties but also attempts connections to tracking services that your content blocker silently blocks (stealth-blocked) or fully blocks.

This insight helps you decide if additional blocking rules or further investigation are necessary.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Interpreting Counts**: Focus on the number of distinct allowed domains as a measure of your exposure. Seeing many allowed third parties could mean your blocker allows too many external connections.
- **Use Stealth-Blocked Info**: Don't ignore stealth-blocked domains; they reveal hidden, often privacy-invasive connections.
- **Refresh Page If Needed**: If the popup shows no data, refresh the page and reopen the popup to capture the latest network activity.
- **Check Multiple Tabs**: Use the popup on different tabs to compare how various sites differ in their third-party connections.
- **Combine With Other Tools**: Use alongside content blockers for nuanced control and awareness.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Network Connection Investigations">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Blank">
- Ensure you clicked the icon from the active tab where you want to investigate.
- Refresh the webpage to trigger network activity reporting.
- Confirm that uBO Scope is enabled in your browser's extensions.
- Check if your browser supports the `webRequest` API properly (see browser compatibility documentation).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Stays Empty or Unchanged">
- Make sure you have visited a website that makes network requests; static or local pages may show zero.
- Confirm that permissions for URL access are granted to uBO Scope.
- Disable conflicting extensions that might interfere with network monitoring.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains List Looks Incomplete or Missing Entries">
- Network requests can be delayed or cached; try reloading the page.
- Some browser privacy settings or user-agent modifications may limit reporting.
- The extension depends on browser network reports; some embedded requests might not be visible.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
