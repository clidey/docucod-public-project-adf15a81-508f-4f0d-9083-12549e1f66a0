# Exploring the Popup: Interpreting Connection Details

## Overview

This guide walks you through the uBO Scope popup interface that delivers real-time insights into network requests for your current browser tab. You will learn how to interpret the domains listed under allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections, understand the significance of connection counts, and how this information reflects on your browsing privacy.

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope extension installed and correctly configured ([see Installation Instructions](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/guides/getting-started/install-extension.mdx))
- Permissions granted to uBO Scope
- Active tab with network activity (typically a loaded website)

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this guide, you will:
- Understand how to read the popup interface
- Know what the domains and counts represent
- Gain actionable privacy insights based on connection outcomes

## Time Estimate

10-15 minutes

## Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate

## Understanding the Popup Interface

Upon clicking the uBO Scope extension icon, the popup displays detailed connection data for your current active browser tab. It breaks down network requests into three categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains where connections were permitted
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were blocked silently by the browser or content blockers without a visible block
- **Blocked**: Domains where connections were explicitly blocked by content blockers

### Components of the Popup

### 1. Tab Hostname Display

The header shows the current tab's hostname separated visually:
- The left span shows the subdomain portion
- The right span shows the base domain (registrable domain)

For example, if visiting `news.example.com`, the popup splits this into `news.` (subdomain) and `example.com` (base domain).


### 2. Domains Connected Summary

Below the hostname, the summary section displays the total count of distinct domains observed in the popup. This count reflects all unique third-party domains contacted by the page.

### 3. Connection Outcome Sections

#### Allowed (Not Blocked)
- Lists domains with successful connections
- Shows counts representing the number of network requests sent to each domain

#### Stealth-Blocked
- Contains domains where connections were invisibly blocked, meaning the requests did not reach the destination but were suppressed transparently.

#### Blocked
- Domains where requests were actively blocked, typically by your content blocker settings


### Visual Indicators

- Each domain entry includes the domain name and a count badge indicating request volumes.
- Sections without any domains are hidden to reduce clutter.
- Color coding helps differentiate: green highlights allowed connections, red highlights blocked or stealth-blocked.


### Example

Imagine you visit an online news site. The popup might show:
- Allowed: `cdn.images.com (15 requests)`, `api.news.com (4 requests)`
- Blocked: `tracker.adnetwork.net (8 requests)`
- Stealth-Blocked: `analytics.hiddentracker.com (3 requests)`

This tells you the exact external domains your page is contacting, and which connections were prevented by your blocking tools.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar to open the popup window showing connection details for the active tab.

**Outcome:** The popup displays the current tab's hostname and a loading animation briefly before populating data.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret the Hostname Header">
Look at the top header—
- The right portion displays the base domain.
- The left portion shows any subdomains.

**Outcome:** Clear identification of which website's network data you are viewing.
</Step>

<Step title="Read the Domains Connected Summary">
Observe the summary count indicating how many unique domains were contacted by the page.

**Outcome:** A quick measure of the overall domain footprint of the website.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Allowed Connections">
Expand the "not blocked" section.
Look through the list for domains the page connected to successfully.
Note the volume of connections to each domain.

**Outcome:** Insight into which third-party services your site is actively fetching resources from.

**Tip:** Legitimate domains like CDNs or essential APIs commonly appear here.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Look at the "stealth-blocked" section.
Understand that these are domains where requests were silently blocked to avoid webpage breakage or detection.

**Outcome:** Awareness of stealthy privacy protection in effect.

<Note>The difference between "blocked" and "stealth-blocked" is subtle but important: stealth blocking is designed to be invisible to the site to maximize privacy without triggering site errors.</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Examine Explicitly Blocked Domains">
Review domains listed under the "blocked" section.
These are the targets where content blockers actively prevented connections.

**Outcome:** Identify which third-party connections have been disabled, improving your privacy.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Use the domain counts to identify heavy third-party usage**: A high volume to a single domain may indicate persistent tracking or resource loading.
- **Watch for stealth-blocked domains**: These often reveal trackers or intrusive requests your content blocker manages silently.
- **Compare Allowed vs Blocked to assess privacy**: A lower number of allowed third-party domains generally indicates better privacy.
- **Reload pages to see real-time data**: The popup updates on each active tab navigation, allowing monitoring across sites.


## Common Pitfalls

- **No data displayed or stale data:** This may occur if the tab is inactive or no network activity occurred since extension activation.

- **Confusing subdomain and base domain separation:** Remember that the right name is the registrable domain (effective top-level domain plus one label), while the left is subdomain information.

- **Assuming blocked means better blocking:** A high blocked count with many allowed domains may suggest the blocker is less effective at reducing third-party connections.


## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty sections">
- Ensure you have an active tab with page content loaded.
- Confirm the extension has necessary permissions (activeTab, webRequest).
- Reload the page to trigger network data collection.
- Check related setup guides if issues persist.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Counts seem inconsistent with expectations">
- The popup reflects unique domains contacted, not raw request counts.
- Use the toolbar badge (see "Your First Analysis: Reading the Toolbar Badge") for a quick domain count.
- Stealth-blocked and blocked categories may sometimes overlap in function but differ in reporting style.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup UI layout issues or missing styles">
- Make sure your browser extensions aren’t interfering with styling.
- Refresh the popup or restart the browser.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Understanding

Behind the scenes, uBO Scope collects connection data for the active tab and categorizes domains according to whether requests were allowed, explicitly blocked, or stealthily blocked. The popup renders this data by:

- Converting domain names to Unicode representation for readability
- Sorting domains alphabetically
- Displaying request counts per domain

This live view is an invaluable resource for users keen on transparency and real privacy insights from their browsing sessions.
