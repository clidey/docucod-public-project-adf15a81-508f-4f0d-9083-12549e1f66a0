# Your First Look: How to Use the uBO Scope Popup

Welcome to your first interaction with uBO Scope's popup interface! This guide walks you through how to open the popup, understand the badge count, and interpret the connection data displayed. You'll learn how uBO Scope categorizes network connections and summarizes the data for any active tab in your browser.

---

## 1. What This Guide Covers

- How to open the uBO Scope popup
- Understanding the badge count on the extension icon
- Reading the popup interface sections
- Interpreting domain connection categories

## 2. Before You Start

**Prerequisites:**

- uBO Scope installed and active in your supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
- A webpage loaded in an active tab.

**Why this matters:**

The popup only shows data relevant to the active tab. Make sure you have a webpage open where connections can be observed.

---

## 3. Opening the uBO Scope Popup

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon** in your browser's toolbar. The icon appears with the label 'uBO Scope' on hover.
2. **Click the icon** to open the popup window.

The popup automatically fetches and displays data about the network connections associated with the current tab.

<Info>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA', it means there’s no connection information available for the active tab yet. Try refreshing the tab page to generate network activity.
</Info>

---

## 4. Understanding the Badge Count

The badge—a small number overlay on the toolbar icon—indicates:

- **Number of distinct third-party remote server domains with allowed connections** for the active tab.

**Remember:**

- A *lower* badge count means fewer unique third-party connections, which can be better for privacy.
- It counts domains from which resources were actually fetched, *not* the number of requests blocked or attempted.

<Tip>
This badge helps you quickly gauge the extent of third-party remote server connections without opening the popup.
</Tip>

## 5. Exploring the Popup Interface

The popup is divided into several sections that summarize network connection outcomes:

### 5.1 Tab Hostname Header

At the top, you see the hostname of the active tab split into two parts:

- The **first part**: the subdomain(s), if any
- The **second part**: the base domain

This helps clarify the exact website you’re inspecting.

### 5.2 Summary Section

Just below the header, the summary shows:

- The total count of distinct domains connected.

### 5.3 Connection Outcome Categories

uBO Scope groups domains into three categories based on their connection outcome:

| Category       | Meaning                                   | Section Color Example |
| -------------- | -----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Not Blocked**  | Connections allowed without issue         | Green header         |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Connections attempted but silently redirected or modified | Light Blue header     |
| **Blocked**      | Connections that were blocked or failed   | Red header           |

Each category lists the remote domains and the number of connections (requests) observed.

### 5.4 Domain Entries

Each domain row displays:

- The domain name (converted to Unicode if it uses punycode for internationalized domain names).
- A count badge showing how many connection requests were made to that domain.

---

## 6. How to Interpret What You See

- **Domains under "Not Blocked"** represent third-party servers your browser successfully connected to while loading the active tab’s page.
- **Stealth-Blocked domains** are attempts the browser redirected or interfered with so stealthily that they aren’t outright blocked but changed.
- **Blocked domains** are connections that failed or were explicitly blocked by content blockers or network errors.

This categorization helps you understand the real network footprint of the page, beyond what basic content blockers show.

<Tip>
If many domains are under "Not Blocked", it indicates a page with numerous third-party connections, possibly affecting privacy and performance.
</Tip>

---

## 7. Practical Example

Imagine you open uBO Scope popup on a news website:

- The badge shows `5`.
- The summary indicates `domains connected: 5`.
- Domains like `cdn.examplecdn.com` and `fonts.googleapis.com` appear under "Not Blocked".
- A tracking domain shows under "Blocked".

**Outcome:** You can see exactly which third-party domains had successful connections, which were blocked, and which connections are stealthily interfered with.

---

## 8. Tips for First-Time Users

- **Refresh the page** after installing uBO Scope to build initial data.
- Use the popup alongside your content blocker to get a full connection picture.
- Pay attention to the badge; it’s your quick assessment metric.
- Look for unexpectedly high connection counts or suspicious domains for privacy investigation.

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Issues">
<Accordion title="No Badge or Empty Popup">
- Ensure the extension is enabled.
- Reload the active tab to trigger connection tracking.
- Check that the browser version supports the extension (minimum Chrome 122, Firefox 128, Safari 18.5).
- Verify that other extensions or browser settings do not block webRequest APIs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- Give the extension a moment after page load; the background script batches updates every second.
- Close and reopen the popup to refresh the data.
- Ensure you have network activity; a static page with no external connections shows zero.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
