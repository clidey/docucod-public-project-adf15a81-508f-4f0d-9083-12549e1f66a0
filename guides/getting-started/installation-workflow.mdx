## 4. Granting Required Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions to monitor network requests effectively:

- **Access to active tab:** Allows analysis of the current webpage.
- **Storage:** Saves session and public suffix data for consistent operation.
- **webRequest API:** Essential to intercept network requests and determine blocking status.

These permissions are requested automatically during installation or first run.

<Warning>
Do not disable these permissions; uBO Scope cannot function correctly without them.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Activating and Configuring uBO Scope Post-Installation

1. **Pin the Extension to Toolbar:**
   - Chrome: Click the puzzle-piece icon, then click the pin icon beside uBO Scope.
   - Firefox: Right-click the uBO Scope icon and select 'Pin to Toolbar' if needed.
   - Safari: Enable uBO Scope in Preferences > Extensions.
2. **Open the Popup Interface:** Click the uBO Scope icon to display the connection data panel.
3. **Verify Functionality:** You should see the domain of the active tab, along with allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains as they are identified.

<Check>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty sections, reload the active tab and try again. Ensure permissions were accepted.
</Check>

---

## 6. First Use: Exploring Third-Party Connections

Upon opening uBO Scope:

- The popup lists domains linked to the current tab under three categories:
  - **Not blocked:** Third-party domains with allowed connections.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where content blockers stealthily prevented requests.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests were explicitly blocked.

- The badge count on the toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.

This immediate feedback offers actionable insight into which external servers your current website interacts with.
