# Exploring the Popup UI

Unlocking clear insights into your browser's network activity starts here. This guide takes you on a step-by-step tour of the uBO Scope extension’s popup interface, empowering you to interpret the data it presents about allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains. You'll learn exactly what each section communicates about your current tab’s network connections and how to leverage this information for better understanding and control.

## 1. What This Guide Helps You Accomplish

This guide walks you through the uBO Scope popup interface:
- Understanding how domain connection counts are presented
- Differentiating between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains
- Learning what each section signals about network requests
- Knowing how to interact with the popup to gain actionable insights

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope extension installed and active in your browser
- A web page loaded in the active tab where network requests are being tracked

### Expected Outcome

After completing this guide, you will be able to:
- Navigate the popup UI confidently
- Understand the significance of each domain count category
- Use the popup to monitor and analyze network connections per active tab

### Time to Complete

Approximately 5 minutes

### Difficulty Level

Beginner-friendly; no prior technical knowledge required

## 2. Interface Overview and User Flow

When you click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar, the popup displays real-time summaries of the network activity for your current tab. Let's break down the popup’s main sections.

### 2.1 Tab Hostname Header

- **Location:** Top of the popup
- **Purpose:** Displays the domain information of the active tab
- **Structure:** Two parts
  - A prefix of the tab’s hostname (optional, shown if the hostname includes a subdomain)
  - The main domain name extracted using the public suffix list (e.g., example.com)

This helps you easily identify which website’s network activity you are viewing.

### 2.2 Domains Connected Summary

- Shows the count of distinct domains connected to by the current tab.
- This value is a real-time snapshot of third-party domains contacted.

### 2.3 Outcome Sections

There are three distinct sections, each labeled clearly and color-coded for ease of recognition:

| Section          | Meaning                                                  | Interaction                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**  | Domains with network connections allowed by your content blocking rules | Expand to view domain list   |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains whose requests were blocked silently or redirected, so stealthily that the request might not even appear to have failed | Expand to view domain list   |
| **Blocked**      | Domains for which network requests were blocked outright (e.g., by content blockers or network errors) | Expand to view domain list   |

Each section displays a list of domains with the count of requests made to each.

## 3. How to Use the Popup for Actionable Insights

Follow these steps to get the most out of the popup:

<Steps>
<Step title="Accessing the Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon next to your browser’s address bar while browsing any website.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the Active Tab’s Hostname">
Look at the hostname header at the top of the popup ensuring it matches the site you want to inspect.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Domains Connected Count">
Note the summary count which tells you how many distinct domains have been connected to from that tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Each Outcome Section">
Click on or scroll through each of the three sections — Not Blocked, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked — to review domain-level details.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Domain Counts">
Use the numeric badges next to domains to see how many requests were made to each; higher counts mean more frequent requests.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Practical Examples

Imagine you browse `news.example.com`. The popup shows:

- Not Blocked: `cdn.example.org (5 requests)`, `api.news.com (3 requests)`
- Stealth-Blocked: `trackers.adservice.net (4 requests)`
- Blocked: `ads.exampleads.com (10 requests)`

This tells you your browser fetched resources from legitimate content servers (Not Blocked), silently blocked certain trackers (Stealth-Blocked), and outright blocked ads domains (Blocked).

Examining stealth-blocked domains can hint at hidden tracking attempts bypassed by your content blockers.

## 5. Best Practices & Tips

- **Check the Badge Number:** The toolbar icon badge corresponds to the count of distinct allowed third-party domains—use this as a high-level privacy metric.
- **Use Domain Counts to Spot Heavy Connections:** Multiple requests to a single domain can indicate significant resource or tracking use.
- **Monitor Stealth Blocked Domains:** These indicate more subtle blocking and should inform your filter list choices.
- **Clear the Popup View Periodically:** Refresh the page or reload the tab to update the popup data, as it tracks real-time sessions.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Display Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Blank">
- Make sure you have an active tab selected.
- Confirm the extension is enabled and has necessary permissions.
- Check that the current tab is a web page that makes network requests.
- Reload the tab to trigger new data collection.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Counts Not Updating">
- Network requests are aggregated asynchronously; allow a few seconds delay.
- Verify that your content blocker or browser settings do not interfere with the webRequest API.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count on Icon Doesn't Match Popup Data">
- Badge counts report only allowed third-party distinct domains.
- Popup displays counts by category, including stealth and blocked domains.
- These counts measure different metrics, so discrepancies are expected.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. What’s Next?

Once you're comfortable interpreting the popup UI:

- Explore [Interpreting Badge Counts](/guides/getting-started/interpreting-badge-counts) to deepen your understanding of badge signals.
- Learn how to analyze network connections across websites in [Analyzing Website Network Connections](/guides/real-world-usage/analyzing-website-network-connections).
- Use uBO Scope to improve your filter lists by reading [Using uBO Scope for Filter List Maintainers](/guides/real-world-usage/using-ubo-scope-for-filter-list-maintainers).

## Appendix: Popup Layout Snapshot

```html
<body class="loading">
  <h2 id="tabHostname"><span></span><span>NO DATA</span></h2>
  <main>
    <section id="summary">
      domains connected: <span>?</span>
    </section>
    <section class="outcome allowed">
      <h3>not blocked</h3>
      <div class="domains"></div>
    </section>
    <section class="outcome stealth">
      <h3>stealth-blocked</h3>
      <div class="domains"></div>
    </section>
    <section class="outcome blocked">
      <h3>blocked</h3>
      <div class="domains"></div>
    </section>
  </main>
</body>
```

This interface dynamically populates domains under each section using data collected by the extension’s background scripts.
