# Viewing and Understanding Connection Reports

## Overview

This guide walks you through accessing uBO Scope's extension popup to view detailed reports on network connections made by the current active browser tab. You'll learn how to interpret the displayed information including allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains, understand the significance of the toolbar badge count, and confidently read the connection status for your active web page.


## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your supported browser (Chromium ≥122.0, Firefox ≥128.0, Safari ≥18.5).
- You have visited at least one webpage after installation to generate connection data.
- Basic familiarity with browser extensions and toolbar interaction.


## Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will be able to:

- Open the uBO Scope popup panel for the active tab.
- Read and understand the connection summary and domain lists.
- Interpret the distinctions between 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' domains.
- Relate popup data with the badge count shown on the extension icon.
- Use this insight for better understanding of network privacy and connection behavior.


## Time Estimate

This process takes about **3-5 minutes**.


## Difficulty Level

Beginner - no technical expertise required beyond basic browser use.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Ensure you are on the browser tab for which you want to view connection data. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in the browser toolbar. This action opens the popup window displaying connection information for the active tab.

**Result:**
You see a popup with the domain title, connection counts, and categorized connection lists.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify the Main Domain">
At the top of the popup window, note the site header which displays the main hostname and domain for the active tab. For example, visiting `https://example.com`, the hostname and domain will be shown (often with the hostname left-trimmed if it contains subdomains).

**Result:**
The heading changes from 'NO DATA' to the actual domain names.
</Step>

<Step title="Understand the Summary Section">
Locate the summary line below the header, labeled 'domains connected'. This number represents the count of distinct third-party domains the page has successfully connected to.

**Tip:**
A lower number is generally preferable, indicating fewer third-party connections.
</Step>

<Step title="Examine Connection Categories">
The popup divides connection domains into three categories:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains with allowed connections.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains blocked using stealth/blocking methods that attempt to conceal blocking presence.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were actively blocked.

Each category lists domains along with the number of connection attempts or successful connections.

**Result:**
You get a categorized view of all remote servers contacted during the page load.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Domain Counts">
Review the counts next to each domain. These represent the number of requests associated with that domain. Higher numbers indicate frequent connections to that domain.

**Decision Point:**
If you see unexpected or high counts for unknown domains, consider investigating whether those are necessary or potentially intrusive.
</Step>

<Step title="Relate Popup Data to Badge Counts">
Open multiple tabs and observe the extension icon's badge number. This badge shows the number of distinct allowed (not blocked) third-party domains for that tab.

**Check:**
After viewing the popup, confirm that the badge count matches the size of the 'not blocked' domain list.
</Step>

<Step title="Refresh Data as Needed">
The popup updates dynamically when you open it on new tabs or reload webpages. To re-check connections, refresh the page or switch to another tab and re-open the popup.

**Expected Result:**
Accurate, live reflection of current network connection status.
</Step>
</Steps>

## How uBO Scope Defines Connection Status

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** These are domains your browser successfully connected to without any blocking intervention.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections prevented in a way that masks the fact that they were blocked, often to avoid breaking webpage functionality.
- **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked connections typically prevented by filters or network policies.

Understanding these states helps you discern how your content blockers or network restrictions impact your browsing.

## Practical Example

Suppose you visit `https://news.example.com`:

- You click the uBO Scope icon.
- The header shows hostname `news` and domain `example.com`.
- The summary indicates ‘domains connected: 5’.
- The 'not blocked' section lists `cdn.example.net (10)`, `analytics.thirdparty.com (3)`.
- The 'stealth-blocked' section lists `ads.badads.com (2)`.
- The 'blocked' section lists `tracker.eviltracker.net (7)`.

You interpret:

- The site loaded resources from 5 distinct third-party domains successfully.
- Some ads and trackers were stealth-blocked or fully blocked.
- The badge count on the extension icon will be '5', matching 'not blocked' domains.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Connection Reports">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Blank">
- Ensure you have browsed to a page in the active tab where network requests could be observed.
- Reload the page and try opening the popup again.
- Check that uBO Scope has appropriate permissions and is enabled.
- If still unresolved, consult installation and setup guides.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Doesn't Match Visible Data">
- The badge count reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains, not total requests.
- Some stealth-blocked domains are not counted in the badge.
- Reload the tab or reopen the popup to refresh data.
- Verify no other extensions interfere with data reporting.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Clarifying Domain Names Displayed">
- Domains are displayed in Unicode (human-readable) form if punycode-encoded.
- Subdomains are trimmed in the header to highlight the registered domain.
- Use the counts to prioritize which domains might warrant further investigation.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Keep in mind that a high number of connected third-party domains can impact privacy. Use uBO Scope insights to understand and adjust your content blocking or browsing habits.
