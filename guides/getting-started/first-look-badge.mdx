# Your First Analysis: Reading the Toolbar Badge

## Overview
This guide explains how to interpret the badge number displayed on the uBO Scope browser extension icon. The badge quantifies the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the webpage you are visiting. Understanding this badge helps you gauge your browsing privacy and the extent of external connections initiated by webpages.

## What the Badge Represents

- **Badge Number Meaning:** The badge count reflects the total number of unique third-party remote servers that the current webpage attempted to connect to or successfully connected to during your browsing session.
- **Third-Party Remote Servers:** These are domains that are different from the site you are visiting, often used to serve content, ads, analytics, or other resources.
- **Significance of Lower Counts:** Fewer third-party connections generally indicate better privacy, as your browser interacts with fewer external parties.

## Why the Badge Is Important

Many users focus on the number of blocked requests reported by ad blockers, but uBO Scope’s badge focuses on distinct third-party remote servers with which the browser has communicated, revealing the real exposure breadth.

- A **high badge count** means numerous external servers are reached, increasing tracking or data sharing surfaces.
- A **low badge count** suggests fewer external connections, indicating tighter privacy.

This perspective helps debunk common myths that higher block counts equal better privacy. What's critical is the effective reduction in unique third-party domains contacted.

## How the Badge Updates

1. When you navigate to a new webpage or reload a page, uBO Scope monitors all network connections initiated by that tab.
2. The extension tracks distinct third-party domains contacted by that page.
3. The badge on the extension icon updates in near real-time, reflecting the current count.

## Step-by-Step: Check and Interpret Your Badge

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Icon in Your Browser Toolbar">
Find the uBO Scope icon among your browser’s extensions. It looks like the uBO Scope logo, consistent across supported browsers.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Badge Number">
Next to or over the icon, you will see a number badge indicating how many distinct third-party servers the active tab has connected to.
</Step>
<Step title="Understand Badge Values">
Recognize that this number does not count total requests but unique third-party hosts contacted.
</Step>
<Step title="Reload the Page for Updated Counts">
Refreshing the page reruns the network activity and updates the badge to show current connection counts.
</Step>
<Step title="Use the Badge as a Privacy Indicator">
Lower numbers signal fewer third-party contacts, suggesting better privacy.
Higher numbers can highlight pages with extensive external connections deserving closer inspection.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips

- Use the badge as an ongoing gauge of privacy impact while browsing.
- Compare badge counts across your favorite sites to identify privacy-friendly vs. resource-heavy sites.
- Combine badge insights with the popup UI (documented elsewhere) for granular details on which domains are involved.
- Remember the badge includes all network connections reported by the browser, including those allowed by any active content blockers.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Expecting block counts:** The badge is distinct from block counts displayed in ad blockers; it shows unique domains contacted, not requests blocked.
- **Assuming zero means no connections:** A badge of zero might indicate no third-party connections or that the tab’s data is not yet available (e.g., on initial load).
- **Ignoring background activity:** Connections may continue after page load due to scripts or trackers initiating later.

<Tip>
Keep in mind that the badge updates dynamically as your browsing session progresses, providing a real-time reflection of third-party network exposure.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Badge Issues

If the badge does not appear or does not update:

- Ensure that the extension is enabled and has appropriate permissions as outlined in the installation and configuration guides.
- Reload the current page and switch tabs to force a refresh of connection data.
- Check for browser compatibility and minimum version requirements.
- Consult the Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues guide if problems persist.
