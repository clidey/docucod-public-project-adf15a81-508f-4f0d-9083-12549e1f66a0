## 3. First-Time Configuration

### Step 1: Grant Permissions

uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor network requests to provide accurate reporting:

- Access to active tab content
- Web request monitoring
- Storage access

Grant these when prompted during installation or first run.

### Step 2: Initial Extension Activation

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- The popup panel will open (see the example below).

### Step 3: Understanding the Popup UI

The popup displays:
- The current webpage's hostname
- Number of distinct connected third-party domains
- Categories of connections:
  - **Not Blocked** (allowed connections)
  - **Stealth-Blocked**
  - **Blocked**

### Step 4: Confirm Active Monitoring

Visit a few websites and watch the badge count on the toolbar icon increase based on unique third-party remote servers contacted.

---

## 4. Verification and Validation

### How to Confirm Successful Setup

- Open several websites known to load multiple third-party resources (for example, news sites, social platforms).
- Click the uBO Scope icon and observe the popup update with listing domains and counts.
- The badge number on the toolbar icon should reflect the number of distinct third-party connections made.

### Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

If the extension does not seem to detect connections:

- Ensure you are using a supported browser and version.
- Confirm all requested permissions are granted.
- Reload the browser or restart it.
- Check for conflicts with other network monitoring extensions.

> Refer to the guide [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../first-use-and-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues) for detailed solutions.

## 5. Practical Tips for a Smooth Start

- **Privacy-first mindset:** A lower badge count means fewer third-party connections and better privacy.
- **Understanding badge count:** The badge shows distinct third-party domains contacted, not total requests.
- **Use alongside content blockers:** uBO Scope reports connections irrespective of content blockers in use, providing transparency on what is actually allowed or blocked.

## 6. What Comes Next?

After installation and validation:

- Explore the [Feature Quick Tour](../../overview/quick-tour-integration/feature-overview) to learn how to interpret connection reports.
- Read [Viewing and Understanding Connection Reports](../getting-started/first-network-connection-insight) to make the most of uBO Scope’s real-time insights.
- If you have issues, visit [Troubleshooting and Common Issues](../../guides/realworld-usage/troubleshoot-common-issues).

## Appendix: Example Popup UI Structure (Simplified)

The popup interface categorizes connections as follows:

- `Not Blocked` – connections successfully allowed
- `Stealth-Blocked` – requests intercepted in stealth mode
- `Blocked` – outright blocked requests

This immediate visual feedback helps you assess network transparency of the active webpage.
