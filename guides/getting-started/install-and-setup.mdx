---

## 4. Permissions Explained

Upon installation, the extension requests the following key permissions:

- **activeTab:** Grants the extension access to interact with the currently viewed tab, enabling accurate network request tracking per tab.
- **storage:** Allows the extension to save session data such as recorded domains and settings.
- **webRequest:** Provides the capability to observe all network requests initiated by web pages, critical for the monitoring functionality.

<u>These permissions are essential and must be granted for uBO Scope to operate effectively.</u>

---

## 5. Post-Installation Behavior

- The extension immediately begins to monitor network requests across all your browser tabs and windows.
- It maintains a session-based record of:
  - Domains where connections were **allowed** (not blocked).
  - Domains that were **stealth-blocked** (requests redirected or hidden by filters).
  - Domains that were explicitly **blocked**.
- The toolbar icon badge updates dynamically to display the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
  
## 6. Opening the Extension Popup for the First Time

1. **Locate the uBO Scope Icon:**
   Find the extension icon in your browser’s toolbar (usually near the address bar).

2. **Click the Icon:**
   This opens the popup window showing a summary of third-party domains related to the active tab.

3. **Understanding the Popup:**
   - The popup shows counts and lists of domains under the categories: _not blocked_, _stealth-blocked_, and _blocked_.
   - The page hostname and domain are displayed at the top.
   - Below is the summary showing the total number of distinct domains connected.

4. **Initial Data Displayed:**
   As you load pages and browse, the lists update to reflect actual network requests per tab.

---

## 7. Verifying Successful Installation

- After opening the popup, you should see domain connection data corresponding to the current tab.
- The badge icon count on the toolbar should reflect the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.
- If the popup shows "NO DATA" or is empty:
  - Confirm that permissions have been granted.
  - Ensure you are visiting a webpage that makes network requests.
  - Re-load the tab and open the popup to refresh data.

<Tip>
If you do not see data immediately, try navigating to a new webpage or refreshing the page. Some network request data initializes as pages load.
</Tip>
