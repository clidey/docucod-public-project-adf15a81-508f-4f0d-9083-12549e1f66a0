## 2. Step-by-Step Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Verify Browser Compatibility

Ensure your browser is supported and up to date:
- Chromium-based browsers require version 122.0 or newer.
- Firefox requires version 128.0 or newer.
- Safari requires version 18.5 or newer.

You can check your browser's version in its settings/about page.

### Step 2: Install uBO Scope Extension

Use official sources for security and reliability:

- **For Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge):**
  1. Visit the [Chrome Web Store - uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
  2. Click `Add to Chrome` and confirm the installation.

- **For Firefox:**
  1. Visit the [Firefox Add-ons - uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
  2. Click `Add to Firefox` then `Add` to install.

- **For Safari:**
  1. Starting with Safari 18.5, the extension is available via the App Store or trusted distributor.
  2. Follow Safari’s extension installation instructions using the appropriate package.

### Step 3: Confirm Permission Requests

During installation, uBO Scope will request the following permissions:
- **webRequest:** To listen to and report network requests.
- **storage:** To save session data and user preferences.
- **activeTab:** To associate data with the currently active browser tab.

Accept all permissions to ensure full functionality.

### Step 4: Verify Toolbar Icon and Badge Visibility

After installation:
- Locate the uBO Scope icon on the browser toolbar. It should appear as the uBO Scope logo.
- The badge (a numeric overlay) will initially be empty or zero.
- If you do not see the icon:
  - Check your browser’s extensions management page.
  - Pin / enable the extension icon if your browser supports pinning.

### Step 5: Initial Launch and Popup Inspection

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- The popup should display:
  - The hostname of the active tab.
  - A count of connected third-party domains.
  - Three domain connection categories: "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked".
- Initially, you might see "NO DATA" or zero counts if no network activity has been detected yet.

### Step 6: Confirm Real-Time Network Activity Capture

- Navigate to a known website with third-party content (e.g., news site, ecommerce platform).
- Observe the toolbar badge updating with a count reflecting third-party connections.
- Refresh the page if necessary to trigger new network requests.
- Open the popup again and verify domain counts populate under each connection outcome.

### Step 7: Basic Configuration Check (Optional)

- uBO Scope operates effectively with zero configuration.
- If needed, confirm the extension is allowed to run on all sites by checking browser extension settings.
