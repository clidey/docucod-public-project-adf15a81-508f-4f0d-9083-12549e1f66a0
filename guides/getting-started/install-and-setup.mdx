## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Verify Browser and Version Compatibility

Before installation, ensure your browser is supported and meets the minimum version:

| Browser | Minimum Version |
|---------|----------------|
| Chrome  | 122.0          |
| Firefox | 128.0          |
| Safari  | 18.5           |

Updating your browser to the latest version is recommended for best compatibility and security.

### 2. Obtain uBO-Scope from Official Sources

Install uBO-Scope from the official extension stores: 

- **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.):** [Chrome Web Store - uBO-Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)

- **Firefox:** [Firefox Add-ons - uBO-Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

- **Safari:** Available on the Mac App Store matching Safari version 18.5 or later. (Ensure your Safari version meets the requirement.)

> Note: Avoid installing uBO-Scope from unofficial or third-party sources to maintain security and stability.

### 3. Install the Extension

Follow your browser’s normal extension installation process:

- Click the provided link to open the extension page.
- Select **Add to [Browser Name]**.
- Allow requested permissions when prompted (such as access to web requests and tabs).

### 4. Activate and Pin the Extension Icon

- After install, the uBO-Scope icon will appear in your browser's toolbar.
- Pin the icon for easy access:
  - In Chrome and Edge, open the extensions menu (puzzle icon), then pin uBO-Scope.
  - In Firefox, the icon normally shows after install; if hidden, find it in the overflow menu and drag it to the toolbar.

### 5. Confirm uBO-Scope is Running

- Click the uBO-Scope toolbar icon to open its popup interface.
- You should see data loading, then a display of the current page’s connections categorized as **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** with counts.
- The badge on the icon will show a number representing the count of distinct third-party remote domains connected.

<Tip>
If the popup displays 'NO DATA' or remains blank, reload the active browser tab to trigger network activity and update results.
</Tip>

### 6. Verify Permissions and Functionality

- Ensure you have granted the extension permission to access important features like network requests (`webRequest`), active tabs, and storage.
- The extension uses these permissions to monitor all network connections regardless of your content blocker.

### 7. Troubleshoot if Necessary

If the extension does not appear or the badge does not update:

- Restart your browser.
- Check the extension management page to ensure uBO-Scope is enabled and has required permissions.
- Confirm you are running on a supported browser version.
- See the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](https://yourdocs.example.com/getting-started/first-steps-validation/troubleshooting) guide for more detailed help.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep your browser updated** for compatibility with the extension’s modern APIs.
- **Pin the uBO-Scope icon** for quick access and instant insights into site connections.
- **Reload webpages** after installing uBO-Scope to start monitoring network traffic immediately.
- Remember, **a lower badge count means fewer distinct third-party remote connections**, which aligns with better privacy.
- Use the official extension stores only; **manual installation is advanced** and not recommended unless you are a developer.
