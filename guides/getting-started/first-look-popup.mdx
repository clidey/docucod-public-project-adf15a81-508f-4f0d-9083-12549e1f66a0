# Your First Look: Understanding the Popup UI

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description

This guide takes you on a practical tour of the uBO Scope extension popup interface. It helps you understand how to interpret domain connection statistics, categorize network connections into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked outcomes, and grasp the significance of the toolbar badge count. With this knowledge, you will immediately recognize suspicious or excessive third-party connections occurring in your browser.

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope extension installed on a supported browser:
  - Chromium 122+
  - Firefox 128+
  - Safari 18.5+
- The extension has been granted necessary permissions at first launch (activeTab, webRequest, storage).
- You have opened uBO Scope popup by clicking its icon in the browser toolbar while on an active web page.

### Expected Outcome

- You will confidently navigate the popup UI with a clear understanding of:
  - The number of distinct third-party domains connected per active tab
  - The categories of connection outcomes: not blocked (allowed), stealth-blocked, and blocked
  - How to interpret domain counts and connection instances
  - The real meaning of the badge count displayed on the browser toolbar
- Ability to spot unusual or high volume third-party network activity.

### Time Estimate

10-15 minutes to read through and explore on actual web pages.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate – no prior network or privacy tool knowledge required.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar while an active tab with a website loaded is open.
- The popup will display connection details relevant to the active tab.

### 2. Understand the Header Section

- **Hostname Display:** Top of the popup shows the current tab’s hostname split into two parts:
  - Left span: Any subdomains (e.g., `www.`)
  - Right span: The main registered domain (e.g., `example.com`)
- If no data is available for the tab, it shows `NO DATA`.

### 3. Check the Summary Section

- Below the hostname, the summary reads "domains connected: X", where X is the count of distinct third-party domains to which your browser attempted or made connections on this tab.
- This count reflects the real network activity, including allowed and stealth-blocked connections.

### 4. Explore Domain Connection Categories

The popup organizes domains into three outcome categories. Each category lists domains alphabetically with connection instance counts:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which connections succeeded without being blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were silently blocked (e.g., via stealth blocking to avoid detection).
- **Blocked:** Domains whose network requests were actively blocked (including failed network requests).

Each category section shows:
- Section header with the category name
- A list of domain rows: each with domain name (Unicode displayed if punycode) and a numeric badge showing how many times connections occurred

### 5. Interpreting the Badge Count on Toolbar

- The number on the browser’s toolbar badge matches the count of distinct allowed third-party domains for the active tab.
- Lower badge counts generally indicate fewer third-party connections, which usually means better privacy.
- Remember, the badge excludes blocked or stealth connections.

### 6. Interact and Read Data Thoughtfully

- Use the data to identify:
  - Legitimate domains, such as well-known CDNs
  - Unexpected third parties contributing to your network activity
  - Excessive connections which might suggest privacy leaks or tracking
- Utilize this understanding to make informed decisions about content blockers or site trust.

### 7. Verify Display on Different Websites

- To see the popup UI in action, visit various websites and open the popup to observe real-time connection changes.
- Note how domain counts and categories vary based on site content and your blockers.

### Verification Steps

- Confirm the active tab’s hostname appears correctly at the top.
- Check the total domain count matches the number shown on the badge.
- Verify domain listings appear under appropriate outcome categories.
- Ensure counts correspond to connection instances noted.

## Examples & Real Scenarios

Imagine you are visiting an online news website:

- The popup shows `domains connected: 15`.
- Allowed domains include the news site’s CDN and popular analytics services.
- Stealth-blocked section lists some advertising domains silently blocked to avoid page breakage.
- Blocked section shows domains explicitly blocked by your content blocker.

You notice an unexpected domain with a high connection count under allowed domains – this indicates a third-party resource heavily involved in the page activity, worth further investigation.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Empty">

- **Cause:** uBO Scope has not yet recorded network requests for the active tab or the tab has no network activity.
- **Solution:** Refresh the web page and reopen the popup. Ensure extension permissions are granted and the browser version is supported.
- Check related documentation: [First Launch and Permissions](getting-started/install-configure/first-launch), [Troubleshooting Common Issues](getting-started/using-validating/troubleshooting).

</Accordion><Accordion title="Badge Count Doesn't Match Popup Total Domains">

- **Cause:** The browser badge count only reflects allowed third-party domains, excluding stealth or blocked ones.
- **Tip:** Use this as an indicator of distinct successful third-party connections.

</Accordion><Accordion title="Domains List Looks Unfamiliar or Obfuscated">

- uBO Scope converts punycode domains into readable Unicode for easier recognition.
- You can recognize real-world domains better thanks to this feature.

</Accordion></AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Tip: Regularly monitor the popup UI when browsing different sites to familiarize yourself with typical domain patterns, making suspicious connections easier to spot.

<Tip>
Best Practice: Use the popup’s categorized data to complement your content blocking strategy for enhanced privacy and site compatibility.
