# First Look: Understanding the Popup

## Overview
The **uBO Scope popup interface** provides an on-the-spot, categorized snapshot of your current browser tab's remote server connections. It reveals which domains the active webpage tried to connect with and classifies those connections based on their outcome: allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

This guide walks you through the popup's layout and explains how to read and interpret the data effectively to understand your network traffic at a glance.

---

## What the Popup Shows

When you open the uBO Scope popup, it displays:

- The **hostname and domain** of the current active tab
- A **summary** count of all distinct domains connected during the page’s lifecycle
- Three categorized sections listing connected domains:
  - **Not blocked:** Domains with allowed network requests
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains with connections that were redirected or stealthily blocked
  - **Blocked:** Domains where network requests were explicitly blocked and did not succeed

This immediate classification helps you quickly audit network behavior for the page you're visiting.

---

## Detailed Interface Breakdown

### 1. Hostname Display
At the top, the popup shows the hostname and domain of the active tab:

- The **domain** is the core registered domain, shown prominently (last span).
- If the hostname differs from the domain (e.g., with subdomains), the extra part is shown before the domain.

*Example:* For the URL `https://news.example.com`, the popup shows:

- 'news.' in the first part
- 'example.com' as the main domain

This helps you confirm exactly which site tab the connection data belongs to.

### 2. Summary Section
Below the hostname, a summary section reports:

- Total number of **distinct domains connected** during this page session.

This count reflects third-party remote servers your browser successfully connected to, giving a quick sense of network reach and third-party exposure.

### 3. Outcome Sections
The core of the popup lists connected domains grouped by network request outcomes:

- **Not Blocked** (allowed): 
  - Domains for which network requests were allowed and completed without intervention.
  - This section usually reflects the third parties actually delivering content or assets.

- **Stealth-Blocked:**
  - Domains where connection attempts were stealthily blocked, such as when requests were redirected or silently prevented from loading.
  - These may represent requests blocked without explicit error, reducing detectable load.

- **Blocked:**
  - Domains where requests were explicitly blocked and failed to connect, often due to content blocking or other filtering.
  - These domains had connection attempts that did not succeed.

Each section lists:
- The domain name
- A badge with the **count** of requests made to that domain within the tab session

This breakdown aids in visualizing network behavior and understanding which third parties are active, suppressed, or blocked.

## How to Use the Popup Effectively

1. **Open the popup immediately after loading a page** to see all network interactions recorded so far.
2. **Review the summary count** to understand the number of third-party domains connected.
3. **Examine the "Not Blocked" list** to see what third-party domains have successfully served resources.
4. **Check "Stealth-Blocked"** for connections that were silently stopped or redirected, giving insight into non-obvious blocking.
5. **Look at "Blocked"** to verify if domains you expect to be blocked are indeed prevented.

This knowledge helps assess your content blockers' effectiveness or identify unexpected connections.

## Practical Tips

- The popup updates based on the **active tab**; switch tabs and reopen the popup to refresh data.
- If the popup shows **"NO DATA"** or a '?', it means no network connection data has been collected yet for the current tab – try reloading the page.
- The **count badges** provide quick quantitative insight but do not provide granular request details.
- Use the domain lists to identify suspicious or unexpected third-party domains.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Expect the domain lists to sometimes be empty for newly opened tabs with little network activity.
- Highly dynamic webpages might generate many connections; expect the list and counts to vary on refresh.
- Network requests initiated outside the browser’s reach (e.g., OS-level or VPN-based) will not show.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Popup shows "NO DATA" or '?' in summary.

- Reload the webpage and reopen the popup.
- Confirm the extension is installed and active.
- Verify you have permissions enabled (refer to installation docs).

**Issue:** Counts always zero or sections empty.

- The extension updates data asynchronously and may require page interaction.
- Network activity may be minimal on simple pages.
- Check for browser restrictions interfering with webRequest API.
