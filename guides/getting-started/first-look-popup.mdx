# Understanding the uBO Scope Popup Dashboard

Welcome to the uBO Scope popup dashboard walkthrough. This guide will quickly orient you with the main user interface elements, how to find connection summaries, and how to interpret the different domain categories displayed for the active browser tab. By the end, you will confidently understand what 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' domains represent and how to use the popup for immediate privacy insights.

---

## 1. What You Achieve With This Guide

- **Purpose**: Learn how to read and interpret the uBO Scope popup window, which shows domain connection results for the current active browser tab.
- **Prerequisites**: uBO Scope installed in your browser, an active webpage loaded in the current tab, and the popup opened (click the uBO Scope toolbar icon).
- **Outcome**: Understand each UI section, connection statistics, and domain outcome categories to quickly assess third-party connections.
- **Estimated Time**: 5 minutes
- **Difficulty Level**: Beginner

## 2. Overview of the Popup Dashboard UI

The popup dashboard is designed to be clear and focused, presenting real-time data on remote server connections made by the active browser tab.

### Main UI Elements

- **Hostname Title (#tabHostname)**
  - Displays the hostname and its domain of the active tab at the top.
  - For example, if visiting "news.example.com", it shows the "news." subdomain separately from the main domain.

- **Summary Section (#summary)**
  - Shows a count labeled 'domains connected' indicating how many distinct remote domains the current tab connected to.
  - This number reflects unique third-party domains that had at least one allowed connection.

- **Domain Outcome Sections**
  The popup divides domains into three outcome categories, each with its own section listing domains and connection counts:

  1. **Not Blocked (allowed)**
     - Domains to which connections were allowed (loaded or accessed).
     - These usually represent third-party servers that delivered content or data successfully.

  2. **Stealth-Blocked (stealth)**
     - Domains where connections were redirected stealthily.
     - This outcome means requests were stealthily modified or redirected by content blockers.

  3. **Blocked**
     - Domains where connections failed due to blocking.
     - Represents requests that the content blocker explicitly stopped.

Each outcome section lists domains with the number of connection attempts shown as badges.

### Domain Rows

- Each domain is displayed alongside a badge showing how many requests involved that domain.
- Domain names handle internationalized domain names (IDN) and will display in Unicode.

## 3. Step-by-Step: Using the Popup Dashboard

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser.
- The popup immediately loads data for the active browser tab.

### Step 2: Identify the Current Tab Hostname

- Look at the top header showing the tab hostname and domain.
- This confirms which webpageâ€™s data you are viewing.

### Step 3: Review the Connection Summary

- See the 'domains connected' count showing the number of distinct third-party domains reached on this page.
- A lower count typically indicates fewer third-party connections and potentially better privacy.

### Step 4: Examine the Domain Outcome Categories

- Scroll through each category: not blocked, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- For each, review the domain names and badges, representing the number of distinct connection requests.

### Step 5: Interpret the Domain Categories

- **Not Blocked:** Domains that your browser successfully connected to and fetched resources from.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with modified or redirected requests (may indicate sophisticated block techniques).
- **Blocked:** Domains fully blocked by content blockers or network filters.

Use these categories to understand privacy exposure and evaluate blocking effectiveness.

## 4. Practical Examples

#### Scenario: Investigating a News Website

- Open the uBO Scope popup on a news site tab.
- See the 'domains connected' count is 15.
- In 'Not Blocked', domains like 'cdn.news.com' with badges showing multiple entries indicate allowed CDN content.
- 'Stealth-Blocked' might list ad-serving domains with connection attempts redirected or modified.
- 'Blocked' lists domains completely blocked, such as trackers or known malicious servers.

This snapshot allows you to see at a glance which third parties are active and which are blocked.

---

## 5. Tips and Best Practices

- **Regularly check the popup after loading new pages** to monitor changing third-party connections.
- Use the **domain counts to spot high-volume connections** which could indicate tracking or heavy resource loading.
- Consider the **presence of stealth-blocked domains** as signals of advanced blocking behavior.
- A **low 'domains connected' count is generally favorable** for privacy but always interpret with context.
- Remember that **domain names are presented in Unicode** for readability, including internationalized domains.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<Tip>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or question marks, try refreshing the webpage or reopening the popup, as data collection depends on active network activity in the tab.
</Tip>

<Warning>
If the domains lists are empty but you expect some connections, ensure the extension permissions are correctly granted and that uBO Scope's background processes are running.
</Warning>

<Note>
Blocked domains might be missing if your content blocker or browser restricts network monitoring APIs. Verify the browser supports required permissions.
</Note>

## Appendix: Popup HTML Structure Reference

```html
<body class="loading">
    <h2 id="tabHostname"><span></span><span>NO DATA</span></h2>
    <main>
        <section id="summary">
            domains connected: <span>?</span>
        </section>
        <section class="outcome allowed">
            <h3>not blocked</h3>
            <div class="domains"></div>
        </section>
        <section class="outcome stealth">
            <h3>stealth-blocked</h3>
            <div class="domains"></div>
        </section>
        <section class="outcome blocked">
            <h3>blocked</h3>
            <div class="domains"></div>
        </section>
    </main>
</body>
```

This layout arranges the sections users interact with to interpret the network request results.
