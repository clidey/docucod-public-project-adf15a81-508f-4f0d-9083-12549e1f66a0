# Understanding the Extension Popup and Badge Count

## Overview
This guide introduces you to the core user interface elements of uBO Scope — specifically, how to open and interpret the extension’s popup and toolbar badge. You will learn how to quickly assess the number of third-party servers contacted by web pages and understand the significance of the data uBO Scope displays.

---

## What This Guide Will Help You Achieve
- Understand the meaning of the toolbar badge count on the uBO Scope icon.
- Learn how to open and navigate the extension popup interface.
- Decode the lists and connection outcome categories shown in the popup.
- Place the information in practical context to evaluate webpage network behavior.

---

## Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and enabled in your browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- At least one active webpage in your browser tab that initiates network connections.
- Basic familiarity with browser toolbars and extensions.

---

## Time Estimate
About 5 minutes to open the popup, explore, and become comfortable with the core UI elements.

## Difficulty Level
Beginner

## 1. Interpreting the Toolbar Badge Count

### What the Badge Represents
- The badge number shown on the uBO Scope browser toolbar icon reports the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the current webpage.
- A **third-party remote server** is any server not belonging to the primary website domain you are visiting.
- The count includes only servers with network connections that were allowed to proceed (not blocked).

### Why This Matters
- A **lower badge count** indicates fewer third-party connections, typically signaling better privacy and reduced network exposure.
- Conversely, a higher count means the webpage communicates with many remote servers, potentially increasing tracking or data leakage risk.

<Tip>
Not all third-party servers are harmful or unwanted—they can include legitimate services like content delivery networks (CDNs). Use the badge count as a useful indicator but consider context.
</Tip>

### When the Badge May Be Empty
- If no third-party domains were contacted or all connections were blocked, the badge will show no number (empty).

## 2. Opening the uBO Scope Popup Interface

### How to Access
- Click on the uBO Scope icon situated in your browser's toolbar.
- This action opens the popup.html interface presenting detailed information about the current tab’s third-party network connections.

<Check>
If you do not see the icon, verify that the extension is installed and enabled. See [Installing uBO Scope](https://example.com/guides/getting-started/installing-extension) for detailed instructions.

## 3. Understanding the Popup Layout

Upon opening, the popup provides three main sections:

### a. Hostname Header
- Shows the primary hostname and domain of the active browser tab.
- The domain is the registered site, while the hostname includes subdomains, helping you distinguish the exact resource being visited.

### b. Domains Connected Summary
- Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains contacted by the webpage.
- This number matches, or closely correlates with, the toolbar badge count.

### c. Connection Outcome Sections
These three panels categorize third-party domains based on how connections to them were treated:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Third-party domains that successfully established connections.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains for which requests were intercepted and redirected stealthily by content blockers; the webpage often does not detect these.
- **Blocked**: Domains whose connections were outright blocked by content blockers or network errors.

Each section lists domains along with a count indicating how many network requests were made to that domain.

## 4. Practical Example: Exploring the Popup

1. Visit a popular website such as a news site or social media platform.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
3. Observe the hostname displayed at the top — it tells you which site’s data you are analyzing.
4. Note the summary count of third-party domains connected.
5. Expand each category (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked) to see which domains fall into that group.
6. Use the domain list counts to gauge traffic volume per domain.

---

## 5. Tips and Best Practices

- **Regularly Review the Popup**: Familiarize yourself with common third-party domains for sites you visit. This helps spot unusual or unexpected network activity.
- **Compare Badge Counts Across Sites**: Use the badge to quickly compare third-party exposure between websites.
- **Check Stealth-Blocked Domains**: These indicate content blockers working silently; a balanced number suggests effective blocking without alerting websites.

<Tip>
Frequent changes in the badge count or domain lists may indicate dynamic content loading or trackers avoiding detection.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty
- Ensure you have an active tab with a loaded webpage.
- Sometimes the popup may take a second to refresh; try reopening it.
- Verify extension permissions are granted.

### Badge Count Does Not Update
- Reload the current tab to refresh connection data.
- Ensure no other extension or browser setting is blocking uBO Scope’s monitoring.
- Restart the browser if necessary.

## 7. Summary
This popup interface and badge count provide transparent, real-time insight into the distinct third-party servers a webpage contacts. Harnessing these indicators empowers you to better understand and control your privacy footprint while browsing.

## Appendix: Behind the Scenes (Technical Insight for Interested Users)

The popup fetches its data by messaging the background script, which maintains up-to-date records of network requests for each browser tab. These requests are categorized and counted, then presented in the popup using a clean, user-focused UI that avoids exposing internal data structures.
