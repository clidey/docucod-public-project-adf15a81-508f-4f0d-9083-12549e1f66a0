# Understanding the Badge and Popup Interface

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you understand the visual indicators provided by uBO Scope: the toolbar badge and the popup panel. You will learn how to interpret the badge count, recognize domain categories, and analyze the domain-level statistics displayed for allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and active in your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with using browser extensions and opening popup interfaces.

### Expected Outcome
By the end of this guide, you will confidently interpret uBO Scope’s badge count and popup details, enabling you to assess network connections made by webpages in real-time.

### Time Estimate
5-10 minutes

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Locate the Toolbar Badge
- After installing uBO Scope, look for its icon in your browser's toolbar.
- The badge on the icon displays a number representing the **count of distinct allowed third-party domains** contacted by the active tab.

<Tip>
A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party remote servers contacted, which typically suggests better privacy.
</Tip>

### 2. Understand What the Badge Represents
- The badge count is **not** the number of blocked connections, but the number of unique third-party domains that the webpage has successfully contacted.
- This reflects the real network exposure and third-party interaction.

### 3. Open the Popup Interface
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- The panel provides detailed domain-level statistics, including counts of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.

### 4. Interpreting the Popup Header
- At the top, the popup shows the hostname of the active tab’s main page.
- If the hostname contains subdomains, these are visually separated from the main domain for clarity.

### 5. Analyze the Summary Section
- The "domains connected" summary shows the total count of unique third-party domains contacted (allowed).
- This corresponds to the badge count.

### 6. Review the Outcomes Sections
The popup is divided into three primary sections, each reflecting a distinct connection outcome:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
  - Lists third-party domains and their counts for allowed connections.
  - Each domain shows how many requests succeeded.

- **Stealth-Blocked**
  - Shows domains that underwent "stealth blocking"—requests that were redirected or altered to prevent detection.

- **Blocked**
  - Lists domains for which network requests were outright blocked (errors or failures).

<Tip>
Sections without any domains are hidden automatically to keep the interface clear and focused.
</Tip>

### 7. Review Domain Lists
- Each section lists domains with their individual request counts.
- Domains are sorted alphabetically.
- Counts reflect the number of requests for each domain under that outcome category.

### 8. Confirm Your Understanding
- After examining the popup, the badge count should match the number of allowed domains displayed.
- Use this information to assess if the active webpage contacts more or fewer third-party servers.

## Examples & Visual Guide

### Example Scenario
You visit `https://example.com`.
- The uBO Scope badge shows `5`.
- You click the icon and open the popup:
  - Summary section displays: "domains connected: 5"
  - Under **Not Blocked**, you see 5 domains listed with their request counts.
  - The **Blocked** section is empty (hidden).
  - The **Stealth-Blocked** section lists 1 domain with 2 stealth-blocked requests.

This means the active webpage successfully contacted 5 distinct third-party domains, one domain had stealth blocking applied, and there were no outright blocked domains.

### Screenshot (Hypothetical)
```
[Toolbar Icon] uBO Scope [Badge: 5]

Popup Panel:
  Hostname: example.com
  Domains connected: 5
  Not Blocked:
    - cdn.example.net   4
    - analytics.com    3
    - fonts.com       1
    - ads.com         2
    - api.example.org  1
  Stealth-Blocked:
    - telemetry.com   2
  Blocked: <Hidden>
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Badge shows no count or '?'**
  - The webpage may not have loaded any third-party requests yet.
  - The extension may not be fully active or permissions are missing.
  - Try refreshing the page or restarting the browser.

- **Popup shows "NO DATA"**
  - The active tab might not have data collected yet.
  - Switch to another fully loaded tab.

- **Counts seem inconsistent**
  - Remember the badge counts **allowed** domains. Blocked and stealth-blocked are in the popup but do not affect the badge.

### Best Practices
- Use the badge as a quick privacy indicator—lower numbers typically mean less third-party tracking.
- Regularly check the popup to understand detailed third-party connections on important websites.
- Combine this information with your content blocker settings to optimize privacy.

### Performance Considerations
- uBO Scope processes network requests efficiently with minimal impact.
- Complex sites with many requests may cause a momentary delay for the badge to update.
- Refresh the popup to refresh data if needed.

### Alternative Approaches
- Use developer tools network tab for deeper inspection, but uBO Scope provides a focused third-party domain view more accessible to non-experts.

## Summary of Key Information

uBO Scope uses its badge and popup interface to help you visualize and understand the third-party domains that webpages contact. The badge shows the count of allowed third-party domains, while the popup provides detailed insights into allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains, giving you transparent and actionable network visibility.

---

## Appendix: Understanding Visual Style

- The **badge** color is consistent and unobtrusive.
- The popup uses color coding:
  - Green highlights allowed connections.
  - Red highlights blocked and stealth-blocked connections.
- Domain counts are right-aligned for clarity.

This design ensures quick at-a-glance understanding, avoiding overwhelming technical details.
