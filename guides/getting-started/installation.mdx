### Step 3: Install the Extension

1. On the extension page, click **Add to Chrome** (or **Add to Firefox**).
2. You may be prompted to review permissions:
   - *ActiveTab*: Grants the extension access to the current tab.
   - *Storage*: Allows storing session data.
   - *webRequest*: Permits monitoring of network requests.

3. Confirm by clicking **Add extension**.


### Step 4: Verify Installation
