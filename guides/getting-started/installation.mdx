## 3. Installation Steps

### 3.1 Locate uBO Scope in Your Browserâ€™s Extension Store

Search for **uBO Scope** or **uBlock Origin Scope** in the browser's official add-on or extension store:

- Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore
- Firefox Add-ons: https://addons.mozilla.org
- Safari Extensions Gallery or via the App Store (Safari 18.5+)

> _Tip:_ Verify the developer is **Raymond Hill** and that the extension version is current (e.g., v1.0.1) to avoid unofficial copies.

### 3.2 Install the Extension

Follow these steps:

1. Click **Add to Browser** / **Install** button.
2. When prompted, review and accept the permissions requests:
   - Access to websites you visit
   - Read and change your data on websites
   - Access to browser tabs and storage
3. Wait for the installation to complete; an icon resembling the uBO Scope logo will appear in the browser toolbar.

### 3.3 Verify Installation

After installation:

- Confirm the uBO Scope toolbar icon is visible, usually near the address bar.
- The icon should have no warning badges but may have an empty badge (no connections counted yet).

## 4. Enabling and First Launch

uBO Scope activates automatically upon installation, but verifying it functions correctly ensures you capture network data.

### 4.1 Enable the Extension if Disabled

1. Go to your browser's extensions page:
   - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
   - Firefox: `about:addons`
   - Safari: Preferences > Extensions
2. Locate **uBO Scope**.
3. Ensure the toggle or checkbox is enabled.

### 4.2 Permissions Confirmation

When you first visit a website after installation, uBO Scope will request necessary permissions quietly to monitor network requests. No further action is generally required.

### 4.3 Open the uBO Scope Panel

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
2. The popup panel will open, displaying the current tab's domain and network connection summary.

> _Example_: If visiting a popular website, the panel shows counts of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains connected.

### 4.4 Understand the Badge Count

- The toolbar icon badge reflects the number of distinct third-party domains connected for the active tab.
- A **lower badge count indicates fewer external connections**, assisting your privacy inspections.
