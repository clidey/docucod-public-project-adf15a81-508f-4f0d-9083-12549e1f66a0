---

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, please ensure:

- You are using a supported browser version:
  - **Chrome**: Version 122 or later
  - **Firefox**: Version 128 or later
  - **Safari**: Version 18.5 or later
- You have internet access to reach the browser extension marketplaces.
- You understand that uBO Scope requires permissions to access network requests (`webRequest`), active tabs, and browser storage.

For detailed prerequisites, see [System Requirements and Prerequisites](../../getting-started/installation-basics/prerequisites).

---

## 1. Installation

### Chrome
1. Open the [Chrome Web Store page for uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
2. Click **Add to Chrome**.
3. Review the permission prompt carefully. uBO Scope requires:
   - Access to your active tab

2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Confirm the requested permissions:
   - Permissions to access network requests

   - Permission to use storage
4. Click **Add** and wait for installation to complete.

## 2. Confirm Extension Activation

After installation, verify the extension is enabled and actively monitoring:

- **Locate the uBO Scope icon:** Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It typically looks like a stylized shield or small logo.

- **Verify badge count:** The icon badge shows the number of distinct allowed third-party domains with network connections originating from the active tab. Initially, this may be blank or zero if no browsing activity is detected.

- **Enable if disabled:** If the icon does not appear, or if the badge is not updating, ensure that the extension is enabled in your browser's extensions management page.

For help with locating and confirming activation, see [First Launch and Extension Activation](../../getting-started/first-use-configuration/first-launch).

## 3. Usage Confirmation Steps

### Observe badge updates
1. Browse to a trusted website (for example, a news site or your favorite homepage).
2. Look at the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. Observe the badge number increasing, indicating distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the tab.
4. Click the icon to open the popup UI, which provides detailed outcomes of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.

### Check permissions
- uBO Scope needs permission to monitor network requests across HTTP and HTTPS URLs.
- In Chrome and Firefox, this is declared as `host_permissions` for all URLs (`https://*/*` and `http://*/*`). Chrome additionally includes `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*` to cover WebSocket traffic.

### Troubleshoot installation issues
- If the icon is missing, confirm:
  - The extension was installed successfully
  - The extension is enabled
  - Your browser version meets minimum requirements
  - You have granted all requested permissions

For more troubleshooting guidance, refer to [Troubleshooting Common Installation and Usage Issues](../../getting-started/troubleshooting-support/common-issues).

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

- **Keep your browser updated** to ensure full compatibility and access to required WebExtensions APIs.

- **Restart your browser** after installing uBO Scope for best results.

- **Understand the badge meaning:** A lower badge count represents fewer distinct third-party connections, which generally means better privacy.

- **Use uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blocker** to get an independent measurement of network requests.

- Regularly consult detailed popup data to audit third-party connections.
