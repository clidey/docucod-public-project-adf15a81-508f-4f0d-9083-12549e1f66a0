## 3. Confirming Installation & Enabling uBO Scope

After installation:

1. **Check Toolbar Icon:** Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. By default, it is a shield emblem.
  - If you do not see it immediately, check your browser’s extension menu or customize toolbar options.

2. **Verify Permissions:** The first time you open uBO Scope, it uses browser permissions to monitor network requests via the `webRequest` API. Without these, data won’t appear.

3. **What It Monitors:** uBO Scope tracks network connections your browser makes to third-party servers and translates these into counts and details.

## 4. Opening uBO Scope for the First Time

1. **Click the uBO Scope Icon:** This opens the popup panel.
2. **What You See:** 
   - The popup header shows the current tab’s hostname.
   - A summary of distinct third-party domains connected.
   - Three categorized domain lists:
     - **Not blocked:** Domains your browser connected to successfully.
     - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains that were silently blocked or redirected.
     - **Blocked:** Domains actively blocked (usually by content blockers).

3. **Interpreting the Popup Data:** The distinct domain counts and their status give you instant insight into third-party network activity on the active tab.

## 5. Practical Tips for a Smooth First Launch

- **Trigger Network Activity:** Navigate to a website with external resources after installing uBO Scope to see the dashboard populate.
- **Refresh the Tab:** If the popup initially shows "NO DATA", refresh the page to allow uBO Scope to capture connections.
- **Resize Popup Window:** The popup UI adapts dynamically; resizing or waiting a moment after opening can help display all sections properly.
