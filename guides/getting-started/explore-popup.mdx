# Navigating the Popup and Interface

## Overview
This guide provides a clear walk-through of the uBO Scope popup panel—your primary interface for inspecting third-party network connections on the active browser tab. You'll learn how to open the popup, interpret the domain activity table, understand badge counts on the toolbar icon, and recognize the visual cues that indicate the connection status of domains (allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked).

---

## Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your browser.
- At least one tab actively loaded with web content.
- Familiarity with the browser toolbar and extension icons.

---

## Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will confidently open and navigate the uBO Scope popup to:
- View distinct third-party domains contacted by the current webpage.
- Understand the status of those domains in real-time (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked).
- Relate popup domain data to the toolbar badge count.


## Time Estimate
Approximately 5 minutes.

## Difficulty Level
Beginner

## Opening the uBO Scope Popup Panel

1. **Locate the uBO Scope toolbar icon** in your browser's toolbar area. It typically displays the uBO Scope logo.

2. **Click the icon** to open the popup panel. This panel dynamically shows the data collected for the active tab.

3. If no data is ready, the popup displays “NO DATA” until network requests are recorded.


## Understanding the Popup Panel Layout

### 1. Tab Hostname Display
At the top of the popup, you'll see the hostname of the current webpage:
- The **full hostname** is shown on the right side.
- If the hostname is a subdomain, the preceding part appears on the left, enabling easy recognition (e.g., `news.example.com` would show `news.` on the left and `example.com` on the right).

### 2. Summary Section
- Immediately below the tab hostname is a summary line showing **"domains connected:"** followed by the number of distinct third-party domains contacted by the current tab.
- This number corresponds directly to the badge count on the toolbar icon.

### 3. Connection Status Sections
The popup separates third-party domains into three clear sections:

- **Not Blocked (`allowed`)**: Domains from which network requests succeeded or were allowed.
- **Stealth-Blocked (`stealth`)**: Domains with requests that were stealthily blocked (for instance, redirected or cancelled) but may not be explicitly visible in usual blockers.
- **Blocked (`blocked`)**: Domains where outbound connections failed or were denied.

Each section contains a list of domains grouped by outcome.

### 4. Domain Rows
Each domain is presented as a row showing:
- The domain name (decoded to Unicode for internationalized domains).
- A numeric badge indicating the count of network requests associated with that domain.

This count helps you gauge how frequently a third-party domain is contacted during the browsing session.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using the Popup

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup for the active tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Read the Tab Hostname">
Observe the hostname displayed at the top to confirm you are inspecting the correct tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Check the Summary Count">
Look at the "domains connected:" number. This reflects the distinct third-party domains contacted, matching the toolbar badge.
</Step>

<Step title="Explore Allowed Domains">
Scroll to the **Not Blocked** section to see all domains from which connections succeeded.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Check the **Stealth-Blocked** section to identify domains that were blocked in a way that may bypass typical detection.
</Step>

<Step title="Inspect Blocked Domains">
View the **Blocked** section for all domains where connections failed or were explicitly blocked.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Request Counts">
Use the badges next to each domain to understand how many requests are made per domain during the current tab session.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- The badge number on the browser toolbar icon is your quick indicator of how many distinct third-party domains are connected to. A **lower number usually implies better blocking or fewer trackers**.

- Use the popup frequently to verify the behavior of content blockers and to identify unexpected third parties.

- The distinction between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains helps you understand not just which domains are accessible by the browser but also which are being stealthily blocked—offering a deeper privacy insight.

- Internationalized domains are accurately decoded for easier reading.

- If the popup shows "NO DATA" immediately after opening, give it a moment while browsing activity is recorded.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope Popup Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' or is empty">
- Ensure you have visited a webpage in the active tab that initiated network connections.
- Refresh the tab to trigger new network requests.
- Confirm that uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Check browser permissions do not block uBO Scope from accessing webRequest data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge count does not update correctly">
- Badge updates may have a slight delay; wait a few seconds after page loads.
- Reload the active tab if counts remain static.
- Close and reopen the popup panel.
- Ensure no conflicting extensions block uBO Scope’s access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Domain names appear encoded or unreadable">
- The extension decodes internationalized domain names using Punycode automatically.
- If a domain looks suspiciously encoded, ensure your browser supports Unicode rendering.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary
With this guide, you are equipped to:
- Open and understand the uBO Scope popup interface quickly.
- Interpret domain activity categorized by connection outcomes.
- Map the popup's domain counts to the toolbar badge for easy validation.
- Use visual cues to assess which third-party domains are allowed through, stealthily blocked, or fully blocked.

This tool empowers you with real-time, actionable visibility into your browser's third-party network interactions.
