# Interpreting Badge Counts

Understanding the toolbar badge count in uBO Scope is critical for interpreting your browser's real network exposure to third-party servers. This guide will walk you through what the badge represents, how the count is calculated, and why this number is essential in evaluating your privacy and content blocking effectiveness.

---

## 1. What the Badge Count Represents

The number displayed on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon reflects the count of **distinct third-party domains** your browser has connected with during the current browsing session for the active tab.

- **Third-party domains** are domains different from the website you are currently visiting.
- These connections represent actual network requests that were sent and responded to, independent of any content blocker’s intervention.

<u>**Why focus on distinct third-party domains?**</u> Because each unique domain contacted indicates a separate entity potentially receiving your data, revealing your network exposure footprint more transparently than generic block counts.

---

## 2. How the Count Is Calculated

uBO Scope tracks every network request using the browser's `webRequest` API, categorizing requests based on their outcome:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** Domains from which connections succeeded and were not blocked by any content blocker.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly blocked by content blockers or network policies.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains for which requests were redirected silently before the connection, a stealth method some blockers use to avoid detection by webpages.

The badge counts the total distinct domains among the **allowed** connections only.

### Key Points:

- The count represents the number of unique third-party domains that your browser successfully connected to.
- This count updates in real time as you browse.
- The domains are consolidated using the **public suffix list** to ensure proper domain boundaries (i.e., distinguishing `cdn.example.com` as a subdomain of `example.com`).

## 3. Why the Badge Count Matters

Many users mistakenly equate a higher block count or results from ad-blocker test pages with better privacy protections. uBO Scope’s badge count clarifies this misconception by focusing on what truly matters:

- **Lower badge numbers usually mean fewer third parties receiving your browsing data, indicating better privacy.**
- Block counts alone don’t indicate privacy effectiveness because blocking many trackers but still connecting to many distinct third-party servers can mean worse privacy.
- Test pages that simulate trackers don’t reflect the real-world connections your browser makes and are often irrelevant to actual privacy.

<u>**Example scenario:**</u>

- Extension A blocks 100 requests but you still connect to 30 distinct third-party domains.
- Extension B blocks only 50 requests but only lets 10 third-party domains connect.

Here, Extension B offers better privacy even with a lower block count because fewer unique third parties are contacted.

## 4. Best Practices to Interpret Badge Counts

- **Use the badge as a primary privacy indicator.** Prefer browsing situations where the badge count is low.
- **Consider context:** A legitimate site may load resources from common CDNs or trusted services, which is often unavoidable.
- **Monitor changes:** If browsing a site causes a spike in badge count, this signals many third parties are contacted.
- **Avoid relying solely on block counts or test websites** for privacy decisions.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Misconceptions

- **Pitfall:** Assuming a higher block count means better blocking.
  - *Reality:* More blocks might mean more attempts but not fewer connections overall.

- **Pitfall:** Trusting ad-blocker test web pages.
  - *Reality:* They often produce unrealistic network scenarios and cannot detect stealth blocking.

- **Pitfall:** Expecting uBO Scope to show all network activity.
  - *Reality:* Only connections visible through the browser’s `webRequest` API are reported; some native apps and system-level connections are not visible.

## 6. Verifying and Understanding Badge Counts in Practice

Follow these steps to check the badge count's practical meaning:

### Steps:

1. **Open uBO Scope on an active tab** by clicking the toolbar icon.
2. **View the popup UI**, which breaks down domains into allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked sections.
3. **Match the popup allowed domains count** with the badge count number.
4. **Browse to different websites** and observe how the badge number changes.
5. **Identify domain names** in the popup list to understand which third parties your browser connects to.

Expected result: The badge count should equal the number of distinct domains listed under "not blocked" in the popup UI.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues

- **Badge count remains at zero or does not update:**
  - Make sure the extension is properly installed and enabled.
  - Check that necessary permissions are granted (especially `webRequest` and `activeTab`).
  - Confirm the browser supports the required API (`webRequest` API is available and enabled).

- **Badge number does not correspond with popup data:**
  - Refresh the tab and reload uBO Scope’s popup.
  - Wait a few seconds for network request processing.

- **Unexpected high counts:**
  - Consider the site’s actual third-party dependencies.
  - Investigate if other extensions or network factors influence requests.

- **No domains shown in popup but badge is non-zero:**
  - This can happen transiently; close and reopen the popup.

## 8. Summary

The badge count on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon offers a **reliable, real-time view of your browser’s network exposure to third-party domains.** It improves privacy awareness by focusing on distinct, allowed domains, breaking through misleading block counts or simulated test scenarios.

Regularly monitoring and understanding this badge empowers you to make informed decisions about your browsing privacy.

<Tip>
Always remember: The quality of your privacy protection is better represented by the **number of distinct third-party servers your browser actually connects to**, not merely by how many requests an ad blocker claims to have blocked.
