2. Visit the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
3. Click **Add to Firefox**.

</Tip>

### Step 2: Enable and Pin the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

- Most browsers automatically enable extensions on installation. If not enabled, check your extensions settings to enable uBO Scope.
- Pin the extension icon to your toolbar for easy access:
  - In Chrome and Firefox, click the puzzle icon or extensions menu, then pin uBO Scope.
  - In Safari, enable the extension via Preferences > Extensions.

### Step 3: Open the uBO Scope Popup

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar.
2. The popup will load, displaying the current tab's connection data.
3. Initially, you may see "NO DATA" while the extension gathers network request information.
4. After a few moments, the domains connected and category sections (Not Blocked, Stealth-Blocked, Blocked) will populate.

### Step 4: Verify the Extension Is Running

- Look for a badge count number on the toolbar icon. This number represents distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the active tab.
- Ensure the popup displays domains under:
  - **Not Blocked:** third-party domains with successful connections.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** connections blocked silently by content blockers.
  - **Blocked:** explicitly blocked domains.
- Browse typical websites and observe that the badge number updates accordingly.

<Check>
If no badge shows or the popup remains empty after browsing, see the troubleshooting section below.
</Check>

### Step 5: Using uBO Scope in Multi-Browser Environments

- Install uBO Scope separately on each browser you use following the above steps.
- The extension’s performance and data are isolated per browser.
- You can compare connection profiles across browsers to evaluate differing content-blocking behaviors.

## 3. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Keep your browser updated** to meet uBO Scope’s minimum version requirements for optimal performance.
- **Allow a few seconds after navigation** for uBO Scope to collect data before expecting badge counts.
- **Refresh tabs** if connection data seems stale or missing.
- **Use a mix of sites** to observe how connection counts vary with different content.
- **Regularly update uBO Scope** via your browser’s extension update mechanism.
