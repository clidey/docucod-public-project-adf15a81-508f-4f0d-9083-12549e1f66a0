# Your First Network Inspection with uBO Scope

Discover how to use uBO Scope to inspect network requests on any webpage. This step-by-step guide will walk you through opening the popup panel, understanding the data presented, and identifying all third-party remote servers involved in network activity on your current browser tab.

---

## 1. Overview

### What You Will Achieve
This guide helps you learn how to inspect the network connections reported by uBO Scope for any active tab. You will:
- Access the popup panel showing third-party server connections.
- Distinguish allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked network requests.
- Recognize how many unique third-party domains a page is connecting to.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and activated in your browser.
- The extension’s toolbar icon visible and badge count displayed.
- A webpage loaded in an active tab you want to inspect.

### Expected Outcome
By completing these steps, you will confidently analyze network request outcomes and identify all distinct third-party domains your browser tab touches.

### Estimated Time
5 minutes or less.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner — no advanced technical knowledge required.

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate uBO Scope Icon and Badge">
To start, find the uBO Scope icon on your browser’s toolbar. The icon’s badge displays a number — the count of distinct third-party remote servers the current tab has connected to.

- A higher number means more third-party exposure.
- A zero or empty badge means no reported third-party connections.

**Success criteria:** Badge number visible and corresponds to your browsing session.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel">
Click the toolbar icon to open the uBO Scope popup.

- The popup header shows your current tab’s hostname and main domain.
- The summary section reports total distinct third-party domains connected.

**Success criteria:** Popup panel opens without delay, showing hostname and domain info.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Three Outcome Sections">
Inside the popup, you’ll find three categorized lists:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains that the browser successfully connected to.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains for which requests were redirected or stealthily handled.
- **Blocked:** Domains whose network requests were actively blocked or failed.

Browse each section by scrolling if needed. Each domain entry shows the domain name and the number of network requests.

**Success criteria:** Domain lists populated with correct counts; no empty sections unless genuinely no data.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret the Data for Real-World Insight">
Use the domain counts to understand the network behavior:

- Legitimate sites often connect to few third-party CDNs.
- Unexpected or many third-party domains may indicate trackers or ads.
- Presence of stealth-blocked domains suggests content blockers intervened silently.

**Success criteria:** Ability to distinguish benign content from possible trackers or unwanted connections.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Network Activity by Browsing">
Navigate to different pages or refresh the tab and observe badge updates.

- Badge number should update dynamically reflecting active connections.
- Popup panel content refreshes accordingly when reopened.

**Success criteria:** Real-time evidence of network changes; confirmation that uBO Scope tracks connections continuously.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Practical Example

Imagine you are visiting `example.com`.

1. Open uBO Scope popup; the heading shows `example.com` with main domain `example.com`.
2. The summary shows `domains connected: 5`, indicating 5 distinct third-party servers.
3. In 'Not Blocked', you see domains like `cdn.example.net` with a count of 12 requests — a typical CDN usage.
4. 'Stealth-Blocked' lists a domain like `ads.tracker.com` showing redirected requests, meaning uBO Scope detected stealth blocking.
5. 'Blocked' includes `analytics.badtracker.net` with 3 blocked requests.

This lets you conclude that while some connections are allowed (likely benign/CDN), others are blocked or stealth blocked (likely unwanted trackers).

## 4. Tips and Best Practices

- **Verify legitimate third-party domains:** Not all third parties are problematic; CDNs are common and usually necessary.
- **Use badge count as exposure indicator:** Lower numbers generally mean better privacy.
- **Refresh the popup often:** This ensures data reflects the latest network activity.
- **Combine with other content blocker insights:** Use uBO Scope data to validate claims of content blocker performance.

<Note>
The badge count represents *distinct* third-party domains connected, which provides a meaningful privacy-focused metric over simple request counts.
</Note>

## 5. Troubleshooting

### The Popup Panel Shows 'NO DATA'
- Ensure you have an active webpage open.
- Try refreshing the tab; data collection starts upon main frame load.
- Wait a few seconds, as uBO Scope processes network events asynchronously.

### The Badge is Empty or Missing
- Confirm uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Pin the extension icon to your toolbar for visibility.
- Browse websites that load remote resources to trigger network events.

### Domain Lists Are Empty
- This can happen if the page makes no third-party network requests.
- Some sites may cache resources locally, reducing network traffic.

<Warning>
Network requests made outside the browser's webRequest API scope cannot be detected by uBO Scope, potentially causing data gaps.
</Warning>

## 6. What Next?

After mastering your first inspection:
- Explore the [Interpreting the Popup Panel](https://example.com/guides/getting-started/understanding-popup) for detailed explanations of domain categories.
- Review [Validating Functionality](https://example.com/getting-started/first-use-and-validation/validating-functionality) to ensure full uBO Scope operations.
- Dive into advanced topics like [Comparing Content Blockers Factually](https://example.com/guides/advanced-usage/analyzing-content-blockers) to leverage uBO Scope in privacy assessments.
