# Your First Third-Party Network Inspection

Explore how to use the uBO Scope extension popup panel to monitor and understand third-party network connections on any webpage. This guide walks you through opening the popup, interpreting badge counts, reading domain lists, and offers practical tips for analyzing your first inspection.

---

## Overview

When you visit a webpage, your browser often connects to multiple remote servers beyond the site you requested—the so-called third-party servers. uBO Scope reveals these connections regardless of your content blockers. This guide helps you make sense of what you see in the uBO Scope popup panel so you can analyze your browser's network activity effectively.

### What You Will Learn

- How to open and navigate the uBO Scope popup panel
- Understanding counts on the toolbar badge
- Interpreting the Allowed, Stealth-blocked, and Blocked domain lists
- How to use this information to assess privacy and content blocker effectiveness

### Prerequisites

You must have uBO Scope installed and active in your supported browser. For installation instructions, refer to the relevant platform guide:

- [Install on Chromium-based Browsers](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/guides/getting-started/installation-setup/install-on-chrome.md)
- [Install on Firefox](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/guides/getting-started/installation-setup/install-on-firefox.md)
- [Install on Safari](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/guides/getting-started/installation-setup/install-on-safari.md)

Ensure you have visited a webpage after installation so that network requests have been recorded.

## Step-by-Step: Inspecting Your First Network Activity

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup Panel">
After navigating to any webpage, click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser's toolbar. This opens the popup panel where the network inspection data lives.

**Expected Result:**
You will see a panel titled with the current tab's hostname and a summary count of connected domains.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret the Toolbar Badge Count">
Look at the small badge number displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon. This number shows the count of distinct third-party domains from which allowed connections were made.

- A **lower badge count** generally indicates fewer third-party connections, which can mean better privacy.
- The badge updates in real-time as network requests occur in the active tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Read the Domain Summary">
Inside the popup panel, the "domains connected" number shows the total count of distinct domains for the current tab. This complements the badge count by giving an overall picture.

**Example:** If the badge shows 5, and the summary shows 8, the difference can be domains that were stealth blocked or blocked.
</Step>

<Step title="Explore the Domain Lists">
The panel classifies domains into three categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains to which the browser successfully connected. These are displayed first.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were intercepted before completion by stealth blocking techniques.
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed or were explicitly blocked.

Each list shows domains with counts indicating how many requests were made to each.

**Action:** Scan these lists to understand who your browser talks to when you visit a site.
</Step>

<Step title="Use the Domain Name Display to Your Advantage">
Domains are shown with Unicode decoding to make international domain names readable. The popup shows both the hostname (often a subdomain) and the registered domain for clarity.

**Tip:** Recognizing domain names can help you spot familiar services like CDNs, analytics, or potential trackers.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify on Popular Websites">
Try inspecting well-known websites like Wikipedia, YouTube, or news sites. Check which domains appear in the allowed vs. blocked lists.

**Observation:**
- Sites often contact a handful of key third-party domains.
- Stealth blocking is common for domains that try to redirect or fingerprint.
- Blocked domains represent connections your content blocker or browser denied.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices & Tips for First Inspections

- **Refresh the webpage** to see updated network activity reflected in the popup.
- Pay attention to the badge count: a sudden large number on unfamiliar sites may reveal excessive third-party tracking.
- Consider the difference between allowed and blocked domains to evaluate your content blocker's strictness.
- Use uBO Scope alongside other browser privacy tools for a comprehensive analysis.

<Note>
Not all third-party connections are harmful. Many legitimate services, such as content delivery networks (CDNs), authentication providers, or essential scripts, use third-party domains.
</Note>

<Warning>
Domains classified as "Stealth-Blocked" might suggest sophisticated evasion techniques by trackers trying to avoid detection. Understanding these requires deeper knowledge and possibly filter list maintenance.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Common Initial Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Your First Inspection">
<Accordion title="No Data or Blank Popup Panel">
- Ensure you have navigated to a webpage and not a new tab page.
- Refresh the page and then open the popup.
- Verify the extension is enabled and has necessary permissions (activeTab, webRequest).
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Installation and Startup](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting-support/common-issues.md) guide if problems persist.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- The badge updates after network requests complete; allow a few seconds after page load.
- Some browsers may delay updates; check your browser version compatibility.
- Make sure other extensions or browser settings are not blocking uBO Scope's data access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unexpected Large Number of Domains">
- Large numbers may indicate intense tracking on the site.
- Verify the content blocker is active and check if domains appear under blocked or stealth-blocked.
- Investigate specific domains using external tools if unsure.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup title="FAQ">
<Accordion title="What does the badge count represent exactly?">
The badge shows the count of distinct third-party domains that have allowed connections during the current browser tab's session. It helps quantify exposure to external servers.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are all listed third-party domains harmful?">
No. Many domains belong to necessary services such as CDNs or analytics providers which may be integral to website functionality. uBO Scope helps you see all, letting you decide.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is stealth-blocking?">
Stealth-blocking involves hiding blocking actions from webpages to avoid detection, typically by redirects or script modifications. uBO Scope reports these connections separately to highlight possible attempts at circumvention.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope block content or interfere with webpages?">
No. uBO Scope is a passive observer that monitors network requests but does not block or modify them directly.
</Accordion>

## Under the Hood: How uBO Scope Monitors Network Requests

For users curious about the mechanism, uBO Scope uses the browser's `webRequest` API to listen for all network requests your browser attempts. It classifies outcomes as:

- **Allowed:** Successful connections.
- **Stealth:** Redirected or intercepted requests.
- **Blocked:** Failed or explicitly blocked requests.

These are recorded per browser tab and summarized in the popup panel.

This data flow ensures you get an accurate, real-time snapshot of third-party network activity unrelated to the content blocking solutions you use.

*For more technical details on how data is collected and processed, see the [How uBO Scope Works](../../overview/product-architecture-and-workflows/how-ubo-scope-works.md) documentation.*

## Visual Guide Example

Below is an example snapshot of the popup panel after inspecting a news website:

- **Hostname:** news.example.com
- **Domains connected:** 12
- **Allowed:** cdn.example.com (5), images.example.net (3), analytics.tracker.com (1)
- **Stealth-blocked:** tracker.redirector.net (2)
- **Blocked:** ads.tracker.com (1)

Interpreting this:
- The site uses a few CDNs and image servers successfully.
- Two stealth-blocked connections likely indicate tracking attempts hidden from the page.
- One blocked domain is an ad server prevented from loading.

---

## Summary

Use uBO Scope to make informed privacy decisions by directly viewing your browser’s third-party connections. This guide serves as your first milestone to confidently navigate the popup UI and create meaningful insights from network data.
