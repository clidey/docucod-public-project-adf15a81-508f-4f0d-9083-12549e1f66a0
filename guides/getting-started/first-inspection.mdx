## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Open a Webpage

1. Launch your web browser where uBO Scope is installed.
2. Navigate to any webpage you want to inspect—for instance, a news site or popular web store.

<Check>
Choose a familiar website to make it easier to recognize usual connections.
</Check>

### Step 2: Observe the Toolbar Badge

- Look at the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- The badge displays a number representing **distinct third-party domains** your current tab has connected to.
- A higher number means more third-party connections, and a lower number often indicates a smaller exposure.

<Info>
Note that the badge count reflects allowed connections only, excluding blocked or stealth-blocked requests.
</Info>

### Step 3: Open the Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar to open the popup interface.
- The popup will load and display connection details grouped by outcome:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains your browser successfully connected to.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections redirected stealthily (hidden).
  - **Blocked**: Domains for which connections were blocked.

### Step 4: Understand the Popup Interface Details

- The headline shows the current tab’s hostname and domain.
- The **domains connected** count summarizes distinct third-party domains with allowed connections.
- Each section lists domains alongside how many times resources were requested from them.

### Step 5: Interpret Third-Party Connections

- The domains listed under **Not Blocked** are third-party servers your browser contacted during page load.
- Recognize common CDNs or trusted service providers (e.g., Akamai, Cloudflare domains).
- Use intuition and external lookup to flag unknown or suspicious domains.

<Tip>
If unsure about a domain, a quick web search can help verify its legitimacy. Many benign third parties support site functionality.
</Tip>

### Step 6: Refresh or Navigate to a New Site

- Closing or navigating away resets the context.
- The badge updates on each new page load to reflect active third-party domains.

<Warning>
Do not rely solely on block counts to determine privacy. The badge number corresponds to distinct servers contacted, providing a clearer picture of exposure.
</Warning>

## Practical Example: Inspecting a News Website

Imagine opening a popular news site. The uBO Scope badge shows **4**.

- You click the icon, and the popup lists domains like `cdn.example-cdn.com`, `ads.partner-site.com`, and `analytics.data.net` under **Not Blocked**.
- Recognize the CDN domain as legitimate; it delivers images and scripts.
- The analytics and advertising domains indicate tracking or third-party services.
- The popup also shows some blocked domains in the **Blocked** section, demonstrating the extension's protective action.

By reviewing these details, you understand your browsing footprint on this site and can decide if further content blocking measures are needed.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Why Is the Badge Not Updating?
- Verify that the extension is enabled and has permissions for the URL.
- The badge updates after network activity completes; wait a few seconds or reload the tab.

### The Popup Shows 'NO DATA'
- This indicates no network information was recorded for the current tab yet.
- Reload the page and try opening the popup shortly after.

### Count Appears High—Is This Bad?
- A high count means many third-party connections, which often correlates with greater exposure.
- Not all third parties are harmful; recognize known CDNs and essentials.

### Best Practice
- Regularly inspect sites you trust less or that may track heavily.
- Use uBO Scope data combined with content blockers for privacy tuning.
