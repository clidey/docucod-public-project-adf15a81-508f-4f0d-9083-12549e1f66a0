# Your First uBO Scope Session

Welcome to your first exploration with **uBO Scope**. This guide walks you through opening the uBO Scope popup interface and understanding the network connections your current web page is making. Whether you're new to network monitoring or privacy analysis, this step-by-step guide makes it easy to interpret the main popup panel, decipher domain categories, and grasp what allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections mean in real time.

---

## Workflow Overview

### What You'll Accomplish
- Open the uBO Scope popup for the active browser tab.
- Identify the current top-level domain being inspected.
- Explore and understand the lists of third-party domains categorized as 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'.
- Learn how to read the summary count of connected domains.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and active in your browser (compatible with Chrome v122+, Firefox v128+, Safari v18.5+).
- Active internet connection while browsing a webpage.
- The webpage tab you want to analyze must be open and active.

### Expected Result
By following this guide, you will clearly see:
- The hostname and domain of the current web page.
- A categorized listing of all remote connections made by that page to third-party servers.
- Counts of unique third-party domains contacted.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 5 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner-friendly.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
<p>Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. This action opens the popup window displaying network connection data related to the currently active tab.</p>
<p><Check>Success: The popup window appears showing connection stats for the active tab.</Check></p>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the Current Tab's Domain">
<p>At the top of the popup, locate the header which shows two parts: the <em>hostname</em> (left) and the <em>effective domain</em> (right). For example, if the URL is <code>https://news.example.com</code>, you will see 'news' on the left and 'example.com' on the right.</p>
<p>This confirms which page's network requests are being monitored.</p>
<p><Tip>This uses the Public Suffix List to accurately determine domains, even for complex or country-code top-level domains.</Tip></p>
<p><Check>Success: The header clearly identifies your current tab's domain.</Check></p>
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret the Summary Count">
<p>Under the header, you will find a summary displaying:<br><strong>domains connected: X</strong></p>
<p>This number reflects the count of distinct third-party domains that the active page connected to and were <em>allowed</em> (not blocked) by uBO Scope.</p>
<p><Warning>Note: A lower count is generally better as it means fewer third-party connections.</Warning></p>
<p><Check>Success: You see a numerical count matching the number of allowed third-party domains.</Check></p>
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Categorized Domain Lists">
<p>Below the summary, the popup panel presents three distinct sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>not blocked</strong>: Lists third-party domains successfully connected.</li>
<li><strong>stealth-blocked</strong>: Domains where network requests were stealthily blocked (blocked without explicit page errors).</li>
<li><strong>blocked</strong>: Domains where requests were explicitly blocked, typically resulting in errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each section displays domains with a count of how many requests were made to that domain.</p>
<p><Tip>Pay special attention to stealth-blocked domains as these indicate subtle blocking actions which might not be obvious otherwise.</Tip></p>
<p><Check>Success: Domains categorized correctly into the three sections, with request counts clearly shown.</Check></p>
</Step>

<Step title="Browse Real Examples to Understand Behavior">
<p>To get practical insight, try the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit a popular news or e-commerce site.</li>
<li>Open the uBO Scope popup to observe how many distinct third-party connections are made.</li>
<li>Note which domains appear in each category. Many legitimate CDN or service domains will appear under 'not blocked'.</li>
<li>Observe if any advertising or tracking domains appear under 'stealth-blocked' or 'blocked'.</li>
</ul>
<p><Check>Success: You can distinguish between allowed and blocked connections, strengthening your understanding of how uBO Scope interprets network requests.</Check></p>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Popup Interface

| Section           | Description                                                                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Header**        | Shows the current tab’s hostname and main domain, enabling you to confirm which webpage’s connections you are viewing. |
| **Summary Count** | Displays the number of distinct third-party domains allowed for the current tab, reflecting network connection breadth.         |
| **Not Blocked**   | Lists all third-party domains contacted where resource loading was successful or explicitly allowed.                     |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains where requests were silently blocked by content blockers or filters (no visible errors on the webpage).               |
| **Blocked**       | Domains where network requests failed due to explicit blocking or errors.                                         |

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Refresh the Popup**: If nothing shows or data looks stale, close and reopen the popup. uBO Scope collects data live as you browse.
- **Understand Counts**: Counts next to each domain reflect how many requests targeted that domain in the tab session.
- **Interpreting Stealth Blocking**: Domains in this category may have requests blocked silently; they often reveal hidden trackers.
- **Lower Counts Are Better**: The fewer third-party domains connected, the more privacy you have.
- **Use for Privacy Audits**: Regularly opening the popup while browsing reveals real-world third-party connections, helping audit blockers.

<Warning>Remember that some network requests may not appear if the browser doesn’t expose them via the webRequest API, especially with newer stealthy blocking techniques.</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues Opening or Viewing the Popup">
<Accordion title="Popup Does Not Display or Shows 'NO DATA'">
- Ensure the current tab is fully loaded.
- Make sure uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled.
- Click the browser action icon in the active tab.
- Reload the current webpage and retry.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Lists Are Empty or Not Updating">
- Close and reopen the popup to refresh data.
- Verify if another content blocker is interfering.
- Check browser permissions for uBO Scope (especially access to tabs and webRequest API).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Counts Seem Incorrect or Surprising">
- Understand counts reflect requests observed since the tab was opened or last data reset.
- Some domains may overlap as subdomains or CDNs.
- Review related documentation on domain grouping and the Public Suffix List for precision.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
