# Understanding the Popup: A User Interface Tour

Welcome to the **uBO Scope** popup interface guide. This page walks you through the popup panel that appears when you click the extension icon in your browser toolbar. You'll learn how to interpret the displayed information about network connections initiated by the current tab, with clear distinctions between allowed, stealth-blocked, and explicitly blocked domains.

---

## 1. Overview of the Popup Panel

The popup offers a real-time snapshot of remote domains connected to by the active browser tab. It shows how many distinct domains were contacted and categorizes them based on how the extension reported connection outcomes.

### What You See in the Popup

- **Hostname Display**: At the top, the popup prominently shows the current tab's hostname and its primary domain name, helping you quickly identify which site’s connections you are viewing.
- **Summary Section**: Displays the total count of distinct domains contacted during the browsing session.
- **Three Outcome Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains that successfully connected without blocking.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains that were blocked silently by stealth mechanisms.
  - **Blocked**: Domains explicitly blocked due to errors or request failures.

Each section lists domains with the count of times each domain appeared in connection attempts.

---

## 2. Popup Panel Sections Explained

### 2.1 Hostname and Domain Header

- The header shows two spans:
  - The first span shows the subdomain part of the tab’s hostname if present.
  - The second span displays the main (registrable) domain.

This distinction clarifies exactly which site context you are monitoring.

### 2.2 Summary: Domains Connected

- Displays a count representing the number of **unique third-party domains** contacted by the current tab, aggregated across all outcomes.
- This count reflects the number of distinct remote servers your browser tried to reach, a critical privacy and network visibility metric.

### 2.3 Outcome Sections

#### Not Blocked (Allowed)
- Shows domains for which network requests succeeded.
- These are remote servers your browser was able to connect to and fetch content from.
- The domains are sorted alphabetically for easy navigation.
- Each domain has a badge displaying how many requests targeted it.

#### Stealth-Blocked
- Contains domains that were blocked using stealth techniques.
- These requests never reached the network but were silently prevented, a behavior typical of advanced content blockers aiming to avoid detection and webpage breakage.
- Listing these helps users understand hidden blocking activity beyond explicit errors.

#### Blocked
- Lists domains where network requests failed or were explicitly blocked and reported as errors.
- This section helps identify domains the extension or browser actively prevented from connecting.
- Like the others, domains are alphabetically sorted with request counts.

## 3. Navigating and Interpreting Domain Listings

- **Domain Names**: Shown in Unicode format to handle internationalized domain names correctly.
- **Request Counts**: The badge next to each domain shows the number of connection attempts.
- The list provides insights into third-party services involved during your browsing, useful for privacy auditing and network troubleshooting.

### Practical User Flow

1. Open the popup while on the tab you want to inspect.
2. Note the hostname displayed — verify you are viewing the right context.
3. Check the domains connected count to gauge third-party exposure.
4. Review each outcome section to understand which domains were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
5. Use this information to decide if content filtering or privacy tools need adjustment.

---

## 4. Tips and Best Practices

- **Regularly Check the Popup**: Keep an eye on third-party domains on sensitive websites to detect unexpected connections.
- **Use the Counts**: Domains with high request counts may indicate frequent resource loading or tracking activity.
- **Understand Stealth Blocking**: Recognize stealth-blocked domains as hidden protection, not necessarily a problem.
- **Correlate With Badge Count**: The popup domains and badge number together give a comprehensive understanding of network activity.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Popup Shows "NO DATA" or Empty Domains
- Ensure the active tab’s content is fully loaded.
- Confirm uBO Scope permissions are granted and the extension is enabled.
- Verify the browser supports the required `webRequest` events with your current version.

### Counts or Domains Seem Incorrect
- The extension accumulates data during the browsing session; reloading the page or switching tabs resets the data.
- Network activity outside the browser’s control or through unsupported protocols may not be captured.

### Popup Layout Issues
- If the popup looks broken or clipped, try resizing the browser window or reloading the extension.
- Dark/light mode support is automatic as per your system settings.

## 6. How This Popup Fits Into uBO Scope Workflow

The popup is your window into uBO Scope's measurement of network requests:

- It complements the badge indicator on the toolbar, offering detailed breakdowns.
- It helps validate the effectiveness of your content blocking and privacy setup.
- It supports filter list maintainers and privacy-focused users in transparent monitoring.

For installation and initial setup, see the [Installation Guide](/guides/getting-started/install-setup).
For interpreting badge counts and domain lists more deeply, consult [Interpreting Badge Numbers and Domain Lists](/guides/workflows-usage/interpreting-badge).

## Summary

The uBO Scope popup is your real-time dashboard into third-party network activity for the current browser tab. Each domain listed is categorized by connection outcome — allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked — with counts showing activity prominence. This enables instant, actionable insights into your browsing privacy and security.

---

<Tip>
For best results, open the extension popup while actively browsing, and refresh the tab when testing new content blocker settings to reflect updated network activities accurately.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Remember that some stealth-blocked domains may not appear in your network panel outside the extension, since they are intentionally hidden from webpages to improve stealthiness and reduce disruption.
