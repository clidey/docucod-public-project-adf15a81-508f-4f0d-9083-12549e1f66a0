# Viewing Your First Third-Party Connection Insights

Discover how to use uBO Scope’s popup interface to unlock real-time, actionable insights about third-party network connections made by your browser as you visit websites.

---

## Overview

This guide walks you through a typical user journey: opening the uBO Scope extension after navigating to a webpage, understanding the badge count on the toolbar icon, and interpreting the categorized domain connection statistics shown in the extension's popup. By following these practical steps, you will learn how to quickly grasp which remote servers your browser has contacted — whether connections were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

### What You Will Achieve

- Understand the meaning and significance of the badge count displayed on the uBO Scope icon.
- Learn how to access and read the popup interface's domain connection data.
- Become familiar with the categories: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** connections.
- Gain practical knowledge to evaluate third-party network activity for better privacy awareness.

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope extension installed and enabled on your supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- You have visited at least one website in the active tab.
- The extension has the necessary permissions (`webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab`).

### Time Commitment

Approximately 5 minutes to open the popup and explore the basic insights.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner — ideal for users new to network activity inspection and privacy tools.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Notice the Badge Count on the Toolbar Icon

1. After loading a webpage, look at the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. Observe the **badge number** displayed over the icon.
   - This number represents the **count of distinct third-party domains** your browser connected to.
   - A lower count indicates fewer third-party connections, often implying better privacy.

<Check>
Always interpret the badge count as the **number of unique third-party domains contacted and allowed**, not simply blocked requests.
</Check>

### Step 2: Open the uBO Scope Popup

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar.
2. The popup will appear, displaying detailed network insights related to the current active tab.

### Step 3: Read the Current Tab Information

At the top, you will see:

- The **hostname** of the current tab’s top-level site.
- Its associated **domain** (based on the Public Suffix List).

> Example: If the hostname is `sub.example.com`, the domain shown will be `example.com`.

### Step 4: Interpret the Domains Connected Summary

- This section shows the total number of distinct domains contacted by the current tab.
- The number here corresponds to those counted on the badge.

### Step 5: Explore the Domain Connection Categories

The popup divides connection outcomes into three clear sections:

#### 1. Not Blocked
- Domains from which connections were successful and allowed.
- These are third-party services the browser actually communicated with.
- Typically includes Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), analytics platforms, or other legit third-party services.

#### 2. Stealth-Blocked
- Domains where connection attempts were stealthily blocked.
- These connections may not be visible or obvious to the webpage but blocked by network filtering.
- Useful to understand subtle blocking behavior that doesn’t trigger obvious failures.

#### 3. Blocked
- Domains from which connection attempts were explicitly blocked and failed.
- Indicates third-party servers prevented from connecting due to your content blockers or browser policies.

Each category shows a list of domains alongside the number of requests made to them.

### Step 6: Recognize Domain Names in Unicode

- Domains are displayed in their **Unicode form** when applicable for readability.
- For example, `xn--example-ova.com` is shown as `exämple.com`.

### Step 7: Refresh and Verify

- Load or reload different websites in your browser tabs.
- Click the uBO Scope icon each time to observe changes in badge counts and popup data.
- Notice how third-party connections differ per site, giving you clear, actionable insights.

## Real-World Examples

| Website Example         | Expected Domain Counts & Categories    | Explanation                               |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| News site with ads      | 5-10 third-party domains allowed      | Includes CDNs, ad servers, analytics      |
| Privacy-focused blog    | 1-3 domains, mostly allowed or stealth | Minimal third-parties, some stealth blocked|
| E-commerce site         | Higher counts, multiple categories    | Payment gateways, analytics, tracking     |

## Tips & Best Practices

- Remember, a lower badge count typically means fewer third-party contacts and better privacy.
- Do not assume a high block count alone means better blocking quality; focus on allowed third-party connections.
- Use the popup regularly to monitor network connections for unusual or unexpected domains.
- Cross-reference domains listed with known tracker or ad-blocking lists for informed decisions.
