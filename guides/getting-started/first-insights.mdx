# Interpreting the Popup and Domain Connections

This guide helps you understand and effectively use the **uBO Scope** popup panel to visualize and interpret the domain connection statistics for the currently active web page. You will learn how to read the badge counts, differentiate between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains, and grasp what these various connection outcomes mean for your privacy and security.

---

## 1. Overview of the Popup Panel

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup panel appears displaying a summary of the remote server connections your active browser tab has made or attempted. This panel categorizes domains based on the connection outcome to help you clearly see which third-party servers your browser connected to, which were blocked, and which were stealth-blocked.

### What You See in the Popup:

- **Tab Hostname and Domain**: The panel header shows the current tab's hostname and domain, helping you identify the page being analyzed.

- **Domains Connected Summary**: A total count of unique domains connected or contacted is prominently displayed.

- **Outcome Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains that your browser successfully connected to.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains which were indirectly or stealthily blocked, such as those blocked via redirects or other stealth techniques.
  - **Blocked**: Domains explicitly blocked during the page load.

Each domain entry is accompanied by a badge count indicating the number of requests or connection attempts associated with that domain within the current page context.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before diving into interpreting the popup, ensure:

- You have **installed and enabled uBO Scope** in your browser (Chromium, Firefox, or Safari supported).
- You are viewing a tab with active network requests (ideally a webpage that includes third-party content).
- The browser permissions for uBO Scope include access to monitor network requests (`webRequest` permission).

If these conditions are not met, the popup may show 'NO DATA' or incomplete information.

## 3. How to Use the Popup Panel Step-by-Step

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar to open the popup panel for the current tab.

The popup loads and displays the hostname and domain of the active tab along with connection statistics.
</Step>

<Step title="Understand the Hostname and Domain Display">
Look at the top heading:

- The hostname is the full domain of the page (may show subdomains).
- The domain is the registered or base domain portion (e.g., example.com).

This differentiation helps you understand the network reach relevant to the page.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Total Connected Domains Count">
Under the summary section, find the total number of distinct domains contacted by the web page.

A lower number generally indicates fewer third-party connections, often implying better privacy.
</Step>

<Step title="Explore Connection Outcomes">
The popup divides domains into three categories. Each section lists domains and badge counts:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains your browser successfully established network connections with.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains that were blocked indirectly, such as by redirects or stealth blocking.
- **Blocked**: Domains explicitly blocked by content blockers or browser policies.

Click each domain to view the exact number of connection attempts.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Badge Counts">
The small numeric badges next to domains represent how many network requests went to that domain.

Higher counts indicate more activity from that domain on the page.

This helps you assess the concentration or spread of connections.
</Step>

<Step title="Use the Domain Lists to Assess Privacy Exposure">
Consider the following:

- Domains in **Not Blocked** are those your browser communicates with directly. Review them to understand which third parties are involved.
- **Blocked** domains highlight what content blockers or security policies prevented.
- **Stealth-blocked** domains are subtle blockers that prevented connections through indirect means.

This insight helps you validate your privacy settings and content block configurations.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Practical Examples

### Example Scenario:
You visit a news website and open uBO Scope's popup.

- The **Not Blocked** section shows `cdn.example-cdn.com` and `analytics.example.com` with badge counts 3 and 5.
- The **Blocked** section shows `trackers.example-tracker.com` with badge count 12.
- The **Stealth-Blocked** section lists `ads.example-ads.com` with 2.

**Interpretation:**

- Your browser connected successfully to the CDN and analytics servers — typically necessary for site functionality and allowed third parties.
- The tracker was blocked from connecting frequently, confirming your filters are active.
- Ads were stealth-blocked, indicating your blockers are actively preventing indirect ad requests.

You can trust the content blocker is working as intended while knowing which connections remain allowed.

## 5. Tips and Best Practices

- **Routinely check the popup panel** after loading sensitive or unfamiliar sites to verify which third parties are contacted.
- **Use the badge count as an indicator of third-party exposure** — aim for a low count for better privacy.
- **Understand that some allowed connections (e.g., popular CDNs) are generally harmless** and needed for site performance.
- **Stealth-blocked connections reveal advanced blocking techniques** that happen behind the scenes; these provide an additional layer of privacy.
- **If the popup shows 'NO DATA', reload the tab and verify that uBO Scope is active and has permissions.**

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### Pitfall: The popup shows "NO DATA" or no domain lists
- Ensure the tab you are viewing has fully loaded network requests.
- Confirm uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (`webRequest`).
- Reload the page and click the popup again.
- Verify the extension is enabled and active.

### Pitfall: Badge count is zero but you believe third-party connections exist
- The badge count only reflects successful non-blocked domains.
- Connections blocked at the network or DNS level outside the browser may not be reflected.
- Some stealth blocking may reduce visible connection counts.

### Pitfall: Unexpectedly high counts or many unknown domains
- Investigate domains carefully, as high counts may indicate heavy tracking.
- Consider adding or adjusting content blocker rules to reduce unwanted connections.

## Summary

The uBO Scope popup is your window into the live network activity of the active tab, visually organizing domains by connection outcome. By using badge counts and segregated domain lists, it empowers you to see exactly what third-party servers are involved and assess your privacy exposure in real time.

Use this guide to confidently interpret every detail in the popup panel and make informed decisions about content blocking and network privacy.
