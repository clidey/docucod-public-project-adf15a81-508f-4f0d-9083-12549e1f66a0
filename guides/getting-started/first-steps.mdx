# First Steps: Exploring the Popup Interface

## Overview
This guide leads you through exploring the uBO Scope popup interface — your window into understanding the real-time network connections initiated by the active browser tab. You will learn how to interpret domain connection statistics, use the toolbar badge effectively, and differentiate between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

---

## Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and enabled on your supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
- Ensure the extension has the necessary permissions granted (activeTab, storage, webRequest).
- You should have visited at least one webpage in the active tab to generate network activity.
- Familiarity with basic web browsing and opening browser extension popups.

---

## What You Will Achieve
By following this guide, you will confidently navigate the popup interface, understand the implications of domain connection categories shown, and effectively use the toolbar badge to monitor third-party connections from the current tab.

## Estimated Time
5 to 10 minutes

## Understanding the Popup Interface

The uBO Scope popup provides a categorized view of network connections related to the active browser tab. It is broken down into three core sections:

1. **Allowed Domains**: Third-party domains from which network connections succeeded, meaning data requests reached the server and returned successfully.
2. **Stealth-Blocked Domains**: Domains for which connection attempts were redirected or altered quietly by content blockers or network layers.
3. **Blocked Domains**: Domains for which network requests were explicitly blocked, either by uBO Scope’s underlying content blocker or other system components.

Additionally, the popup header displays the **tab’s hostname and domain**, providing context about the site you’re observing.

## Step-by-Step: Exploring the Popup UI

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Open your browser toolbar and click the uBO Scope icon to launch the popup interface. This action displays current network activity for the tab in focus.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify the Active Tab’s Domain">
Look at the top header to see the tab's full hostname and root domain in Unicode format. This clarifies which webpage's network activity you are inspecting.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the 'Domains Connected' Summary">
Near the top, check the "domains connected" count. This number represents how many distinct third-party domains your active tab has successfully connected to.
</Step>

<Step title="Explore Each Domain Category">
Expand the three main sections:
- **not blocked (allowed)**: Lists third-party domains with successful connections and the count of requests for each.
- **stealth-blocked**: Shows domains where redirections or stealth blocking occurred without explicit blocking notifications.
- **blocked**: Shows domains whose connection attempts were blocked outright.

Each domain is paired with a request count badge indicating its number of connection attempts.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Connection Counts and Behavior">
Use domain counts to gauge the volume of interaction with each third party. Higher counts mean more frequent resource requests.
</Step>

<Step title="Relate Toolbar Badge to Popup Data">
The toolbar icon's badge number matches the count of distinct allowed domains shown.
This real-time link helps you quickly assess network exposure per tab without opening the popup.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Low badge count is good**: Fewer distinct third-party domains imply reduced exposure.
- **Distinguish 'stealth-blocked' from 'blocked'**: Stealth-blocking indicates network requests were silently redirected or manipulated, often by advanced content blockers for stealth operation.
- **Refresh popup to update stats**: Close and reopen the popup or switch tabs to see latest data reflecting current network states.
- **Use domain unicode display for clarity**: Punycoded international domain names are converted back to readable format for easier recognition.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting the Popup Interface">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Sections">
This typically means no network activity has been captured for the active tab yet.

**Action:**
- Browse to a new website and trigger page reload.
- Confirm the toolbar badge updates with a count.
- Retry opening the popup.
- Ensure extension permissions and host permissions are correctly granted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Toolbar Badge Number Does Not Match Popup Count">
The badge reflects the count of allowed domains only. Popup sections include stealth-blocked and blocked domains as well, so their counts can differ.

**Action:**
- Understand the badge is a quick indicator of allowed third-party domains.
- Popup provides a full breakdown including stealth and blocked domains.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Does Not Appear or Is Blank on Click">
Possible browser UI glitch or extension error.

**Action:**
- Restart browser.
- Verify extension is enabled.
- Update uBO Scope to the latest version.
- Refer to Quick Validation & Troubleshooting guide if issues persist.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Real-World Example

Imagine visiting 'example.com', a news site that loads embedded videos, third-party ads, and fonts.

- The toolbar badge shows "6", meaning six distinct third-party domains were allowed connections.
- Opening the popup reveals:
  - Allowed domains include content delivery networks and trackers.
  - Stealth-blocked domains might include advertising domains silently redirected.
  - Blocked domains could be known ad servers your content blocker stopped.

This immediate visibility equips you to understand your network exposure at a glance.
