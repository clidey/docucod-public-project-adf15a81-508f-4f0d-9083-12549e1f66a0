# First Steps: Analyzing a Webpage with uBO Scope

This guide walks you through inspecting the network connections that any webpage makes using uBO Scope. You will learn how to open the extension's popup panel, understand the information presented there, and interpret key indicators such as the badge count and domain analysis.

---

## 1. Overview of the Network Connections Panel

uBO Scope provides a real-time, detailed summary of all remote server connections initiated by the webpage open in your browser tab. The data is displayed through a popup panel accessed from the toolbar icon.

### What This Guide Covers
- How to open the uBO Scope popup panel for the active tab
- Understanding the information displayed regarding network connections
- Interpreting the badge count on the browser toolbar
- Recognizing the different connection outcome categories

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and enabled in your browser
- Browser tab actively loaded with the webpage you want to analyze
- Permissions granted for the extension to access network requests

### Expected Outcome
After completing this guide, you will confidently use the popup panel to monitor network activity per webpage and extract meaningful insights from the connection data.

---

## 2. Accessing the Network Connections Popup

Begin by navigating to the webpage you want to inspect. The uBO Scope extension icon is located in your browser's toolbar.

### Steps to Open the Popup
1. **Locate the uBO Scope Icon** in the browser toolbar. The icon represents the extension.
2. **Click the Icon** to open the connection summary popup panel for the active tab.

<Tip>
If the popup does not appear or shows 'NO DATA', refresh the page and wait a few moments for uBO Scope to collect connection information.
</Tip>

### What You’ll See
- The _hostname section_ at the top shows the main domain of the tab's webpage.
- A summary count of distinct domains connected to.
- Three outcome sections categorizing connections by their final status:
  - **Not Blocked**: Connections that the browser allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections blocked silently or stealthily.
  - **Blocked**: Connections explicitly blocked.

---

## 3. Understanding the Information Displayed

### Hostname and Domain
- The **hostname** displays the full domain of the active webpage.
- The portion of the hostname before the public suffix (main domain) is shown separately for clarity.

### Domains Connected
- The **domains connected** summary shows how many distinct domains the webpage has attempted network communication with.
- This number counts unique third-party remote servers contacted.

### Connection Outcomes
Each connection outcome category lists the domains with which connections were attempted, along with how many requests were made:

| Outcome          | Definition                                                    | Usage Note                                    |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked      | Connections successfully allowed and made by the browser      | Indicates live third-party servers used       |
| Stealth-Blocked  | Connections blocked in a manner not visible to the webpage    | Useful to detect silent blocking behavior     |
| Blocked          | Connections explicitly blocked by content blockers or errors  | Helps identify blocked third-parties          |

Domains are listed in alphabetical order in each category with a count badge showing the number of connections.

### Badge Count Meaning
- The numeric badge on the uBO Scope toolbar icon reports the count of **distinct third-party domains** with allowed connections.
- A lower badge count typically represents fewer third-party servers contacted, which could indicate better privacy or less third-party content.

<Info>
The badge count updates dynamically as you navigate tabs or reload pages.
</Info>

## 4. Step-by-Step Walkthrough Example

Let’s apply the above steps in a realistic scenario.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Your Webpage">
Open any website you want to analyze in your browser.
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar. The popup panel appears displaying the hostname and a summary count.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Connection Categories">
Observe the domains listed under `not blocked`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked`.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Badge Count">
Look at the badge number on the icon — this reflects how many unique allowed third-party domains the webpage communicates with.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## 5. Best Practices & Tips

- **Refresh the page** if the popup shows no data to ensure network events are captured.
- **Use the badge count as a quick privacy indicator** — more allowed domains means more third-party connections.
- **Check stealth-blocked domains** to detect subtle network request blocking not obvious to webpages.
- **Distinguish between hostname and domain** — the domain is the public suffix plus one label (e.g., example.com), which helps group related subdomains.

<Warning>
The information reflects only network requests visible through the browser’s webRequest API. Some network activity outside this API scope will not appear.
</Warning>

## 6. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Network Connections Popup">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Blank">
- Make sure the webpage is loaded and active.
- Reload the page to trigger network event collection.
- Verify uBO Scope is enabled properly and has permissions.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
- Wait a few seconds after page load — badge updates are batched.
- Confirm you are viewing the correct browser tab.
- Restart the browser if the issue persists.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
