# First Steps and Basic Usage

## Overview
This guide walks you through the essential first steps to activate uBO Scope, open its user interface, and interpret the key indicator that informs your browsing privacy: the distinct third-party remote server count badge. You will gain practical insight into what the numbers mean and how to use the popup window to understand your browsing connections.

## Prerequisites
- You have uBO Scope installed on a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari). For installation guidance, see the [Installing uBO Scope](../getting-started/installing-extension) guide.
- The extension is activated and permissions have been granted.
- You are browsing a website or web application where network connection data can be gathered.

## Expected Outcome
- Confirmed activation of uBO Scope.
- Access to the popup interface showing domain connection categories.
- Understanding of the badge count as the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected.

## Time Estimate
Approximately 5 minutes.

## Difficulty Level
Beginner — no technical knowledge required.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Confirm Extension Activation
1. Launch your browser and ensure uBO Scope has been installed.
2. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your toolbar. It typically appears as a shield or scope icon.
3. Observe the badge (number) superimposed on the icon:
   - The number indicates how many distinct third-party remote servers your active tab has connected to.
   - No badge or zero means no third-party connections detected or all connections blocked.

**What You Should See:**
- A numeric badge on the uBO Scope toolbar icon when you visit websites.

<Tip>
If the badge is missing, verify your installation and permissions as explained in the [Activation and First Run](../getting-started/installation-and-setup/activation-and-first-run) guide.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Open the Popup Interface
1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar.
2. The popup window appears, showing a summary and detailed domain connection lists.

**Popup Layout Includes:**
- **Top Header:** Shows the current tab hostname and domain.
- **Summary Section:** Displays total connected domains count.
- **Three Domain Lists:**
  - *Not Blocked* (allowed connections)
  - *Stealth-Blocked* (connections blocked stealthily)
  - *Blocked* (connections explicitly blocked)

**What You Should See:**
- A count of domains connected by your current tab.
- Lists populated according to connection outcome.

<Tip>
The popup updates live as you browse to reflect fresh data per tab.
</Tip>

---

### Step 3: Understand the Badge Count Meaning
1. Recall the badge number represents the count of **distinct third-party domains** your tab has connected to successfully (not blocked).
2. Third parties are servers whose domains differ from the website's main domain.
3. A lower number signifies fewer external parties possibly tracking or serving content.
4. The detailed popup breaks down connections into:
   - **Not Blocked:** Domains where network connections succeeded.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections blocked silently to avoid breakage or detection by the site.
   - **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked by content blockers or network rules.

<Tip>
The badge count excludes first-party domains and only counts unique third-party domains.
</Tip>

---

### Step 4: Explore Connection Details
1. In the popup, review each domain listed under the three categories.
2. Each domain row shows the domain name and a count badge indicating how many requests went to that domain.
3. Use this data to identify potentially unwanted network activity.

**Example Scenario:**
- If you visit a news site and see many third-party domains under *Not Blocked*, consider whether all are necessary.
- Domains under *Blocked* reflect what your content blocker prevented.
- *Stealth-Blocked* may indicate connections hidden from the webpage but still monitored by uBO Scope.

---

## Verification & Troubleshooting

### Verify Data is Reporting
- Visit a site known to have external resources (e.g., a common news or social media site).
- Observe the extension badge updating with a numeric count.
- Open the popup and see domain entries populate.

### Common Issues
- **No badge or zero connections when expected:** Extension may be inactive or lacking permissions.
- **Empty popup even when badge shows count:** A popup refresh glitch; close and reopen the popup.
- **Badge never updates:** Browser or extension needs restart.

For detailed troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../getting-started/configuration-and-validation/setup-troubleshooting).

---

## Best Practices & Tips
- Use the badge as a quick privacy metric: fewer third-party connections means less exposure.
- Review the popup domain lists to audit third-party servers.
- Understand that some legitimate sites use multiple CDNs or APIs, which appear as multiple third parties.
- Combine insights from uBO Scope with your content blocker settings for optimal safety.

---

## Next Steps
- Explore the [Basic Configuration](../getting-started/configuration-and-validation/basic-configuration) guide to learn about default settings and permissions.
- Read [Understanding Connection Data and Badge Count](../guides/analyzing-connections/understanding-data) for deep dives into interpreting results.
- For new users, proceed to [Getting Started Quick Tour](../overview/user_journeys_usecases/quickstart_overview) for a broader walkthrough.
