# Understanding the Popup Panel

Get acquainted with uBO Scope's popup interface—the key to monitoring your browser's third-party network connections in real time. This guide explains each section of the popup panel, the icons you’ll see, and how to interpret connection statistics for the active browser tab.

---

## 1. What You Will Achieve

- **Understand the structure and layout** of the popup panel.
- **Learn the meaning of each section and icon** to interpret connection data correctly.
- **Gain confidence** in reading allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connection statistics per active tab.


## 2. Prerequisites

- uBO Scope extension installed in your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser.
- The browser tab you wish to inspect is active and loaded.
- Familiarity with basic browsing and extension usage.


## 3. Overview of the Popup Panel Layout

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup panel opens showing connection details specific to the active browser tab.

### 3.1 Header: Current Tab Hostname

- Displays the **hostname** of the active tab’s main document.
- If the hostname contains subdomains, the subdomain part is shown separately from the main domain.

### 3.2 Summary Section

- Shows the total number of **distinct domains connected** to by the active tab.
- This number reflects third-party network requests that were _not_ blocked.

### 3.3 Outcome Sections

The popup divides connection information into three distinct outcome categories, each with its own section:

| Section           | Description                                                                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**   | Domains where network requests were allowed and completed successfully.                   |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains where connections were stealth-blocked—requests were internally redirected but not visibly blocked by your content blockers. |
| **Blocked**       | Domains where network requests were explicitly blocked or failed (errors occurred).       |

Each section lists connected domains alongside the count of requests made to each domain.

### 3.4 Domain Rows

- Each domain appears as a row with:
  - The **domain name** (converted from punycode to Unicode if applicable).
  - The **count badge** showing how many times the domain was contacted.


## 4. Step-by-Step: Using the Popup Panel

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon next to your browser’s address bar to open the popup panel.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the Active Tab's Hostname">
Look at the header at the top to verify the domain of the current page you are monitoring.

- The first part (if visible) shows subdomains.
- The second part is the main domain.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Summary">
Check the 'domains connected' value—this indicates the total distinct third-party domains contacted during the page load and active browsing.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Allowed Connections">
Expand or scroll to the **Not Blocked** section and see domains where connections succeeded. These are allowed third-party resources.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Stealth-Blocked Domains">
In the **Stealth-Blocked** section, observe domains that were redirected internally by blockers. These don't appear as blocked but were silently handled.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Blocked Connections">
Finally, look at the **Blocked** section for domains where requests failed or were explicitly blocked by your content blockers.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 5. Practical Interpretation Tips

- A **lower ‘domains connected’ summary number** is generally better — fewer third-party exposures.
- The **presence of domains under ‘Blocked’** confirms your content blockers actively prevented network requests.
- **‘Stealth-Blocked’ domains might be invisible otherwise**, showing you hidden connection manipulation.
- Use the **count badges** to see which domains are contacted most frequently, helping identify prominent third-party services.


## 6. Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Website, Many Allowed Domains
If you see a high count under **Not Blocked**, the site is requesting many third-party resources allowed by your current blocking rules. Consider reviewing whether stricter blocking is desirable.

### Scenario 2: Stealth Blocking Is Active
Domains appearing only under **Stealth-Blocked** indicate connections your blockers redirected internally to maintain page functionality while preventing tracking.

### Scenario 3: Zero or No Data in Popup
- The **hostname header shows "NO DATA"** or the sections remain empty.
- This can happen if the page hasn’t made any network requests yet or uBO Scope hasn't collected data.

Refer to troubleshooting guidelines if this persists.


## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Panel Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Empty">
- Ensure the active tab is fully loaded.
- Verify that uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Check browser permissions, specifically that uBO Scope has access to the active tab.
- Try refreshing the tab or opening another site.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Count Badges Show Unexpected Numbers">
- Remember: the badge reflects _allowed third-party domains_, not total requests.
- High count may be normal for content-rich sites using many CDNs or third-party services.
- Review the distinction between ‘allowed’ and ‘blocked’ domains in the popup for clarity.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth-Blocked Domains Not Understood">
- Stealth-blocking does not stop all requests outright — it silently redirects or modifies them to prevent tracking.
- These domains are listed separately to inform you about hidden blocking activities.
- Consult the 'Core Concepts & Terminology' guide for deeper understanding.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 8. Best Practices

- Regularly check the popup when visiting new or unfamiliar websites to monitor third-party exposure.
- Use the information to wisely adjust your content blocking settings or whitelist trusted domains.
- Observe stealth-blocked domains to ensure your blockers are effectively managing hidden tracking techniques.
- Combine insights from the popup panel with badge counts for a comprehensive picture.


## 9. Related Concepts and Next Steps

- Explore **Interpreting Badge Counts and Domain Statistics** to deepen your understanding of numbers shown in the popup and toolbar badge.
- Review **Launching and Using the Toolbar Popup** for hands-on guidance on accessing and navigating the popup panel.
- Learn about **Stealth-Blocking and Its Impact** in the core concepts documentation.

## Appendix: Example Screenshot and Anatomy

While exact UI styling may vary slightly by browser, the popup panel typically appears as follows:

```
---------------------------------
| current.subdomain.example.com |
---------------------------------
| domains connected: 12          |
---------------------------------
| Not Blocked                   |
| example-cdn.com        [5]     |
| analytics.corp.net     [2]     |
---------------------------------
| Stealth-Blocked              |
| tracker.fakead.net      [3]     |
---------------------------------
| Blocked                       |
| badtracker.malicious.net [1]   |
---------------------------------
```

Each domain row shows the domain's Unicode name and number of connections. Popup sections are scrollable if the list grows long.
