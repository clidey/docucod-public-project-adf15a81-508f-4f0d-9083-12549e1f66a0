# Understanding the Popup and Toolbar Badge

## Overview
This guide walks you through the core user interface elements of uBO Scope, focusing specifically on the popup panel and the toolbar badge count. It explains how the extension presents network connection data for the active browser tab, breaks down domain lists with their respective statuses, and clarifies the real significance of the badge count displayed on the toolbar icon.

By fully understanding these UI elements, users gain clear visibility into third-party network requests triggered during web browsing, enabling more informed privacy and content blocking decisions.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### Task Description
Learn how to interpret the uBO Scope popup interface and toolbar badge. Understand what information is shown about network requests, how to distinguish allowed versus blocked connections, and what the badge count actually represents.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and active in your supported browser.
- Basic familiarity with browser tabs and extension toolbar icons.
- Browsing a web page to observe live network connection data.

### Expected Outcome
- Confident navigation of the popup panel to review network outcomes.
- Ability to read and understand the domain lists categorized by connection status.
- Correct interpretation of the toolbar badge count reflecting network activity.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10 minutes to review UI elements and test browsing scenarios.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate – no technical setup, only interface interaction.

## 2. Understanding the Popup Panel

The popup appears when you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon. It provides an organized, real-time summary of network connections related to the currently active browser tab.

### Key Elements
- **Tab Hostname Header:** Displays the hostname and domain of the active tab.
- **Domains Connected Summary:** Shows the total count of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- **Outcome Sections:** Divided into three categories, each listing domains by connection status:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains suspected of being stealthy redirects or stealth blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where network requests were blocked or failed.

### How to Use the Popup
1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. Observe the hostname banner at the top. This shows the current tab's domain information.
3. View the total domains connected below, reflecting third-party remote domains contacted.
4. Review each outcome section for detailed domain lists and how many resource requests correspond to each domain.

### Outcome Definitions
- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** These are third-party domains from which your browser successfully fetched resources. These connections passed through any content blockers and network filters.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Indicates domains related to redirect events or stealthy network access attempts that might evade typical blocking detection.
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed or were intentionally blocked by content blockers or network policies.

### Practical Example
If you visit a website like example.com, the popup will:
- Show example.com as the active domain.
- List all third-party domains (e.g., cdn.example.net, analytics.tracker.com) contacted.
- Categorize each domain as allowed, stealth, or blocked depending on network request outcomes.

Domains in the allowed section typically include content delivery networks or essential third-party services. Blocked domains often correspond to trackers or ad servers that content blockers prevent.

## 3. Interpreting the Toolbar Badge

The small numeric badge on the uBO Scope toolbar icon is one of the most important visual indicators.

### What the Badge Represents
- The badge shows the **number of distinct third-party domains to which there was at least one successful connection** (allowed domains).
- A higher badge count means more third-party servers were contacted by the page.
- A lower badge count is generally more desirable from a privacy and security perspective.

### Common Misunderstandings
- **The badge does NOT indicate the number of blocked requests.** It only counts allowed third-party domains.
- A high block count (as seen elsewhere) does not necessarily mean better protection—the true measure is how many distinct third parties your browser connected to.

### Badge Update Behavior
- The badge updates dynamically as network requests occur.
- If no successful third-party connections exist in the current tab, the badge will be blank.
- The badge only counts domains, not total number of requests, avoiding misleading interpretations based on volume.

### Example Scenario
If you visit a site that loads resources from 3 third-party domains, but your content blocker blocks two of them:
- The badge count will be 1, reflecting the single allowed third-party domain.
- The popup panel will categorize other domains under stealth or blocked accordingly.

## 4. Step-by-Step Usage

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the toolbar icon for uBO Scope in your browser while on a website.
</Step>
<Step title="Read the Tab Hostname Header">
Look at the hostname displayed on the banner to confirm which tab's data you are viewing.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Total Connected Domains">
Note the number displayed in the 'domains connected' summary – this represents the count of distinct allowed domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore the Domain Lists">
Review each outcome section. Notice the domain names and how many requests were made per domain.
</Step>
<Step title="Cross-Reference with Badge Count">
Compare the popup’s allowed domain count with the toolbar badge number to understand the badge’s significance.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Tips and Best Practices

- **Refresh the popup after navigating to a new tab or site** to ensure current data is displayed.
- Use the badge count as a privacy heuristic: fewer allowed third-party domains usually means less tracking exposure.
- Remember stealth-blocked domains may indicate sophisticated redirections or evasive behaviors worth monitoring.
- The popup does not require manual configuration; it updates automatically based on ongoing tab network activity.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common UI Questions">
<Accordion title="Why is the badge sometimes blank?">
If no allowed third-party domains have been contacted yet on the active tab, the badge will remain empty. This can occur on new tabs or for sites that load all resources from the main domain only.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some domains appear under 'stealth-blocked'?">
Stealth-blocked domains correspond to requests that involved redirects or may have attempted to evade content blocking. This is an advanced category showing network nuances beyond simple allowed/blocked distinctions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty lists?"><p>
This may indicate that the tab is new or network requests are still being processed. Reloading the tab or waiting a few seconds usually resolves this.

If the problem persists, ensure the extension has all necessary permissions and that your browser version is supported.
