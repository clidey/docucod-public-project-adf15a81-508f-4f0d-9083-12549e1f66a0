# Understanding the Popup UI

The uBO Scope popup panel serves as your window into the network connections made by the active browser tab. This guide walks you through how to read and interpret the domain summary, badge counts, and connection categories — allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked — so you can quickly recognize meaningful remote server activity at a glance.

- Browsing an active tab with network activity
- Basic familiarity with browser extension interfaces

### Expected Outcome

By completing this guide, you'll be able to confidently interpret the popup UI data, giving you a real-time snapshot of third-party connections on the current webpage.

### Estimated Time

Approximately 5 minutes

### Difficulty Level

Beginner

## 2. Overview of the Popup Panel Structure

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup UI appears, structured into three primary sections:

- **Tab Hostname Header**
- **Domain Summary Count**
- **Connection Outcome Sections:** "not blocked (allowed)", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked"

Each section is designed to convey specific insights into your network connection profile for the active tab.

## 3. Step-by-Step Guide to Reading the Popup UI

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup UI">
Click the uBO Scope icon located in your browser's toolbar. This opens the popup panel.

**What you see:** At the top, a hostname header indicates the current tab's hostname.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify the Tab Hostname">
The large header under the popup title shows the domain of the webpage you're currently on.

- The panel splits the full hostname into two parts: a possible subdomain (first span) and the main domain (second span).
- For example, visiting "news.example.com" will show "news." in the first span and "example.com" in the second.

**Why it matters:** This confirms which webpage’s connections you are currently examining.
</Step>

<Step title="Read the Domain Summary">
Below the header is a summary line labeled "domains connected," followed by a badge showing the count.

- This number represents the count of distinct domains from which network connections have been allowed.
- A lower number typically suggests fewer third-party connections, which could be favorable for privacy.

**Tip:** This matches the number you see as a badge on the toolbar icon.
</Step>

<Step title="Understand the Connection Outcome Sections">
The popup lists domains under three categories:

1. **Not Blocked (Allowed):**
   - Domains the webpage successfully connected to.
   - These are active third-party servers providing resources or data.

2. **Stealth-Blocked:**
   - Domains whose requests were silently redirected or blocked in ways transparent to the webpage ("stealth blocking").
   - Usually indicates hidden blocking enforced by filters or the browser.

3. **Blocked:**
   - Domains where connection attempts failed explicitly (e.g., request errors).
   - Reflects active blocking that prevented network traffic.

Each category lists domains alongside the count of how many times resources were requested from them during the session.

**Why this matters:** These categories help you quickly identify which domains are allowed, which are being stealthily blocked (invisible to the page), and which are outright blocked.
</Step>

<Step title="Browse Domain Entries">
Each domain is listed with its Unicode representation and a small badge count.

- Domains are sorted alphabetically within each category for easier navigation.
- The count indicates how many network requests uBO Scope observed for that domain.

**Outcome:** This lets you drill down into which third parties are most active or consistently queried.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Practical Tips for Using the Popup UI

- **Quick Scan:** Begin by checking the top domain header to ensure you are viewing data for the correct tab.

- **Focus on the Summary:** The connected domains total helps you assess the footprint of external connections instantly.

- **Pay Attention to Stealth and Blocked:** If many domains appear here, it signals that your blocker is actively engaging, sometimes invisibly, with those hosts.

- **Use Domain Counts:** Large counts for certain domains often indicate persistent or resource-heavy connections.

- **Interpret in Context:** Not every allowed third-party domain is suspicious; many are CDNs or essential services.

- **Refresh the Popup:** Reload the popup to get updated data as network activity changes.

## 5. Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Asked Questions">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count sometimes differ from other blockers?">
The badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party domains for which the extension observed allowed connections. Other blockers may count raw blocked requests or use different metrics, so comparing counts directly can be misleading.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What does 'stealth-blocked' mean?">
Stealth blocking means the domain's requests were blocked or redirected transparently, so the webpage is not aware of the blocking. This helps avoid webpage breakage or detection of blocking.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why are some legitimate domains blocked?">
Blocking is based on filter lists or browser policies. Some legitimate domains can be blocked if they match blocking rules. Review filter lists or whitelist if necessary.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if the popup shows 'NO DATA'?">
This indicates no connection data is currently available for the active tab, possibly due to no network activity or a delayed update. Refresh the page or popup.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **Popup Loads without Data:** Confirm you have an active tab with network activity and try refreshing the popup.
- **Badge Count is Empty:** No third-party connections with allowed outcomes have been detected yet.
- **Domains List Missing:** Check your browser permissions and confirm uBO Scope is enabled and running.
- **Popup UI Size is Clipped:** The popup adjusts width responsively; if too narrow, resize or pin the popup if your browser supports it.

## 7. Summary

The uBO Scope popup UI is a concise yet powerful interface showing you the domains your current tab has connected to, how many connections each domain had, and their connection outcome status. By understanding the structure and meaning of the sections, you gain immediate insight into third-party activity and your content blocking effectiveness.

Use this knowledge to make better privacy decisions and interpret what’s happening behind the scenes as you browse.
