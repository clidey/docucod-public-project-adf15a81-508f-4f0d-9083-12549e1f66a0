# Understanding the Popup Panel and Toolbar Badge

## Introduction

The uBO Scope extension provides a clear and approachable interface to help you monitor network connections your browser makes to remote servers during your browsing session. The Popup Panel and the Toolbar Badge work together to present a concise, categorized summary of these connections for the active tab, helping you better understand what sites connect to which remote domains — whether connections are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

This guide explains how to interpret the Popup Panel's sections and the Toolbar Badge count, enabling you to gain actionable insights into your browsing privacy and content blocking effectiveness.

## 1. What the Popup Panel Shows

When you click the uBO Scope icon in your browser, the Popup Panel opens, displaying a snapshot of the network connection activity for the current tab. It provides a categorized breakdown to help you quickly assess which domains your browser interacted with and how each connection was handled.

### Key Sections in the Panel

- **Hostname Header:** Shows the current tab's hostname and domain, helping you identify the website you're analyzing.
- **Summary:** Displays the total number of distinct domains connected to by the current tab.
- **Outcome Sections:** Divided into three categories:
  - **Allowed:** Domains from which network requests were permitted and completed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were stealth-blocked — prevented in a way designed to be transparent or silent to the target.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests were explicitly blocked.

Each outcome section lists connected domains alongside the number of requests made to each domain, helping you understand the volume and distribution of network connections.

### Visual Indicators

- The **Hostname Header** splits the displayed hostname into two parts: the subdomain portion and the main domain, making it easier to see relationships between hostnames.
- Outcome sections use color cues:
  - Allowed domains have a subtle green highlight.
  - Stealth-blocked and blocked domains use red hues to alert you to restricted connections.
- If an outcome section has no domains recorded, it is hidden from view to keep the panel concise.

### Example of the Panel Layout

```text
Tab Hostname:   subdomain.example.com

Summary:        domains connected: 3

not blocked:
  example-cdn.com (5 requests)
  trustedcdn.net (2 requests)

stealth-blocked:
  tracker.example.org (1 request)

blocked:
  ads.example.com (7 requests)
```

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The Toolbar Badge—the small number displayed over the extension's icon in your browser toolbar—provides an at-a-glance metric of distinct third-party remote servers connected to by the active tab.

### What the Badge Represents

- **Count Meaning:** The number on the badge indicates how many unique domains your browser successfully connected to and were allowed during the current tab session.
- A **lower number** generally indicates fewer third-party connections, which often aligns with better privacy.

### What the Badge Does NOT Show

- The badge focuses only on **allowed** connections — it does *not* count blocked or stealth-blocked requests.
- It does not show total request counts or repeated connections, only unique domains.

This design encourages users to focus on the actual exposure to third-party servers rather than raw numbers of blocked attempts.

## 3. How to Use This Information Effectively

Interpreting the Popup Panel and Toolbar Badge together enables you to:

- **Identify Cleared Privacy Risks:** Allowed domains reveal which third-party servers your browser is communicating with, helping spot unexpected or suspicious connections.
- **Detect Blocking Effectiveness:** Stealth-blocked and blocked domains highlight attempts your content blocker is managing, giving insight into its behavior.
- **Compare Browsing Sessions:** Tracking changes in the badge count and popup details across different websites or times can reveal variations in third-party exposure.

### Practical Tips

- Frequent appearance of unfamiliar allowed domains could signal trackers or unwanted third-party resources.
- A high badge count does not necessarily mean more privacy risk but signals more third-party connections allowed.
- If stealth-blocked or blocked sections are empty for sites known to request tracking resources, re-evaluate your filter lists or blocker settings.

## 4. Step-by-Step: Viewing and Interpreting the Popup Panel

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel">
 Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar while on the tab you want to analyze.
</Step>
<Step title="Read the Hostname Header">
 Notice the top line showing the tab’s hostname and main domain. This identifies the page currently analyzed.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Summary">
 Look at the domains connected count just below the hostname. This number indicates all distinct domains contacted.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
 Scroll to the 'not blocked' section listing domains your browser interacted with successfully, along with counts of connections per domain.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Stealth-Blocked Domains">
 Check the 'stealth-blocked' section to see domains whose requests were silently blocked to avoid detection.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Blocked Domains">
 Finally, see which domains experienced explicit blocking in the 'blocked' section.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Toolbar Badge">
 Observe the badge number on the extension icon; this matches the count of allowed unique domains for the active tab.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Common Questions & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="FAQs and Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge show no number sometimes?">
If no allowed third-party domains were connected for the active tab, the badge will be empty.

Also, if the tab information is not available (e.g., browser restrictions or extension state after restart), the badge may temporarily show blank.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is the 'stealth-blocked' section sometimes empty?">
Stealth blocking is applied only when certain network request types are silently prevented without triggering errors. If the page or content blocker situation doesn’t produce stealth-blocked requests, this section remains hidden.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why does the popup sometimes say ‘NO DATA’?">
This indicates no network information has been collected yet for the active tab. Ensure the tab is loaded and data collection is active.

Refresh the page or switch tabs and reopen the popup to trigger data gathering.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can the popup panel reflect multiple tabs at once?">
No. The popup panel shows network data only for the currently active tab when opened.

Switch to the tab you want to analyze before opening the popup.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is the badge count affected by content blockers or DNS-based blockers?">
The badge counts unique allowed third-party domains post any form of blocking, including DNS or extension-based content blockers, as long as the browser’s webRequest API reports them.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Best Practices

- Regularly check the Popup Panel to monitor changes in third-party domains over time.
- Use the badge count as a quick indicator, but always consult the detailed Popup Panel for context.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with your content blocker settings to optimize privacy.
- Recognize that not all third-party connections are harmful; some are needed for legitimate content delivery like CDNs.
