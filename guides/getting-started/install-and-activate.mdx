### 1. Installing uBO Scope

#### For Chromium-based Browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, etc.)

1. Open your browser and navigate to the [Chrome Web Store uBO Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
2. Click the **Add to Chrome** (or equivalent) button.
3. Review the permissions the extension requires: access to active tabs, storage, and webRequest to monitor network connections.
4. Confirm by clicking **Add extension** in the permission prompt.
5. Wait for the extension to install; you will receive a notification once added.

#### For Mozilla Firefox

1. Navigate to the [Firefox Add-ons uBO Scope page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Review the permissions requested.
4. Confirm by clicking **Add**.
5. Allow any prompts that ask you to permit the extension to run.

### 2. Pinning uBO Scope in Your Browser Toolbar

Pinning the extension icon to your toolbar ensures quick, one-click access to the popup that displays real-time connection data.

- **Chromium**:
  1. Click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions) in the browser's toolbar.
  2. Find **uBO Scope**.
  3. Click the pin icon to pin it.
  4. The uBO Scope icon will appear in your toolbar.

- **Firefox**:
  1. Click the menu button (three horizontal bars).
  2. Select **Extensions and Themes**.
  3. Find **uBO Scope** in the list.
  4. Click the ellipsis (…) and choose **Pin to Toolbar**.

<Tip>
Pinning uBO Scope provides immediate insight into each tab’s network activity without extra navigation.
</Tip>

### 3. Confirming uBO Scope is Active

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to any popular website.
2. Look at the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
3. The badge count on the icon represents the number of distinct third-party servers contacted.
4. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup window.
5. Confirm that the popup shows categorized lists of domains under **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** sections.

<Tip>
- A badge count of zero means no third-party connections have been detected yet for that tab.
- If the popup shows "NO DATA", try reloading the webpage or switching tabs.
</Tip>

### 4. Troubleshooting Installation and Activation Issues

- If you don’t see uBO Scope after installation:
  - Try restarting your browser.
  - Confirm the extension is not disabled in your browser’s extensions/add-ons page.
- If permissions requests pop up again:
  - Make sure to accept the required permissions for activeTab, storage, and webRequest.
- If the badge does not update or popup shows no data:
  - Verify that uBO Scope is pinned and active.
  - Ensure your browser version meets the minimum requirements (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+).
  - Confirm other content blockers or security extensions are not interfering.

<Warning>
The extension relies on browser webRequest API to capture network requests. Browsers or profiles with restricted permissions or security settings may limit functionality.
</Warning>

### 5. Verifying Extension Permissions (Advanced Users)

For users wanting to double-check or manually manage permissions:

- Open your browser’s extensions management page.
- Select uBO Scope.
- Review that it has permission to access URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`), storage, and webRequest.

## Examples & Real-World Use

Imagine you just installed and pinned uBO Scope. You visit a news website. The uBO Scope badge shows “5”.

- Clicking the icon reveals:
  - **Not blocked**: Domains like the news site’s CDN and social media widgets.
  - **Stealth-blocked**: Domains that attempted hidden redirects.
  - **Blocked**: Domains the browser or other blockers prevented.

This immediate feedback clarifies what connections your browser is making, helping you understand third-party content exposure.

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Tip:** After installation, try loading well-known websites with multiple third-party content providers to see varied domain counts.

- **Tip:** If the badge stays blank after visiting multiple sites, restart the browser or reinstall the extension.

- **Pitfall:** Some browsers isolate extension processes. Make sure the extension’s background process has proper permissions and is not being blocked by privacy settings.

- **Performance:** uBO Scope runs efficiently by batching network request processing to avoid performance hits.
