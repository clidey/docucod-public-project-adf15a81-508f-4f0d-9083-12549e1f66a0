# Understanding the Popup and Badge

Unlocking the full potential of uBO Scope means knowing exactly what the toolbar badge signifies and how to navigate the popup interface to gain detailed insights about the network connections each webpage makes. This guide will walk you through interpreting the badge on the extension icon and effectively using the popup UI to analyze distinct third-party remote servers and connection outcomes.

---

## 1. What the Badge Represents

At the heart of uBO Scope's value is the **badge count** displayed directly on the browser toolbar icon. This badge is not a simple tally of blocked requests; instead, it shows:

- **The number of distinct third-party remote servers that were successfully connected during the current tab session.** 

### Why This Matters

A lower badge count means fewer third-party servers have been contacted, which typically corresponds to better privacy.

<u>Example:</u> If you're browsing a news site and the badge shows "12," uBO Scope has detected connections to 12 unique third-party servers (e.g., ad networks, analytics providers, CDNs). 


### Key Points about the Badge

- It only counts **distinct domains** connected to; multiple requests to the same domain count as one.
- It excludes first-party domains (the domain of the site you are visiting).
- The badge updates in real-time as network requests resolve.
- The badge does **not** count blocked or stealth-blocked domains; it only reflects allowed connections.

<Tip>
A higher badge count does not always indicate a less effective content blocker. Some blockers with higher block counts can still allow access to more unique third parties. Use the badge as your primary privacy insight.
</Tip>

## 2. Opening and Navigating the Popup UI

Clicking the uBO Scope icon opens the popup interface, providing a clear breakdown of third-party connections with categorized outcomes.

### Popup Layout Overview

| Section            | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Hostname Display** | Shows the current tab's hostname and domain information.  |
| **Domains Connected Summary** | Displays the number of distinct third-party domains connected to (matching the badge count). |
| **Outcome Sections**  | Breaks down connected third-party domains into 3 categories: 
|                    | - **Not Blocked** (Allowed)  |
|                    | - **Stealth-Blocked** (requests internally redirected or otherwise made invisible) |
|                    | - **Blocked** (network requests that were prevented) |


### Interpreting the Hostname Display

At the top, you’ll see two parts:

- If the top-level hostname differs from its registered domain, the prefix is displayed on the left (e.g., `subdomain.`), and the base domain is on the right.
- For example, for `news.example.com`, the popup displays `news.` and `example.com` side-by-side.

This distinction helps clarify exactly which subdomain is active and what the core domain is.

### Domains Connected Summary

Below the hostname header is a count showing how many unique third-party domains the page connected to.

### Connection Outcome Categories

The main body divides domains based on how the network requests ended:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Third-party domains for which network requests succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were silently redirected, altered or suppressed in a way that hides them from usual UI feedback.
- **Blocked:** Domains where network requests failed or were explicitly blocked.

Each category lists third-party domains in a scrollable section with:

- Domain name displayed (converted to Unicode for readability if needed).
- A small badge indicating how many requests were made to that domain.

## 3. Step-by-Step: Using the Popup to Analyze Connections

Follow these steps to explore the network details for the active tab.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Popup">
    Click the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar.

    <Check>
    The popup appears showing the hostname at the top and initial domains connected count.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify the Active Domain">
    Observe the hostname shown at the top: the subdomain (if any) is to the left, base domain to the right.

    <Tip>
    This helps confirm which site you are inspecting especially when complex subdomain structures are involved.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Allowed Connections">
    Scroll to the **not blocked** section.

    - Each domain is a distinct third-party server for which a connection succeeded.
    - The count badge shows how many requests were made to that domain.

    <Check>
    Confirm the domains here match your expectations for legitimate third parties (such as CDNs or analytics).
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inspect Stealth-Blocked and Blocked Domains">
    Review the 'stealth-blocked' and 'blocked' sections to see which domains your content blockers or network policies prevented or modified.

    <Tip>
    Seeing domains here can help diagnose if expected blocking policies are functioning.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Interpret Connection Counts">
    Use the numeric badges to gauge the frequency of connections per domain.

    Higher counts may indicate heavier resource usage or potentially suspicious activity especially if unexpected domains appear.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Refresh the page to re-check:** The popup updates dynamically but reflects the current page state only; reload a page to start fresh and confirm updated connections.
- **Compare badge counts across sites:** Use the badge number as a quick privacy quality metric between websites.
- **Understand domain roles:** Not all third-parties are tracking entities; some are essential CDNs or service endpoints.
- **Watch for unexpected domains:** Repeated unfamiliar third-party domains may warrant further investigation.

<Warning>
The popup shows data only for the currently active tab. Switching tabs requires reopening the popup to see that tab’s data.
</Warning>

## 5. Common Troubleshooting Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with Popup and Badge">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Match Expected Privacy Levels">
- Confirm that the page is fully loaded.
- Ensure no other conflicting extensions manipulate web requests.
- Remember badge counts represent distinct domains connected, not blocked requests.
- Consult Troubleshooting Common Issues in the documentation if counts do not update.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Is Empty">
- Make sure the popup was opened on an active, fully loaded tab.
- Verify permissions and that uBO Scope is enabled.
- Reload the tab and open the popup again.
- Check that the browser supports the required webRequest API.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains List Appears Incomplete or Does Not Update">
- Network requests may sometimes be outside the webRequest API’s scope.
- Some requests might be cached or not triggered upon page reload.
- Restart the browser to clear stale session data.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
