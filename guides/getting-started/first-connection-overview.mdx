# Your First Scan: Interpreting Popup Results

## Workflow Overview

This guide helps you understand how to open the uBO Scope popup while browsing a webpage, interpret the connection results displayed, and grasp the meanings behind the allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories. It also explains the significance of the badge counter shown in the toolbar icon.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and enabled in your supported browser (Chromium, Firefox, or Safari).
- Access to any webpage with third-party network activity (e.g., news sites, social media).

### Expected Outcome
After following this guide, you will be able to open the extension popup for the current browser tab and clearly understand the classification of remote connections your browser made or attempted. You will also know how to interpret the badge count on the toolbar icon.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 5-10 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner

## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
While browsing any webpage, click the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. This will open the popup window showing connection details for the current tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Hostname Header">
At the top of the popup, find the hostname of the webpage loaded in your active tab. This helps you verify you are viewing connection data for the correct site.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Connection Summary">
Look at the summary section labeled "domains connected". This shows the total number of distinct domains your browser contacted during page load.
</Step>
<Step title="Understand the Three Outcome Sections">
The popup separates domains into three categories:

- **Not blocked** (allowed): Connections that succeeded and were not blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked** (stealth): Connections that were blocked silently, often to avoid detection by the webpage.
- **Blocked**: Connections that were explicitly blocked by the content blocker.

Each section lists domains and the number of requests per domain.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Badge Count">
The numeric badge count on the toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct remote domains from which resources were successfully fetched (allowed section).

A lower badge count indicates fewer distinct third-party connections, which usually equates to better privacy.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Examples & Use Case

For example, visiting a news site might result in connections to:

- The site's main domain (allowed)
- A CDN serving images or scripts (allowed)
- Analytics domains which might be stealth blocked or blocked

The popup will display these domains grouped accordingly with the number of their network requests.

### Sample Popup Sections

```plaintext
not blocked
[domain1.com]  15
[cdn.example.net]  8

stealth-blocked
[analytics.com]  5

blocked
[trackersite.com]  12
```

You can see how many requests each domain made, helping you identify any suspicious or unexpected connections.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' or is empty">
This may happen if the page has not yet finished loading connections or if the extension did not detect any network activity for the active tab.

Try refreshing the page and reopening the popup.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge number is zero but sites still load content">
The badge counts distinct connected third-party domains, not total requests. If all third parties are blocked or no network requests occurred, the badge can be zero.

Verify the allowed section in the popup for clarity.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain names appear in Unicode or encoded form">
uBO Scope converts domain names to a readable Unicode format using the punycode library. This ensures internationalized domain names (IDNs) are shown clearly.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

- Regularly check the popup to monitor third-party domains your browser interacts with, especially while visiting sensitive or unfamiliar sites.
- Use the distinction between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked to assess the effectiveness of your content blocking setup.
- A consistent low badge count correlates with better blocking efficiency, but always review the popup details rather than rely on badge count alone.

## Next Steps & Related Content

After mastering the popup interpretation:

- Explore [Understanding the Badge Count and What It Means](./reading-badge) to deepen your knowledge of badge significance.
- Learn more about the categories in [What Are Allowed, Stealth, and Blocked Domains?](./popup-domain-categories).
- Review [Using the Extension for the First Time](../../getting-started/first-use-and-validation/using-the-extension) for additional onboarding guidance.
- For troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting Common Installation & Setup Issues](../../getting-started/troubleshooting-and-faq/common-issues).

## Additional Information

- The popup reflects real-time connection data for the active browser tab.
- Domains are parsed using an internal Public Suffix List, ensuring second-level domain accuracy.
- The extension uses the browser's webRequest API to monitor and classify network requests.
