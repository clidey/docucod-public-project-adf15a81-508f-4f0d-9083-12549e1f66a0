# Understanding the Popup: Your First Analysis

## 1. Overview

This guide helps you get started with the uBO Scope popup interface. It explains how to open the popup, understand its layout, and interpret the key data points shown across its tabs: **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth** domains. By the end, you will confidently read the connection counts and know how they reflect your real-world browsing privacy.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension is installed and active in your browser.
- You have at least one active browser tab with network activity.

### Expected Outcome
- Understand how to open the popup UI.
- Recognize what information each section displays.
- Interpret the meaning and significance of connection counts.

### Time Estimate
Less than 5 minutes to open the popup and grasp the main UI concepts.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner â€” no technical background required.

---

## 2. Opening the Popup UI

The uBO Scope popup provides a snapshot of network connections related to the active browser tab.

### How to Open

1. Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser. It is usually located near the address bar.
2. The popup window appears displaying summarized data for the current tab.

<Tip>
If the uBO Scope icon does not appear, verify installation and permissions by visiting the installation documentation.
</Tip>

### What You See First

- **Hostname at the Top**: This shows the hostname of the active tab, typically the domain of the webpage currently open.
- **Domains Connected Summary**: A total count of distinct remote domains contacted by the active tab.

## 3. Popup Layout and Data Sections

The popup is divided into three main sections, each representing a category of remote server connections:

| Section           | Description                                          | What It Represents                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**   | Domains that allowed connections successfully.       | Servers your browser connected to |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains blocked in a "stealth" manner (redirects). | Connections uBO Scope hid or redirected |
| **Blocked**       | Domains explicitly blocked.                           | Connections blocked entirely       |

### Detailed Explanation

- Each section lists domains with counts showing how many times each domain was contacted or blocked.
- Domains are displayed in their Unicode form when applicable (e.g., internationalized domain names).
- Counts are badges showing frequency of requests to each domain.

---

## 4. Interpreting the Connection Counts

Understanding these counts is crucial to assess the extent of third-party exposure and blocking effectiveness.

### Allowed Domains (Not Blocked)
- Represents third-party servers your browser successfully connected to.
- A **lower count here generally means better privacy**, indicating fewer third-party connections.
- These domains include any legitimate services or CDNs used by the webpage.

### Stealth-Blocked Domains
- Connections that were blocked or redirected without causing page breakage.
- Often relates to hush blocking or stealth techniques to prevent resource loads silently.
- Counts here show how many requests were quietly prevented.

### Blocked Domains
- Domains for which connection attempts were outright blocked by the extension.
- High counts indicate aggressive blocking but do not always translate to higher privacy if allowed connections remain high.

<Tip>
Do not rely solely on the block count to assess privacy exposure. The allowed domains count is a more reliable indicator of what connections actually occurred.
</Tip>

### Real-World Significance
- The total number of domains connected gives an immediate view of your privacy exposure on the current webpage.
- Understanding stealth versus explicit blocks helps interpret how uBO Scope handles different connection types.

## 5. Step-by-Step Example

Imagine visiting a news website:

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon next to your browser's address bar.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Identify the Hostname">
At the top of the popup, note the webpage's hostname, for example, 'news.example.com'.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Review Domains Connected Summary">
See "domains connected: 15" indicating 15 distinct domains contacted.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: Examine 'Not Blocked' List">
Check which domains your browser actually connected to and how often requests were made.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 5: Examine 'Stealth-Blocked' and 'Blocked' Lists">
Understand what domains were silently redirected and which were explicitly blocked.
</Step>
</Steps>

By interpreting these counts, you can gauge your browsing privacy and the effectiveness of your content blockers.

## 6. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Refresh the popup** as you navigate to different tabs or pages to see updated connection data.
- **Pay attention to the total "domains connected" count**, which reflects the breadth of third-party exposure.
- Use this popup alongside the badge count on the toolbar icon for quick privacy assessment.
- Remember that some allowed domains may be legitimate first-party services or essential CDNs.

<Warning>
Avoid drawing privacy conclusions solely from the block count. A high block count may coexist with a high allowed domains count, indicating less effective blocking.
</Warning>

---

## 7. Common Pitfalls

- **Confusing domains with hostnames**: The popup simplifies to domains, which groups related hostnames together.
- **Assuming the block count equals better blocking**: More blocks do not necessarily mean fewer connections.
- **Not recognizing stealth blocking**: Important to understand that some blocked content may be stealthily handled without explicit block counts.

## 8. Troubleshooting the Popup

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Doesn't Open or Shows No Data">
- Ensure the extension is enabled and has proper permissions.
- Reload the active tab to trigger data collection.
- Verify your browser supports the required APIs (e.g., webRequest).
- Consult the Troubleshooting Common Issues guide for detailed steps.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Hostname or Domain Names Appear as Encoding or Symbols">
- The popup uses Unicode to properly display international domain names.
- If display seems broken, try refreshing the popup or restarting the browser.
- Update the extension to the latest version if problems persist.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Counts Seem Too High or Too Low">
- Counts reflect real network requests; some websites have many third-party connections.
- Differences may occur across browsing sessions; try consistent testing conditions.
- Consult the guide on interpreting badge count for deeper understanding.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
