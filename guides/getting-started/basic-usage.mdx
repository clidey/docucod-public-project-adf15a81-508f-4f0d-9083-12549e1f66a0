# Understanding the uBO Scope Popup and Badge

## Overview

This guide provides a practical walkthrough of the uBO Scope extension's primary user interface elements—the toolbar badge and the popup window. It explains how to interpret the badge count and understand the detailed summary of third-party network connections presented in the popup. By following this guide, users will confidently monitor distinct remote server connections triggered by webpages, gaining insight into their browsing privacy footprint.

---

## 1. What This Guide Helps You Achieve

- Understand the meaning behind the badge count shown on the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- Navigate and interpret the popup window that lists third-party domains by their connection status.
- Use this information to assess the effectiveness of your content blocker and your exposure to third-party network requests.

### Prerequisites

- The uBO Scope extension installed in a supported browser (Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, or Safari).
- Basic familiarity with browser toolbars and extension icons.

### Expected Outcome

After completing this guide, you will:
- Know how to open and read the uBO Scope popup window.
- Understand the distinctions between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.
- Benefit from an accurate count of distinct third-party connections relevant to your current tab.

### Time Estimate

Approximately 5 to 10 minutes.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner

## 2. Understanding the Toolbar Badge

### What the Badge Shows

- The numeric badge on the uBO Scope toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct **third-party remote servers** contacted by the current webpage.
- A **lower badge count indicates better privacy** since it means fewer third-party servers were connected.

### Why the Badge Is Different

- Unlike traditional content blockers that show a block count, uBO Scope focuses on actual connections made to third-party domains, regardless of how many individual requests were blocked.
- This helps you avoid misleading conclusions often drawn from block count metrics.

### How to Use the Badge

1. Look at the badge each time you open a new webpage.
2. Use a higher badge count as a signal that more distinct third-party servers are communicating with your browser.
3. Compare badge counts when using different content blockers or filter lists to evaluate their effectiveness.

<Check>
A badge showing “0” means no third-party connections are detected on that tab — ideal for privacy.

## 3. Accessing and Navigating the Popup Window

### Opening the Popup

1. Click the uBO Scope icon located on your browser’s toolbar.
2. The popup window launches, displaying detailed information about the active tab.

### Popup Layout

- **Header**: Shows the current page’s hostname and associated primary domain.
- **Summary Section**: Displays the total number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Outcome Sections**: Divided into three categories, each listing domains by their network request outcomes:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
  - **Stealth-Blocked**
  - **Blocked**

Each domain name is paired with a count badge indicating how many requests were made to that domain.

## 4. What the Connection Categories Mean

| Category         | Meaning                                                                                                   | User Takeaway                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked      | Connections to third-party servers that succeeded without being blocked.                                  | These are active third-party connections your browser engaged with. Consider how many you want. |
| Stealth-Blocked  | Network requests that triggered redirects or other conditions considered stealthy blocking methods.       | May indicate subtle blocking or redirection attempts not fully surfaced by typical logs.           |
| Blocked          | Network requests that were explicitly blocked or failed to complete.                                       | Confirm your content blocker is actively blocking unwanted third-party content.                   |

## 5. Step-by-Step Instructions for Using the Popup

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup window showing network connection data for the current tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Read the Page Hostname and Domain">
At the top, identify the hostname and root domain of the webpage you are inspecting. This provides context for the connection data.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Total Connected Domains">
Observe the number next to "domains connected:" to see how many unique third-party domains your browser contacted for this page.
</Step>

<Step title="Examine Allowed Connections">
Expand the 'not blocked' section to view which third-party domains were connected without interference.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Stealth-Blocked Connections">
Look through the 'stealth-blocked' section for connections that may have been indirectly blocked or affected by redirects.
</Step>

<Step title="Inspect Blocked Connections">
Check the 'blocked' section to verify which domains were prevented from connecting.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Frequent Checks**: Monitor the badge and popup regularly to detect unusual spikes in third-party connections, which might indicate changes in webpage behavior or filter effectiveness.
- **Use with Other Content Blockers**: uBO Scope works alongside your content blocker; it does not block content itself but reports connections. This helps validate your blocker’s impact.
- **Domain Name Decoding**: The popup automatically converts punycode domain names (encoded internationalized domain names) to readable Unicode format.

<Tip>
Lowering the badge number is generally better for privacy, but remember some third-party domains (like CDNs) are legitimate and essential.
</Tip>

## 7. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Popup Shows "NO DATA"
- This can happen if no network requests were registered for the active tab yet.
- **Solution**: Reload the tab or wait a few seconds after page load for uBO Scope to gather data.

### Badge Count Does Not Update
- The browser may temporarily delay updating badge text, or some network requests are outside the extension’s monitoring scope.
- **Solution**: Refresh the page or open a new tab to see if counts appear.

### Unexpected High Counts
- Connections to many third-party domains can occur legitimately on complex sites.
- **Tip**: Compare counts with and without other blockers enabled to understand how your setup affects connections.

## 8. Examples

### Example Scenario: An eCommerce Site
- Badge shows “5” indicating five distinct third-party servers connected.
- Popup lists domains like `cdn.example-cdn.com` under 'not blocked' (allowed), `tracking.ads.com` under 'blocked', and `analytics.remote.net` under 'stealth-blocked'.
- Interpretation: The site uses legitimate CDN servers and some trackers are blocked or stealth-blocked by your content blocker.
