## 2. Step-by-Step Installation

Follow the steps below to install and set up uBO Scope quickly.

### Step 1: Choose Your Browser

Decide which browser you use from the supported list above.

### Step 2: Install uBO Scope from Official Source

- **Chrome:**
  1. Go to the [Chrome Web Store listing for uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
  2. Click `Add to Chrome` and confirm the installation.

- **Firefox:**
  1. Visit the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
  2. Click `Add to Firefox` and approve permissions.

- **Safari:**
  1. Follow Apple’s instructions to install Safari extensions and locate uBO Scope in the App Store or developer-provided installation instructions.

### Step 3: Confirm Extension Presence

- Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
- Pin the icon for easy access if your browser hides it by default.

<Tip>
Pinning the icon ensures you can easily observe badge counts and open the popup to review network connections on any webpage.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Configure Basic Settings

uBO Scope requires no complex initial configuration to start monitoring. Its default permissions and behavior are optimized for immediate use.

- Ensure the extension has proper permissions to monitor web requests by verifying during installation prompts.

### Step 5: Verify the Installation

- Open a popular website (e.g., a news site or social media platform).
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
- In the popup, you should see:
  - The hostname of the current tab at the top.
  - Counts of connected domains grouped by their connection status (`not blocked`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked`).
  - A numeric badge count on the toolbar icon representing distinct third-party domains contacted.

<Check>
If you see "NO DATA" or empty counts, generate some network activity by refreshing the page or visiting another site.
</Check>

## 3. Understanding What Happens During Installation

Upon installation, uBO Scope:

- Registers listeners for network events (requests, redirects, errors, responses) using the browser's `webRequest` API.
- Builds internal records mapping third-party hostnames and domains contacted by each browser tab.
- Displays a badge on the toolbar icon showing the count of distinct allowed third-party domains.
- Updates the popup UI with detailed domain lists split into "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" outcomes.

All this works automatically without further user action once installed and permissions are granted.

## 5. Best Practices & Tips

- **Start with popular sites:** Initial network activity on sites you frequently visit provides clear insight into third-party connections.
- **Verify permissions:** Extensions that lack full `webRequest` permissions will not report network traffic reliably.
- **Keep your browser updated:** Ensure consistent operation by running a supported browser version.
- **Pin the extension icon:** Facilitates easy access and real-time monitoring.
