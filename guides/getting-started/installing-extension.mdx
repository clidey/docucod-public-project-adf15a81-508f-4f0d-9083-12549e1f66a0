## 5. Verifying uBO Scope is Working

### How to Verify:

```bash
./tools/make-package.sh firefox 1.0.1
```

- In your browser's extension management page, enable Developer Mode and load the unpacked extension from the generated `build/uBO-Scope.<platform>/` directory.

<Note>
Manual installation requires caution: be sure to keep your local version updated to avoid security risks and incompatibilities.
