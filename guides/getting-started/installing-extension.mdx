### Chromium Browsers

2. **Click 'Add to Firefox':** Initiate the add-on installation process.
3. **Accept permissions:** Allow the requested permissions such as access to browser tabs and network requests.

### Safari

1. **Open Safari Extensions:** Access Safari’s Extensions preferences or the App Store to locate uBO Scope.

## 3. Verifying Installation

Once installed, verifying the extension works as expected is crucial.

1. **Refresh a website:** Load or reload any webpage in your browser.
2. **Observe the toolbar badge:** The uBO Scope icon’s badge should display a number representing distinct third-party domains connected.
3. **Open the uBO Scope popup:** Click the toolbar icon to view detailed domain connection data.
4. **Confirm data loading:** The popup lists allowed, stealth, and blocked domains for the current tab.

If the badge is empty or the popup shows 'NO DATA', the extension may not be active or lack permissions.

## 4. Preparing Your Browser Environment

Certain settings or conditions can affect uBO Scope’s functionality:

- **Allow extensions to run in private windows** (if you browse in private/incognito mode).
- **Ensure the browser is updated** to a supported version (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- **Grant all requested permissions** during installation for accurate network monitoring.
- **Verify that no other extension conflicts prevent webRequest APIs from working properly.**
