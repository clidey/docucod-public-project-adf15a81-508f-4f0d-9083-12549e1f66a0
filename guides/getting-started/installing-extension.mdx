## 4. Permissions Overview

During installation, uBO Scope requests permissions essential to deliver its core functionality:

- **ActiveTab:** Access to the currently active tab for monitoring network requests.
- **Storage:** To save session data and user settings locally.
- **webRequest:** To monitor and log network request outcomes, including allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.

These permissions ensure uBO Scope can track network activity transparently while respecting browser security constraints.

## 5. First Launch and Verification

Once installed, verify that uBO Scope is active and functioning:

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar to open its popup panel.
2. The popup displays the count of distinct third-party domains contacted by the active web page.
3. The popup categorizes domains by connection outcomes: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
4. A number badge on the toolbar icon indicates the count of allowed third-party domains.

If you see no data, consider:

- Refreshing the current web page to generate network requests.
- Verifying that the extension has the necessary permissions.
- Checking that the browser version meets minimum requirements.
