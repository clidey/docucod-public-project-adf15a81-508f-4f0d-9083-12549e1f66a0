## 2. Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Select Your Browser
Determine which browser you want to install uBO Scope on:
- Chromium (Google Chrome, Brave, Edge, etc.)
- Firefox
- Safari

### Step 2: Access the Official Extension Store
Use the following official links to find the uBO Scope extension:

| Browser  | Store Link |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Chromium | [Chrome Web Store - uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox  | [Firefox Add-ons - uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |

For Safari, visit the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com) and search for "uBO Scope" or use Safari’s Extensions page if available.

### Step 3: Initiate the Installation
- Click the **Add to Browser** or **Install** button on the extension page.
- Confirm any prompts that ask for permission to add the extension.

### Step 4: Review Required Permissions
Before confirming installation, review the requested permissions carefully:

- **Access to activeTab:** Allows uBO Scope to inspect network requests from the currently active tab.
- **Storage access:** Enables saving session data to accurately track connections.
- **WebRequest API permissions:** Allows listening to and measuring network requests (including HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS protocols depending on browser).

<Tip>
These permissions ensure that uBO Scope can observe network connections in real-time without interfering, giving you accurate visibility into your browsing exposure.
</Tip>

### Step 5: Confirm Installation
- After confirmation, watch for a new uBO Scope icon on your browser’s toolbar.
- This icon typically resembles a simple badge with a connection count.

### Step 6: Verify a Successful Installation
- Click the uBO Scope icon to open its popup panel.
- The popup should display information about the current active tab, including the number of third-party domains connected.
- If the popup shows “NO DATA,” refresh the active tab or browse to a new website to collect data.

<Check>
If the icon doesn’t appear:
- Confirm the extension is enabled in the browser’s extensions/add-ons management page.
- Restart the browser.
</Check>

## 3. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Install from official stores only:** Avoid downloading the extension from third-party sites to ensure security and authenticity.
- **Keep your browser updated:** Compatibility requires chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+.
- **Allow necessary permissions:** Declining access to network requests will render uBO Scope ineffective.
- **Refresh tabs after install:** A refresh triggers fresh network data capture.
- **Note protocol coverage:** Safari currently supports monitoring HTTP and HTTPS but might have limitations for WebSocket protocols.

<Warning>
If you use other content blockers, uBO Scope’s functionality depends on your browser’s webRequest API feed, which may be limited if other extensions restrict it.
</Warning>
