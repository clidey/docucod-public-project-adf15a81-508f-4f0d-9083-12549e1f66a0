## 4. Verifying Installation

Once installed, ensure uBO Scope is active and ready to use:

- Look for the shield-shaped uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
- Click the icon to open the popup window, which initially will display 'NO DATA' until you navigate to a page and interactions are logged.
- The badge count on the icon will update as network requests are observed.

<Check>
If the icon does not appear:
- In Chromium or Firefox, open your extensions management page and confirm uBO Scope is enabled.
- In Safari, check under Preferences > Extensions.
- Pin the extension icon to the toolbar for easy access.
</Check>

---

## 5. First Run Overview

After installation, you can immediately start observing network activity:

1. Open any website in your browser.
2. Watch for badge count updates indicating the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to view connection details, categorized as:
   - **Not Blocked**: Domains from which resources loaded successfully.
   - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where requests were intercepted stealthily.
   - **Blocked**: Domains explicitly blocked.

<Info>
The badge count shows distinct third-party remote servers connected â€” a lower number suggests fewer third-party connections.
</Info>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="Extension Icon Missing After Installation">

- Verify the extension is enabled in your browser's extension management page.
- For Chromium and Firefox, try restarting the browser.
- Ensure you granted the necessary permissions during installation.
- Pin the extension to the browser toolbar manually.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permissions Denied or Not Working">

- Ensure you allow storage and webRequest permissions.
- Some browsers might block webRequest API usage on certain internal pages.
- You may need to reload your open tabs for monitoring to start.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">

- Confirm you are browsing HTTP/HTTPS sites as only those requests are monitored.
- Reload the page to trigger new network events.
- Check for any conflicting extensions that might block uBO Scope.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Additional Notes

- The extension monitors network requests regardless of other content blockers; it reports all attempts and outcomes.
- Because uBO Scope relies on browser APIs, network requests outside these APIs (e.g., native apps or some background services) cannot be observed.
- uBO Scope's version and permissions are consistent across platforms, but browser-specific behaviors may differ slightly.
