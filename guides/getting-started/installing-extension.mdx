## 3. Permissions Explained

uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions to function:

- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to observe the current tab’s URL and network activity.
- **webRequest**: Enables uBO Scope to listen to web requests made by tabs to track connection statuses.

## 4. What to Expect on First Launch

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon after installation:

- The popup will show a **loading state** briefly while initializing.
- Once ready, it displays:
  - The **hostname** of the current tab
  - A summary count of **distinct connected domains** (third-party servers)
  - Three categorized lists:
    - **Not blocked**: Domains from which connections succeeded
    - **Stealth-blocked**: Domains where requests were redirected stealthily
    - **Blocked**: Domains where requests were explicitly blocked

- The extension's **badge count** on the toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected.

<Info>
The badge count helps you evaluate overall exposure to third-party servers; a lower number generally means fewer external connections.
</Info>
