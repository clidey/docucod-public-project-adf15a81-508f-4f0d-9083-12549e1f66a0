## 2. Step-by-Step Installation and Activation

### Step 1: Choose Your Browser
uBO Scope supports the latest versions of these browsers:
- **Chromium:** Minimum version 122.0
- **Firefox:** Minimum version 128.0
- **Safari:** Minimum version 18.5

Ensure your browser is updated to meet these requirements. If not, update your browser before proceeding.

### Step 2: Access the Official Extension Page
To maintain security and version integrity, always install uBO Scope from the official browser extension store:
- **Chromium:** Access the [Chrome Web Store - uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- **Firefox:** Visit [Firefox Add-ons - uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- **Safari:** Available via the official Apple Extensions Gallery (search for uBO Scope) or through your Safari Extensions preferences.

<Tip>
Installing from official stores guarantees automatic updates and reduces security risks.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Install the Extension
1. Click the **Add to Browser** or **Install** button on the extension page.
2. Confirm any permission dialogs that appear. uBO Scope requires permissions to access web requests and tabs to monitor network connections accurately.
3. Wait for the installation to complete.

<Tip>
Browser permissions required:
- Access to active tabs
- Storage management
- WebRequest monitoring of HTTP and WebSocket traffic
Ensure you accept these to enable full functionality.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Verify Extension Installation
Check that uBO Scope’s icon appears in your browser’s toolbar near the address bar.

- If the icon is not visible:
  - Click your browser’s extension menu (often a puzzle piece icon).
  - Pin or enable the uBO Scope extension for quick access.

### Step 5: Activate and Pin the Extension Icon
For frequent access, pinning the icon keeps it always visible:
- **Chromium & Firefox:** Click the puzzle piece icon → find uBO Scope → click the pin icon.
- **Safari:** Open Safari Preferences → Extensions → locate uBO Scope → check the box to enable and show toolbar icon.

### Step 6: Confirm Extension Is Working
1. Navigate to any website.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon.
3. The popup should display network connection data for the active tab (domain names and counts).

<Tip>
If the popup shows "NO DATA" or no connections, try refreshing the page or checking that the extension is permitted to run on the site.
</Tip>

## 3. Practical Tips for Installation Success

- **Keep Your Browser Updated:** Older versions may lack required APIs, causing incomplete or failed data reporting.
- **Check Extension Conflicts:** Disable other extensions that might interfere with network request monitoring.
- **Ensure Permissions Are Granted:** Without permission to monitor webRequest events, uBO Scope cannot track connections.
- **Refresh Tabs on Activation:** After installing or enabling the extension, refresh open tabs to trigger data collection.
