## 3. Verifying uBO Scope is Working

Follow these quick validation steps to confirm uBO Scope is actively monitoring network connections:

### Step 1: Open an Active Browser Tab

Visit any website that loads external content, such as a news site or social media platform.

### Step 2: Observe the Toolbar Icon Badge

Look at the uBO Scope extension icon in the toolbar:
- A **number badge** indicates the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected.
- No badge or empty badge means no detected third-party connections yet.

### Step 3: Open the Popup Interface

1. Click the uBO Scope icon.
2. The popup will display:
   - **Hostname of the current tab**.
   - **Summary count of connected domains**.
   - Domains categorized by their connection outcome:
     - **Not blocked** (allowed)
     - **Stealth-blocked** (requests intercepted silently)
     - **Blocked** (requests outright blocked)

<Tip>
If you visit multiple sites, the badge count and popup contents will update live.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Confirm Data Updates

Navigate to another site or reload the current tab and observe changes to the badge and popup data.
