## 3. Enabling and Verifying uBO Scope Activation

### 3.1 Verify the Extension Icon
- Look for the uBO Scope icon (usually a simplified logo) in your browser’s extension toolbar area.
- If missing, check the browser’s extensions or add-ons manager to enable or pin the extension.

### 3.2 Confirm Permissions
- Upon installation, the extension requests permissions to monitor network requests on all websites.
- Verify that permissions are granted; otherwise, uBO Scope cannot report network activity.

### 3.3 Open the uBO Scope Popup
- Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
- The popup displays:
  - The current tab’s domain (top of the popup).
  - Number of connected domains.
  - Lists separated into **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

### 3.4 Check the Toolbar Badge
- The badge number represents the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected for the active tab.
- A displayed badge count indicates uBO Scope is actively monitoring network requests.

<Check>
If the badge is empty or no data is shown in the popup, verify activation status and permissions.
</Check>
