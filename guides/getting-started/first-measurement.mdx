# Your First Measurement: Revealing Third-Party Connections

Unlock immediate visibility into every third-party network connection your browser attempts or successfully makes when visiting a website using uBO Scope’s popup panel. This guide walks you through interpreting the dynamic badge count on the toolbar icon alongside detailed domain connection statuses in the popup UI to empower your privacy oversight and auditing.

---

## What You Will Achieve

By following this tutorial, you will:

- Access real-time measurement data of all third-party connections initiated by the current active tab.
- Understand how to read and interpret the badge count shown on the toolbar icon.
- Navigate and make sense of the categorized domain lists in the popup panel: Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked.
- Gain actionable insights into the true network activity of visited webpages to inform your privacy decisions.

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your Chromium, Firefox (128+), or Safari (18.5+) browser.
- Browser permissions granted to uBO Scope including `webRequest` API access.
- At least one active tab loaded with a webpage to observe network connections.

If you need assistance, consult the [Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope](/guides/getting-started/installation-setup) and [First Run & Basic Configuration](/getting-started/installation-setup/first-run-setup) guides.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar (usually beside the address bar).
- If you don’t see it, verify the extension is enabled in the browser’s extensions or add-ons management.

### 2. Observe the Badge Count

- The numeric badge on the icon represents the number of distinct third-party remote server domains the current tab has connected to successfully.
- A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections.
- This count updates dynamically as you navigate or reload pages.

### 3. Open the Popup Panel

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- The panel header displays the hostname and the effective domain of the active tab.
- Below the header, the total count of connected domains is shown.

### 4. Understand the Connection Outcome Sections

The popup panel classifies third-party connections into three categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were attempted but stealth-blocked by content blockers or other measures.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections failed altogether.

Each section lists the domains along with the count of connection events detected.

### 5. Explore Domain Lists

- Scroll through the domains under each category to understand which third parties were contacted.
- Each domain displayed is the effective domain, determined using the Public Suffix List to ensure accurate grouping.

### 6. Interpret Unicode Domains

- Domains may be shown in Unicode form to accurately represent internationalized domain names.
- This aids readability, especially for domains using non-Latin scripts.

### 7. Reload or Navigate to New Pages to Refresh Data

- The data updates automatically on navigation or page reload.
- Confirm that badge count and popup contents reflect current tab activity.

## Practical Example

Imagine visiting a news website. Upon opening the uBO Scope popup immediately after the page loads:

- The badge count shows `7`, signaling seven distinct third-party domains contacted.
- The **Not Blocked** section lists CDNs and analytics providers currently active.
- The **Stealth-Blocked** section reveals tracker domains silently blocked by your content blocker.
- The **Blocked** section is empty, indicating no outright blocked domains.

Using this, you discover which third parties are truly contacted behind the scenes, beyond what an ad blocker might superficially indicate.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Regularly check the popup during browsing sessions** to catch unexpected or stealthy connections.
- **Use the badge count as a privacy health indicator**—higher counts mean more third-party network activity.
- **Combine insights with your content blocker settings** to adjust privacy tools effectively.
- **Reload tabs to get updated real-time reports** especially after making site permission changes.

## Common Pitfalls

- **No badge count or data:** Verify that uBO Scope is enabled and that your browser supports the `webRequest` API fully.
- **Domains seem missing:** Some very stealthy or browser-internal connections might not appear due to API limitations.
- **Confusing domain groupings:** Remember that domains are grouped by effective domain using the official Public Suffix List; unfamiliar subdomains will consolidate appropriately.

## Troubleshooting

Refer to [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/getting-going/troubleshooting-common) if:

- The popup shows 'NO DATA' repeatedly.
- The badge count does not update after navigation.
- The extension icon is missing.
