# Running Your First Network Analysis with uBO Scope

Discover how to harness the power of uBO Scope's popup interface to monitor third-party network connections as you browse. This guide walks you through opening the popup, understanding real-time connection data, and making sense of domain categorizations for effective network analysis.

---

## 1. Introduction

uBO Scope provides a concise, clear view of which third-party domains your browser connects to while loading a web page. Using the extension's popup, you will see domain lists categorized by whether requests were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked, helping you understand and verify the extent of remote connections in real-time.

## 2. Prerequisites

- **uBO Scope Extension Installed:** Ensure the extension is installed and properly enabled in your browser.
- **Active Tab Open:** Have a web page loaded in the active browser tab that you want to analyze.
- **Browser Permissions Granted:** The extension requires permissions such as `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest`.
- **Supported Browser:** Use Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browsers at supported versions as outlined in the [System Requirements](../getting-started/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements).

## 3. Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will:

- Access the extension popup tied to the active tab.
- View three categorized lists showing distinct third-party domains connected during page load:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains where requests succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where redirects occurred but were stealthily handled.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where network requests failed or were blocked.
- Understand the summary count of unique domains contacted.
- Gain immediate insight into the security and privacy landscape of the loaded webpage.

## 4. Time Estimate

Completing the initial analysis takes less than 5 minutes once uBO Scope is installed and a webpage is loaded.

## 5. Difficulty Level

Beginner – no advanced configuration or technical knowledge required.

## 6. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup

1. Locate the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser’s toolbar—typically identified by the uBO Scope logo.
2. Click the icon to open the popup interface.

**Expected Result:** The popup window opens, displaying domain connection data related to the active tab.

### Step 2: Understand the Hostname Header

- At the top of the popup, observe the two-part hostname display:
  - The first part shows the subdomain or prefix portion (if applicable).
  - The second part shows the main domain (effective top-level domain).

**Use Case:** This confirms the primary domain of the tab you are evaluating.

### Step 3: Review the Summary Count

- Below the header, the `domains connected` summary shows the total number of distinct third-party domains contacted during page load.
- This count matches the toolbar badge count dynamically.

**Tip:** Lower numbers often mean fewer third-party connections, which can suggest stronger privacy.

### Step 4: Explore the Domain Lists Sections

- The popup divides domains into three clear sections:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains successfully contacted.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where redirects or stealth techniques prevented direct detection but were logged.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where the extension or browser blocked requests.

- Each section lists domains with a count showing how many requests were made.

**Tip:** Use this to see which third-party servers your browser is talking to or blocking.

### Step 5: Interpreting Individual Domains

- Domains are shown in Unicode to ensure readability of internationalized domain names.
- The count column reflects the number of times each domain was contacted.

**Decision Point:** If you notice unexpected or suspicious third-party domains, consider whether they should be blocked or monitored further.

### Step 6: Refresh and Monitor Updates

- As you browse or reload the page in the active tab, re-open the popup or click the uBO Scope icon again to see updated connection data.

**Expected Result:** The popup reflects up-to-date network connection information.

## 7. Practical Example

You visit `https://example.com` and open the uBO Scope popup:

- The top hostname shows 'www' as the first part, and 'example.com' as the domain.
- The summary reads 'domains connected: 18', indicating 18 distinct third-party domains.
- In **Not Blocked**, you see domains like `cdn.examplecdn.com` with counts reflecting multiple requests.
- In **Stealth-Blocked**, you might see a domain like `ads.redirectexample.com` where redirects occur.
- In **Blocked**, domains such as `tracker.badsite.com` might appear, indicating blocked requests.

This overview immediately informs you about third-party activity on the page.

## 8. Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting and Tips for uBO Scope Popup">  
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists">  
- Verify you have an active tab with a loaded web page.
- Ensure the extension has permissions and is not blocked by browser settings.
- Refresh the active tab, then re-open the popup.
- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled in your browser extensions list.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Why Do Some Domains Appear in Multiple Sections?">  
- Each domain is categorized by the outcome of its network requests.
- Redirects could categorize a domain as stealth-blocked;
- Successful requests appear as allowed.
- Some domains might have requests with different outcomes.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Understanding Unicode Domain Names">  
- Domains are converted using Punycode to Unicode for readability.
- Internationalized domain names show their native scripts correctly.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Best Practices for Monitoring Third-Parties">  
- Review domains regularly to detect unexpected external connections.
- Use the counts to identify frequently contacted domains.
- Combine with content blocker settings to adjust blocking rules.

## Appendix: How the Popup Works (Technical Overview)

The popup uses data collected by the background script which listens to network requests via the browser’s `webRequest` API. It categorizes requests into three buckets:

- **Allowed:** Requests that completed successfully.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed or were stopped.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests involving redirects or stealth blocking behaviors.

Connecting domains and counts are deserialized and displayed in the popup's sections, dynamically showing the domains related to the active tab.

While this appendix is for advanced understanding, your interaction remains simple: open the popup, read the data, and act accordingly.
