# Running Your First Network Connection Analysis with uBO Scope

Unlock the power of uBO Scope’s real-time network monitoring to see exactly which remote servers your browser connects to on any active tab. This guide walks you through opening the popup interface, understanding the toolbar badge's significance, and interpreting connection details — helping you grasp the essence of what uBO Scope reveals.

---

## 1. What This Guide Helps You Achieve

- Open and explore uBO Scope’s popup UI for the active browser tab.
- Understand the toolbar badge count and what it represents.
- Interpret the categorization of domains by connection outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).
- Learn to view detailed real-time connection data per tab.

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your browser.
- You are on a webpage with network activity (ideally one that loads resources from multiple domains).
- Familiarity with basic browser extension UI interactions.

### Expected Outcome

- Successfully open uBO Scope’s popup window.
- Identify the active tab's hostname and domain displayed.
- Understand the toolbar icon badge count as an indicator of distinct third-party connections.
- Confidently distinguish between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked remote server domains listed.

### Time Estimate

About **5–10 minutes** to complete this hands-on walkthrough.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner — the workflow is aimed at users new to uBO Scope but comfortable with browser basics.

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Opening the uBO Scope popup window">
1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar; it shows a numeric badge when network connections exist.
2. Click the icon to open its popup window.
--
**Expected result:**
- The popup UI loads, initially showing the current active tab's connection overview.
- The page header displays the tab’s hostname and domain.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpreting the toolbar badge count">
1. Observe the numeric badge on the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
2. Understand this count represents how many **distinct third-party domains** your browser connected to on the active tab.
3. Remember: a lower badge count generally means fewer third-party connections, which can indicate better privacy.
--
**Expected result:**
- You see a number badge or no badge (if no connections recorded).
- You understand this number does not count blocked requests but allowed third-party connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Reviewing the popup UI domain sections">
1. Within the popup, locate the three distinct sections titled:
   - "not blocked"
   - "stealth-blocked"
   - "blocked"
2. Each section lists domains connected to the active tab, aggregated with counts.
3. Click or hover over entries to confirm domain names if needed.
--
**Expected result:**
- Domains under "not blocked" are third parties your browser connected to successfully.
- "stealth-blocked" domains indicate those that were redirected stealthily (e.g., silently blocked but still tracked).
- "blocked" domains are those for which connection attempts were actively blocked or failed.
</Step>
<Step title="Understanding domain counts and details">
1. Note the numeric count next to each domain — this shows how many requests were made to that domain.
2. Realize domain counts help prioritize which third-party servers are most active.
3. Use the summary line near the top to see total distinct domains connected.
--
**Expected result:**
- You get a quantified view of network activity for allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- You understand which domains are more dominant in network requests.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Example Usage Scenario

Imagine you visit a news website known to rely on multiple content delivery networks (CDNs) and advertising servers. When you open uBO Scope:

- The toolbar badge shows a count of '7', indicating seven distinct third-party domains connected.
- Opening the popup, you see the main site’s domain at the top.
- The "not blocked" section lists CDN domains and essential service providers.
- The "stealth-blocked" section includes a few ad servers quietly redirected or suppressed.
- The "blocked" section shows domains to which connection was attempted but failed due to content blocking.

This clear segregation helps you understand how your content blocker affects the browsing experience and what third-party connections occur behind the scenes.

## 4. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Refresh after page load:**  For accurate data, open uBO Scope **after** the page has fully loaded to see the complete set of connections.
- **Interpreting stealth-blocked:** Some domains might be stealth-blocked, meaning requests were intercepted or altered silently; these can impact privacy without obvious UI feedback.
- **Badge absence means no connections:** If no badge appears, either no network connections have occurred yet or they were all blocked.
- **Use on diverse sites:** Test on different sites to observe varying network patterns and domain behaviors.
- **Combine with core concept guides:** Deepen your understanding by reading about how uBO Scope classifies domain statuses.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Popup Usage Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup remains blank or shows 'NO DATA'">
- Ensure the tab is active and has network activity.
- Reload the page to generate new network requests.
- Verify that uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Toolbar badge shows no count despite page loading multiple resources">
- Confirm uBO Scope has necessary permissions (check extension settings).
- Some network connections may happen outside `webRequest` API access and may not be counted.
- Try a different webpage known to have distinct third-party connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains appear but counts seem inconsistent">
- Counts reflect distinct request outcomes; some requests may be retried or redirected.
- 'Stealth-blocked' domains indicate background redirects; results here might be less intuitive.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
If persistent issues occur, consider visiting the Troubleshooting and Limitations guide for detailed diagnostics. Restarting the browser sometimes resolves extension state syncing problems.
