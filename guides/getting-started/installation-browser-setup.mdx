# Installing and Setting Up uBO-Scope

## Overview
This guide walks you through installing uBO-Scope in your preferred browser—Chrome or Firefox—covering all necessary permissions and initial setup steps. By following this guide, you will have uBO-Scope ready to monitor and report network connections with minimal friction.

### Why Install uBO-Scope?
uBO-Scope exposes and categorizes all network connections your browser makes or attempts to make, providing valuable transparency into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party servers.

---

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure:
- You have Google Chrome (version 122 or higher) or Mozilla Firefox (version 128 or higher) installed.
- You have internet access to visit the official addon stores.
- You are aware that uBO-Scope requires permissions to access web requests and tabs for accurate monitoring.


## Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### 1. Choose Your Browser
- **Chrome:** Supported from version 122 onwards.
- **Firefox:** Supported from version 128 onwards.

### 2. Access the Official Extension Store

| Browser  | Install From                                           |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Chrome   | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)                    |
| Firefox  | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)        |

### 3. Install the Extension
- Click `Add to Chrome` or `Add to Firefox` as appropriate.
- Confirm any permission requests prompted by the browser. uBO-Scope requests:
  - Access to active tabs (`activeTab`) so it can obtain data about the current page.
  - Web request information (`webRequest`) to monitor network connections accurately.
  - Local storage (`storage`) to store session data persistently.

### 4. Verify Installation
- After installation, ensure the uBO-Scope icon appears next to your browser’s address bar.
- The icon typically displays a badge count indicating the number of third-party remote servers connected in the active tab.

<Tip>
Permissions are essential: uBO-Scope relies on access to network requests and tab data to provide meaningful insights. Denying these permissions will prevent the extension from working as expected.
</Tip>

### 5. Pin the Extension for Quick Access (Optional)
- In Chrome, click the puzzle piece icon, then click the pin icon next to uBO-Scope.
- In Firefox, click the extensions icon and select “Pin to toolbar”.

### 6. Open the uBO-Scope Popup for the First Time
- Click the uBO-Scope icon to open its popup UI.
- Initially, you will see network connection data related to the current tab, including the number of distinct domains connected.

## What Happens Behind the Scenes?

- Upon installation and activation, uBO-Scope starts listening to your browser’s web requests.
- It categorizes connections into:
  - **Allowed:** Connections that succeeded.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that are redirected or quietly prevented.
  - **Blocked:** Requests that failed due to blocking.
- Network request outcomes dynamically update the toolbar badge count.
