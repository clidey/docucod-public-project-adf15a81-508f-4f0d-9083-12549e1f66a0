# How uBO Scope Monitors Network Requests

uBO Scope provides a transparent window into the network activity of your browser by leveraging the browser’s native `webRequest` API. This enables real-time monitoring of all attempted and successful network requests, particularly those connecting to third-party remote servers, which are a critical factor in assessing web privacy.

---

## 1. Overview: What uBO Scope Tracks

At its core, uBO Scope is designed to:

- **Capture all network requests** made by your browser, including redirects, successful connections, and errors.
- **Classify these requests** into three distinct categories:
  - **Allowed**: Requests that went through successfully.
  - **Blocked**: Requests that failed or were explicitly blocked.
  - **Stealth-blocked**: Redirected requests that were prevented from completing.

By focusing on unique domains contacted, especially third-party domains, uBO Scope helps you understand the breadth of your browser’s network exposure.

### Why Third-Party Domains Matter

Third-party connections, often to trackers, CDNs, or ad servers, represent privacy risks and potential data leaks. uBO Scope counts the number of **distinct third-party remote servers** contacted to give you an accurate sense of your browsing footprint.

---

## 2. How uBO Scope Uses the webRequest API

The extension listens to three critical network events through the browser's `webRequest` API:

| Event               | Description                                                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `onBeforeRedirect`  | Triggered when a network request is about to be redirected       |
| `onErrorOccurred`   | Triggered when a network request fails or is blocked             |
| `onResponseStarted` | Triggered at the start of a successful response                   |

These listeners feed into uBO Scope's internal logic, which records outcomes against each network request.

### Event Processing Flow

- **Redirects:** Marked as stealth-blocked, the system tracks when a request doesn’t complete due to redirection.
- **Errors:** Classified as blocked requests, representing explicit failures or blocks.
- **Successes:** Requests with a valid IP or status code are logged as allowed. If these conditions are not met, the success is downgraded to an error.

This ensures accurate classification regardless of the underlying content blockers or DNS-level filtering active in your browser.

---

## 3. Tab-Level Aggregation and Real-Time Feedback

uBO Scope maintains connection data aggregated by browser tab, allowing you to inspect the network activity on a per-tab basis. This approach offers actionable insights tailored to your browsing context.

### What Happens Internally?

- Each network request is tied to a tab ID.
- The extension tracks domains and hostnames in each outcome category.
- The badge on the extension icon reports the number of distinct **allowed** third-party domains per active tab.
- The popup panel visually displays detailed connection data for that tab, broken down by allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

### Sample User Flow

1. You navigate to a website.
2. uBO Scope captures all network requests triggered by that page.
3. The badge updates dynamically, displaying the count of unique allowed third-party domains.
4. You click the extension icon to open the popup.
5. The popup shows domains grouped by their connection outcome, giving you granular visibility.

## 4. Limitations and Cross-Browser Behavior

While uBO Scope offers powerful visibility, it's important to understand its limitations:

- **Only Network Requests Exposed via the webRequest API Are Visible:** Some browser platform internals or extensions might bypass `webRequest` or make network calls invisible to extensions, which uBO Scope cannot detect.
- **Browser API Differences:** Though the extension supports Chromium-based, Firefox, and Safari browsers, differences in API availability or network request processing may affect data granularity.
- **No API Coverage for Network Requests Outside the Tab:** Requests made outside the active browsing context (e.g., background service workers, other apps) are outside the scope.

Despite these restrictions, the extension provides consistent, actionable data about real, third-party server connections relevant to privacy.

---

## 5. Understanding the Badge Count

The badge count on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon represents the current tab’s number of **distinct third-party domains that successfully allowed network requests**.

### Why Is This Valuable?

- **Lower is Better:** A lower count means fewer third-party servers are contacted, which typically indicates a smaller online footprint.
- **Not a Block Counter:** The badge is not a block count; it does not measure how many requests were blocked.
- **Misconceptions Cleared:** A content blocker that blocks more requests does not necessarily mean better privacy if it allows connections to many third-party domains.

---

## 6. Inspecting the Popup Panel

When you open the extension popup, uBO Scope presents a detailed breakdown:

- **Page Hostname:** Displayed prominently, including separated subdomain and registered domain using Punycode decoding for internationalized domains.
- **Summary:** Total count of unique domains contacted in the current tab.
- **Categories:** Separate sections for Not Blocked, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked domains, showing domain names and connection counts.

This design helps you quickly identify which third-party servers are interacting with the page and how your content blocker or network policies impact these connections.

---

## Example: Understanding a Network Request Outcome

Consider a network request made by the current tab to `cdn.example.com`:

- The `hostnameFromURI` utility extracts the hostname from the request URL.
- Using the public suffix list, `domainFromHostname` computes the registered domain, e.g., `example.com`.
- Depending on the outcome event (`success`, `error`, or `redirect`), the request is categorized and counted under Allowed, Blocked, or Stealth-blocked.
- The domain count increments accordingly.

---

## 7. Practical Tips for Users

- **Use the Badge to Gauge Privacy Exposure:** Monitor the distinct allowed domain count as an indicator of how many third-party servers your browsing currently touches.
- **Open the Popup for Details:** Identify exact domains and how connections are classified.
- **Refresh the Page if Data Seems Missing:** Sometimes network activity is still catching up.
- **Remember the Limitations:** Not all connections can be tracked due to platform constraints.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Network Monitoring Issues">
<Accordion title='Badge Count Not Updating'>
If the badge count does not update:

- Make sure the extension has the necessary permissions.
- Reload the active tab.
- Confirm the browser version meets minimum requirements (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Check for conflicts with other extensions using the `webRequest` API.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Popup Panel Shows "NO DATA" or Blank'>

- Ensure you have an active tab loaded with a webpage.
- Some local pages (`file://`, browser settings) have no network requests.
- Try reloading the tab and reopening the popup.
- Verify network activity is actually occurring (e.g., by interacting with the page).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Connections Not Classified Correctly'>

- This might happen if the browser’s `webRequest` API is limited by browser settings or privacy modes.
- Network requests triggered by service workers or native apps are invisible.
- uBO Scope does not track non-http(s)/ws(s) protocols.
</Accordion>
