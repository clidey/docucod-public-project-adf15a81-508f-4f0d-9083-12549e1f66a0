# First Look: Interpreting the Popup

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you understand the uBO Scope popup interface, empowering you to quickly interpret connection summaries for the active browser tab. You'll learn how to read the key sections showing third-party domains, connection outcomes, and grasp the core value of uBO Scope at a glance.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and enabled in your supported browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- At least one active browser tab with network activity.
- Basic familiarity with browser extensions and tabs.

### Expected Outcome
After following this guide, you will confidently read uBO Scope's popup, identify the connection status of third-party domains, understand the badge counts, and recognize which connections are potentially privacy-sensitive.

### Time Estimate
5-10 minutes

### Difficulty Level
Beginner

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup
1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup window will appear, showing summary data for the active tab.

**Expected Result:** The popup displays the hostname of the current tab at the top, with summary statistics below.

### Step 2: Understand the Header Hostname Display
- The header shows the current tab’s **hostname** (e.g., example.com).
- If the hostname is a subdomain (e.g., mail.example.com), the display splits it to visually separate the subdomain portion from the base domain.

**Why this matters:**
This helps contextualize third-party connections relative to the primary site you are browsing.

### Step 3: Read the Summary Section
- This section shows the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to while loading the page.
- The count reflects **unique domains from which resources were successfully fetched and not blocked**.

**Success criteria:**
A lower count generally suggests fewer third-party connections, which could indicate better privacy.

### Step 4: Explore the Outcome Sections
The popup divides third-party domains into three outcome-based sections:

1. **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which connections were allowed.
2. **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were stealth-blocked by your content blocker (requests not completed but hidden from the webpage).
3. **Blocked:** Domains whose requests were blocked outright.

Each section lists:
- A domain name.
- The number of individual requests from that domain.

**Interpreting these:**
- Domains in **Not Blocked** are third parties providing resources.
- **Stealth-Blocked** domains indicate blocked connections that do not trigger webpage breakage or detection.
- **Blocked** shows domains fully prevented from connecting.

### Step 5: Identify Important Third-Party Domains
- Pay attention to domains with higher request counts, as they represent more active behind-the-scenes connections.
- Recognize familiar domain names (e.g., analytics providers, ad servers, CDNs).

**Practical Tip:**
Focus on reducing unwanted third-party connections by evaluating the domains in the allowed category.

### Step 6: Confirm Data Accuracy
- If you see ‘NO DATA’ or missing counts:
  - Ensure the extension has necessary permissions.
  - Reload the active tab and reopen the popup.
  - Refer to troubleshooting guides if issues persist.

**Verification:**
The badge on the toolbar icon should match the count seen in the popup summary.

## Examples & Visual Guidance

### Example Popup Layout
```plaintext
--------------------------------------------------
| mail.    example.com                            |  <- Hostname header shows subdomain separated
--------------------------------------------------
| domains connected: 5                           |  <- Summary showing 5 distinct third-party domains
--------------------------------------------------
| not blocked                                   |
|  - cdn.example.net (3)                        |
|  - analytics.service.io (2)                   |
--------------------------------------------------
| stealth-blocked                               |
|  - tracker.example.org (1)                    |
--------------------------------------------------
| blocked                                       |
|  - ads.server.com (4)                         |
--------------------------------------------------
```

### Real-World Scenario
If you visit a news website and see many third-party connections under 'not blocked', you might suspect heavy tracking or ad-serving activity.

Using uBO Scope, you can validate whether your content blocker stealth-blocks or blocks these domains properly.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Popup Issues">
<Accordion title="No Data or 'NO DATA' Displayed in Header">
- Verify the extension permission settings to allow access to all sites.
- Reload the active tab and reopen the popup.
- Check if your browser version meets supported minimum requirements.
- Consult the Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues guide.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Match Popup Summary">
- Close and reopen the popup to refresh data.
- Clear browser session data by restarting the browser.
- Disable conflicting extensions that might interfere with network monitoring.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains Appear in Unexpected Sections">
- Understand that some domains may shift categories between stealth-blocked and blocked depending on your content blockers.
- Use additional privacy tools to analyze domain behavior for confirmation.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Remember, not all third-party domains are harmful. Many are legitimate content delivery networks. Use uBO Scope to gain transparency, then decide if connections match your privacy expectations.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Popup data only reflects active tab network activity and is subject to browser and extension permissions. Data for background tabs or certain network types may not be reported.
</Warning>

## Visual Reference

The popup UI uses color coding:
- Green shades for **Not Blocked** section.
- Red shades for **Stealth-Blocked** and **Blocked** sections.

This visual cue aids rapid scanning of connection security.
