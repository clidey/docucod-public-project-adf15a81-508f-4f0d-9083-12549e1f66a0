# First Use: Exploring Remote Connections with uBO-Scope

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with uBO-Scope! This guide walks you through opening the extension’s popup interface, understanding the network connection details it reveals, and interpreting the badge counts and domain lists it displays. You will quickly gain practical insight into the remote servers your browser connects to when visiting webpages.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### Task Description
Discover which remote servers your browser communicates with, how they are categorized by connection outcome, and what the badge count on the toolbar icon indicates.

### Prerequisites
- uBO-Scope installed and enabled in your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- An active browser tab loading a website that makes network requests.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide you will:
- Open the uBO-Scope popup UI.
- Identify the connected domains categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- Understand the badge count meaning and how it relates to domain connectivity.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 5 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner.

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Locate and Open the uBO-Scope Popup
- Find the uBO-Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
- Click the icon to open the popup panel.

**Expected Result:** The popup should appear showing domains related to the active webpage.

### Step 2: Read the Tab Hostname Heading
- At the top, the heading shows the exact hostname and domain of the current tab.
- Hostnames may include subdomain parts, while the domain represents the registered domain.

### Step 3: Understand the Badge Count
- The badge count on the toolbar icon shows the number of **distinct third-party domains** your browser has connected to on the active tab.
- A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, generally preferred for privacy.

### Step 4: Explore the Connection Outcome Sections
The popup categorizes connected domains into three clear groups:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains for which network requests succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains involved in redirects or stealth blocking; connections attempted but have stealth blocking behavior.
- **Blocked:** Domains from which requests were blocked or resulted in errors.

For each category, domains appear alongside a count indicating the number of network requests observed.

### Step 5: Analyze Domain Rows
- Each domain row shows the punycode-decoded domain name and the request count.
- This helps identify which third-party services are active and their relative request volume.

### Step 6: Verify the Summary Count
- Under the heading "domains connected" is a summary of all unique domains counted in the allowed section.
- This number should match the badge count on the toolbar icon.

### Step 7: Use the Extension During Web Browsing
- Visit different websites.
- Open the popup to observe how domain connections and badge counts change in real time.

This workflow demonstrates uBO-Scope’s core purpose: providing transparent visibility into all remote server connections attempted or made by web pages.

## 3. Examples & Visual Guide

### Real-World Scenario
You browse to a news website:
- The popup shows 5 allowed domains (CDNs, analytics, advertising servers).
- 2 stealth-blocked domains are listed indicating background redirects.
- 3 blocked domains represent trackers or ads your content blocker stopped.
- The toolbar badge shows "5", indicating the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.

### Popup Structure Sample
```html
<h2 id="tabHostname"><span>subdomain.</span><span>example.com</span></h2>
<section id="summary">
  domains connected: <span>5</span>
</section>
<section class="outcome allowed">
  <h3>not blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains">
    <div class="row"><span class="domain">cdn.example.net</span><span class="count badge">10</span></div>
    <div class="row"><span class="domain">analytics.othersite.io</span><span class="count badge">4</span></div>
    <!-- more domains -->
  </div>
</section>
<!-- stealth and blocked sections similar -->
```

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Popup shows NO DATA or is empty:**
  - Ensure the current tab has successfully loaded and initiated network requests.
  - Confirm uBO-Scope has permissions granted (activeTab, webRequest).
  - Reload the tab and reopen the popup.

- **Badge count does not update:**
  - Reload the page to trigger fresh network requests.
  - Check if uBO-Scope is enabled and the browser supports the required APIs.

- **Stealth-blocked or blocked sections are empty:**
  - This means no network requests were stealth-blocked or blocked on the current tab, which can be normal depending on the site.

### Best Practices
- Use the popup after pages have fully loaded to see complete connection data.
- Interpret lower badge counts as potentially stronger privacy preservation.
- Use uBO-Scope alongside your content blocker to independently verify blocking effectiveness.

### Performance Considerations
- uBO-Scope monitors network requests efficiently in the background and updates data every second; you may notice slight delays after navigation.

### Alternative Approaches
- For advanced users: integrate results from uBO-Scope with other privacy tools or filter list evaluation workflows.

<AccordionGroup title="Quick Reference">
<Accordion title="What does the badge count represent?">
The badge count shows the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to from the active tab, focusing on allowed (not blocked) connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What are stealth-blocked domains?">
Stealth-blocked domains are those involved in redirect chains or network requests that were blocked stealthily to avoid detection or breakage.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How to refresh connection data in the popup?">
Simply reload the active tab’s page to generate new network requests, then open or refresh the popup.

<Tip>
uBO-Scope complements content blockers but measures distinct third-party connections independently, giving an honest picture of network traffic transparency.
