# Your First Look: Navigating the uBO Scope Popup

Discover how to open the uBO Scope popup interface, understand its layout, and interpret the color-coded information presenting allowed, blocked, and stealth connections. This guide takes you step-by-step through the popup’s core elements so you can confidently monitor network activity right from your browser toolbar.

---

## Workflow Overview

**What this guide helps you do:** Understand the structure, meaning, and navigation of the uBO Scope popup interface — the main tool for viewing network request outcomes per active tab.

**Prerequisites:**
- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
- An active browser tab with network activity (a webpage loaded).

**Expected Outcome:**
- You will know how to open the popup.
- You will be able to interpret the hostname and domain shown.
- You will understand the three connection outcome categories: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- You will identify domain counts and request numbers.

**Time Estimate:** 3-5 minutes.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using the uBO Scope Popup

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
To view detailed connection information for the current tab:

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- The popup window opens, showing your current tab's network connection summary.

**Expected Result:** The popup displays the hostname at the top, the summary of connected domains, and three sections listing domains by connection outcome.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify the Hostname and Domain">
At the top, you see two key pieces of information:

- **Hostname:** The full hostname of the current tab’s webpage, displayed in Unicode (human-readable) form.
- **Domain:** Shown as part of the hostname header, this is the registered domain portion determined via the Public Suffix List.

If the hostname differs from the domain, both are displayed distinctly for clarity.

**Tip:** This helps distinguish subdomains from the primary site.

**Expected Result:** The popup’s header shows your tab’s hostname, including the domain portion.
</Step>

<Step title="Understand the Domains Connected Summary">
Directly below the header is the **summary section**:

- It displays the count of **distinct domains** contacted by the current webpage.
- This number represents third-party remote servers your browser communicates with.

**Why it matters:**
- The count reflects unique third-party domains, providing a quick overview of your tab’s network footprint.

**Expected Result:** A number indicating how many distinct domains were connected.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Connection Outcomes">
The main body shows three distinct sections, each with a heading and list of domains:

1. **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which connections were allowed.
2. **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were stealth-blocked (redirected or otherwise intercepted quietly).
3. **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were actively blocked.

Each domain entry includes:

- The domain name displayed in Unicode for readability.
- A badge with the **number of requests** associated with that domain.

**How to use this:**
- Quickly spot which domains your current tab is communicating with and assess blocking results.

**Expected Result:** Each section populated with domains and request counts if applicable.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Domain and Request Counts">
- The **badge number** next to a domain reflects how many requests were made to that domain.
- A higher count indicates more network activity from/to that domain.
- Use this information to identify domains with frequent connections.

**Practical example:**
- If you see an unexpected domain with a high request count in the "Allowed" section, it might warrant a privacy review.

**Expected Result:** You can differentiate domains by activity intensity.
</Step>

<Step title="Close the Popup">
- Once you’re done reviewing, simply click outside the popup or click the toolbar icon again to close.

**Expected Result:** Popup closes, returning you to full browsing.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Interface Details and Visual Cues

<u><strong>Hostname and Domain Display</strong></u>
- Displayed with Unicode conversion for internationalized domains.
- Distinguishes subdomains from registered domain using separate spans.

<u><strong>Connection Outcome Sections</strong></u>
- **Allowed (greenish styling):** Represents domains for which connections successfully completed.
- **Stealth-Blocked (grayish styling):** Domains whose connection attempts were silently redirected or intercepted.
- **Blocked (reddish styling):** Domains whose network requests were actively blocked by uBO or underlying filters.

These color codings help immediate visual identification of connection status.

<u><strong>Domain Rows</strong></u>
- Each row contains a domain name and a count badge.
- Rows are dynamically generated and sorted alphabetically for easy scanning.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Refresh the popup after page navigation:** The data shown corresponds only to the active tab at the time of opening.
- **Interpreting "stealth-blocked":** These connections might not appear as blocked on webpages but have been intercepted at some stage.
- **Use the domain counts wisely:** A large number of distinct domains or unexpectedly high request counts can signal extensive third-party resource loading.
- **Localized domain names:** uBO Scope converts punycode domains back to Unicode; expect domain names to appear in their familiar forms.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Popup Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' or blank hostname">
This usually means uBO Scope has not yet collected data for the current tab.

- Ensure you have navigated to a webpage with network activity.
- Refresh the page and open the popup again.
- Confirm extension permissions are granted and it is enabled.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Counts don’t update after navigation">
Data refreshes only when the popup is opened anew or after navigation.

- Close and reopen the popup.
- Reload the current tab and try again.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain names appear strange or in punycode">
uBO Scope converts punycode domains to Unicode for readability.

- If you see punycode (xn--...), it might indicate rare or unusual domain names.
- This is expected behavior when Unicode conversion is not possible.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps & Related Documentation

- Proceed to **Interpreting Network Activity: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Connections** to deeply understand connection outcomes.
- Review **Troubleshooting Common Issues** if you face recurring popup or data display problems.
- Return to **Installation & Setup Guides** if uBO Scope does not appear to function or gather data.

## Explanation of Data Behind the Popup

- When the popup opens, the extension queries the active tab's connection data from the background service worker.
- The data contains three groups of domains by connection outcome (allowed, stealth, blocked).
- The popup script dynamically renders this data into the interface sections.

Understanding this flow helps when correlating popup display with actual network activity and diagnosing issues.
