# Interpreting the Toolbar Badge

Unlock the meaning behind uBO Scope’s badge count. Learn why a lower count is preferable, how it relates to 3rd-party remote servers, and how to use this info as a practical privacy health-check while browsing.

---

## 1. Understanding the Badge Count

### What Does the Badge Number Represent?
- The toolbar badge on uBO Scope shows the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** to which your browser connected for the currently active tab.
- Each count corresponds to a unique third-party domain that has successfully established at least one network connection.

### Why Is a Lower Badge Number Preferable?
- Fewer third-party connections generally indicate better privacy and reduced tracking surface.
- Many third-party domains belong to trackers, advertisers, or other unwanted services.
- While some third-party domains (e.g., Content Delivery Networks - CDNs) are necessary and benign, an unusually high count signals potential overexposure to such parties.

<Info>
The badge does *not* measure blocked connections. It only shows successful, allowed connections.

## 2. Relation to Third-Party Remote Servers

- uBO Scope counts **distinct third-party domains** contacted by the page, ignoring the number of requests per domain.
- This count focuses on domains outside the main domain of the current webpage.
- Third-party domains are often separate companies serving ads, analytics, or content resources.

### Example Scenario:
For a news website `example.com`:
- uBO Scope tracks how many different external domains like `adtracker.net`, `cdn.somelibrary.com`, or `analytics.company.com` your browser connected to while loading the page.
- The badge number reflects the total count of these unique third-party domains.

### What the Badge Does Not Include:
- First-party domains (same as the main page domain).
- Failed or blocked network requests (these appear in the popup but do not increase the badge).

## 3. How to Use the Badge as a Privacy Health-Check

### Step 1: Observe the Badge Number
- When you visit a website, check the uBO Scope badge.
- A **low number** (e.g., 0 to a handful) usually means fewer third-party connections.
- A **high number** can mean numerous trackers or excessive third-party requests.

### Step 2: Open the Popup Panel for Details
- Click the badge or extension icon to see the popup panel.
- Review the categorized lists:
  - **Not blocked** (allowed connections)
  - **Stealth-blocked** (invisible blocking by content blockers)
  - **Blocked** (explicitly blocked connections)

### Step 3: Interpret the Information
- Check which third-party domains are connected.
- Consider if these servers are expected or necessary.
- Use this insight to adjust your browsing habits or content blocker settings.

### Step 4: Track Changes Over Time
- Notice if specific sites consistently produce high badge numbers.
- Use uBO Scope to compare the effectiveness of content blockers or filters.

<Warning>
Do not rely solely on the badge count to judge your content blocker’s performance. A low badge count means fewer third-party connections, which is a better privacy indicator than block counts or other metrics.
</Warning>

## 4. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Use the badge as a quick indicator:** Before delving into detailed network analysis, the badge number gives an immediate sense of third-party connectivity.
- **Combine with popup insights:** The badge count is a summary; the popup shows details and categories for deeper understanding.
- **Keep your content blockers active:** uBO Scope reports actual network requests *after* any content blocker took effect.
- **Be aware of necessary third parties:** Some third-party domains are essential for site functionality (e.g., CDNs). The badge count alone doesn’t distinguish benign from harmful.

<Note>
A lower badge count generally aligns with improved privacy but always review domain identities in the popup for context.
</Note>

## 5. Common Misinterpretations and Pitfalls

| Misinterpretation                | Reality                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A higher block count means better blocking | uBO Scope badge shows allowed connections, not blocks. Watching allowed domains is a stronger privacy metric.|
| Zero badge on some sites means perfect privacy | Some sites may not establish third-party connections; others may use different tracking methods not visible here. |
| Badge reflects total network requests | It reflects distinct remote domains successfully connected, regardless of request volume per domain.            |

<Warning>
Avoid drawing conclusions solely from raw badge numbers without considering domain context and category.
</Warning>

## 6. Verifying Badge Accuracy

If you suspect the badge count is incorrect or not updating:

1. **Refresh the active tab:** Badge updates occur on network events; reloading the page triggers fresh data.
2. **Ensure permissions are granted:** The extension requires appropriate browser permissions to monitor network requests.
3. **Check for conflicts:** Some browser configurations or additional extensions may affect webRequest API reporting.
4. **Review the popup panel:** Confirm if the domain lists match the badge count.

<Tip>
If badge remains empty or frozen despite network activity, consult troubleshooting guides on setup and compatibility.
</Tip>

## 7. Summary

| Badge Role                          | Description                                            |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Displays number                   | Unique third-party remote domains connected per active tab.
| Indicates privacy exposure       | Fewer unique third-party connections = better privacy.
| Supports user evaluation         | Quick health-check of browsing privacy at a glance.
