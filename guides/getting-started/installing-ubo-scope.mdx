uBO Scope requires specific browser permissions to operate effectively:

After installation:

1. Click on the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
2. The popup will load and display the domains accessed by the active tab.
3. The badge count on the extension icon should show the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.

If you see "NO DATA" or the count remains zero after visiting active websites, refer to troubleshooting tips.
