## Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### 1. Choose Your Browser Store

| Browser                 | Store Link                                              |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium-based Browsers  | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox                 | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |

&nbsp;

### 2. Installing from the Extension Store

#### For Chromium-Based Browsers
- Navigate to the [Chrome Web Store link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
- Click **Add to Chrome** (or the equivalent button in your browser).
- Confirm any permission prompts.

#### For Firefox
- Go to the [Firefox Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
- Click **Add to Firefox**.
- Approve any permissions requests.

#### For Safari
- Access the Safari Extensions section in the App Store or your browser's extension management interface.
- Find uBO Scope and install.


### 3. Initial Setup After Installation
- Once installed, locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. It uses recognizable uBO Scope branding icons at various sizes (16x16 to 128x128 px).
- Click the icon to open the uBO Scope popup interface.
- On first launch, uBO Scope initializes its background processes and loads the Public Suffix List to correctly categorize connections.


### 4. Verifying Installation
- The toolbar icon badge will display a numeric count indicating the number of distinct third-party remote domains connected by the active tab.
- Clicking the icon opens the popup showing connection details grouped as **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** domains.
- Confirm that this data updates as you load webpages.


---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices
- Ensure your browser is updated to meet the minimum version to guarantee compatibility with Manifest v3 and the WebRequest API.
- If installing manually (e.g., loading unpacked extension), make sure to include the correct `manifest.json` for your browser platform.
- Familiarize yourself with the badge count meaning: a lower number reflects fewer distinct third-party connections, generally indicating better privacy.
- Do not confuse the uBO Scope connection count with content blocking metrics; uBO Scope reveals connections irrespective of which blocker or DNS filtering you use.


---

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### Problem: uBO Scope icon does not appear or badge does not update
- Verify the extension is enabled in the browser's extensions manager.
- Reload the browser or restart it after installation.
- Ensure your browser meets the minimum required version.

### Problem: Permissions error or missing WebRequest data
- Confirm that the extension has been granted the necessary permissions at install time.
- On some browsers, ensure you accept the permissions prompt fully.
- Check that no other extension or browser setting blocks access to the WebRequest API.

### Problem: No domain data in popup
- Allow a moment for uBO Scope to gather connection data after opening the popup.
- Visit a website known to load resources from multiple domains to see data populate.
- If the problem persists, try disabling conflicting extensions and reinstalling.

<Tip>
If you face installation issues, consult the browser's extension troubleshooting guidelines, ensure compatibility, and visit uBO Scope's GitHub repository for issue tracking:

## About uBO Scope
uBO Scope is a lightweight extension designed to transparently reveal all connections—both attempted and successful—to remote servers from your browser. It works alongside content blockers, relying on the browser’s WebRequest API to report network activity independent of your blocking setup.

<Info>
Remember, the toolbar badge reflects the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected during page loading. This insight helps users better assess their actual exposure to external services beyond simple block counts.
