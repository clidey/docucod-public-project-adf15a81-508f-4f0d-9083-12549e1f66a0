# Installing uBO Scope

A step-by-step walkthrough for installing uBO Scope on Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers. This guide covers where to find official builds, installation steps for each supported browser, and how to verify your installation was successful.

---

## 1. Overview

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to transparently report all remote server connections initiated by your browser. Installing it correctly ensures you can monitor third-party network connections and better understand your browser’s exposure.

## 2. Supported Browsers and Requirements

- **Chromium-based browsers:** Chrome 122+ and compatible browsers
- **Firefox:** Version 128+
- **Safari:** Version 18.5+

Ensure your browser version meets these minimums to guarantee compatibility.


## 3. Where to Get uBO Scope

Install uBO Scope only from the official and secure sources for each browser to ensure you get a trusted build:

| Browser       | Official Installation Source                                                              |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium      | [Chrome Web Store - uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox       | [Firefox Add-ons - uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)         |
| Safari        | From the official Apple Extensions Gallery (search for 'uBO Scope')                        |


## 4. Installation Steps by Browser

### Chromium (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)

1. Open the Chrome Web Store link above.
2. Click on **Add to Chrome**.
3. Review permissions requested by uBO Scope. It requires access to monitor network requests.
4. Confirm by clicking **Add extension**.
5. The extension icon for uBO Scope will appear near the address bar.


### Firefox

1. Visit the Firefox Add-ons link above.
2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Allow requested permissions when prompted.
4. Click **Add** to complete installation.
5. The uBO Scope icon will appear in your toolbar.


### Safari

1. Open the Safari Extensions Gallery or App Store.
2. Search for 'uBO Scope'.
3. Click **Get** or **Install** for the extension.
4. After installation, enable the extension in Safari’s Preferences under the Extensions tab.
5. The uBO Scope icon should now be visible in your Safari toolbar.


## 5. Verifying Your Installation

After installation, you must verify that uBO Scope is working correctly.

### What to check:
- The uBO Scope icon should be visible in your browser’s toolbar.
- When clicking the icon, a popup panel should display connection data (
  see the [Launching and Using the Toolbar Popup](../../getting-started/first-steps/launching-ubo-scope) guide for usage).
- The badge count on the toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct third-party domains connected by the current tab.

### Basic Validation Steps:

1. Open a website you frequently visit.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. Confirm you see domains under categories "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" (some may be empty).
4. Check that the badge number is displayed and corresponds to the count of distinct connected domains.

If these conditions are met, uBO Scope is installed and functioning.


## 6. Troubleshooting Installation Issues

- If you don’t see the extension icon after installing, restart your browser.
- Ensure the browser version is supported (see section 2).
- Verify permissions were granted; the extension requires `webRequest` and `storage` permissions.
- Conflicts may occur with other privacy/security extensions; consider temporarily disabling them to check.
- For zero badge count despite visiting websites, consult the [Why Is My Badge Count Zero?](../../getting-started/troubleshooting/no-connections-badge) guide.


<Warning>
Never install uBO Scope from third-party or unofficial sites to avoid security risks.
</Warning>


## 7. Additional Tips

- Keep your browser updated to maintain compatibility with uBO Scope.
- If you uninstall and reinstall the extension, previous session data might be cleared.
- Use the linked validation and troubleshooting guides to deepen your understanding.


## 8. Next Steps
