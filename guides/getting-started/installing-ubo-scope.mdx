## 6. Verifying the Extension is Working

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Icon Does Not Appear After Installation">
- Ensure the extension was installed successfully and is enabled in your browser's extensions/settings page.
- Restart your browser and reload open tabs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Prompt Was Declined or Missing">
- Reinstall the extension and accept all permissions when prompted.
- Check the browser's extensions page to manually enable permissions if available.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Displays NO DATA Continuously">
- Visit several websites with known third-party connections to trigger data collection.
- Confirm that content blockers are not interfering (uBO Scope works alongside them but if very restrictive, might show limited data).
- Refer to the [Troubleshooting & Validation](../../getting-started/first-steps/troubleshooting) guide for further steps.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
