## 2. Browser-Specific Installation Steps

Follow the instructions for your browser below. Each method includes where to find the extension, permission prompts, and verification tips.

### 2.1 Chrome (Chromium-based Browsers)

1. Visit the [Chrome Web Store page for uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
2. Click **Add to Chrome**.
3. When prompted, review and accept the permissions needed:
   - Access to website data (to monitor network connections).
   - Storage access (to save session data).
   - WebRequest permission (to observe network requests).
4. Upon successful installation, the uBO Scope icon appears in your toolbar.

### 2.2 Firefox

1. Navigate to the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Review and accept the permission requests similar to Chrome.
4. Confirm the uBO Scope icon displays in the browser’s toolbar.

### 2.3 Safari

1. Safari support requires macOS version compatible with Safari 18.5 or higher.

3. Enable the extension in Safari’s Preferences > Extensions pane.
4. Verify the toolbar icon is visible.

## 3. Granting Necessary Permissions

uBO Scope requires these permissions to work correctly:

- **Host Permissions:** Access to all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket URLs so it can monitor network requests.
- **Storage:** To store session and public suffix list data.
- **WebRequest:** To listen to web request lifecycle events.

When installing, your browser will display dialogs requesting these permissions. Approve them to enable full functionality.

<Tip>
Denying permissions will prevent uBO Scope from properly tracking network connections. If denied accidentally, you can manage permissions manually from your browser’s extension settings.
</Tip>

## 4. Verifying Successful Installation

After installation and granting permissions:

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
2. Click the icon to open the popup.
3. If active data is available, you will see the current tab’s domain name, counts of connected domains, and categorized lists (not blocked, stealth-blocked, blocked).
4. The badge on the icon shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected to by the active tab.

If you see _NO DATA_ or the icon is missing, review the Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues guide.
