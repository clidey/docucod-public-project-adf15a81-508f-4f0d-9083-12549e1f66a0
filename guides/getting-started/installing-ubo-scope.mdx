# Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope

Welcome to the essential guide for installing and setting up uBO Scope. This guide walks you through acquiring and enabling the extension on your browser, understanding the required permissions, and tips to verify it is running correctly for the first time.

---

## 1. What You Will Achieve

By following this guide, you will:

- Install uBO Scope on your preferred supported browser (Chromium, Firefox, Safari).
- Grant the necessary permissions for full network connection monitoring.
- Verify the extension is active and reporting data.
- Understand basic initial setup tips for a smooth first run.


## 2. Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure:

- You are using a supported browser at or above the required version:
  - **Firefox 128+**
  - **Chromium 122+ (e.g., Chrome, Edge)**
  - **Safari 18.5+**
- You have a stable internet connection to download the extension.
- You have administrative or permission rights to install browser extensions.


## 3. Installing uBO Scope

### Step 1: Choose Your Browser

Identify the primary browser you want to use uBO Scope with. Depending on your browser, follow the appropriate installation step.

### Step 2: Access Official Extension Stores

Always install uBO Scope from official, trusted sources to ensure security and authenticity.

- **Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.)**
  - Visit the [Chrome Web Store - uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- **Firefox**
  - Visit the [Firefox Add-ons site - uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- **Safari**
  - Get uBO Scope from the Mac App Store or your Safari Extensions page, compatible with macOS supporting Safari 18.5+

### Step 3: Install the Extension

- Click the **Add to [Browser]** button in the store.
- Review requested permissions carefully; uBO Scope requires network and tab access to monitor connections.
- Confirm and complete the installation.


<Tip>
Make sure to install the extension version **1.0.1** or later to have the latest features and compatibility.
</Tip>

## 4. Understanding Permissions

uBO Scope needs specific permissions to function correctly:

- `activeTab`: To monitor the active browser tab.
- `storage`: To save session data and preferences locally.
- `webRequest`: To listen to network requests and gather connection information.
- `host_permissions`: To observe all HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket connections (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`).

Granting these permissions empowers uBO Scope to provide accurate insights into connections — essential for transparency and privacy monitoring.


## 5. Initial Setup and Confirmation

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope Popup

1. After installation, locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar (it should display the uBO Scope logo).
2. Click the icon to open the popup interface.

### Step 2: Navigate to a Website

Visit any website, preferably one that loads multiple resources (for example, https://www.wikipedia.org).

### Step 3: Observe the Popup Panel

The popup panel should now display:

- The hostname and domain of the active tab at the top.
- A summary showing the number of connected domains.
- Three categorized sections listing domains:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains with stealth blocking applied.
  - **Blocked**: Domains blocked by content blockers.

### Step 4: Confirm the Badge Count

Look at the uBO Scope icon badge count — it should reflect the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected.


<Check>

- If the popup shows NO DATA or no domains, it indicates no network data has been captured yet.
- The badge count should update as you visit different sites.

</Check>


## 6. Tips for a Smooth First Experience

- **Enable all requested permissions:** Restricting permissions may cause incomplete or no data to appear.
- **Avoid private/incognito windows initially:** Some browsers restrict extensions in private mode.
- **Refresh the webpage after installation:** To populate connection data for the active tab.
- **Use well-connected sites:** Sites with many third-party resources better illustrate uBO Scope’s capabilities.
