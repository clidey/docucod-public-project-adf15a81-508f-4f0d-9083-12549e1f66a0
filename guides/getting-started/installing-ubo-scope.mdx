## 5. Verifying Your Installation

After installation, verify that uBO Scope is operating correctly and can monitor your browsing activity.

### Verification Steps

1. Open any website in your browser.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. The popup shows three domain categories:
   - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
   - **Stealth-Blocked**
   - **Blocked**
4. Confirm the domain counts increase as web pages establish third-party connections.

If the popup shows 'NO DATA' persistently, or the badge count never updates:
- Check browser permissions.
- Restart the browser.
- Confirm no other blocking extension or browser setting is preventing network monitoring.
