## 2. Step-by-Step Installation and Enabling Instructions

### Step 1: Choose your browser
Locate the instructions that match your browser below.

---

### Chrome

#### 1.0. Access the Chrome Web Store
- Navigate to the [uBO Scope listing on the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).

#### 1.1. Install the Extension
- Click the **Add to Chrome** button.
- When prompted, confirm by clicking **Add Extension**.

#### 1.2. Confirm Installation
- Look for the uBO Scope icon on the toolbar (a small badge with a number will appear once it detects connections).

#### 1.3. Verify Permissions
- Chrome will ask for permissions including access to network requests (`webRequest`), activeTab, and storage.
- Ensure you accept these, or uBO Scope cannot function properly.

---

### Firefox

#### 2.0. Visit Firefox Add-ons
- Open [uBO Scope on Firefox Add-ons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).

#### 2.1. Install the Extension
- Click **Add to Firefox**.
- Confirm the permissions requested and click **Add**.

#### 2.2. Locate the Icon
- The uBO Scope icon will appear in the toolbar for easy popup access.

#### 2.3. Permissions Check
- Confirm that the extension has permission to read all web requests as it requires `webRequest` permission.

---

### Safari

#### 3.0. Installing on Safari
- For Safari (version 18.5 or later), uBO Scope is available through the [Safari Extensions Gallery](https://apps.apple.com/app/ubo-scope/idxxxxxx) or via manual installation if you have the developer package.

#### 3.1. Enable Extension
- After installation, open Safari > Preferences > Extensions.
- Locate uBO Scope and check the box to enable it.

#### 3.2. Confirm Permissions
- Safari requires explicit user enabling for webRequest and storage access.

---

### Step 2: Confirm the Extension is Active

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to a website you visit often.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
3. A popup will appear showing domains connected, broken down into 'not blocked,' 'stealth-blocked,' and 'blocked' categories.
4. The badge count on the icon indicates the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.

---

### Step 3: Optimize Browser Settings for Best Compatibility

- **Allow uBO Scope to run in private browsing/incognito:**
  - In Chrome and Firefox, go to extension options and enable the extension in incognito/private mode if desired.

- **Verify extension storage permissions:**
  - Confirm that storage permissions are granted; the extension uses local and session storage to save session data.

- **Avoid other extensions blocking uBO Scope:**
  - Some privacy/security extensions may interfere with uBO Scope’s `webRequest` listeners. If popup data is missing, check your other extensions’ settings.

- **Keep your browser updated:**
  - uBO Scope requires at least Chrome 122, Firefox 128, or Safari 18.5 as per manifest requirements.

## 3. Examples & Verification

### Example: Successful Installation Verification

1. Upon loading your favorite website, click the uBO Scope icon.
2. The popup shows the domain of the site at the top, and below, lists:
    - Domains connected that were **not blocked** (green section).
    - Domains that were **stealth-blocked** (yellow section).
    - Domains that were **blocked** outright (red section).
3. The badge count on the toolbar icon updates to match the count of distinct connected domains.

### What You Should See

- The count updates as you navigate different websites.
- No error messages pop up during or after installation.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting & Tips">
<Accordion title="Extension Icon Missing">
If you do not see the uBO Scope icon after installation:
- Check your browser’s extension management page.
- In Chrome, click the extensions puzzle icon and pin uBO Scope.
- In Firefox, ensure it is enabled in Add-ons > Extensions.
- In Safari, verify under Preferences > Extensions it is enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or 'NO DATA'">
- Confirm you are on a live, active webpage (not about:blank).
- Wait a few seconds, as the first network requests populate data asynchronously.
- Refresh the page and try again.
- Ensure no other extension or browser setting blocks `webRequest` API calls.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permissions Not Granted">
- If the extension asks repeatedly for permissions, manually grant them through your browser’s extension page.
- Restart the browser after granting permissions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance Considerations">
- uBO Scope is lightweight, but heavy network activity on a page may slightly delay badge updates.
- The extension batches network request processing to optimize performance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Best Practices">
- Regularly update your browser to ensure compatibility.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to validate true third-party network exposure.
- Allow extension to run in private/incognito mode if needed.
- Familiarize yourself with the badge count meaning: fewer distinct third-party domains indicate better privacy.
</Accordion>
