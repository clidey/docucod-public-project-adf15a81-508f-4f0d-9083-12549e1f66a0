# Your First Connection Analysis

## Workflow Overview

This guide walks you through using the uBO Scope popup interface to analyze the remote server connections that a webpage initiates or attempts. You will learn how to open the extension popup, interpret the badge count displayed on the toolbar icon, and identify the status of third-party domains categorized as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked within the UI.

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope must be installed and enabled in your browser.
- You should have a webpage loaded in an active tab where uBO Scope can monitor network connections.
- Basic understanding of browser extensions and navigating the toolbar.

### Expected Outcome

After completing this guide, you will be able to:

- Open the uBO Scope popup and retrieve connection details for the current tab.
- Understand the badge count and what it represents.
- Read and differentiate lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains.
- Use this information to assess your webpage's network connections and content blocking effectiveness.

### Time Estimate

Approximately 5 minutes.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner-friendly; designed for users new to the extension.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup for the Active Tab">
Launch your browser with uBO Scope installed and click the uBO Scope toolbar icon for the tab you want to analyze. This opens the popup.html interface.

**Expected Result:** A popup displays listing connection information about the current tab’s webpage.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret the Badge Count on the Extension Icon">
Look at the badge number over the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar. This number shows the number of distinct third-party remote domains contacted successfully by the webpage.

**Expected Result:** A numeric badge, or no badge if zero, indicating how many unique third-party domains made successful connections.

**Tip:** A lower badge count generally means fewer third-party connections.
</Step>

<Step title="Understand the Popup Header: Hostname and Domain">
At the top of the popup, note the displayed hostname and domain of the current tab’s main frame.

**Expected Result:** The hostname and domain representing the main webpage are shown clearly.

**Tip:** The domain is often a subset of the full hostname (e.g., subdomain.example.com vs example.com).
</Step>

<Step title="Review Allowed Domains List">
In the section labeled "not blocked," you will find a list of third-party domains allowed by the browser or content blockers. Each domain shows a count indicating how many successful network requests were made.

**Expected Result:** A list of remote domains that the page connected to successfully, with their respective connection counts.

**Use Case:** Identify which third-party servers your webpage depends on (e.g., CDNs).
</Step>

<Step title="Review Stealth-Blocked Domains List">
The "stealth-blocked" section lists third-party domains where connections were redirected or intercepted stealthily by content blockers (connections did not fully succeed but didn’t show as blocked explicitly).

**Expected Result:** Domains with stealth-blocked status and their connection counts.

**Insight:** These indicate attempts to block tracking or unwanted connections without breaking webpage functionality visibly.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Blocked Domains List">
The "blocked" section shows third-party domains where connections were explicitly blocked or failed due to filtering.

**Expected Result:** Domains for which network requests were denied or failed, with counts.

**Actionable Info:** Helps you see what content blockers prevented from loading.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Connection Data Accuracy and Refresh">
Reload the web page tab to generate fresh connection data, then reopen the popup to observe updated connection statistics.

**Expected Result:** Updated badge count and domain lists reflecting new network activity.

**Troubleshooting:** If no data appears, verify extension permissions and webpage activity.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Examples & User Scenario

### Scenario: Analyzing Connections on Example.com

You visit example.com and click the uBO Scope icon.

- The badge shows '3', indicating three unique third-party servers connected.
- The popup shows:
  - Allowed: cdn.examplecdn.net (15 requests), analytics.exampledata.com (3 requests)
  - Stealth-blocked: trackers.badsite.com (2 attempts)
  - Blocked: ads.badads.com (5 blocked requests)

From this, you understand example.com fetches resources primarily from a legit CDN, blocks ads explicitly, and stealthily blocks trackers.

### Refreshing for Updated Data

Reload example.com to verify changes if the site has dynamic connections.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with Connection Analysis">
<Accordion title="No Data Shown in Popup">
- Ensure the extension has necessary permissions (especially access to webRequest API).
- Confirm the current tab is fully loaded and has made network requests.
- Reload the page and retry opening the popup.
- Check for potential conflicts with other extensions or browser privacy settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating">
- The badge updates on network events; wait a moment after page load.
- Manually refresh the tab to trigger new network requests.
- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled and active.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Domain Names Appear Punycode-Encoded">
- Domains may appear encoded (e.g., xn-- domains) if they use international characters.
- The popup converts them to Unicode for clarity where possible.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Understanding Stealth-Blocked Domains">
- "Stealth-blocked" means the request was intercepted or redirected silently.
- This is useful to identify subtle content blocking.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Refresh the page whenever network conditions or content blockers change to ensure data accuracy.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Lower badge counts generally correlate with better privacy but verify known essential third-party services remain intact.
</Tip>
