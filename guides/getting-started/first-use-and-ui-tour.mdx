# First Use: Exploring the Popup

Discover the powerful snapshot of your browsing activity with uBO Scope's popup interface. This guide walks you through opening the popup, understanding the badge count on the toolbar icon, and interpreting the detailed breakdown of remote domain connections, classified by their blocking status.

---

## Workflow Overview

**Purpose:** Help you quickly open and interpret the uBO Scope popup to understand which third-party domains your browser connected to during web browsing — and whether these connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

**Prerequisites:**
- uBO Scope installed and active in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
- A webpage loaded in the active browser tab.

**Outcome:**
- You will confidently open the popup interface and read the summary data.
- Understand the badge count meaning and domain connection categories.
- Relate popup data to your browsing experience.

**Time Estimate:** 3–5 minutes

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser’s extension area.
- The popup window appears showing details about the current active tab.

<Tip>
If the popup does not open or shows "NO DATA," ensure you are on a regular webpage (not a browser internal page) and that uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled.
</Tip>

### 2. Read the Hostname Header

- At the top of the popup, see the header displaying the current tab's URL hostname.
- The domain part of the hostname is shown prominently.
- If the hostname has subdomains, these appear in the first part of the header.

### 3. Understand the Summary Section

- Look at the **‘domains connected’** count — this number represents the distinct third-party domains your current tab attempted or successfully connected to.
- This count matches the number shown on the toolbar icon badge.

### 4. Explore Domain Connection Categories

The popup organizes connections by their blocking outcome in three sections:

#### a. Not Blocked (Allowed)
- Domains here represent third-party remote servers your browser connected to successfully without being blocked.
- These include typical content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics, or other services.
- Each domain shows how many times it was contacted.

#### b. Stealth-Blocked
- Domains in this list represent requests that were implicitly blocked or redirected stealthily by content blockers or other mechanisms.
- The requests to these domains were suppressed but generally without making it obvious to the webpage.
- This helps reveal connections that are prevented without breaking browsing experience.

#### c. Blocked
- These domains correspond to requests that were explicitly blocked, causing failures or errors.
- This section shows direct evidence of content blocking in action.

<Tip>
Domains are always shown in their Unicode form, converted from punycode where applicable, ensuring clarity and readability.
</Tip>

### 5. Correlate Badge Count and Popup Data

- Remember, the numeric badge on the toolbar icon represents the count of distinct 'allowed' third-party domains (those not blocked).
- A lower badge count generally means fewer third-party exposures, which is preferable from a privacy perspective.

### 6. Refresh and Observe Changes

- Navigate to different webpages and revisit the popup to see how domain connections and counts change.
- Use this to monitor site's third-party exposures in real time.

## Examples & Practical Scenarios

Imagine visiting a news website:

- You open the popup and see a small badge count of **3**.
- Inside the popup, you find ‘allowed’ domains like `cdn.newsassets.com` and `analytics.tracker.net`.
- The ‘stealth-blocked’ list shows domains your content blocker hides silently, such as `ads.fakeadserver.net`.
- The ‘blocked’ section might be empty or contain known ad servers you explicitly block.

This real-time feedback helps you verify your content blocking setup and understand where your data flows.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Their Solutions">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows NO DATA or is Empty">
- Ensure you are clicking the popup on a webpage tab (not on browser internal pages like `about:` or `chrome://`).
- Confirm uBO Scope permissions are granted and active.
- Refresh the webpage and reopen the popup.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
- The badge count updates when network requests complete; allow a few seconds for data to refresh.
- Restart the browser if counts seem frozen.
- Check for conflicting extensions that may interfere with network request reporting.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Interpreting Stealth-Blocked Domains">
- Stealth-blocked requests can look confusing; they represent silently suppressed connections.
- If unexpected domains appear here, consider reviewing your blocklist and content blocker settings.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
For best insight, use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to confirm which third-party servers are genuinely contacted and which are blocked or blocked stealthily.
