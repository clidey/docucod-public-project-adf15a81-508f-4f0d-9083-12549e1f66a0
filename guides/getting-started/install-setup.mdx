### Step 1: Install the Extension

3. When prompted, confirm by selecting **Add extension**.

2. Click **Add to Firefox**.

<Tip>

</Tip>

### Step 2: Locate and Pin the uBO Scope Icon

1. After installation, find the uBO Scope icon in the browser's toolbar area.
2. If it doesn’t appear immediately, click the puzzle-piece icon (Extensions) and pin uBO Scope to the toolbar.

---

### Step 3: Understand Permissions Asked by the Extension

uBO Scope will request the following permissions:

- **Active Tab:** To track network activity on the current tab.
- **Storage:** To save session information.
- **Web Request:** To monitor web requests and their outcomes.
- **Host Permissions:** To observe network requests matching URLs like `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`, `wss://*/*`, and `ws://*/*`.

<Info>
These permissions are essential for uBO Scope to capture and categorize network connections made by websites you visit.
</Info>

---

### Step 4: Accessing the Popup Interface

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar.
2. You will see the popup panel which displays real-time insights:
   - The current webpage’s hostname.
   - Number of connected domains grouped into categories:
     - Not blocked (allowed connections)
     - Stealth-blocked connections
     - Blocked connections
3. The popup updates as you browse different pages.

---

### Step 5: First Use and Validation

1. Visit a website or reload the active tab.
2. Observe the badge count on the toolbar icon:
   - This count reflects distinct third-party domains connected to.
   - A lower count suggests fewer third-party connections.
3. Open the popup and verify the domain breakdown under “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked” sections.
4. If you see a non-zero count and domain details populate, the extension is working correctly.

<Check>
If the badge count remains zero or popup shows "NO DATA," verify the permissions, refresh the tab, or restart the browser.
</Check>

---

## Examples & Real Scenarios

Imagine you browse a news site. The uBO Scope badge shows "3" — this means the page requested resources from three distinct third-party domains. Clicking the popup reveals these domains sorted by which were allowed or blocked, giving you immediate visibility into the network connections behind the scenes.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Icon Does Not Appear After Installation">
- Refresh the browser or restart it.
- In Chromium browsers, check if the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`.
- Use the Extensions menu (puzzle icon) to pin uBO Scope.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Update">
- Confirm that the site you are visiting uses network requests that the extension can watch.
- Check extension permissions and enable "Allow access to file URLs" if testing on local files (in extension details).
- Close and reopen the tab or browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists">
- Verify you're on an active tab with network traffic.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
The badge count represents the number of unique third-party domains connected to — not the number of blocked requests.
</Tip>

## Additional Notes

- **Browser compatibility:** uBO Scope requires minimum versions that support necessary APIs:
  - Chrome 122+
  - Firefox 128+
  - Safari 18.5+ (see platform-specific guidance)

- The extension does not interfere with network requests or block anything; it **monitors** and reports.

- The popup interface is your window into the network activity per tab.
