## 2. Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Choose Your Browser
Select the browser where you want to install uBO Scope. This guide covers Chromium, Firefox, and Safari.

---

### Step 2: Access the Official Extension Store

- **Chromium/Chrome:**
  - Visit the [Chrome Web Store page for uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).

- **Firefox:**
  - Visit the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).

- **Safari:**
  - Use the macOS App Store or Safari Extensions Gallery and search for 'uBO Scope' compatible with Safari 18.5+

---

### Step 3: Install the Extension

- Click the install/add button for uBO Scope in your browser's extension store page.
- Confirm any prompts to allow and install the extension.

---

### Step 4: Verify Required Permissions

uBO Scope needs specific permissions to operate effectively. After installation, ensure the following permissions are allowed:

- **Active Tab Access:** Allows monitoring the currently active tab.
- **Storage:** Necessary to save session data and preferences.
- **WebRequest:** Grants access to network request details so the extension can log third-party connections.

If your browser asks for permission requests during or after installation, accept them for uBO Scope to function properly.

---

### Step 5: Confirm the Toolbar Icon and Badge

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar; the icon uses distinctive uBO graphics.
- Upon browsing any webpage, the badge on the icon will display a number representing the count of distinct third-party domains your browser has connected to.

This badge shows that uBO Scope is actively monitoring and reporting network connections.

---

### Step 6: Open the Popup UI

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup interface.
- The popup will display:
  - The domain name of the active tab.
  - Counts and lists of domains in three categories:
    - **Not Blocked** (allowed connections)
    - **Stealth-Blocked** (requests blocked silently)
    - **Blocked** (requests outright blocked)

This interface reflects uBO Scope’s monitoring in real time.

## 3. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep Your Browser Updated:** To ensure compatibility and security, use the latest browser versions.
- **Permissions May Vary:** Different browsers may prompt for permissions differently; always allow the required permissions for full functionality.
- **Browsing Generates Data:** The badge and popup populate with data only after visiting websites that make external third-party connections.
- **Use uBO Scope Alongside Your Content Blocker:** uBO Scope does not interfere with existing content blockers but provides transparent insight into network activity regardless of what blockers are installed.
