## 2. Installation Step-by-Step

Follow the steps below to install uBO Scope on your preferred browser.

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Access the Official Extension Store">
1. Open your browser and navigate to the official extension store:
   - **Chromium Browsers:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
   - **Firefox:** [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

2. Search for 'uBO Scope' or directly follow the above link.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 2: Install the Extension">
1. Click on the **Add to Browser** or **Install** button.
2. Review the permissions prompt carefully — uBO Scope requires access to activeTab, storage, webRequest, and host permissions (HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket).
3. Confirm and accept the installation.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 3: Verify Successful Installation">
1. Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar — it appears as a small badge icon.
2. Click the icon to open the popup panel and confirm it loads without error.
3. Verify the version is 1.0.1 or later.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 4: Understand Extension Permissions">
- uBO Scope requires these permissions to function correctly:
  - **activeTab**: To identify the current active tab.
  - **storage**: To save session data and configuration.
  - **webRequest**: To observe and report on all remote server connections.
  - **host permissions**: To monitor HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket connections across all sites.
- These permissions allow uBO Scope to detect network activity transparently.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Ensure you install uBO Scope only from official browser extension stores to avoid tampered versions.
</Note>

## 3. Initial Configuration and First-Time Launch

After installation, follow these steps to ensure the extension is configured and ready.

### Step 1: Refresh Your Browser Tabs

- After installation, reload any open browser tabs to allow uBO Scope to start monitoring network connections on those pages.

### Step 2: Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- The popup displays connection data including distinct third-party domains categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

### Step 3: Monitor Permissions

- The extension works transparently but requires host permissions for all HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket protocols to report accurately.
- If the popup shows "NO DATA", confirm that permissions are granted. Refer to browser settings under Extensions > uBO Scope > Permissions.

### Step 4: Understand the Badge Count

- The badge on the toolbar icon shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected in the active tab.
- A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party network connections, aligned with privacy preferences.

### Step 5: Initial Troubleshooting

If you do not see network connection data:
- Reload the active tab.
- Restart the browser.
- Verify permissions as per Step 3.
- Check that uBO Scope is enabled and not conflicting with other extensions.

<Tip>
If you encounter issues, consult the "Troubleshooting Common Issues" guide in the documentation for targeted fixes.

## 4. Best Practices for Setup

- **Keep uBO Scope Updated:** Extensions update through browser stores; ensure automatic updates are enabled.
- **Minimal Permissions Approach:** Do not restrict host permissions; the extension needs broad access for full visibility.
- **Use alongside Content Blockers:** uBO Scope reports connections regardless of installed content blockers, offering an independent view.
- **Regularly Inspect Popup Data:** Frequent checks help correlate real-time network activity with browsing habits.
