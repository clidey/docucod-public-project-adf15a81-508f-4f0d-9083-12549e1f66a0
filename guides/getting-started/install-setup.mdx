## 2. Step-by-Step Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Choose Your Browser Installation Source

| Browser  | Official Installation Source  |
|---|---|
| Chrome  | [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |
| Safari  | Apple Safari Extensions Gallery or manual installation for Safari 18.5+ |

> **Tip:** Always install from official stores or trusted sources to ensure you have the latest secure version.

---

### Step 2: Install the Extension

#### For Chrome and Firefox

1. Click the appropriate link above for your browser store.
2. Click **Add to Chrome** or **Add to Firefox**.
3. Accept the permissions prompt requesting:
   - Access to activeTab
   - Storage permissions
   - Web request monitoring permissions

Permissions enable uBO Scope to monitor network requests accurately.

#### For Safari

1. Ensure Safari is updated to version 18.5 or higher.
2. Go to Safari’s Extensions preferences pane.
3. Locate uBO Scope (might require manual installation from GitHub or Apple’s extension gallery).
4. Enable the extension and approve its permissions.

> **Note:** Safari’s extension system requires a minimum version and may need manual trust configuration.

---

### Step 3: Verify Permissions and Extension Activation

uBO Scope requires the following permissions:

- **activeTab:** To monitor and report requests on the active browser tab.
- **storage:** To save and recall session and configuration data.
- **webRequest:** To listen to network requests and classify connections.

After installation:
1. Visit your browser's extension management page:
   - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
   - Firefox: `about:addons`
   - Safari: Safari Preferences > Extensions
2. Locate uBO Scope and confirm:
   - It is enabled.
   - The required permissions are granted (some browsers show this explicitly).

---

### Step 4: Confirm the Extension is Running and Monitoring

1. Open any website in your browser.
2. Look at the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar. It should display a badge with a number if any third-party remote servers are connected by the page.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open its popup.
4. Confirm that the popup lists domains under “not blocked”, “stealth-blocked”, and “blocked” categories related to the current tab’s network activity.

> **Success Indicator:**
> - A non-empty badge count indicates active monitoring.
> - The popup displays domains connected by the page, showing clear classification.

### Step 5: Handle Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Missing Toolbar Icon">
- Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extension page.
- Check if the icon is hidden in overflow menus or toolbar customization settings.
- Restart your browser to refresh extension loading.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Not Granted">
- Some browsers may not grant permissions until first use; try refreshing the page or relaunching the browser.
- Check the extension’s settings in your browser to grant permissions manually if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Badge or Empty Popup Data">
- uBO Scope only reports connections for active tabs that have network activity.
- Some sites or tabs may not produce third-party requests, leading to empty results.
- Verify you have allowed network monitoring permissions.
- Try visiting a site with known third-party content, such as widely-used news sites.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="WebSocket Connections Not Reported (Firefox only)">
- Firefox requires special permissions and minimum version 128 for WebSocket monitoring.
- Confirm you use Firefox 128 or above.
- Note that uBO Scope may have limitations on WebSocket visibility depending on browser capabilities.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 3. Installation Validation Example

Once uBO Scope is installed:

1. Visit a website like `https://example.com`.
2. Observe the toolbar badge showing a number reflecting distinct third-party connections.
3. Click the extension icon and verify that the popup:
   - Lists domains with connection counts.
   - Separates domains into 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked' sections.

Example popup snippet:

```
domains connected: 3

not blocked:
 - cdn.examplecdn.com (5)
 - analytics.example.com (2)

stealth-blocked:
 - tracker.blockedtracker.com (1)

blocked:
 - adserver.blockedad.com (4)
```

## 4. Best Practices & Tips

- Regularly check that uBO Scope is enabled after browser updates.
- Use the popup UI to audit which third-party domains are connecting as you browse.
- A lower badge count typically indicates fewer third-party connections, aligning with stronger privacy.
- Remember some third-party domains (such as CDNs) are often legitimate and necessary.
- Use uBO Scope in tandem with your content blocker to better understand what is allowed, stealth-blocked, or explicitly blocked.

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Appearing or Not Working
- Confirm browser version compatibility.
- Reinstall the extension from the official store.
- Disable conflicting extensions that may interfere with permissions.
- Clear browser cache or restart the browser.

### Badge Count Does Not Update
- Refresh the active tab.
- Navigate to a different tab and back.
- Restart the browser to reset extension state.

### Popup Data is Blank or Does Not Match Expectations
- Ensure the extension is granted `webRequest` permission.
- Test on sites with known third-party content.
- Review browser and extension notifications for permission prompts.

If issues persist, consult the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../getting-started/getting-going/troubleshooting-setup) documentation.
