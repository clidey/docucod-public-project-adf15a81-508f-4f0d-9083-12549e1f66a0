# Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope

This guide walks you through installing uBO Scope on supported browsers, enabling the extension, and verifying your setup. By following these steps, you will be ready to start monitoring all third-party network connections your browser makes during web browsing.

---

## Workflow Overview

- **Objective:** Install uBO Scope on Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, enable it, and confirm it's correctly capturing network connection data.
- **Prerequisites:** Supported browser installed (Chrome v122+, Firefox v128+, Safari v18.5+), internet access to download from official web stores.
- **Expected Outcome:** uBO Scope is active, its toolbar icon visible, badge counts reflect distinct third-party connections, and popup UI displays domain connection summaries.
- **Time Estimate:** 5 - 10 minutes
- **Difficulty:** Beginner-friendly

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Browser Compatibility

Ensure your browser version meets these minimum requirements:

- **Chrome:** version 122.0 or later
- **Firefox:** version 128.0 or later
- **Safari:** version 18.5 or later

Using unsupported browser versions will prevent uBO Scope from functioning correctly due to API dependencies.

### Step 2: Installing uBO Scope

Install uBO Scope from the official browser add-on stores to guarantee authenticity and automatic updates:

- **Chrome:** [Chrome Web Store - uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- **Firefox:** [Firefox Add-ons - uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- **Safari:** Available via Safari Extensions Gallery or the Mac App Store (Safari 18.5+)

Follow your browser's standard installation prompts, granting required permissions (webRequest, activeTab, storage).

### Step 3: Enable the Extension

After installation:

1. Confirm uBO Scope is enabled in your browser's extensions manager.
2. Locate the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar (it uses a distinct icon).
3. Pin the icon if your browser supports extension pinning to keep it always visible.

This ensures easy access to real-time network connection insights.

### Step 4: Confirm Permissions and Initial Setup

uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor network activity:

- `webRequest` (to intercept network requests)
- `activeTab` (to monitor current tab activity)
- `storage` (to save session data and configuration)

Your browser typically requests these during installation. If not, verify permissions in the extensions manager.

### Step 5: Verify Installation

1. Navigate to any website.
2. Watch the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge. It should display a number representing the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected by the current tab.
3. Click the toolbar icon to open the popup UI.

The popup displays:

- The current tab's domain and hostname.
- A summary count of connected third-party domains.
- Categorized lists of domains under "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked."

If the popup shows meaningful domain data and the badge updates as you browse, uBO Scope is correctly installed and operational.

## Practical Example

```markdown
# After installing and enabling uBO Scope:

1. Open your favorite website (e.g., example.com).
2. Notice the badge on the uBO Scope icon shows a number — say, "5" — indicating 5 distinct third-party servers your browser connected to.
3. Click the icon. The popup lists domains categorized where connections were allowed, stealth-blocked (redirected), or blocked.
4. Use this information to understand your browser's network exposure from the active tab.
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Icon Does Not Appear">
- Check the browser’s extensions manager that uBO Scope is enabled.
- Ensure the icon is pinned or visible in the toolbar area.
- Restart your browser to reload extensions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Remains Empty or Stuck at Zero">
- Confirm you have visited websites with network activity.
- Verify that uBO Scope has permission to monitor web requests.
- Clear browser cache and data related to extension or reinstall.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Lists">
- Ensure you opened the popup on an active tab with network connections.
- Reload the current tab to trigger new connection monitoring.
- Check for conflicts with other browser extensions intercepting network or privacy settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Prompts or Requests During Installation">
- It is normal to be asked for webRequest and storage permissions.
- Denying these prevents uBO Scope from functioning.
- Review permission descriptions before acceptance.
