# Navigating the Popup: Understanding Your Domain Summary

---

## 1. Overview of the Popup Panel

The uBO Scope popup panel presents a clear, real-time summary of network connections for the current browser tab. This guide navigates you through the popup's key sections, helping you interpret the domains and connection results shown so you can understand precisely which third-party servers your browser interacts with.

The popup allows you to:
- See the current tab's origin hostname and domain.
- Review domains grouped by connection outcomes: Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked.
- Understand how many distinct third-party domains your tab has connected to.

By mastering this interface, you gain transparent visibility into all remote server communications initiated by the webpage you are visiting.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before using the popup:
- Ensure uBO Scope is installed and activated in your browser.
- Confirm you have navigated to an active browser tab with visible network activity.
- Familiarity with basic networking concepts such as hostname, domain, and third-party connections will be helpful.

## 3. Popup Panel Sections Explained

### 3.1 Tab Hostname and Domain Header

At the top of the popup, the hostname of the current tab's main frame is displayed in two parts:
- **Hostname prefix:** Subdomain or the part before the main domain.
- **Main domain:** The registered domain name derived using the Public Suffix List.

For example, viewing “sub.example.com” will show ‘sub.’ and ‘example.com’ distinctly.

This header immediately orients you to the web origin whose connections are being reported.

### 3.2 Domains Connected Count

Below the header is a summary count labeled **domains connected**, representing the total number of distinct third-party domains for which the page made at least one network connection that was allowed (not blocked or stealth-blocked).

This count corresponds to the badge number you see on the browser toolbar icon when uBO Scope is active.

### 3.3 Domains Categorized by Outcome

The popup divides domains into three outcome groups, each in its own section:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):**
  - Domains from which network requests were successfully made without interference.
  - These count towards your third-party connection exposure.

- **Stealth-Blocked:**
  - Domains where network requests were redirected or modified in ways that prevented direct network communication but without outright blocking errors.
  - This often reflects network activity managed by stealthy content blockers or mechanisms that mask or reroute requests.

- **Blocked:**
  - Domains where network requests failed due to explicit blocking or errors detected by uBO Scope.
  - These domains did not complete their network connection.

Each section lists domains in alphabetical order, displaying:
- The domain name (Unicode decoded for readability).
- A badge with the number of connection attempts to that domain.

### 3.4 Understanding Domain Counts and Frequency

Each domain's count indicates how many network requests targeted that domain during the tab's lifetime. This helps distinguish frequent third-party connections from infrequent or incidental ones.

## 4. Step-by-Step User Flow: Using the Popup Effectively

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel for the active tab. This launches the real-time domain summary.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify the Current Tab Hostname">
At the top, confirm the hostname and domain correspond to the webpage you expect to analyze.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domains Connected Count">
Look at the 'domains connected' count to get an immediate sense of your third-party exposure.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Allowed Domains">
Check the 'not blocked' section to see all domains actively fetching resources. Note both domain names and their request counts.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Identify stealth-blocked domains, which may indicate redirection or subtle blocking. This provides insight into stealthy content blocking layers.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Blocked Domains">
Review explicitly blocked domains to understand which third parties were fully prevented from connecting.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret and Correlate with Your Privacy Goals">
Use the domain data to assess third-party exposure for privacy, troubleshooting, or auditing purposes.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Refresh the Popup:** The domain summary updates when you reload the active tab or navigate to a new site. To see fresh data, refresh the webpage before opening the popup.
- **Understand Third Parties vs. First Party:** The popup focuses on third-party remote domains contacted by the active tab. Your site's own domain is excluded from the count.
- **Unicode Domain Names:** Internationalized domain names (IDNs) are rendered in their readable Unicode format for clarity.
- **Recognize Genuine vs. Suspicious Connections:** Frequent connections to common CDN domains (e.g., cloudflare.com, googleusercontent.com) may be normal, whereas unknown domains may require further investigation.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<Tip>
If the popup shows “NO DATA” or no domains:
- Confirm you are on a tab with active network activity.
- Try refreshing the page and reopening the popup.
- Check that uBO Scope is enabled and the toolbar icon badge is present.
- Review permissions to ensure the extension has access to webRequest API data.
</Tip>

<Warning>
The popup displays data scoped to the current active tab only. Switching tabs requires reopening or refreshing the popup to see updated domain summaries.
</Warning>

<Note>
Stealth-blocked domains might be less familiar; these connections are intercepted in ways that do not raise errors but prevent direct communication. They are not necessarily a cause for concern but worth understanding in context.
</Note>
