# Exploring the Popup: Your First Look at Network Requests

## Overview

The uBO Scope popup provides a clear, real-time snapshot of all third-party network connections on the currently active browser tab. This page walks you through opening the popup, understanding the summary statistics it presents, and interpreting how domains are categorized into allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked sections. By the end, you will be able to use the popup to quickly assess the privacy exposure of any webpage you visit.

---

## What You Will Learn

- How to open the uBO Scope popup to view network request details
- How to read and understand the summary statistics shown
- How to identify and differentiate between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains
- The significance of each domain category for privacy and tracking

---

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and active in your browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+)
- You must be viewing a webpage in an active tab for which network requests have been observed
- Basic understanding of third-party network requests (recommended but not required)

---

## Time Estimate

Opening and interpreting the popup data takes only a few minutes. Familiarity will increase the speed of meaningful insights.

---

## Difficulty Level

Beginner: The popup UI is designed for quick comprehension without technical jargon.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
- Click the icon to open the popup window.
- The popup loads network data gathered for the active tab.

**Expected Result:**
- The popup window appears with the page hostname at the top.
- You see the "domains connected:" summary with a number and lists below.

<Tip>
If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or a question mark in the summary, ensure you have navigated to an active webpage and that uBO Scope is enabled with permissions granted.
</Tip>

### 2. Understand the Page Hostname Display

- The top header displays the current tab's hostname and domain.
  - The first span typically shows the subdomain or prefix.
  - The second span shows the main domain.

**Example:**
If visiting `news.example.com`, you may see 'news' as the prefix and 'example.com' as the domain.

### 3. Read the Summary Statistic

- The "domains connected:" count shows the total number of unique domains contacted by the page.
- This count reflects only distinct domains; multiple requests to the same domain count as one.

**Significance:**
- A lower count indicates fewer third-party connections, generally better for privacy.
- The count updates dynamically based on network activity on the active page.

### 4. Explore Domain Categories

The popup divides domains into three distinct sections:

#### a. Not Blocked (Allowed)

- Domains for which network requests were allowed by the browser and any content blockers.
- These domains currently have active network connections.

#### b. Stealth-Blocked

- Domains whose requests were blocked in a stealthy manner.
- The browser request was redirected or blocked, but the page may be unaware of this blocking.
- Helps avoid detection by trackers and prevents page breakage.

#### c. Blocked

- Domains whose requests were explicitly blocked, such as by a content blocker.
- These are confirmed blocked connections preventing data from being loaded.

### 5. Review Domains and Request Counts

- Each section lists domains with a count badge indicating the number of network requests to that domain.
- Domains are sorted for ease of review.

**Action:**
- Scan allowed domains to identify potentially privacy-impacting connections.
- Review blocked and stealth-blocked lists to verify which third-party requests are being intercepted.

### 6. Interpret What You See

- Allowed domains reflect where your browser is still connecting.
- Blocked and stealth-blocked domains show where content blockers or privacy settings intervene.

**Tip:**
Not all third-party connections are malicious; some (e.g., CDNs) are essential for site performance.

## Practical Example

Suppose you are browsing a news site. Opening the popup shows:

- 5 domains connected
- Allowed domains: `news.example.com`, `cdn.example.net`
- Stealth-blocked domains: `tracker.badads.com`
- Blocked domains: `ads.badads.com`

Interpretation:

- You have two domains serving content directly.
- Trackers are being quietly blocked without site detection (stealth-blocked).
- Some ad-related connections are explicitly blocked.

This gives you confidence about your privacy hygiene on this page.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or Summary is '?'">
- Ensure you have navigated to a webpage (not a new tab or blank page).
- Refresh the page to trigger new network requests.
- Confirm that uBO Scope is enabled and has the necessary permissions.
- Try disabling and re-enabling the extension if the issue persists.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Domain Lists Are Empty Despite Activity">
- The page may use network requests outside the scope of the browser’s webRequest API (rare).
- Some browser settings or other extensions may interfere with network request reporting.
- Restart the browser to clear potential caching or session issues.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Counts Seem Inconsistent or Delayed">
- The popup updates asynchronously; wait a moment after navigating to the page.
- Network requests may be cached or resolved before uBO Scope can observe them.
- Reload the tab to generate fresh requests.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices & Tips

- Regularly check the popup while browsing sensitive sites to monitor third-party exposure.
- Use the domain counts to assess the impact of content blockers and privacy tools.
- Remember stealth-blocking is designed to be invisible to sites — this is a privacy feature.
- Combine the popup insights with other privacy tools for a thorough evaluation.
