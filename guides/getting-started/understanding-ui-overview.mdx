# Understanding the User Interface

Explore the core features of the uBO Scope popup panel, designed to provide immediate clarity on the network connections your browser is making for the active tab. This guide will help you quickly interpret connection counts, domain categories, and key user interface elements to transform raw network data into actionable insights about your browsing privacy.

---

## 1. What You Will Learn

- How to open and read the uBO Scope popup panel
- Understanding the connection count summary
- Differentiating domain categories: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth
- Navigating domain listings with connection counts
- Using the UI effectively to gain privacy awareness

## 2. Prerequisites

- Have uBO Scope installed and activated in a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Understand basic browsing concepts like domains and connections.
- Have an active tab loaded with a website whose network connections you want to analyze.

## 3. Expected Outcome

By the end of this guide, you will confidently use the uBO Scope popup panel to inspect all third-party connections initiated by the current webpage, understand their status, and recognize what the numbers signify about your network exposure.

---

## 4. Opening the uBO Scope Popup Panel

1. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar. The popup panel will appear, overlaying the browser interface.
2. If no data is available, the panel will indicate 'NO DATA'. This typically happens if the tab is new or connections have not been registered yet.

<Callout title="Inspecting Live Data">The panel updates dynamically as network requests occur, enabling near real-time monitoring of connections per webpage.</Callout>

## 5. Understanding Key UI Elements

### 5.1 Tab Hostname Display

- Appears prominently at the top of the panel.
- Shows the hostname and its domain from the current browser tab.
  - If the hostname includes subdomains, these are shown separately from the main domain to help contextualize the connection source.

### 5.2 Connection Summary

- Below the hostname is a summary count labeled **domains connected**.
- This number represents the total distinct third-party domains contacted by the currently active webpage.
- A **lower domain count indicates better privacy** as fewer external connections are exposed.

### 5.3 Domain Categories Sections

The main area of the popup is split into three clearly labeled sections, each listing connected domains grouped by connection outcome:

| Section      | Description                                                                                   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked (Allowed)**  | Domains where network requests succeeded and were allowed by content blockers or browser settings. |
| **Stealth-Blocked (Stealth)** | Domains where connection attempts were made but stealth blocking prevented visible requests.          |
| **Blocked**  | Domains where connection attempts were explicitly blocked by content blockers or browser policies.        |

Each category displays:

- A heading describing the outcome.
- A list of domains contacted, each with a numeric count indicating how many connections were made.

### 5.4 Domain Rows

Each domain row contains:

- The domain name, translated from punycode to Unicode for readability.
- A badge showing the count of connections to that domain.

Domains are sorted alphabetically within each category for easy lookup.

## 6. How to Interpret the Data Flow in the UI

When you open the panel, uBO Scope:

1. Retrieves the current tab's domain data from its background process.
2. Populates the hostname display with the current tab's hostname and domain.
3. Aggregates and categorizes network connections into Allowed, Stealth, and Blocked.
4. Displays sorted domain lists with connection counts, enabling you to quickly assess which third-party domains your current tab communicates with and their status.

<Info>
Understanding that 'Stealth' domains represent requests that were intercepted with minimal visibility can help you appreciate the degree of hidden blocking occurring beyond what 'Blocked' explicitly covers.

## 7. Practical Example

Imagine you are visiting a news website and want to see its third-party connections:

- Open the uBO Scope popup via the extension icon.
- The popup shows the news site's hostname at the top.
- The summary displays "domains connected: 14", indicating 14 unique third-party domains.
- The 'Not Blocked' section lists familiar CDNs and analytics providers with counts indicating frequency of connection during page load.
- The 'Stealth-Blocked' section lists a few ad networks or trackers that uBO Scope detected as stealth blocked.
- The 'Blocked' section shows domains completely blocked by your content blocker.

This quick view informs you how many and which third-party servers are contacted, and how your blocker manages them.

---

## 8. Tips & Best Practices

- **Use the popup frequently** while browsing privacy-sensitive sites to monitor unexpected connections.
- **Focus first on the summary count** to get a quick privacy risk snapshot.
- **Check blocked and stealth lists** to ensure trackers or unwanted domains are effectively blocked.
- **Remember domain counts can spike** on pages with many embedded resources â€” a high count warrants closer inspection.
- **Use the domain count badges** as a guide to identify dominant third-party domains on a page.

## 9. Common Pitfalls

- Some network requests might not appear immediately; refresh the popup after a second or two to ensure all data loads.
- The panel reflects data for the active tab only; switching tabs requires re-opening the popup.
- Third-party DNS-level blocks that do not emit webRequest events might not show up.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

### Problem: Popup shows "NO DATA"
- Ensure the tab is fully loaded and has active network connections.
- Confirm uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (storage, webRequest).
- Reload the page and re-open the popup.

### Problem: Connection counts seem inconsistent
- Understand counts reflect distinct connection attempts, not total data volume.
- Stealth blocking may cause some connections to be hidden from direct view.

## Appendix: Visual Layout of the Popup Panel

```plaintext
+---------------------------------------------+
| Current Tab Hostname and Domain             |
| e.g.  sub.example.com                       |
+---------------------------------------------+
| domains connected: [Count]                  |
+---------------------------------------------+
| NOT BLOCKED (Allowed)      |  STEALTH BLOCKED |
|  domain1.com    [count]    |  domainA.com [count] |
|  domain2.com    [count]    |  domainB.com [count] |
|  ...                      |  ...               |
+---------------------------+------------------+
| BLOCKED                   |
|  domainX.com    [count]   |
|  domainY.com    [count]   |
+---------------------------+
```

Each section lists domains with numeric connection badges, delivering a clear snapshot of network activity for the current tab.
