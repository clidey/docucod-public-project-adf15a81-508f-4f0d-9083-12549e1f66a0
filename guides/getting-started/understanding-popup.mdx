# Interpreting the Popup Panel

Welcome to your hands-on guide for understanding the uBO Scope popup panel. This page walks you through the meaning behind each domain list, helps you read connection details clearly, and explains how the badge count on the toolbar icon reflects your tab’s third-party connections. Gain confidence in distinguishing allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked network requests, turning raw data into actionable insight.

---

## 1. Overview: What the Popup Panel Shows

When you click the uBO Scope extension icon, the popup panel reveals a real-time snapshot of network connections made by the active browser tab. It focuses on categorizing remote server domains based on connection outcomes:

- **Allowed connections**: Domains for which remote server connections succeeded unhindered.
- **Stealth-blocked connections**: Domains where connection attempts were redirected or altered stealthily by content blockers.
- **Blocked connections**: Domains whose requests were explicitly blocked and failed.

### Key Visual Elements

- **Hostname Header (Top)**
  - Displays the tab’s current page hostname, divided into subdomain and main domain parts.
- **Domains Connected Count (Summary)**
  - Shows the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected (allowed).
- **Connection Outcome Sections**
  - Separate lists of domains grouped under “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked” categories.
  - Each domain shows how many connection attempts were recorded.

<Tip>
The popup panel is a window into your tab’s network activity, revealing objective data on distinct remote connections categorized by their status. Use it to audit third-party server contact and adjust your privacy or filter settings accordingly.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding Domain Classifications and Counts

### Allowed (Not Blocked)
- Represents domains contacted successfully without interference.
- These are domains from which resources actually loaded or connections were established.
- The count reflects distinct domains—multiple connections to the same domain count as one in the badge number but are tallied with attempt counts in the list.

### Stealth-Blocked
- Domains with attempts redirected or modified invisibly, typically by sophisticated content blockers employing stealth techniques.
- These connections appear in the log but do not successfully load resources.
- Stealth-blocking differs from outright blocking by being invisible to some traditional detection methods.

### Blocked
- Clear rejections or failures to connect to the domain, usually due to blocking by content blockers or network errors.
- These domains are important for understanding where blocking is effective.

### Badge Count and Its Meaning

- The number shown as a badge on the toolbar icon represents **the number of distinct allowed (not blocked) third-party domains** connected by the active tab.
- A lower badge count suggests fewer external parties contacted, often corresponding with tighter privacy.

<Note>
The badge count does not include blocked or stealth-blocked domains. It focuses solely on successful third-party contact.
</Note>

## 3. How to Read and Navigate the Domain Lists

### Panel Sections and Their Purpose

- Each section clearly labels the outcome (allowed, stealth, blocked).
- Domains are listed alphabetically by default.
- The number next to each domain shows how many connection attempts were made — consider this as activity volume.

### Decoding Hostname and Domain Names

- The header splits the full hostname into two parts: the subdomain (if any) and the main domain.
- Domain names shown are decoded to Unicode for readability (e.g., punycode encoded domains appear as human-readable).

### Practical Example

Imagine visiting `https://example.blog.site`. The header might show:

- Subdomain part: `example.blog.`
- Main domain: `site`

If this site loaded resources from CDN domains, trackers, or ad servers, these would be listed across the three outcome categories depending on success or blocking.

<Tip>
A high number of allowed third-party domains can indicate extensive external content loading, which might be a privacy concern.

## 4. Step-by-Step: Using the Popup Panel Effectively

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon while browsing a website you wish to inspect.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Hostname Header">
Verify that the tab hostname at the top matches the current webpage.
Note the split of subdomain and main domain.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Domains Connected Count">
Look at the summary count to see how many distinct allowed third-party domains connected.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
Expand and scan the list under “not blocked” to see all domains successfully contacted.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Check the “stealth-blocked” section to understand what connections were redirected or stealthily blocked.
Consider these as potential hidden activity.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Blocked Domains">
See what connections were fully blocked, indicating where content blocking was effective.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Connection Counts">
Pay attention to the connection count badges next to each domain to gauge activity intensity.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Best Practices and Tips

- Use the popup early and often when visiting new websites to understand your exposure to third-party domains.
- Pay special attention to stealth-blocked domains as they reflect subtle content blocking that might impact site behavior.
- Combine this information with your content blocker’s settings for optimal privacy control.
- Remember that certain legitimate domains, such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), are expected and usually do not harm privacy.

<Warning>
Do not rely solely on domain counts — consider contextual knowledge of domains to differentiate safe from tracking or advertising domains.
</Warning>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Panel Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Why is the badge count zero but the site is loading third-party content?">
This can happen if the extension hasn't processed the tab's network requests yet or if some requests are outside the webRequest API scope.
Reload the webpage and re-open the popup. If the issue persists, consult troubleshooting guides.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some domains appear under stealth-blocked?">
Stealth-blocked domains represent connections altered or redirected in ways invisible to the page. Some advanced blockers implement stealth techniques to avoid detection while blocking.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can the popup panel impact browser performance?">
The panel is lightweight and only activates on demand. However, extensive network activity could cause a delay in rendering. Use it when needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I interpret punycode domain names in the lists?">
uBO Scope decodes these domains into Unicode in the popup for readability. If you see encoded names, refresh the panel.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
