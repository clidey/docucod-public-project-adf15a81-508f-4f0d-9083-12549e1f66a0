# Understanding the Popup Interface

Welcome to the practical guide on mastering the **uBO Scope popup interface**. This key window gives you live insight into the remote connections made by the active browser tab, letting you see at a glance what domains are contacted, which are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked, and what the badge count on the toolbar icon represents.

---

## 1. What This Guide Helps You Achieve

This guide will help you:

- Understand each section of the popup interface and the information it presents
- Interpret the badge counter on the toolbar icon in the context of network connections
- Navigate through the lists of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains
- Access real-time data relevant to the currently active browser tab

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope extension installed and active in your browser (Chromium, Firefox, or Safari)
- Basic familiarity with browsing tabs and browser toolbars

### Expected Outcome

After completing this guide, you will confidently interpret the popup window, effectively use the badge counter as a privacy metric, and quickly identify which third-party domains connect to the page you are visiting.

### Time Estimate

Approximately 5-10 minutes to review and explore the interface

### Difficulty Level

Beginner-friendly—designed for all users interested in understanding network connections through uBO Scope

## 2. Exploring the Popup Interface: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Open the Popup Window

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
- The popup window will appear, refreshing data for the active tab.

#### What to Expect

- You will see the **hostname** and **domain** of the tab at the top.
- Below is a summary section indicating how many distinct domains are connected.
- Then follow sections listing domains by connection outcome.

### Step 2: Understand the Tab Hostname and Domain Display

- The top header shows two parts:
  - The **hostname** (full address of the active tab)
  - The **domain** (the main domain derived from the hostname)

_Example_: If you visit "sub.example.com", the hostname shows "sub." and the domain shows "example.com".


### Step 3: Interpret the Badge Counter

- The badge count on the **browser toolbar icon** shows the number of *distinct third-party domains* for which a connection was successfully allowed in the active tab.
- **Lower badge counts indicate fewer third-party connections.**
- This number excludes the main domain itself; it focuses on third-party remote servers.

<Tip>
The badge counter measures connection *successes*, not block counts, making it a valuable privacy insight metric.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Review Domain Lists in the Sections

The popup organizes domains into three key sections:

#### a) Not Blocked (Allowed)

- Lists third-party domains that were allowed to connect successfully.
- Each domain entry shows the domain name and a count of network requests made.

#### b) Stealth-Blocked

- Domains here represent connections that were stealth-blocked — requests that were intercepted and handled to be "invisible" without signaling a block explicitly.

#### c) Blocked

- Domains where network requests were blocked outright by the content blocker or extension.
- Shows domains and counts of blocked connection attempts.


For each section:
- Domains are sorted alphabetically.
- Counts provide insight into the frequency of requests.

### Step 5: Navigating and Using the Interface

- Scroll through the lists to get a comprehensive picture.
- Use the domain counts to identify heavily contacted third parties.
- The summary section at the top reports the total number of connected domains.

## 3. Real-World Example

Imagine visiting an online news site:

- You open the popup.
- You see the main domain (`news.com`) in the header.
- The badge count shows `5`, indicating five distinct third-party domains connected.
- In the "not blocked" section, you might see domains for ad networks, CDNs, or analytics providers.
- The "stealth-blocked" section may list servers where stealth blocking prevented explicit blocking.
- The "blocked" section shows any trackers your content blocker successfully stopped.

This snapshot helps you quickly understand third-party exposure on the page.

## 4. Tips and Best Practices

- **Check the badge regularly** to monitor how many third-party servers your browser connects to.
- Use the popup lists to identify unexpected third parties which could affect your privacy.
- Refresh the popup if you navigate to a new tab or reload.
- Remember, a lower number in the badge count means fewer third-party connections — a positive privacy indicator.

### Common Pitfalls

- **No Data Shown:** If the popup shows "NO DATA," ensure you have an active tab loaded with a webpage and not a blank page.
- **Badge Empty or Missing:** This may indicate no third-party connections detected or a permissions issue. Verify the extension’s permissions.
- **Confusing Hostname vs Domain:** The hostname includes subdomains; the main domain is the base registered domain.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Issue: Popup Shows No Information

- Confirm the page has network activity (some blank or local pages won't show data).
- Ensure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions to monitor web requests.
- Refresh the tab and reopen the popup.

### Issue: Badge Counter Not Updating

- Reload the page to trigger new network events.
- Check for any browser or extension conflicts causing issues.
- Restart the browser as a last resort.

### Issue: Unexpected Domains Are Displayed

- Keep in mind legitimate services (CDNs, analytics) appear in the allowed list.
- Use this information to adjust or audit your content blocking rules if desired.
