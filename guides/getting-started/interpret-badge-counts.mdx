# Interpreting Badge Counts & Making Decisions

## Understanding the Badge Count

When you look at the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the badge number you see represents the **count of distinct third-party remote servers** your browser connected to while loading the current webpage. This count is not about the total network requests or blocks, but unique third-party domains that were contacted.

### Why Third-Party Domains Matter

Third-party remote servers are external domains different from the site you are visiting. They often provide resources like ads, trackers, CDNs, or social widgets. The number of these distinct third-party domains directly reflects your exposure footprint:

- **A lower badge count means fewer third parties are involved. This is generally better for privacy.**
- **A higher badge count means more external entities are contacted, increasing the surface for tracking or data exposure.**


## Comparing Badge Counts Between Sites

When you browse different websites, the badge count can help you assess how many distinct third-party domains are involved on each site:

- For example, visiting a news site may yield a badge count of 20, while a privacy-focused blog may show a count of 3 or 4.
- Comparing these counts at a glance informs you about which websites involve more third-party connections.


### Important Considerations

- **Not all third parties are malicious or unwanted.** Many sites rely on legitimate CDNs or necessary services with low impact on privacy.
- **Looking only at block counts or request totals can be misleading.** uBO Scope's distinct domain count offers a clearer view of your actual remote exposure.


## How to Use Badge Counts To Inform Privacy Decisions

<u><b>Use badge counts as a privacy signal, not as a definitive judgment.</b></u> Here's a practical workflow:

1. **Observe the badge count on the icon for your current site.**
   - If it’s low (e.g., 0–5), the site has relatively few third-party connections.
   - If it’s high, consider investigating further.

2. **Open the popup to drill into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains.**
   - Identify domains you recognize and trust.
   - Look for domains you do not trust or recognize.

3. **Compare badge counts and domain lists across similar sites.**
   - This helps you make informed choices about which sites leak less or which content blockers are more effective.

4. **Adjust your content blocker or privacy settings based on findings.** 
   - For example, if a particular site consistently shows many allowed tracking domains, consider tightening your blocking rules.


## Best Practices

- **Use uBO Scope in combination with trusted content blockers.** The extension gives you raw visibility – actions to block or allow happen elsewhere.
- **Focus on domains, not just counts.** The popup lists domains in three categories: allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked. Understanding these helps identify privacy risks.
- **Regularly compare badge counts when evaluating privacy tools or filter lists.** A lower count typically means better privacy exposure.


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Do not rely on block counts alone to judge blocker effectiveness.** A higher block count can mean your blocker allows connections to more distinct third-party domains.
- **Avoid trusting 'ad blocker test' pages for reliable results.** Such pages use unrealistic requests and cannot see stealth-blocked connections.
- **Remember that some third-party domains are essential for website functionality, so a zero count is rare and not always desirable.**


## Step-by-Step: Interpreting Badge Counts

<Steps>
<Step title="Check the toolbar badge">Look at the badge number on the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar while visiting a website. A number is shown representing distinct third-party domains contacted.</Step>
<Step title="Open the popup UI">Click on the uBO Scope icon to open the popup. Here you will see a detailed breakdown of third-party domains categorized as 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'.</Step>
<Step title="Review the list of domains">Explore the list of domains under each category. Pay attention to the counts next to each domain and whether you recognize or trust them.</Step>
<Step title="Make a privacy judgement">Based on the count and domains, decide if the site exposes you to many third parties you want to avoid. Consider tightening your content blocker rules if needed.</Step>
<Step title="Compare with other sites">Visit other websites and compare badge counts and domain lists for a practical assessment of privacy exposure across sites.</Step>
</Steps>


## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Badge Counts">
<Accordion title="Why does my badge count change frequently?">
The badge count updates dynamically to reflect real-time connections as the page loads or as scripts on the page make new network requests. This is expected behavior.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is the badge count zero on some sites?">
A zero count means no third-party remote servers were contacted or all connections were blocked. Some minimal or privacy-focused sites may produce this result.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do stealth-blocked domains still appear as connections?">
Stealth-blocked connections are those blocked in a way to avoid detection by the webpage but are still counted to maintain accurate exposure tracking. These domains appear under the "stealth-blocked" section.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Always use uBO Scope as a visibility tool alongside a content blocker for effective privacy management. The badge count indicates exposure but does not itself block connections.
</Tip>


## Examples

### Example 1: Low Badge Count on a Privacy-Focused Blog

- Badge count: 3
- Popup shows three allowed domains: mostly CDN services
- No stealth-blocked or blocked domains

Result: Minimal third-party exposure, low privacy risk.

### Example 2: High Badge Count on a News Site

- Badge count: 20
- Popup shows numerous allowed domains including trackers and ads
- Several stealth-blocked domains

Result: Significant third-party exposure; consider customizing content blocker settings.


## Next Steps

- Explore the [Understanding the Popup: Reading Connection Summaries](/guides/getting-started/reading-popup) guide to master the popup interface and domain details.
- Use the [Interpreting Badge Counts & Making Decisions] documentation page to learn strategic privacy decision-making based on this data.
- Refer to the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/essentials/installation) if you haven't installed uBO Scope yet.
- Consult [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/essentials/troubleshooting) if you encounter any anomalies or missing data.
