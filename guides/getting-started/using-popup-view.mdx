# Exploring the Popup: Understanding Domain Connections

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you navigate and interpret the uBO Scope popup panel, showing you exactly which remote servers a webpage connects to during browsing. You will learn how to understand the badge counts and distinguish between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked network requests for informed privacy decisions.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your browser.
- At least one webpage loaded in an active tab to analyze network connections.

### Expected Outcome
You will confidently read and interpret the popup interface, grasp the meaning behind each category of domains connected, and understand how the badge count reflects distinct third-party connections.

### Time Estimate
5 to 10 minutes

### Difficulty Level
Beginner

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open the uBO Scope Popup
- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- The popup panel will appear, displaying connection information for the active tab.

### 2. Understand the Header Domain Display
- The header shows two parts: 
  - The left span displays the subdomain portion (if any).
  - The right span shows the base domain (registered domain).

**Example:** If visiting `news.example.com`, the popup shows:
- Left: `news.`
- Right: `example.com`

### 3. Read the Domains Connected Summary
- Just below the header in the `domains connected:` section, you see a count of distinct domains connected in the current webpage context.
- This number represents third-party remote servers that your browser accessed.

### 4. Interpret the Three Outcome Sections
The popup divides domains into three sections:

| Section        | Meaning                                                                                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked** (Allowed) | Domains for which network requests were successful and not blocked. These are active connections.                 |
| **Stealth-Blocked**       | Domains where requests were indirectly prevented (e.g., redirects or stealth blocking techniques).             |
| **Blocked**               | Domains where requests were explicitly blocked or encountered errors, preventing connection.                  |

### 5. Review Domain Lists Within Each Outcome
- Each section lists domains connected with a count showing how many times each domain was contacted.
- You can inspect these to spot potential high-frequency third parties.

### 6. Detail Behind Domain Counts
- The displayed domains are sorted and unique.
- Counts indicate how many network requests involved each domain.

### 7. Use the Domain Information for Privacy Insights
- Higher counts or many entries in "Not Blocked" highlight third parties with active connections.
- "Blocked" domains indicate attempted connections your content blocker prevented.
- "Stealth-Blocked" domains provide insight into subtle blocking behaviors.

### 8. Recognize Unicode Domain Names
- Domain names are shown in their Unicode (human-readable) form using Punycode decoding for internationalized domains.

### 9. Understand Badge Count on Toolbar Icon
- The badge reflects the total number of distinct allowed third-party domains seen on the active tab.
- A lower badge count generally means fewer external connections.

### Verification
- Confirm the count under "domains connected" matches the badge count on the extension icon.
- Validate that domains are listed under the expected category based on your browsing behavior.

## Examples & Scenarios

### Example 1: Basic Domain Breakdown
You visit `https://news.example.com`. The popup shows:
- Header: `news.` and `example.com`
- Domains connected: `5`
- Not Blocked: example.com (count 10), cdn.examplecdn.com (count 3)
- Stealth-Blocked: ads.tracker.com (count 2)
- Blocked: tracker.badads.com (count 1)

This reveals that your main site and CDN are connected, with some tracking domains stealth-blocked or blocked.

### Example 2: International Domain Handling
Visiting a site with Unicode domains (e.g., `xn--bcher-kva.example`), you see the decoded domain name displayed, making it readable and easier to identify.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Popup shows "NO DATA" or empty:**
  - Make sure you have an active tab with a loaded webpage.
  - Verify that uBO Scope has necessary permissions and is enabled.
  - Reload the webpage and reopen the popup.

- **Badge count does not update:**
  - Wait a few seconds; badge updates may lag slightly.
  - Confirm browser supports the required `webRequest` API.
  - Check network requests are being captured (no conflicting extensions blocking API).

- **Domains appear in unexpected categories:**
  - "Stealth-blocked" indicates subtle blocking, not outright failure.
  - "Blocked" means the connection failed or was stopped before success.

### Best Practices
- Regularly check the popup when visiting new or unfamiliar sites to monitor connections.
- Use the popup domain counts to inform whether blocking or privacy tools are effectively reducing third-party connections.
- Pay special attention to high-count domains under "Not Blocked" as these are active third parties.
