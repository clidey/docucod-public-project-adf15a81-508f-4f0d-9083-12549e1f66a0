</Tip>

### 3. Confirm Installation Success

- After installation, look for the uBO Scope icon added to your browser’s toolbar.
- The icon displays a badge – initially it may show 0 or be empty if no sites are loaded.

### 4. Enable and Grant Permissions

- When you first click the uBO Scope icon, the browser may prompt for permission to access browsing activity and network requests.
- Grant the requested permissions to enable full monitoring functionality.

<Note>
The extension requires permission to monitor network requests to capture connections accurately. Without these permissions, data will not be reported.
</Note>

### 5. Verify Active Status and Badge Behavior

- Open any website with network activity.
- Click the uBO Scope icon; the popup will list connection summaries for the currently active tab.
- Observe the badge count which reports the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted.

### 6. Start Monitoring Your Connections

- With uBO Scope installed and enabled, continue browsing normally.
- Frequently click the icon to open the popup interface and view real-time allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.

## Understanding the Toolbar Badge and Popup

- The badge count indicates the number of unique third-party remote servers contacted during your browsing session.
- A lower badge count generally means fewer third-party connections, reflecting better privacy.
- The popup interface categorizes connections into:
  - **Not Blocked:** Connections allowed by content blockers.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections blocked invisibly by blockers.
  - **Blocked:** Clearly blocked connections.

<Info>
For detailed explanation of badge behavior and popup content, see the related guide "Your First Analysis: Reading the Toolbar Badge" and "Exploring the Popup: Interpreting Connection Details".

## Troubleshooting Installation Issues

- **Missing Toolbar Icon:**
  - Ensure the extension is enabled in the browser’s extension management page.
  - Restart the browser if the icon does not appear immediately post-installation.

- **Permissions Not Granted:**
  - If monitoring data is missing, re-check permissions via your browser's settings.
  - Reinstall the extension if permission requests do not appear.

- **Unsupported Browser Version:**
  - Confirm you meet the minimum browser version requirements.
  - Update your browser and retry the installation.

- **Network Data Not Showing:**
  - Some network requests may not be visible if the browser's API restricts monitoring.
  - Refer to prerequisite documentation to verify environment compatibility.
