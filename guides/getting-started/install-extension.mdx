| Browser            | Official Store Link                                                   |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium browsers   | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)  |
| Firefox            | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |
| Safari             | Available on Mac App Store or via Safari Extensions (minimum version 18.5 required) |

---

## 4. Installation Steps

Follow these steps according to your browser.

### Step 1: Navigate to the Extension Store

- **Chromium:** Open the Chrome Web Store link provided above.
- **Firefox:** Open the Firefox Add-ons link.
- **Safari:** Visit the Safari Extensions section in the Mac App Store or enable via Safari’s Preferences if available.

### Step 2: Add uBO Scope to Your Browser

- Click the **Add to browser / Add to Firefox / Get** button.
- Confirm any prompts asking to add the extension.

### Step 3: Confirm Permissions

uBO Scope requests the following permissions to function properly:

- Access to websites and web socket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`). This allows it to monitor all network connections.
- Permission to use the `webRequest` API to listen to network events.
- Permissions to access active browser tabs and local storage.

Accept these permissions when prompted to enable full functionality.

<Tip>
These permissions are essential for uBO Scope to detect and display third-party remote server connections accurately. Without them, the extension cannot monitor network requests correctly.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Verify Installation Success

- After installation, you should see the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar.
- Clicking this icon opens the popup panel showing connection data for your current tab (initially may display 'NO DATA' until browsing activity occurs).
- The toolbar badge will display a count representing distinct third-party servers connected.

<Tip>
If you don’t see the icon immediately, check your browser extension settings to ensure uBO Scope is enabled and visible in the toolbar.
</Tip>

## 5. After Installation

Once installed:

- Browse websites as usual.
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to view the domains connected per tab.
- The badge count gives you a quick indicator of the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted.
