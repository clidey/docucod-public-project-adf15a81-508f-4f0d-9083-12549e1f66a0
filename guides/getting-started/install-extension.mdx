## 2. Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Choose Your Browser
uBO Scope supports:
- **Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge)
- **Firefox** (version 128 and above)
- **Safari** (version 18.5 and above)

Ensure your browser is updated to a supported version to avoid compatibility issues.

### Step 2: Access the Official Extension Store
- **Chromium browsers:**
  Visit the [Chrome Web Store - uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)

- **Firefox:**
  Visit the [Firefox Add-ons - uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

- **Safari:**
  Use the App Store on your macOS and search for "uBO Scope" or install via Safari Extensions (as per version availability).

### Step 3: Add the Extension to Your Browser
Click **Add to Chrome**, **Add to Firefox**, or **Install** in Safari. A permissions prompt will appear.

### Step 4: Grant Required Permissions
uBO Scope requires critical permissions to function correctly:
- **Active Tab Access:** To monitor network requests related to active tabs.
- **Storage:** To save extension data locally.
- **webRequest API Access:** To observe and record all web requests your browser makes.

Grant these permissions by confirming the prompts. Without them, uBO Scope cannot monitor connections.

<Tip>
Be sure to install uBO Scope from official sources only to maintain security and integrity.
</Tip>

### Step 5: Confirm Installation and Locate the Toolbar Icon
Once installed:
- Locate the uBO Scope icon near your browser's address bar (usually to the right).
- You should see a badge count appear over the icon after browsing a website. Initially, it may be blank until data is collected.

### Step 6: Perform a Test Visit
Visit any website to allow uBO Scope to collect data.

### Step 7: Open the Popup UI
- Click the uBO Scope icon.
- The popup will display the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to from this tab.
- It categorizes connections into:
  - **Not Blocked** (allowed connections)
  - **Stealth-Blocked** (connections hidden by stealth blocking)
  - **Blocked** (connections actively blocked by content blockers or errors)

<Tip>
For the first run, the popup UI may take a moment to populate with data after browsing a site.
</Tip>

## 3. Verifying Your Installation

### What to Check
- **Toolbar Badge:** Displays a number representing distinct third-party remote servers connected.
- **Popup Data:** Shows detailed domain lists grouped by connection outcome.

### Troubleshooting Installation
If you do not see the toolbar icon or badge:
- Ensure you allowed all requested permissions.
- Verify your browser version meets prerequisites.
- Disable conflicting extensions that may interfere.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues](../getting-started/first-use-configuration/troubleshooting-common-issues) guide for detailed solutions.

## 4. Understanding the Popup UI After Installation

Once uBO Scope is active, the popup UI offers valuable real-time insights:
- The **domain count** badge helps quantify exposure to third-party content.
- The categorized domain list clarifies which connections were allowed or blocked.

For detailed guidance on interpreting these UI elements, see [Understanding the Popup UI: Domains & Connection Status](../guides/getting-started/interpret-popup).

## 5. Best Practices for Installation and Initial Use

- **Install from official stores** only to avoid malicious or fake extensions.
- **Browse multiple websites** after installation to build a representative dataset.
- **Regularly check for updates** to ensure compatibility with your browser.
- **Combine with troubleshooting guides** if encounter unexpected behavior.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

<Warning>
Do not ignore permission dialogs â€” without granting the necessary permissions, uBO Scope cannot function properly.
</Warning>

<Warning>
Avoid installing multiple similar extensions that use the webRequest API simultaneously, as they might conflict and cause incorrect data.
</Warning>

<Note>
If you see no badge count after visiting sites, confirm your browser supports all required APIs and extensions are enabled.
</Note>

## 7. Next Steps

- After installation and initial verification, proceed to understand your connection data deeper by reading the [Understanding the UI](../getting-started/first-use-configuration/understanding-the-ui) guide.
- Explore practical use cases with [Quick Start: Common Use Cases](../overview/feature_overview_usecases/quickstart_usecases).
- If you run into issues, use the [Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues](../getting-started/first-use-configuration/troubleshooting-common-issues) resource.
