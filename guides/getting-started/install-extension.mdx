# Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide walks you through acquiring and installing the uBO Scope extension from official browser stores, followed by simple post-installation setup tips. You will learn how to obtain uBO Scope on your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari), enable it correctly, and confirm it's working seamlessly, ensuring you can start monitoring third-party connections immediately.

---

## 1. What is uBO Scope?

Before you install, it's important to understand that uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to reveal and count all distinct third-party remote server connections made by webpages. Unlike traditional blockers, it gives you clear insight into real network requests, enhancing your browsing privacy awareness.

Ensure your system meets the following prerequisites before installing uBO Scope:

- A supported browser version:
  - **Google Chrome (Chromium-based browsers)**: Version 122 or later
  - **Mozilla Firefox**: Version 128 or later
  - **Safari**: Version 18.5 or later
- Browser permissions to install extensions and allow uBO Scope to monitor web requests (`webRequest` permission).
- An active internet connection to download the extension from the web store.

> Check your browser version by going to the About page in your browser to verify compatibility.

### 4.2 Verify the Badge Count

- The badge count on the toolbar icon shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers your current tab is connected to. A lower count indicates fewer external connections.
- The badge will be empty if no third-party connections are detected on the active tab.

### 4.3 Open the uBO Scope Popup

- Click the extension icon to open the popup.
- The popup displays:
  - The total number of connected domains in the current tab.

    - **Stealth Blocked** (redirected or stealth blocked connections)
    - **Blocked** (failed or explicitly blocked connections)

## 5. Confirming uBO Scope is Working

Follow these steps to validate that uBO Scope is active and functioning:

3. Click the icon to see detailed per-domain connection data.
4. Test with different websites to see varying badge counts and outcomes.
