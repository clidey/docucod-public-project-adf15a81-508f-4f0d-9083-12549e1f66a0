## 6. Best Practices and Tips

- **Keep uBO Scope updated:**
  - Use official store updates for your browser.
  - For local builds, periodically pull upstream changes.

- **Understand permissions:** uBO Scope requires elevated permissions to monitor connections accurately; do not disable any requested permissions.

- **Use alongside content blockers:**
  - uBO Scope works independently to report connections, and can be used together with ad blockers.

- **Check the badge count regularly:**
  - It reports distinct third-party connections allowed, a valuable indicator for privacy.

- **Follow up with the [Popup Usage Guide](https://docs.example.com/guides/getting-started/using-popup-view) to learn how to interpret connection data in detail.**
