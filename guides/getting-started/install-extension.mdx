# Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope

## Introduction

This guide helps you install uBO Scope, a browser extension designed to monitor and report third-party remote server connections your browser makes. You'll learn how to set up uBO Scope on your preferred browser—Chromium, Firefox, or Safari—and understand the core permissions and data privacy model that underpin the extension's operation.

---

## 1. Installation Overview

uBO Scope is available for all major supported browsers with installation via their official extension/add-on stores. After installation, the extension activates automatically without requiring any manual configuration.

### Supported Browsers
- **Chromium-based browsers** (Chrome, Edge, etc.)
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Safari** (version 18.5 and above)

### Permissions Required
uBO Scope needs the following permissions to operate effectively:
- `webRequest` — to listen to network requests and categorize connection outcomes
- `activeTab` — to access information from the currently active browser tab
- `storage` — to save session and configuration data locally

<Tip>
Ensure you install from the official browser extension stores to receive updates and maintain security.
</Tip>

### Installation Links
- For Chromium: [Chrome Web Store - uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- For Firefox: [Firefox Add-ons - uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

### Installation Steps Summary

<Steps>
<Step title="Open your browser's extension or add-on store">Navigate to the store dedicated to your browser (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari Extensions Gallery).</Step>
<Step title="Search for 'uBO Scope'">Use the store search bar to find the official uBO Scope extension.</Step>
<Step title="Add/Install the extension">Click 'Add to Chrome', 'Add to Firefox', or 'Install' and grant the required permissions when prompted.</Step>
<Step title="Verify the extension icon">Check that uBO Scope's icon appears on your browser toolbar.</Step>

<Tip>
If you do not see the extension icon immediately, try restarting your browser or checking the browser's extensions management page to ensure it is enabled.
</Tip>

## 2. First Time Setup and Activation

After installation, uBO Scope initializes automatically:

- The extension immediately begins monitoring network connections in all open and newly opened tabs.
- No manual settings or configuration are necessary.
- The badge on the toolbar icon shows the number of unique third-party domains contacted for the active tab.

### What to Expect on First Use

- Initially, the badge count may show as blank or zero until the extension collects data.
- The popup interface reflects real-time connection data grouped into categories:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Connections that succeeded without interference.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections redirected stealthily by content blockers.
  - **Blocked**: Connections explicitly blocked or failed.

### Confirming the Extension is Active

1. Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
2. The popup window appears showing connection stats for the current tab.
3. The domains counts should update as you browse.

<Note>
If data does not appear or the popup shows 'NO DATA', ensure the extension has the required permissions and your browser supports the necessary webRequest API.
</Note>

## 3. Understanding Core Permissions and Data Privacy

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network traffic while respecting your privacy.

### Permissions Summary
| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `webRequest` | Listen to all network requests made by the browser to categorize outcomes. |
| `activeTab` | Access and monitor the currently active browser tab's URLs and interactions. |
| `storage` | Store session data locally to persist connection information and improve performance. |

### Data Privacy Model

- All connection data is stored **locally** within your browser.
- uBO Scope does **not** send any browsing data or collected information to external servers.
- Session data persists only during your usage; it is saved using browser local or session storage APIs.

<Tip>
You retain full control over your data. Clearing browser storage or uninstalling the extension removes all recorded browsing connection details.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Post-Installation: Using uBO Scope Effectively

### Toolbar Badge

- Reflects the count of distinct third-party domains with successful connections on the active tab.
- A lower count indicates fewer third-party connections, which typically equates to enhanced privacy.

### Popup

- Provides detailed categorized lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Use the popup to analyze which servers your browser connects to and the blocking status.

### Ongoing Monitoring

- uBO Scope continuously monitors network requests in real time.
- Data updates dynamically as you navigate between different pages or tabs.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation and Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Extension Icon Not Visible">
- Confirm installation completed successfully.
- Check if the extension is enabled in the browser's extensions/add-ons page.
- Restart browser if necessary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions Not Granted">
- Verify that the browser prompted for permissions during installation.
- Reinstall if permissions were denied initially.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Data Not Appearing in Popup">
- Confirm browser supports the `webRequest` API.
- Some private browsing modes or restrictive settings may block data collection.
- Disable conflicting extensions that may interfere.
</Accordion>

## 5. Advanced Notes for Developers and Filter List Maintainers

While this guide focuses on user installation and setup, here's notable technical info for those interested:

- uBO Scope's background script monitors network requests using the browser's `webRequest` API and categorizes them into outcomes.
- The extension uses local and session storage to maintain state across browsing sessions.
- Cross-browser compatibility is achieved by detecting the extension flavor (Chromium, Firefox, Safari) and adjusting accordingly.

For development or filter list maintenance, refer to the source code in `js/background.js` and storage helper functions in `js/ext.js`. This project is open source, hosted at the [uBO-Scope GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).

## 6. Next Steps

After successful installation and setup, consider exploring the following documentation to maximize your benefit from uBO Scope:

- [First Run: What to Expect](getting-started/quick-setup/first-run)
- [Navigating the Popup and Interface](guides/getting-started/explore-popup)
- [Quick Validation: See uBO Scope in Action](getting-started/basic-usage-validation/validate-connection-visibility)
- [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](getting-started/basic-usage-validation/troubleshooting-installation)

These guides will deepen your understanding of the extension’s operation and help you interpret the connection data for improved privacy insights.

## Appendix: Manual Packaging for Linux Environment

Developers or advanced users wanting to package the extension manually can use the `tools/make-package.sh` script. It copies required files and manifests into a build directory for the specified platform.

### Usage Example
```bash
./tools/make-package.sh chromium 1.0.1
```

The script:
- Cleans previous builds
- Copies assets, scripts, styles, HTML, and platform-specific manifests
- Optionally updates the manifest version

Refer to the script located in the `tools/` directory of the repository for detailed operations.
