## Step-by-Step Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Official Extension Store">
Locate your browser’s official extension or add-on store:
- **Chrome:** Open the [Chrome Web Store uBO-Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
- **Firefox:** Open the [Firefox Add-ons uBO-Scope page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
- **Safari:** Safari users should visit the App Store within Safari or Apple's official Safari Extensions gallery, ensuring Safari is version 18.5 or higher.

_Note: Always install extensions from official stores to guarantee security and authenticity._
</Step>

<Step title="Add the Extension to Your Browser">
Click the **Add to Chrome/Firefox/Safari** button on the extension’s store page.

When prompted, review the permissions uBO-Scope requests. These include:
- Access to active tabs
- Storage permissions
- Ability to observe web requests

Approve and confirm the installation to proceed.

Accepting these permissions is necessary for uBO-Scope to measure network connections effectively.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the Installation">
After installation completes:
- Look for the uBO-Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It is identifiable by an icon with the extension’s logo (a simple stylized shield).

If the icon is not visible:
- Check your browser’s extensions or add-ons manager to ensure uBO-Scope is enabled.
- For Chrome, you may need to pin the extension to the toolbar.

Open any website to confirm uBO-Scope is active. The icon’s badge will reflect the number of distinct third-party connections.

</Step>

<Step title="Initial Setup and Next Steps">
Once installed and visible:
- Click the uBO-Scope icon to open the popup panel and view measured data.
- For detailed usage, refer to the [First Launch & Basic Configuration](../getting-started/installation-setup/first-launch-setup) guide.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions Explained
uBO-Scope requires specific permissions to function correctly:

- **ActiveTab:** Allows the extension to access information about the currently active tab for measurement.
- **Storage:** Enables saving session data and settings.
- **WebRequest:** Permits the extension to observe network requests made by webpages to provide visibility into third-party connections.

These permissions do not grant the extension control over browsing data; rather, they enable transparent measurement of network activity.
