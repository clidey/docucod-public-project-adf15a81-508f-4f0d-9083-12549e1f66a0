## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Choose Your Browser
Confirm that you are running a compatible browser version:

- Chrome (version 122.0+)
- Firefox (version 128.0+)
- Safari (version 18.5+)

If your browser is outdated, update it before proceeding.

### Step 2: Download and Install uBO Scope

| Browser      | Installation Source                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| Chrome       | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox      | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)          |
| Safari       | Available through Safari Extensions or your preferred Safari extension source |

1. Visit the link for your browser.
2. Click **Add to Browser** or **Install**.
3. Confirm any permissions or prompts.

### Step 3: Permissions Overview
uBO Scope requires the following permissions to function correctly:

- **Web Request**: Allows uBO Scope to listen to web traffic for measuring connections.
- **Active Tab**: Enables the extension to access information about the current browser tab.
- **Storage**: Saves session data and extension settings locally.

These permissions are requested during installation. You must grant them for uBO Scope to work as intended.

### Step 4: Verify Installation
After installation:

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- The icon will display a badge count representing the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected by the active tab.
- Click the icon to open the popup displaying detailed connection information.


### Step 5: Quick Test
1. Open any website (e.g., your favorite news site).
2. After the page loads, click the uBO Scope icon.
3. Confirm that the popup displays connection statistics and domain counts.

If you see connection data and the badge count updates appropriately, installation is successful.
