# Installing and Setting Up uBO-Scope

## Overview
This guide walks you through installing uBO-Scope on your preferred browser—Chrome (Chromium-based browsers), Firefox, or Safari—pinning it to your browser toolbar, and verifying the installation. By following these steps, you'll have uBO-Scope immediately ready to monitor and reveal all distinct third-party remote server connections made by webpages.

---

## Prerequisites
Before starting installation, ensure you meet the following:

- **Browser version**: 
  - Chromium-based browsers (including Chrome) version 122 or newer
  - Mozilla Firefox version 128 or newer
  - Safari version 18.5 or newer
- **Permissions**: uBO-Scope requires permission to access `webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab` to monitor network requests effectively.
- **Internet connectivity**: Needed for downloading the extension from official stores.

For more on supported browsers and system requirements, see [Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/installation-setup/prerequisites-requirements).

## Installing uBO-Scope

### 1. Choose Your Browser and Installation Source

| Browser                | Installation Link                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium-Based (Chrome) | [Chrome Web Store - uBO-Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox                | [Firefox Add-ons - uBO-Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |
| Safari                 | Safari extension on official Apple Extension Gallery (search 'uBO Scope')

### 2. Install the Extension
- Navigate to the appropriate link above for your browser.
- Click "Add to [Browser]" or "Install" to download and enable the extension.
- Confirm any permission prompts the browser displays to allow the extension to function.

<Note>
Installing from official sources ensures you receive the latest updates and security patches.
</Note>

### 3. Pin uBO-Scope to Your Toolbar

To access uBO-Scope quickly, pin (or show) its icon on your browser toolbar:

- **Chrome/Chromium:**
  - Click the puzzle-piece extensions icon on the toolbar.
  - Find 'uBO Scope' in the list.
  - Click the pin icon next to it.
- **Firefox:**
  - Click the menu (three horizontal bars).
  - Select "Customize Toolbar".
  - Drag the uBO Scope icon to the desired place on the toolbar.
  - Click "Done".
- **Safari:**
  - Go to Safari > Preferences > Extensions.
  - Ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
  - Use the toolbar customization option to make the icon visible if necessary.

## Verifying Installation

After installation and pinning, verify the extension is working correctly:

### 1. Confirm Toolbar Icon Presence
Ensure the uBO Scope icon is visible on your browser's toolbar.

### 2. Initial Badge Count Check
- Open any website that loads external content (e.g., news site, social media).
- Observe the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge number, which shows the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected.
- A lower count typically means fewer third-party connections.

### 3. Open uBO Scope Popup
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- The popup panel should open, displaying:
  - The domain and hostname of the current tab.
  - A summary count of connected domains.
  - Lists of connected domains grouped by network request outcome categories (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).

### 4. Validate Dynamic Updates
- Navigate to different websites and observe the badge count and popup details.
- The counts should update reflecting the active tab’s network activity.

<Check>
If the badge count never updates or the popup shows "NO DATA", ensure you have granted required permissions and that other extensions (especially privacy blockers) do not interfere.
</Check>

## Optional: Manual Installation (Developers / Advanced Users)

If you prefer to build and install uBO Scope manually (e.g., for development or testing), you can use the provided scripts.

### Building for Firefox on Linux

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
cd uBO-Scope
```

2. Run the build script for Firefox:

```bash
./tools/make-firefox.sh
```

3. The output `.xpi` file will be in `build/uBO-Scope.firefox.xpi`.

4. Install this `.xpi` file manually in Firefox via "about:debugging" > "This Firefox" > "Load Temporary Add-on".

<Warning>
Manual builds require a Linux environment and familiarity with browser extension debugging.
</Warning>

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Keep uBO Scope Updated:** Always install updates via your browser's extension manager to access bug fixes and improvements.
- **Review Permissions:** Only grant necessary permissions to keep monitoring accurate and secure.
- **Use Alongside Content Blockers:** uBO Scope works independently and can complement content blockers by providing transparent connection data.
- **Monitor Different Sites Regularly:** Regular usage helps you understand typical third-party connection patterns.
