If you prefer manual installation or use a less common Chromium-based browser:

1. Download the extension package from the GitHub repository releases or build it locally following platform-specific instructions.
2. Open your browser's extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions/` in Chromium browsers).
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Load the unpacked extension by selecting the local folder.

## Verifying Successful Installation

### Confirm Extension is Enabled
- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- Click the icon to open the popup interface.

### Validate Extension Activity
- Browse to any website and watch the badge count update, showing the number of distinct third-party servers connected.
- If the badge shows a number, the extension is actively tracking network requests.

For detailed validation steps and troubleshooting, see [Quick Validation & Troubleshooting](../setup-and-first-use/verifying-functionality).

## Best Practices

- Use official extension stores whenever possible for installed extensions.
- Keep your browser updated to ensure compatibility.
- After installation, familiarize yourself with the toolbar badge and popup interface to interpret results effectively.

## Additional Notes

- uBO Scope functions by using the browser's `webRequest` API, so network requests invisible to this API (e.g., some DNS-based blocking) will not be reported.
- Installation across different browsers behaves similarly but always verify version compatibility.
