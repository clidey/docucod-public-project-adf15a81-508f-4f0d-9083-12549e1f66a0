# Installation and Browser Support for uBO Scope

---

## Overview
This guide details how to install uBO Scope on supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), verify that the installation is successful, and ensure your environment meets all requirements. Following these steps guarantees you can reliably monitor third-party network connections during your browsing sessions with uBO Scope.

This page focuses exclusively on the installation process and browser compatibility. For initial configuration and usage, please refer to linked guides in the related sections.

## Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions
uBO Scope supports the latest major desktop browsers with specific minimum version requirements to leverage manifest v3 and required browser APIs.

| Browser   | Minimum Version |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Chrome / Chromium  | 122.0+          |
| Firefox    | 128.0+          |
| Safari     | 18.5+           |

<Note>
Support is limited to these versions because the extension relies on Manifest V3 APIs, including `webRequest` and service workers. Older versions lack necessary API support.
</Note>

---

## Necessary Browser Permissions
uBO Scope requires the following permissions to function correctly:

- **webRequest**: To monitor network requests transparently.
- **activeTab**: To identify the active tab and associated requests.
- **storage**: To save session data and settings.

These permissions are requested automatically upon installation. You must grant them for accurate network connection monitoring.

<Warning>
Denying any required permissions will prevent uBO Scope from capturing network requests or updating the popup and badge counts correctly.
</Warning>

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Installing via Browser Stores

To install uBO Scope quickly and securely, use your browser’s official extension/add-on store links:

- **Firefox**: [Firefox Add-ons - uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

### 2. Manual Installation (Developer Mode)

If you prefer or require manual installation (e.g., for development or usage outside the stores), follow these steps:

- Open your browser's extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions` in Chrome)
- Enable Developer Mode (toggle visible on the top right)
- Click “Load unpacked” and select the folder containing the uncompressed extension files

<Note>
Manual installation requires all files, including manifest.json, background.js, popup.html, and assets, to be present and unmodified.
