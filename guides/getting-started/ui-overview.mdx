# Understanding the Popup UI

## 1. Introduction to the Popup UI

The uBO Scope popup UI is your interactive lens into the network activity of the currently active browser tab. It presents a detailed and structured snapshot of all third-party remote server connections, categorized by their connection status. This guide walks you through the popup's layout, how it organizes connection data, and how to interpret each part to gain actionable insights into your browsing privacy.

### Why the Popup UI Matters
- **Transparency:** Visualize allowed, stealth-blocked, and outright blocked connections per tab.
- **Insight:** Quickly assess which domains your browser interacts with behind the scenes.
- **Control:** Detect potential privacy risks by analyzing stealth and blocked domains.

Before proceeding, ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled. Also, familiarize yourself with the [Basic Usage of Toolbar and Popup UI](https://example.com/getting-started/first-use-configuration/basic-usage) for foundational concepts.

## 2. Structure of the Popup UI

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon on any active tab, the popup unfolds with the following main elements:

### Header (Tab Hostname)
- Displays the main domain of the active tab.
- Uses visual separation to clarify subdomains (e.g., shows distinct parts before the registered domain).
- Helps identify which site’s connection details you are viewing.

### Summary Section
- Shows the total count of **distinct domains connected to (allowed)** from the current tab.
- Serves as a quick privacy metric—lower counts indicate fewer third-party exposures.

### Outcome Sections
Three core sections categorize the connection outcomes:

1. **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
   - Lists third-party domains with successfully established connections.
   - Each domain is paired with a count of how many requests succeeded.
   - Highlighted with a subtle green background signaling allowed network activity.

2. **Stealth-Blocked**
   - Lists domains where connections were prevented stealthily — the page attempts connections that are silently redirected or obscured.
   - Counts represent how many such stealth blocks occurred per domain.
   - Visualized with light red to denote stealth blocking.

3. **Blocked**
   - Shows domains where network requests failed or were blocked outright.
   - Counts reflect the number of blocked requests.
   - Marked by red backgrounds indicating explicit blocking.

Each section only appears if there is relevant data; empty sections are hidden for clarity.

## 3. Navigating and Interpreting the UI

### Step-by-Step Exploration

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon on your browser toolbar to display the popup for the current active tab.
- Success: The popup header immediately shows the tab’s main domain.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Domain Summary">
Look just below the header at the 'domains connected' count.
- This number quantifies allowed third-party domains accessed by the tab.
- Lower numbers correlate with a reduced network footprint.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Allowed Domains">
Browse the "not blocked" green section.
- Each entry shows a third-party domain name and the number of allowed requests.
- Enables you to identify common CDNs or legitimate services.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Observe the "stealth-blocked" red-shaded section.
- Domains here signal suspicious or stealthy network blocking.
- Frequent stealth blocks may indicate advanced blocking or suspicious activity.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify Blocked Domains">
Review the "blocked" section.
- This lists outright blocked domains with their blocked request counts.
- Useful for ensuring your blocker is enforcing expected restrictions.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Success Criteria
- Each domain is displayed clearly, with counts aligned for quick comparison.
- Sections without data are hidden, minimizing distraction.
- The header domain matches the active tab’s main hostname.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Example: Viewing Connections for example.com
Suppose you're visiting `https://example.com`. On clicking the popup, you might see:

- Header: "example.com"
- Summary: "domains connected: 7"
- Not Blocked Section: Shows domains like `cdn.example.net` (3 connections), `analytics.tracker.com` (1 connection).
- Stealth-Blocked Section: Contains `stealth.blocker.net` (2 connections), indicating suppressed network calls.
- Blocked Section: Lists `ads.example.com` (5 blocked requests), confirming ad connections prevented.

This reflects a typical browsing scenario where some third parties are allowed (e.g., CDNs), some connections are stealth-blocked, and known ad servers are actively blocked.

### Tips for Understanding Counts
- Counts are the number of requests made by the active tab to that domain.
- High counts in the allowed domain mean heavy use; consider whether this matches expected site behavior.
- A non-empty stealth section may warrant investigating network privacy implications.

## 5. Best Practices and Tips

- **Regularly Check the Popup:** Monitoring helps detect unexpected third parties or new trackers.
- **Interpret Counts Carefully:** High allowed domain counts may indicate extensive third-party use.
- **Stealth Blocking Awareness:** Stealth blocks are harder to see; uBO Scope surfaces these to inform.
- **Use Alongside Other Tools:** Combine with other privacy blockers or audits for comprehensive analysis.

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup UI Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Sections">
- Ensure the tab is active and browsing a URL (not a new tab page).
- Verify uBO Scope is enabled and permissions granted.
- Reload the tab to refresh network capture.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Counts Don't Update After Navigation">
- Sometimes network data caches; try closing and reopening the popup.
- Confirm network activity from the tab (e.g., reload the page).
- Check extension’s background activity is running.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains Seem Missing or Incomplete">
- uBO Scope tracks only third-party connections detected by the browser's webRequest API.
- Some lower-level or special requests may not be visible.
- Ensure no conflicting extensions impair functionality.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
