# Understanding the Popup and Toolbar Badge

## Overview
This guide will help you understand how to use uBO-Scope's popup interface and toolbar badge to monitor domain connection counts and network request outcomes for the current browser tab. You'll learn how to read the badge's third-party domain counts, interpret the categorized connection statuses (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked), and navigate the popup's domain lists in real time. 

By leveraging this knowledge, you will gain clear insight into your browser's network activity, improving your awareness of privacy exposure and content blocker effectiveness.

## What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
- Understand what information the toolbar badge conveys and how it reflects the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- Read and interpret the popup's categorized domain lists and their connection outcomes.
- Navigate the popup to analyze real-time network request activity for the active tab.

## Prerequisites
- uBO-Scope installed on a supported browser (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Necessary permissions (activeTab, webRequest) granted for the extension.
- An active browser tab with network activity.

## Expected Outcome
You will confidently interpret connection counts shown on the toolbar badge, understand what each popup section represents, and effectively analyze domain connection data exposed by uBO-Scope.

# 1. The Toolbar Badge: A Real-Time Connection Indicator

The toolbar badge number represents the count of **distinct third-party remote domains** your browser has connected to on the current tab. A lower badge count generally indicates fewer third-party connections, a desirable state for privacy-conscious users.

### Key Points About the Badge
- The count reflects only distinct remote domains to which resources were successfully fetched (allowed).
- It excludes connections that were blocked or stealth-blocked.
- Not all third-party connections are harmful; some are required (e.g., content delivery networks).
- The badge provides a higher-level, privacy-relevant metric beyond simple block counts.

### Example
If the badge shows `5`, it means your browser has loaded resources from five distinct third-party domains during this page's session.

Remember: A lower badge count typically signals better privacy exposure.

# 2. Opening the Popup Interface

Click the uBO-Scope toolbar icon to open the popup window. This interface provides detailed information about the current tab's network requests.

### Layout Overview
- **Tab Hostname Header:** Displays the hostname and domain of the current active tab.
- **Summary Section:** Shows the total number of connected domains.
- **Outcome Sections:** Three distinct sections group domains by their connection outcome:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were stealthily blocked (redirected or otherwise altered).
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.

### What You Should See
On opening the popup while on an active tab with network activity, you will see the current tab's domain shown clearly at the top, a domains connected count, and categorized lists of domains along with counts of requests per domain.

---

# 3. Interpreting the Popup Sections

The popup organizes domain connection data into three categories based on request outcomes:

### 3.1 Not Blocked (Allowed)
This section lists all distinct third-party domains from which resources were successfully loaded.

- Domains appear with counts representing the number of requests to that domain.
- Generally, these are domains your browser communicated with without any blocking.
- Ideally, this list should be minimal for better privacy.

### 3.2 Stealth-Blocked
Domains in this section reflect network requests that were "stealth-blocked": usually redirected or otherwise manipulated in a way that the request did not complete normally, without explicit blocking errors.

- These connections are intercepted quietly.
- They may indicate content blockers altering requests to prevent tracking.

### 3.3 Blocked
Explicitly blocked domains where network requests failed or were blocked by content blocker rules.

- Connection attempts were denied.
- These domains did not supply any content during this tab session.

<Note>
If a section has no domains for the current tab, it is hidden from the popup to keep the interface clean.
</Note>

# 4. Reading Domain Names and Counts

Each domain row lists:
- The **domain name** (automatically converted to proper Unicode representation if needed, courtesy of Punycode).
- The **request count** badge showing how many requests were made to that domain.

This lets you distinguish between many requests to the same domain and single requests spread over multiple domains.

<Example>
If "cdn.example.com" shows count "12" in the allowed section, your browser requested resources from this domain 12 times.
</Example>

# 5. How Data Updates and Reflects Real-Time Activity

uBO-Scope tracks network requests live through browser `webRequest` listeners:

- When you load or reload a page, the popup reflects current network outcomes.
- The extension groups requests by domain and categorizes them according to success, stealth blocking, or blocking.
- The toolbar badge updates dynamically to indicate the number of allowed distinct domains.

<Info>
Background processing batches requests every second to update data without burdening browser performance.

# 6. Practical User Flow

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Observe the toolbar badge">
Look at the number on uBO-Scope's icon for the current tab. This number shows how many third-party domains you connected with.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Click the icon to open the popup">
Open the detailed popup to explore the domains grouped by connection outcome.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Review allowed domains">
Check which domains loaded content successfully. Consider if these are expected and necessary.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: Review stealth-blocked and blocked domains">
See which connections were blocked or stealth blocked. These might relate to your content blocker’s effectiveness.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 5: Use insights to adjust settings">
Use the domain information to decide whether to adjust your content blocker or investigate suspicious connections.
</Step>
</Steps>

# 7. Best Practices & Tips

- **Check the badge often**: Use it as an immediate privacy exposure metric.
- **Interpret blocked vs. stealth blocked differently**: Stealth blocking might silently replace or redirect resource requests.
- **Focus on domains, not raw block counts**: Third-party domain counts provide clearer privacy insight.
- **Reload the tab**: To get updated connection data, reload pages and observe popup changes.

# 8. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup and Badge Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty sections">
- Ensure you have an active tab with network activity.
- Verify that uBO-Scope has appropriate permissions (webRequest, activeTab).
- Try reloading the tab to refresh data.
- Confirm uBO-Scope is running (check installed extensions).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count does not update">
- The badge updates asynchronously; give it a moment after page load.
- Switch tabs and return to see refreshed counts.
- Confirm browser version supports required APIs.
- Check for conflicting extensions that may block or interfere with event logging.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains seem unexpectedly high or low">
- Not all third-party domains are malicious; some domains serve essential content.
- Use domain knowledge to assess.
- If suspicious, combine with network inspection tools for further analysis.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
