# Understanding the Popup Interface

An interactive walkthrough of the uBO Scope extension's popup UI. This guide helps you understand what information is displayed, how to interpret domain counts, and how to quickly recognize allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections for the active browser tab.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### Purpose and User Intent
The popup interface in uBO Scope serves as your real-time, easy-to-understand dashboard for viewing the network connections initiated by your active browser tab. This guide is aimed at helping you navigate the popup UI to quickly assess the number and types of third-party connections—whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and active in your browser.
- An active browser tab with network activity.
- Basic understanding of domain concepts (hostname vs domain).

### Expected Outcome
After following this guide, you will:
- Understand what each UI element in the popup represents.
- Know how to interpret domain counts for the active tab.
- Easily spot allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.
- Gain insights into the state of your network privacy for the visited webpage.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 5 minutes to study and familiarize yourself with the interface.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner-friendly; no technical skills required.

## 2. Exploring the Popup UI

The popup interface is structured to provide three meaningful sections that categorize connections based on their outcome:

### a. Header Section: Active Tab Hostname
- Displays the hostname of your current active tab.
- If the hostname is a subdomain, the popup splits the view into two parts: the subdomain portion on the left and the base domain portion on the right.
- The base domain shown corresponds to the public suffix list determination, ensuring accurate domain classification.

_Example:_ For `shop.example.com`, 'shop.' appears on the left and `example.com` on the right.

### b. Summary Section: Total Domains Connected
- Shows the total **number of distinct domains** contacted by the active tab.
- This value counts only allowed connections (not blocked or stealth-blocked).
- A lower domain count means fewer third-party connections and typically suggests better privacy.

### c. Outcome Sections: Connection Categories
There are three clearly labeled categories representing the connection outcomes:

| Section         | Meaning                                                            | Visual Cue                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked** | Domains with allowed (successful) connections                     | Green-highlighted header and badges    |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Domains blocked stealthily by content blockers or browser     | Red-highlighted header and badges      |
| **Blocked**     | Domains fully blocked or with failed network requests             | Red-highlighted header and badges      |

Each section contains a vertical list of domains, with:
- The domain name on the right.
- A small badge count showing how many connection attempts were made to that domain.

The list is sorted alphabetically.

<Check>
Each domain entry in the list uses the `punycode` library to display internationalized domain names in readable Unicode.
</Check>

## 3. Step-by-Step Guide to Using the Popup

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon next to your browser's address bar to open the popup.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the Active Tab's Domain">
Look at the header section to find the active tab's hostname and base domain.
If the hostname is a subdomain, notice the two-part display.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Total Domains Connected">
In the summary section, see how many domains this tab connected to.
Lower counts usually indicate less third-party exposure.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Connections">
Focus on the green-highlighted 'not blocked' section.
Each domain listed here represents an allowed third-party connection.
The badge shows the number of connections to that domain.
</Step>
<Step title="Evaluate Stealth-Blocked Connections">
Next, check the 'stealth-blocked' section with a red header.
These domains attempted connections but were stealth-blocked — silently prevented by privacy tools or browser features.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Fully Blocked Connections">
Lastly, see the 'blocked' section for domains where connection attempts failed or were actively blocked.
This helps understand what network activity was stopped.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Practical Tips & Insights

- The **badge count on the browser toolbar icon** corresponds to the number of distinct allowed third-party domains. Use the popup to understand what those domains are.
- If the **total domains connected is zero or missing**, the tab likely has no network activity or the extension is not receiving data yet.
- **Stealth-blocked connections** are important to identify because they represent network requests that do not appear as block counts in other content blockers, offering a clearer picture of privacy.
- Pay attention to **domains with high connection counts**; these may indicate domains with extensive resources loaded, such as CDNs or trackers.

<Tip>
Internationalized domains display with Unicode characters for clarity but are stored and processed internally with punycode. This ensures proper domain handling regardless of language scripts.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Interface Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Information">
- Ensure the active tab has loaded and tried to make network requests.
- Reload the page in the active tab and try opening the popup again.
- Confirm uBO Scope has necessary permissions and is enabled in your browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains Not Updating as Expected">
- Sometimes network data is processed with slight delay; wait a few seconds before checking.
- Try closing and reopening the popup to refresh its data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Differs from Popup Domain List">
- Badge count only reflects allowed domains.
- The popup additionally lists stealth-blocked and blocked domains in separate sections.
- Verify you are checking the correct sections for a comprehensive view.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

      <div class="domains">
        <!-- List of allowed domains with counts -->
        <div class="row">
          <span class="domain">example.com</span>
          <span class="count badge">3</span>
        </div>

## Summary
The popup interface of uBO Scope is your streamlined window into the network state of your active tab. It categorizes all third-party network connections into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains, providing you clarity on your browsing privacy exposure.

Regular use of this interface helps you proactively assess which third parties your browser talks to, and identify stealthy or blocked attempts that others do not show.
