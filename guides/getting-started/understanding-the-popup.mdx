# Interpreting the uBO Scope Popup

## 1. Overview

The uBO Scope popup interface is your direct window into understanding what network connections your browser tab is making or attempting to make. This guide leads you through each element of the popup so you can quickly assess the presence and behavior of remote servers involved during browsing. By learning to read the popup, you’ll gain clear insight into which connections are allowed, which were blocked, and which were stealthily blocked (redirected), helping you distinguish between normal site activity and potential trackers or excessive third-party requests.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before exploring the popup, ensure:

- You have installed uBO Scope on a supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- The extension has been granted necessary permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).
- You are viewing a loaded webpage tab; network data relates to the currently active tab.

---

## 3. Understanding the Popup Interface

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup window opens displaying analyzed network connections for your active browser tab.

### 3.1 Tab Hostname Header

Located at the top is a two-part header showing hostname details:

- **Left part:** Subdomain prefix (e.g., `www.` or custom subdomains), shown only if different from main domain.
- **Right part:** Main domain of the current tab, e.g., `example.com`.

If you see “NO DATA” here, it means no network requests have yet been captured for the tab.

### 3.2 Summary Section

Below the header, a single line summarizes how many distinct domains connected in the tab:

```text
domains connected: [Number]
```

This count reflects **distinct third-party domains** contacted — a lower number indicates fewer potentially tracking or extraneous calls.

### 3.3 Connection Outcome Sections

The popup divides network connections into **three outcome categories**, each presented as a separate section with domain lists:

1. **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
   - Domains for which network requests successfully connected.
   - Shown with a green highlight on the section header.

2. **Stealth-Blocked**
   - Domains where network requests were redirected stealthily, giving the appearance nothing was blocked.
   - Shown with a red highlight on the section header.

3. **Blocked**
   - Domains where network requests were explicitly blocked or failed.
   - Also marked in red.

Each section shows a list of connected domains and the count of requests made to each. If a section’s list is empty, that section is hidden automatically.

### 3.4 Domains and Request Counts

Within each outcome section, each line shows:

- The domain name (e.g., `cdn.example.net`). The display converts any Punycode domain to a human-readable form for clarity.
- A small badge next to the domain shows how many distinct requests targeted that domain.

This allows you to quickly identify heavy third parties or trackers making multiple requests.

## 4. Reading and Using the Popup: A Practical Flow

Follow these steps each time you open the popup:

<Steps>
<Step title="Identify the Tab Domain">
Look at the header at the top; verify the domain corresponds to the active tab URL.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Summary Count">
Review the "domains connected" number to understand the volume of third-party connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
Focus first on the green "not blocked" section to see which domains successfully loaded resources.
</Step>
<Step title="Investigate Blocked and Stealth Domains">
Examine the red-highlight sections for blocked and stealth-blocked domains, indicating possible trackers or unwanted connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Request Counts">
Check the badges next to each domain to spot domains with unusually high numbers of requests, often signaling trackers or heavy third-party usage.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## 5. Real-World Usage Scenarios

- **Normal page load:** You see a handful of allowed domains, typically first-party and a few trusted CDNs, with little or no blocked or stealth-blocked domains.
- **Privacy-conscious browsing:** Ideally, blocked and stealth-blocked sections include known trackers or ad servers.
- **Suspicious connections:** Large numbers of requests to unknown third-party domains, especially in the allowed section, might mean trackers or unwanted background requests.

Understanding this breakdown helps you assess site safety and evaluate your content blocker effectiveness.

---

## 6. Best Practices and Tips

- Refresh the popup while on an active tab to get the latest connection data.
- Use the domain counts to identify suspicious domains making frequent requests.
- Understand that some stealth-blocked domains show as redirects that are deliberately hidden from the page; this is part of advanced content blocking techniques.
- Follow up on unknown domains by researching them or using blocklists for better privacy.
- Remember the badge count on the browser toolbar reflects how many distinct allowed third-party domains have successfully connected for the current tab.

## 7. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with the Popup"> 
<Accordion title="NO DATA displayed in header">
If the popup shows 'NO DATA', it likely means network requests for the tab have not yet been captured. Try:
- Reloading the active tab to trigger network activity.
- Ensuring the extension has required permissions.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Empty Allowed or Blocked Sections">
Sections may be hidden if no domains fall into those categories. This is normal if no domains were blocked or stealth-blocked.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup data seems outdated or incomplete">
Network requests data is captured asynchronously, with occasional delay. Close and reopen popup or switch tabs to refresh.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Summary

The uBO Scope popup is your essential tool to transparently review network connections per tab, helping you:

- Quickly see how many and which third-party domains a page communicates with.
- Understand the status of connections (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked).
- Evaluate site behavior and the effectiveness of content blocking.

Regularly checking the popup empowers you to maintain control over your browsing privacy.
