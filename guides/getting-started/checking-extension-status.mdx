# Checking If uBO Scope is Active

Ensure that uBO Scope is properly installed and actively monitoring your browser's network connections by confirming the toolbar icon, understanding the badge count, and testing on known websites. This guide walks you through these validation steps so you can confidently begin tracking third-party network activity.

## 1. Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you verify that uBO Scope is running correctly in your browser. You'll learn how to locate and interpret the toolbar icon and badge, and how to test the extension's functionality on common websites.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope must be installed in a supported browser (Chromium, Firefox, or Safari).
- Basic familiarity with your browser's extension toolbar.
- Access to websites with typical third-party connections for testing.

### Expected Outcome
- Confirmation that uBO Scope is active and monitoring network requests.
- Understanding of what the toolbar icon and badge counts represent.
- Ability to validate extension functionality with practical website tests.

### Time Estimate
5–10 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

1. Look for the uBO Scope icon on your browser's extension toolbar. The icon resembles a stylized shield labeled 'uBO Scope'.
2. If you do not see the icon:
   - Check if the extension is installed correctly.
   - On Chromium and Firefox, click the extensions menu (puzzle piece icon) to find uBO Scope and pin it to the toolbar.

**Expected Result:** The uBO Scope icon is visible on the toolbar.


### Step 2: Understand the Toolbar Badge

1. Observe the numeric badge on the icon. This number indicates the count of distinct third-party remote servers your current webpage is connected to, for allowed (not blocked) connections only.
2. A higher number means more third-party connections; a lower number typically indicates fewer external trackers or resources.

<Tip>
The badge counts **allowed** third-party domains only. Blocked or stealth-blocked domains do not increment this number.
</Tip>


### Step 3: Open the uBO Scope Popup

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open its popup interface.
2. The popup displays:
   - The main domain of the current active tab.
   - Sections listing "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked" third-party domains.
   - Counts of domains contacted in each category.

**Expected Result:** Detailed real-time lists of connected third-party domains with their respective counts are visible.


### Step 4: Test uBO Scope on Easy-to-Verify Websites

1. Visit a website known to load common third-party content, such as https://www.wikipedia.org or https://www.bbc.com.
2. Observe the badge count on the extension icon:
   - It should display a non-zero number reflecting distinct allowed third-party domains.
3. Open the popup and verify that domain lists populate accordingly.

<Tip>
If you see "NO DATA" or zero counts persistently, try refreshing the page or visiting a different site.
</Tip>


### Step 5: Troubleshooting Common Activation Issues

- If the icon does not update or you see no data:
  - Make sure the browser supports the required webRequest API (see Supported Browsers & Requirements).
  - Confirm that uBO Scope permissions include network request access.
  - Restart the browser or disable/re-enable the extension.
  - Review the Troubleshooting Common Issues guide for detailed fixes.

## 3. How uBO Scope Shows You Activity

The toolbar icon’s badge number corresponds to active "allowed" third-party domains the current page contacted, meaning domains the browser connected to that were not blocked or stealth-blocked by any content blocker.

This count updates in real time as you navigate between pages or reload current pages.

The popup interface categorizes domains into three outcomes:
- **Not blocked (allowed):** Third-party domains successfully contacted.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests were explicitly blocked.

This visual categorization helps you understand your actual network exposure on a page-by-page basis.

---

## 4. Practical Example

Visit https://www.wikipedia.org:

- The uBO Scope icon badge displays something like `3`.
- Click the icon to open the popup.
- Under "not blocked", you might see domains such as "upload.wikimedia.org".
- "stealth-blocked" and "blocked" sections might be empty or include some domains depending on your other content blockers.

This test confirms the extension is active and tracking network connections as expected.

---

## 5. Tips & Best Practices

- Always ensure you are using a supported browser version with full webRequest API support.
- For the most accurate counts, open the popup on fully loaded pages—early page loads may show incomplete data.
- Understand that the badge count is purely about distinct allowed third-party domains, not total requests or block counts.
- Use the popup to analyze details beyond the badge count for richer insights.
