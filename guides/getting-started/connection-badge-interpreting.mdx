# Understanding the Toolbar Badge & Count

## Workflow Overview

The toolbar badge on the uBO Scope extension icon provides a real-time count of the unique third-party remote servers contacted by your browser on the active tab. This guide helps you understand how this badge count is calculated, why a lower number is beneficial for your privacy, and how to interpret this metric within your browsing context.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and active in your browser
- A webpage loaded on the active tab with network activity
- Basic familiarity with what third-party connections represent

### Expected Outcome
By the end of this guide, you will:
- Understand what the toolbar badge number represents
- Learn why it is a key privacy indicator
- Know how changes in the badge count relate to your browsing and content blocker behavior

### Time Estimate
About 5 minutes for reading and understanding

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## What the Toolbar Badge Represents

The toolbar badge displays the **count of distinct third-party remote servers** connected to by the current webpage loaded in your active browser tab. 

- **Third-party remote server**: Any server different from the webpage’s main domain that your browser attempts to connect to.
- The extension categorizes connections as **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked**, but the badge focuses on those **allowed** connections.

### Why a Lower Count is Usually Better

A lower distinct third-party server count means:
- Fewer external entities have access or can track your browsing on that page,
- Reduced privacy exposure and potential tracking,
- Less performance overhead from multiple external resource requests.

<u>Note:</u> Sometimes, external services like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are necessary and legitimate, which could result in low but non-zero counts.

## How uBO Scope Calculates the Badge Count

1. **Network Request Observation:**
   uBO Scope continuously observes all network requests your browser makes using browser APIs like `webRequest`. 

2. **Tab-Specific Data:**
   It tracks connections separately for each tab to ensure the badge reflects the active webpage’s third-party connections.

3. **Domain Normalization:**
   Each hostname from network requests is translated into its base domain using a public suffix list to group subdomains correctly (e.g., `cdn.example.com` resolves to `example.com`).

4. **Counting Unique Domains:**
   Only **distinct** third-party domains from allowed requests are counted.

5. **Badge Update:**
   The count updates dynamically and is displayed as a numeric badge on the toolbar icon for instant visibility.

## Interpreting the Badge Number

- **No badge / empty badge:** No third-party remote connections were detected or allowed on the page.
- **Low numbers (1-5):** Indicates minimal third-party exposure, generally desirable for privacy.
- **High numbers (10+):** Suggests many external servers are contacted, which may increase privacy risks.

### Practical Examples
- Visiting a simple news article might show a badge count of 3 (e.g., CDN, analytics, ads).
- A social media page could show 20+ third-party servers due to multiple embedded widgets.

## Best Practices for Users

- **Aim to keep the badge count low:** Consider disabling or blocking unnecessary third-party content when privacy is a priority.
- **Use the popup panel:** Click the toolbar icon to open the popup panel and see detailed categories of connections.
- **Regularly audit connections:** Review which domains appear repeatedly and investigate their legitimacy.
- **Understand necessary third parties:** Not all third-party connections are harmful. CDNs or authentication services are often required.

<Tip>
Remember, the badge reflects allowed connection domains, not just the number of blocked domains. A content blocker that effectively reduces allowed third parties will result in a lower badge count.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Badge Issues

### Badge Does Not Update or Shows Incorrect Count
- **Reload the page:** The badge updates only based on active network requests in the tab.
- **Ensure uBO Scope permissions are active:** The extension needs permission to observe web requests (`webRequest` permission).
- **Verify you are on the active tab:** The badge count reflects only the current active tab.
- **Conflicting extensions:** Other privacy or content blockers might interfere with network request monitoring.

### Badge Always Empty
- Extension might not be initialized correctly.
- Browser might restrict `webRequest` API usage.
- Check permissions and reinstall if necessary.

<Warning>
Browsers occasionally update APIs or permissions; keep your extension up-to-date to ensure proper badge behavior.
</Warning>

## Summary

The uBO Scope toolbar badge is a powerful, at-a-glance privacy indicator representing the number of unique allowed third-party remote servers connected by the active webpage. Keeping this count low is a key sign of reduced third-party tracking and enhanced privacy.

By understanding how this count is calculated and how to interpret it, you empower yourself to audit, evaluate, and improve your browser privacy posture effectively.

## Code Reference from Background Process (For Expert Users)

The badge count is set programmatically by tracking unique allowed domains per tab:

```javascript
function updateTabBadge(tabId) {
    if ( tabId === -1 ) { return; }
    const tabDetails = session.tabIdToDetailsMap.get(tabId);
    if ( tabDetails === undefined ) { return; }
    const count = tabDetails.allowed.domains.size;  // Count unique allowed domains
    browser.action.setBadgeText({
        tabId,
        text: count !== 0 ? `${count}` : ''
    }).catch(() => {});
}
```

This logic ensures that the badge always displays the current unique count or is hidden when zero.
