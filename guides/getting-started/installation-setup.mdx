# Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope

## Overview
This guide walks you through installing uBO Scope on supported browsers, configuring the extension for immediate use, and preparing your browsing environment to fully benefit from real-time reporting of remote server connections. By following these steps, you'll set up uBO Scope to track and display all third-party network connections initiated by webpages, enhancing your transparency into web activity.

## Prerequisites
Before installing uBO Scope, ensure the following:

- **Supported Browsers:**
  - Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge) version 122 or later
  - Mozilla Firefox version 128 or later
  - Safari version 18.5 or later
- **Operating System:** Linux, macOS, Windows supported by your browser
- **Permissions:** The extension requires permission to use the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network requests
- **Internet Access:** To download and install the extension from official stores

For detailed requirements, see also the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](../installation-setup/system-requirements) documentation.

---

## Step 1: Choose Your Supported Browser
Identify which browser you will install uBO Scope on and confirm it meets the minimum version requirements listed above.

> **Tip:** You can find your browser version in the “About” section of your browser’s menu.

---

## Step 2: Install uBO Scope Extension
Navigate to the official extension store for your browser using the links below to install uBO Scope safely:

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) (Chromium browsers)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) (Firefox)

> **Note:** Safari users must install from the Mac App Store or follow Safari’s extensions installation process matching the minimum version requirements.

Follow the on-screen instructions in the browser store to complete the installation.

---

## Step 3: Verify Extension Installation and Toolbar Icon
Once installed, confirm that the uBO Scope icon appears in your browser’s toolbar.

- The icon should show a small badge with a numeric count (which may initially be blank).
- If the icon is not visible, check your browser’s extension management page and:
  - Make sure the extension is enabled
  - Pin the extension to the toolbar if necessary
  - Verify permissions requested during installation

Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/getting-going/troubleshooting-common) guide if you encounter problems.

---

## Step 4: Initial Configuration and Permissions Review
uBO Scope requires access to monitor network requests to report connections:

- Ensure you grant all requested permissions, including access to monitor active tabs and use `webRequest` API.
- No further configuration options are required for basic operation—uBO Scope works out-of-the-box.

> **Callout:** Without granting necessary permissions, uBO Scope cannot track connections accurately.

---

## Step 5: Prepare Your Browsing Environment
Before relying on uBO Scope's reports:

- Clear your browser’s cache and cookies for more accurate first-time measurement.
- Disable any conflicting extensions temporarily if you suspect interference.
- Visit a website to populate uBO Scope’s data.

---

## Step 6: Access the Popup Panel and Validate Operation
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.

- The panel displays the current tab’s hostname and three categories of remote connections:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains fully allowed
  - **Stealth Blocked:** Domains blocked by stealth (e.g., redirects or stealth techniques)
  - **Blocked:** Domains fully blocked
- The summary shows the count of distinct domains connected.

This immediate insight confirms that uBO Scope is active and monitoring connections.

For detailed reading on the popup interface and interpreting the data, see [Using the Popup Panel](/overview/feature-glance/popup-overview).

## Advanced: Manual Build and Packaging (For Developers)
If you prefer to build the extension manually from source (for testing or customization), follow these steps in a Linux environment:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope.git
cd uBO-Scope
```

2. Build for your platform (e.g., Firefox):

```bash
./tools/make-firefox.sh 1.0.1
```

This creates a packaged `.xpi` file under the `build/` folder, ready for installation.

> **Note:** You can specify a version number as the second argument, which updates the version in `manifest.json`.

3. Load the unpacked extension or manually install the packaged file into your browser.

## Common Pitfalls & Tips

- **Missing Toolbar Icon:** Ensure the extension is enabled and pinned; re-install if needed.
- **No Data in Popup:** Try refreshing the webpage or visiting a new site; verify extension permissions.
- **Browser Version Too Low:** Check and update to minimum required versions.
- **Conflicts:** Some security or network-filtering tools may prevent `webRequest` APIs from firing properly.

---

## Summary
By completing these steps, uBO Scope will be installed, enabled, and ready to report the state of all remote server connections for each webpage you visit. You will gain crucial real-time visibility into third-party connections that other content blockers do not reveal.

## Additional Resources

### Example: Installing in Firefox on Linux

```bash
# Download and build
./tools/make-firefox.sh 1.0.1

# Load XPI into Firefox
firefox ./build/uBO-Scope.firefox.xpi
```

### Manifest Highlights

The Firefox `manifest.json` includes necessary permissions and scripts:

```json
"permissions": [
  "activeTab",
  "storage",
  "webRequest"
],
"host_permissions": [
  "https://*/*",
  "http://*/*",
  "wss://*/*",
  "ws://*/*"
],
"background": {
  "scripts": [ "/js/background.js" ],
  "type": "module"
},
"action": {
  "default_popup": "popup.html",
  "default_icon": {
    "16": "img/browsericons/logo16.png"
  }
}
```

This config enables deep monitoring and UI interaction for users.
