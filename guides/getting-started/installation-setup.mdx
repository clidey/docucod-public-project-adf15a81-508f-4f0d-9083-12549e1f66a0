### Pinning the Extension (Optional but Recommended)

Pinning uBO Scope to your browser toolbar makes launching it effortless.

- In Chrome:
  - Click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions) on the toolbar.
  - Find **uBO Scope**.
  - Click the pin icon next to it; this pins the extension to the toolbar.

- In Firefox:
  - Click the menu button (three horizontal lines).
  - Click **Customize Toolbar**.
  - Drag the **uBO Scope** icon onto your toolbar.
  - Click **Done**.


## 3. Confirming uBO Scope is Active

After installation and pinning, verify uBO Scope is functioning properly.

### Steps to Verify

1. **Look for the uBO Scope Icon:** It should be visible in your browser's toolbar displaying the uBO Scope logo.
2. **Check the Badge Count:** The icon may show a badge number indicating the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected by the active tab. A number (e.g., 0 or more) indicates monitoring.
3. **Open the uBO Scope Popup:**
   - Click the uBO Scope icon.
   - The popup will display stats:
     - The current tab's hostname at the top.
     - The total number of connected domains.
     - Three categorized sections showing ‘not blocked’, ‘stealth-blocked’, and ‘blocked’ domains.

### What You Should See

- The extension does not display any error messages in the popup.
- The badge updates live as you browse different tabs and pages.

<Tip>
If the badge count remains blank or does not update while browsing, ensure you have granted the necessary permissions and that no other settings block uBO Scope from accessing network request details.
</Tip>

## 4. Important Permissions and Compatibility Notes

uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor network requests. These permissions are automatically granted upon installation:

- **activeTab:** Allows uBO Scope to interact with the active browser tab.
- **storage:** Enables saving session data persistently.
- **webRequest:** Grants access to monitor network traffic.

For **Chrome** and **Firefox**, the permission scopes include:

- `http://*/*`
- `https://*/*`
- WebSocket protocols `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*` (important for comprehensive monitoring)


Ensure you use compatible browser versions. Older versions may not support all permissions or features, potentially causing partial or no functionality.

<Warning>
Using browsers older than the specified minimum versions will result in incomplete network monitoring or failure to install the extension.
</Warning>

## 5. Quick Gotchas and Tips

- **Extension Icon Missing:**
  - Refresh your browser or restart it if the extension icon does not appear immediately after installation.

- **Badge Count is Zero on Popular Sites:**
  - This might mean the content blocker or browser is blocking all third-party requests, or the page does not establish third-party connections.

- **Stealth Blocking:**
  - Some requests silently fail or are preemptively blocked. uBO Scope categorizes these distinctly.

- **Browser Updates:**
  - Keep your browser updated to the latest stable version to ensure compatibility.

- **Private/Incognito Mode:**
  - Ensure privacy mode allows the extension if you expect to use uBO Scope there.
