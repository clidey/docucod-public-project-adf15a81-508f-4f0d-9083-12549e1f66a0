## 2. Installation

uBO Scope is available for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari through their respective extension/add-on stores.

### Step 1: Access the Correct Installation Page

| Browser  | Installation Link |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| Chrome   | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox  | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) |
| Safari   | Available via Safari Extensions Gallery or Apple App Store (Safari 18.5 or higher) |

### Step 2: Install the Extension

Follow your browser’s usual extension installation procedure:

- Click the installation link for your browser.
- Click the **Add to Browser** or **Add to Firefox/Safari** button.
- Allow any permissions requested for network request monitoring.

### Step 3: Verify Installation

- Confirm that the uBO Scope icon (a small badge icon) appears in your browser’s toolbar or extension area.
- If the icon is missing, check your browser’s extension manager to ensure the extension is enabled.

## 3. Configuration

uBO Scope requires minimal manual configuration but must have the necessary permissions and host access to monitor network requests effectively.

### Step 1: Confirm Permissions

On installation, uBO Scope requests the following permissions:

- `activeTab` – to monitor the active tab
- `storage` – to save session data
- `webRequest` – to observe network requests
- Host access for all HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket URLs

Check your browser’s extension settings and make sure these permissions are granted explicitly.

### Step 2: Enable Site Access (if prompted)

Some browsers may restrict extensions from accessing specific domains automatically:

- Open your browser’s extension details/settings page.
- Navigate to the **Site access** or equivalent setting.
- Choose **On all sites** or manually add permissions for `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, and `wss://*/*`.

This ensures uBO Scope receives all network traffic information regardless of content blockers in place.

### Step 3: Open the uBO Scope Popup

Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup window. 

- You will see a summary of the domains connected on the active tab.
- Sections are labeled **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** to help categorize network requests.

If the popup shows **NO DATA**, proceed to the verification steps below.

## 4. Verification and First Session

### Step 1: Navigate to a Website

Open a new tab and visit a website you trust or commonly use.

### Step 2: Open uBO Scope Popup

- Click the extension’s toolbar icon.
- Observe the count of distinct domains connected displayed near 'domains connected'.

### Step 3: Interpret the Badge Count

- The number on the toolbar icon badge matches the count of distinct third-party domains from which resources were allowed.
- Lower badge counts generally mean fewer third-party connections.

### Step 4: Explore Domain Lists

- Look through the domains listed under **not blocked** — these are third-party servers the browser successfully connected to.
- **stealth-blocked** indicates requests that were redirected or blocked subtly by other content blockers.
- **blocked** shows explicit failures or blocked requests.

### Successful Setup

A successful setup is when the popup shows updated domain counts correlating to the sites you visit, and the toolbar badge updates accordingly.

## 5. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Permission Conflicts:** If the extension does not show any data, verify that all permissions and host access are enabled.
- **Browser Version:** Make sure your browser meets the minimum version requirements listed.
- **Does not depend on content blockers:** uBO Scope reports all network requests, regardless of other content blockers active in the browser.
- **Badge Meaning:** Remember, the badge reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party servers, not block counts.
- **Use for Filter Maintainers:** This tool is particularly useful for blocked list or filter maintainers to assess which servers see traffic.
