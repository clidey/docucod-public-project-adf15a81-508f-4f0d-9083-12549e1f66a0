## 5. Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Install uBO Scope

#### Chromium-based Browsers

1. Open the [Chrome Web Store page for uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
2. Click **Add to Chrome** and confirm the installation.
3. Wait for the browser to complete the extension installation.

2. Click **Add to Firefox** and accept the permissions request.
3. Allow any prompts for extension activation.


### Step 2: Confirm Extension Installation

- After installation, look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- If the icon is not visible, check the browser’s extension management settings and ensure uBO Scope is enabled.

<Check>
Make sure the uBO Scope toolbar icon appears.
</Check>


### Step 3: Verify Required Permissions

uBO Scope requires access to the following permissions for correct operation:

- `webRequest`: To monitor network requests.
- `storage`: To save session data.
- `activeTab`: To interact with the active tab.

The extension requests these automatically upon installation. To verify:

- Go to your browser’s extensions/settings page.
- Review uBO Scope’s permissions.
- Confirm all required permissions are granted.


### Step 4: Launch the uBO Scope Popup

1. Click the uBO Scope icon in the toolbar.
2. The popup will open, initially showing "NO DATA" while it collects network connection information.
3. The popup displays three main sections:
   - **Not Blocked:** Domains connected without any interference.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that the extension detected as redirected or stealthily handled.
   - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were unsuccessfully attempted or blocked.


### Step 5: Navigate and Interpret Initial UI

- The popup's top headline shows the tab’s hostname and domain.
- The summary section below the headline shows the count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- Review the domain lists by outcome to understand third-party connections.

> For deeper understanding of the UI and badge, see the [Your First Report: Understanding the Popup](../getting-started/first-run) guide.


### Step 6: Use uBO Scope with a Test Website

1. Open a new browser tab.
2. Visit a site with third-party content, such as a news site or social media platform.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
4. Observe the listed domains and the badge number on the toolbar updating to the count of distinct third-party domains.


## 6. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Keep Your Browser Updated:** To ensure compatibility with uBO Scope and access to the latest security features.
- **Verify Permissions Early:** Missing permissions are the most common reason uBO Scope won’t display data.
- **Understand Badge Numbers:** The badge shows only the allowed third-party distinct domains, not total requests.
- **Test With Popular Sites:** To immediately verify that uBO Scope captures meaningful network activity.

## Appendix: Manifest Key Permissions Configuration

The extension manifest explicitly requests the following critical permissions:

```json
"permissions": [
  "activeTab",
  "storage",
  "webRequest"
],
"host_permissions": [
  "https://*/*",
  "http://*/*",
  "wss://*/*",
  "ws://*/*"
]
```

This ensures uBO Scope can monitor network requests on all HTTP and WebSocket schemes.


## Summary

By following this guide, you will have uBO Scope installed and operational on your supported browser, ready to provide clear, real-time insights into your browser's third-party network connections.
