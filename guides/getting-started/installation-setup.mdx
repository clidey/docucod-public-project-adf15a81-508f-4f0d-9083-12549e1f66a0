## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Choose Your Browser and Visit Official Extension Store

uBO Scope supports the following browsers:
- **Chromium-based browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.) version 122.0 or higher
- **Mozilla Firefox** version 128.0 or higher
- **Safari** version 18.5 or higher

For the most straightforward experience, install uBO Scope directly from the official browser extension stores:

| Browser           | Official Extension Store Link                                             |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium-based    | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox           | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)    |


### 2. Install uBO Scope Extension

#### Chromium-based Browsers:
1. Go to the [Chrome Web Store page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
2. Click **Add to Chrome** (or your browser's install button).
3. Confirm the permission requests in the dialog.
4. Wait for the extension to install and confirm the uBO Scope icon appears next to your address bar.

#### Firefox:
1. Visit the [Firefox Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Click **Add to Firefox**.
3. Accept the requested permissions.
4. Ensure the uBO Scope icon appears in your browser toolbar.

#### Safari:
1. Open the Safari Extensions preference pane.
2. Search for uBO Scope or install manually if required (note: Safari extensions may require manual installation if not available in App Store).
3. Enable uBO Scope in the Extensions settings.

### 3. Understand Required Permissions

To operate effectively, uBO Scope requests the following key permissions:
- **activeTab**: Access to current active tab to display connection data relevant to your browsing session.
- **storage**: To save session data and configuration securely.
- **webRequest**: To monitor all outgoing requests, including third-party and websocket requests.
- **host permissions**: Access to all URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`), enabling full visibility into network requests.

<Tip>
These permissions are essential for uBO Scope’s core function — revealing all remote server connections your browser attempts. You should expect to grant them when installing or enabling the extension.
</Tip>

### 4. Verify Installation and Permissions

1. Confirm the uBO Scope icon appears in your browser’s toolbar.
2. Click the icon to open the popup interface.
3. Ensure the interface loads without error, displaying “NO DATA” initially when no page is loaded.

To verify permissions:
- Check your browser’s extension management page.
- Confirm uBO Scope is enabled and has listed permissions (usually in the extension details).

<Tip>
If missing, you may need to grant permissions manually or reinstall the extension.
</Tip>

### 5. Start Your First Monitoring Session Immediately

1. Navigate to any webpage.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to view real-time reports of all connections initiated by that page.
3. The popup will show counts of connected third-party domains categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

<Tip>
Refreshing the page or navigating different sites will update these reports dynamically, giving instant insight into remote server connections.
</Tip>

### Best Practices

- **Regularly check the popup interface** to confirm data is actively being collected.
- **Restart the browser** if the extension appears unresponsive after installation.

### Common Pitfalls

- Installation failure due to unsupported browser version.
- Permissions not granted, causing the extension to not report requests.
