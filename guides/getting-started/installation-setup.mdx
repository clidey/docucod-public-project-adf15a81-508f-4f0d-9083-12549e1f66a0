### Step 3: Enable uBO Scope for Active Tabs

The extension requires proper permissions to monitor connections on the pages you visit.

- When you first click the uBO Scope icon, your browser may ask for permissions to access the current site or all websites.
- Approve these permissions to allow uBO Scope to observe network traffic.

<Tip>
Permissions requested include:
- **activeTab:** Grants access to monitor the current tab’s network traffic.
- **storage:** Saves session and configuration data.
- **webRequest:** Observes network requests for reporting purposes.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Verify uBO Scope is Active

1. Visit a few websites in separate tabs.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. Check that the popup loads connection data for the current tab (domains contacted, allowed, blocked, and stealth blocked).
4. Confirm the badge count appears on the toolbar icon, reflecting distinct third-party domains contacted.

If you see `NO DATA` or a question mark (`?`) on the popup, reload the current tab and try again.

<Warning>
If uBO Scope does not respond or show data:
- Make sure you have approved all permissions.
- Confirm the extension is enabled in your browser settings.
- Reload the tab or restart your browser.
</Warning>

# Common Pitfalls and Tips

- **Extension Not Visible:** Pin the extension icon manually as described.
- **Permissions Denied:** Revisit the extension’s permission settings in the browser and enable required permissions.
- **No Data in Popup:** Ensure you have active network activity; some static or internal browser tabs may show no data.
- **Private Browsing:** Extensions often require explicit permission to run in private mode. Enable it in your browser settings if you want uBO Scope to function in private windows.
