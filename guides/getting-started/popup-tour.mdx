# Navigating the uBO Scope Popup Interface

Understanding the uBO Scope popup interface empowers you to quickly grasp the third-party network activity occurring on any web page. This guide walks you through the interface elements, how domain lists are organized by connection outcome, and how to interpret the badge counts — enabling confident analysis of remote server connections initiated in your browser.

---

## What This Guide Covers

- How to access and interpret the main popup interface
- Understanding domain categorizations: "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked"
- Understanding the significance of badge counts and headers
- Practical tips for reading domain lists and connection data

---

## Prerequisites

Before exploring the popup interface, ensure:

- uBO Scope is installed and active in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
- You have loaded a web page whose network connections you want to inspect.
- The extension icon is accessible in your browser toolbar and clickable.

---

## Opening the Popup Interface

1. **Locate the uBO Scope icon** on your browser's toolbar.
2. **Click the icon** to open the popup panel.
3. The popup automatically retrieves network connection data for the active tab.

---

## Interface Layout Breakdown

The popup interface is intuitively divided into several key components, each offering a distinct view of the network connections for the current tab.

### 1. Hostname Header

- Displays the **hostname** and **domain** of the current active tab.
- The domain appears prominently with any subdomain shown as a prefix.
- For example: For the URL `news.example.com`, "example.com" is shown as the domain and "news." as the subdomain prefix if applicable.
- This ensures you’re analyzing connections relative to the exact site context.

### 2. Summary Section

- Shows a concise count of **distinct third-party domains connected** by the page.
- This number represents the total unique external domains contacted (excluding the main domain).
- It corresponds to the numeric badge shown on the toolbar icon, reinforcing the relationship between badge and popup data.

### 3. Connection Outcome Sections

Network connections are categorized into three sections, clearly labeled with headings:

#### a. Not Blocked (Allowed)

- Lists third-party domains that the browser successfully connected to.
- These are domains from which resources were fetched or connections established.
- Seeing legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs) or known service domains here is common.

#### b. Stealth-Blocked

- Domains in this section correspond to network attempts that were **redirected** or interfered with in a stealthy manner.
- These blocks are not obvious to the web page and might be caused by stealth or indirect content blocking methods.
- This signals subtle filtering actions and is valuable for analyzing complex blocking behavior.

#### c. Blocked

- Shows domains whose connections failed due to explicit blocking or errors.
- These are connections that the extension detects as prevented from completing.
- This section helps identify domains actively blocked by content blockers or network policies.

Each section contains a scrollable list of domains with their respective connection counts.

### 4. Domain Lists

- Under each outcome category, domains are shown in rows with two data points:
  - The **domain name** (converted to Unicode for readability).
  - The **count** of requests or connections attempted to that domain.
- Domains are sorted alphabetically for easy scanning.

---

## How to Interpret the Data

- The **badge count on the toolbar icon** reflects the number of distinct domains in the "not blocked" list (Allowed section).
- A **lower badge count** typically indicates fewer third-party connections, which often aligns with better privacy and less tracking surface.
- Checking the **Stealth** and **Blocked** sections reveals nuanced filtering details beyond what content blockers openly show.
- For example, stealth blocks may reveal network requests redirected or failed subtly, which often impact privacy.

---

## Practical Usage Tips

- Use the **domain counts** to identify domains repeatedly contacted — these can be trackers, CDNs, or critical services.
- If unexpected or suspicious domains appear under **Not Blocked**, consider reviewing your content blocker settings.
- Domains in the **Blocked** section confirm that blocking measures are in effect.
- The **Stealth** section is particularly useful for advanced users and filter list maintainers analyzing invisible blocking behavior.

## Step-by-Step User Flow: Exploring Connections on a Site

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope popup">Click the extension icon beside your address bar to open the popup panel.</Step>
<Step title="View the hostname and domain">Confirm the site displayed at the top of the popup matches your active tab.</Step>
<Step title="Check summary count">Note the number of connected third-party domains in the summary.</Step>
<Step title="Explore 'not blocked' domains">Review the listed domains with successful connections.</Step>
<Step title="Review 'stealth-blocked' domains">Investigate subtle or indirect blocked domains that may affect privacy.</Step>
<Step title="Review 'blocked' domains">See the explicitly blocked domains to ensure your content blocker is effective.</Step>
</Steps>

---

## Example Scenario

Imagine visiting a news website where you notice the badge shows "12". Opening the popup shows:

- **Not blocked**: 12 domains including known ad networks and CDN providers.
- **Stealth**: 3 domains, indicating some network requests were stealth blocked.
- **Blocked**: 5 domains, where connections failed due to blocking.

This tells you the site reaches out to multiple third parties, some of which are filtered silently, and some blocked outright, giving you a comprehensive view of your network exposure.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Popup Interface Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup shows NO DATA or is blank">
- Ensure the active tab has finished loading and is an HTTP/S or WebSocket page.
- uBO Scope only shows data for the active tab, so switch tabs and reopen if necessary.
- Confirm the extension is enabled and has required permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count does not update">
- Refresh the web page to trigger new network data.
- Check for conflicting extensions that may interfere with uBO Scope.
- Restart the browser if badge remains static.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain names show as encodings">
- uBO Scope converts punycode to Unicode for legibility; if domains look encoded, check if your browser or OS supports these characters.
- Update your browser if Unicode rendering is problematic.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

- Regularly use the popup interface while browsing sensitive websites to remain aware of third-party connections.
- Use the insight gained here to fine-tune content blockers or privacy settings.
- Pay special attention to stealth-blocked domains for hidden tracking or filtering activities.
- Combine this tool with uBO Scope's badge counts and other guides for comprehensive site auditing.
