# Understanding the Popup UI: Domains & Connection Status

Explore the popup interface of uBO Scope to understand how domain connections are categorized and displayed. This guide will help you quickly interpret the statuses of domain requests—allowed, blocked, or stealth—and appreciate the significance of the toolbar badge count and third-party domain markings for your browsing privacy.

## 1. Introduction to the Popup Interface

When you click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar, a popup opens showing detailed connection data for the active browser tab. This interface offers a real-time snapshot of the domains connected to the page and the outcome of their network requests.

### What You See:

- **Hostname Header**: Shows the current top-level page hostname and, if applicable, its subdomain prefix.
- **Summary Section**: Displays the total number of distinct domains the page has connected to.
- **Outcome Sections**: Domains are grouped under three categories:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
  - **Stealth-Blocked**
  - **Blocked**

Each domain line shows:
- The domain name (Unicode decoded for readability)
- A badge with the count of connections initiated to that domain

### Why This Matters

Seeing which domains a page connects to and how those connections are handled is essential to understanding your exposure to third parties on the web. It reveals whether tracking or unwanted content is allowed or blocked, including cases where blocking is ‘stealth’ and not directly visible in other tools.

## 2. Step-by-Step: Interpreting the Popup UI

Follow these steps as you review the popup interface:

### Step 1: Identify the Active Tab's Hostname

- The top header shows the hostname of the active tab's site.
- If the hostname includes a subdomain (e.g., `blog.example.com`), it is split:
  - Left span shows the subdomain prefix (e.g., `blog.`)
  - Right span shows the registered domain (e.g., `example.com`)

### Step 2: Understand the Summary Count

- The **domains connected** number indicates how many distinct third-party domains the page touched.
- This count excludes the page's own domain.
- A lower number indicates fewer third-party connections, generally more privacy-friendly.

### Step 3: Review the Domain Status Sections

- Domains are categorized based on the outcome of their requests:

  #### Not Blocked (Allowed)
  - These domains successfully connected to the page.
  - They may include the page’s domain or trusted third parties like content delivery networks.

  #### Stealth-Blocked
  - These domains attempted to connect but were silently redirected or intercepted.
  - Stealth blocking can prevent requests without explicitly showing failed connections.
  - These domains might represent trackers or unwanted resources blocked quietly to preserve page functionality.

  #### Blocked
  - Domains outright denied from connecting.
  - Typically third-party ad servers, trackers, or malicious domains blocked by your content filters.

- Each domain line lists the domain and the number of connection attempts.

### Step 4: Recognize Third-Party Domains

- Domains different from the page’s own domain (determined via the Public Suffix List) are third parties.
- The extension automatically recognizes and groups hosts under their registered domain.
- High counts or unexpected domains can indicate extensive third-party tracking or multiple CDN usage.

## 3. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Monitor for Unexpected Domains:** If unfamiliar domains appear in the 'Not Blocked' or 'Stealth-Blocked' sections, consider investigating or adjusting your content filters.

- **Use the Badge Count as a Proxy for Privacy Exposure:** The badge on the toolbar icon displays the number of unique allowed third-party domains for the active tab—fewer is typically better.

- **Note the Difference Between Allowed and Stealth:** Stealth-blocked domains are often more privacy-critical since their blocking is less visible; keep an eye on these.

- **Remember Unicode Domains Are Shown Properly:** The UI uses Unicode decoding for internationalized domain names to help you recognize domains clearly.

- **Refresh the Popup Occasionally:** The popup loads real-time data when opened. Closing and reopening may update the view with the latest connections.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Questions

### Why Is No Data Displayed?
- You might be on a tab that does not have any network requests recorded yet.
- Reload the page and try opening the popup again.
- Ensure the extension has proper permissions and is installed correctly.

### Why Does the Badge Count Not Match What I Expect?
- The badge counts distinct allowed third-party domains, not individual requests.
- Some domains may appear multiple times due to multiple subdomains but counted as one.

### What Does 'Stealth-Blocked' Mean Exactly?
- It indicates network requests that the extension detected as being redirected or intercepted silently.
- Stealth blocking can be useful to stop tracking without triggering page errors.

### Can I Click on Domains in the Popup?
- Currently, the popup provides an overview only, without direct interaction with listed domains.

## 5. Summary and Next Steps

This guide focused on empowering you to read and understand the connection outcome data presented in the uBO Scope popup UI. By mastering these insights, you gain direct visibility into the real network footprint of your browsing activity.

### Suggested Next Actions

- Consult the **[Key Terminology & Metrics](https://yourdocsurl/overview/core_concepts_architecture/terms_and_metrics)** page to deepen your understanding of domain outcomes.
- Explore the **[Analyzing Third-Party Remote Connections](https://yourdocsurl/guides/practical-usage/analyze-third-party-connections)** guide to use this data for privacy optimization.
- Review **[Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues](https://yourdocsurl/getting-started/first-use-configuration/troubleshooting-common-issues)** if you encounter missing or unexpected data in the popup.

<Tip>
The badge on the extension icon reflects the number of *distinct allowed third-party domains* per tab. A lower badge count effectively means fewer third-party connections and typically stronger privacy.
</Tip>

<Note>
Domains listed under “stealth-blocked” might not appear blocked explicitly by other tools but contribute significantly to improving your privacy by preventing hidden tracking.
</Note>

<Info>
To recognize the root domains accurately, uBO Scope uses the official Public Suffix List—leveraging end-user clarity even with internationalized or complex domain structures.
