# Your First Session: Analyzing Network Requests with uBO Scope

Welcome to your initial experience using uBO Scope! This walkthrough empowers you to monitor all network requests on any webpage immediately after installing the extension. You will learn to interpret the badge count shown on the toolbar and understand the detailed data presented in the popup panel about third-party connections.

---

## 1. Getting Started Quickly

### What This Page Helps You Achieve
- See in real time how many **distinct third-party domains** your current browser tab connects to.
- Understand the badge count on the uBO Scope extension icon.
- Navigate and interpret the popup panel showing detailed network connection outcomes.

### Why This Matters
Privacy-conscious browsing means knowing which external servers your web pages are reaching out to. uBO Scope makes this transparent by tracking real-time network requests, highlighting distinct third-party domains involved.

### Prerequisites
- You have successfully installed uBO Scope according to [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/guides/getting-started/installation-setup.md).
- The extension has appropriate permissions and host access configured as detailed in [Configuring uBO Scope After Installation](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/getting-started/first-use-and-validation/configuring-extension.mdx).

## 2. Understanding the Badge Count

### What the Badge Count Represents
The badge count on the browser toolbar icon displays the **number of unique third-party domains** that the current webpage allowed connections to. This count excludes the first-party domain itself and focuses solely on external servers.

### Why Distinct Domains?
Many extensions show raw block counts, which can be misleading. uBO Scope’s value lies in showing distinct domains to give a meaningful measure of third-party network exposure.

### Interpreting the Badge
- A **lower count** indicates fewer distinct third-party domains contacted, which generally means better privacy.
- The badge updates in real-time as you navigate or refresh pages.
- If no count appears, the page may have no third-party network requests, or the extension hasn't captured data yet.

<Check>
Ensure you are viewing the active tab associated with the badge count. Switching tabs will update the badge accordingly.

## 3. Using the Popup Panel for In-Depth Analysis

Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar to open the popup panel. This panel provides a categorized summary of third-party network connections for the active tab.

### Popup Sections and Their Meaning

| Section            | Description                                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Domains Connected** | Total distinct third-party domains the page connected to. |
| **Not Blocked**       | Domains for which connections were allowed successfully.    |
| **Stealth-Blocked**   | Domains where redirects occurred, often stealthily blocked. |
| **Blocked**           | Domains where connection attempts failed or were blocked.   |

### How to Read the Details

- Each domain is listed along with a count badge indicating how many times the page made requests to that domain.
- Domains are sorted alphabetically within each category for easy lookup.
- The domain names are displayed in a user-friendly Unicode format, handling internationalized domain names seamlessly.

### Example Scenario

Imagine browsing a news website:
- The badge shows `6` meaning six distinct third-party domains were contacted.
- Clicking the icon reveals domains like advertising networks, CDN providers, and analytics services.
- You see `allowed` domains are mostly CDN providers supporting the site.
- `Stealth-blocked` might include trackers that your content blocker intercepted indirectly.
- `Blocked` domains denote outright failed connection attempts, possibly due to active blocking.

## 4. Step-by-Step: Analyzing Your First Session

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Webpage in Your Browser">
Navigate to any webpage you want to analyze. For example, visit your favorite news or social media site.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the uBO Scope Toolbar Badge">
Look at the extension icon on your browser toolbar. Note the number displayed — this is the count of distinct third-party domains the page contacted.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Extension Icon to Open the Popup">
Click on the uBO Scope icon. The popup panel will appear, displaying detailed domain information categorized into "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked".
</Step>
<Step title="Explore the Domain Lists">
Examine each section:
- **Not Blocked** domains indicate third parties that the page connected to without interruption.
- **Stealth-Blocked** domains show connections that were redirected, often as a blocking tactic.
- **Blocked** domains represent requests that failed or were prevented.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Counts">
Note the number next to each domain; this reflects how often the page attempted connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Results With Page Navigation">
Refresh or navigate to new pages and watch the badge and popup update in real-time, confirming live monitoring.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The popup relies on real-time network request data. If no data shows, ensure the webpage is actively loading resources and the extension has permissions enabled.
</Note>

## 5. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Use Pages with Rich Content:** Sites with many third-party resources provide a more illustrative example of uBO Scope’s capabilities.
- **Cross-Check with Other Tools:** For privacy audits, compare the badge counts and domain lists with your content blocker’s reported blocked domains.
- **Refresh for Updates:** The popup updates after network activity, but refreshing the page ensures current session data.
- **Understand Third-Party Roles:** Not all third-party domains are malicious; CDNs and analytics services often support site functionality.

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Your First Session">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Appear or Is Empty">
- Verify the extension is enabled and the icon is visible in your browser toolbar.
- Check extension permissions and host access settings.
- Make sure you are on an active tab with loaded content.
- Consult [Quick Validation Steps](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/getting-started/first-use-and-validation/quick-validation.mdx) for diagnosis.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Panel Shows 'NO DATA'">
- This indicates the extension hasn’t captured network data yet for the current tab.
- Refresh the page or visit a new page.
- Ensure other content blockers do not interfere with uBO Scope’s permissions.
- See [Configuring uBO Scope After Installation](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/docs/getting-started/first-use-and-validation/configuring-extension.mdx).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected High Badge Counts">
- Remember the badge counts distinct third-party domains, not just blocked requests.
- Large sites with many embedded services will naturally have higher counts.
- Review the popup lists to identify legitimate versus potentially unwanted parties.

## 8. Technical Snapshot (Optional Insight)

The popup panel uses real-time data collected from your browser’s network API. Domains are grouped based on request outcomes:
- **Allowed:** Successfully connected domains.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains involved in redirect chains often used by blockers.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections failed or were intentionally blocked.

All domains shown represent distinct third-party remote servers associated with the page currently open in your browser tab.

Happy analyzing! Your privacy insight journey begins here with every network connection you uncover.
