## 2. Step-by-Step Installation & First Use

### Step 1: Choose Your Browser and Install uBO Scope

1. Open your preferred supported browser:
   - Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.) version 122 or newer
   - Firefox version 128 or newer
   - Safari version 18.5 or newer

2. Visit your browser’s official extension/add-on store:
   - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) for Chromium-based browsers
   - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) for Firefox
   - Safari extensions can be found via the Mac App Store connected to Safari 

3. Search for "uBO Scope" and select the extension developed by Raymond Hill.
4. Click the install or add button to install the extension.
5. After installation, verify the extension icon appears in the browser toolbar.

<Check>
If you do not see the icon after installing, refer to your browser’s extension management panel to ensure uBO Scope is enabled.
</Check>

### Step 2: Launch and Locate the Extension

- Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon (usually a blue shield with "uBO" label).
- This will open the popup panel showing connection details for the active browser tab.

### Step 3: Verify uBO Scope Is Working

- On page load or reload, observe the badge count displayed on the toolbar icon.
- This badge number represents the distinct third-party domains to which the current tab has established connections.

### Step 4: Understand the Popup Interface

- The popup shows three sections under the headings:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains blocked in a manner that the webpage is unaware of.
  - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked.
- Each section lists domains along with the count of network requests to them.
- The header shows the primary hostname of the current tab, broken down to indicate base domain and subdomain.
- The summary at the top displays the total number of distinct connected domains.

<Tip>
The toolbar badge updates in near real-time to reflect third-party connections specific to the active tab. Reload the webpage to refresh data.
</Tip>

### Step 5: Interact with the Popup

- Open the popup anytime by clicking the toolbar icon.
- Inspect each domain in the allowed, stealth, and blocked sections to understand network activity.
- Use the domain counts as a measure of third-party traffic.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Extension icon not visible:** Check that uBO Scope is enabled in your browser’s extension list. Pin the icon to your toolbar if hidden.
- **Badge count not updating:** Reload the active tab page to refresh data. Ensure the page is fully loaded.
- **No data shown in popup:** Verify you are viewing a webpage with third-party connections. Blank tabs or private mode may limit data.
- **Permission issues:** Ensure the extension has permissions to observe web requests and to run on all sites.

### Best Practices

- Reload pages after installing uBO Scope to ensure accurate data capture.
- Use the popup interface to get a clear picture of third-party connections on a per-tab basis.
- Remember that a lower badge count usually indicates fewer third-party contacts.

### Performance Considerations

- uBO Scope operates efficiently in the background with minimal impact on browsing speed.
- Avoid opening multiple uBO Scope popups simultaneously to reduce UI lag.

### Alternative Approaches

- For extended analysis, integrate uBO Scope data with your web debugging tools.
- Use uBO Scope alongside uBlock Origin to enhance insight into content blocking.
