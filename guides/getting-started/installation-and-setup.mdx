## 3. Installing uBO Scope

Follow these steps to add uBO Scope to your browser:

### Step 1: Access the Official Extension Store

Choose your browser and open the matching store:

- **Google Chrome (Chromium-based browsers):**
  - Visit the [Chrome Web Store uBO Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- **Mozilla Firefox:**
  - Visit the [Firefox Add-ons uBO Scope page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- **Safari:**
  - Use the Mac App Store or Safari Extensions Gallery, searching for "uBO Scope" (requires Safari 18.5+)

### Step 2: Install the Extension

- Click the **Add to [Browser]** or **Install** button on the store page.
- Confirm any prompts to allow installation.
- Wait for the extension to download and install.


### Step 3: Verify Installation

- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar — it displays the extension’s badge.
- Open your browser extension menu or settings page and verify uBO Scope appears as enabled.

### Step 4: Enable or Activate the Extension (if necessary)

- Some browsers or configurations may disable newly installed extensions by default.
- Navigate to your browser’s extensions management page.
- Ensure the toggle for uBO Scope is **ON** / enabled.

## 4. Understanding Required Permissions

uBO Scope works by monitoring network requests made by webpages to detect connections to remote servers. To do this effectively, it requires certain permissions:

- `activeTab` — Allows the extension to interact with the currently active tab for data gathering.
- `storage` — Enables saving session data to maintain state between browser sessions.
- `webRequest` — Grants the ability to observe and intercept network requests, critical for real-time connection monitoring.
- **Host Permissions:**
  - Access to URLs matching `https://*/*` and `http://*/*` on all HTTP/S traffic.
  - For Chromium and Firefox, also includes WebSocket protocols `ws://*/*` and `wss://*/*`.

> These permissions are essential for uBO Scope to count and categorize network connections, giving you a precise view of third-party requests.

For detailed information about permissions and privacy implications, refer to the [Initial Configuration](../getting-started/installation-and-setup/initial-configuration) guide.

## 5. First Steps After Installation

### Opening the Extension Popup

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- This opens the popup window displaying network connection data related to the current tab.

### What to Expect in the Popup

- **Hostname Header:** Shows the hostname of the active tab or 'NO DATA' if information is unavailable.
- **Domains Connected Summary:** Displays the count of distinct domains contacted.
- **Categories:**
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains that successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains blocked silently.
  - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked.

### Example Scenario

When visiting a webpage, uBO Scope monitors all network requests. Clicking the icon reveals how many third-party domains loaded resources and which ones were blocked or allowed, giving you transparent insights into your exposure.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Tips

- **Ensure the Extension Is Enabled:** Sometimes, after installing, an extension may be disabled by the browser or user settings.
- **Browser Version Compatibility:** Older browser versions may not support required APIs; verify your browser meets minimum version requirements.
- **Refresh Tabs:** After installing, refresh open tabs to allow uBO Scope to start monitoring network requests accurately.
- **Popup May Show 'NO DATA' Initially:** This occurs if you open the popup on empty tabs or immediately after installation; navigate to a webpage and reopen.

<Tip>
Refresh your active web pages after installing uBO Scope to start receiving proper network connection data in the popup.
</Tip>

## 7. Verifying Your Installation

Check the following to confirm uBO Scope is working:

1. The extension icon appears on the toolbar with no warning or disabled overlay.
2. The badge on the icon updates with numbers representing distinct third-party domains.
3. Clicking the icon shows the popup with categorized domains and counts.

For advanced verification steps, see the [Validating Extension Activity](../getting-started/first-run-and-troubleshooting/validating-extension-activity) documentation.

## 8. Additional Installation Notes

### Cross-Browser Considerations

- uBO Scope uses Manifest v3, adhering to modern browser extension standards.
- Background scripts run differently per platform (service workers on Chromium, modules on others), but installation is consistent.
- Permissions and host access are adapted per browser manifest files.

### Manual Installation

While this guide focuses on installation via stores, advanced users may build and install using source code from the repository:

```bash
# Example for Linux platforms using provided script
./tools/make-package.sh chromium 1.0.1
# Load the package into your browser as an unpacked extension
```

Source code and scripts are available at the [uBO Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).
