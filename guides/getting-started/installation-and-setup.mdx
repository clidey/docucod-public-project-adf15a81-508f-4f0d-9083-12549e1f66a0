# Installation & Setup

Welcome to the uBO Scope installation guide. This walkthrough will take you step-by-step through installing the uBO Scope extension on major browsers—Chromium-based browsers (like Google Chrome), Mozilla Firefox, and Safari. You’ll also get a first look at accessing the extension’s popup UI, understand what to expect after installation, and find solutions for common setup issues.

---

## 1. Why Install uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight and powerful extension that reveals all attempted and successful third-party network connections made by webpages you visit. It works alongside your existing content blockers to provide clear insights, helping you better understand what connections your browser makes and why a lower badge number on the toolbar icon indicates fewer third-party connections — typically a good thing.

---

## 2. Prerequisites for Installation

Before installing, make sure you have:

- A compatible browser:
  - Chromium browsers version 122 or later (e.g., Google Chrome)
  - Firefox version 128 or later
  - Safari version 18.5 or later
- An active internet connection to download the extension from official stores
- Basic permissions acceptance (webRequest monitoring, activeTab access)

For details on supported browsers and permissions, see the [Supported Browsers & Requirements](https://yourdocsurl/getting-started/installation-basics/supported-platforms-requirements) guide.

## 3. Installing uBO Scope

Follow the steps below based on your browser.

### Step 1: Locate the Extension in Your Browser's Add-ons Store

- **Chromium/Chrome:**
  1. Open the [Chrome Web Store page for uBO Scope](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
  2. Click **Add to Chrome**.

- **Firefox:**
  1. Open the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
  2. Click **Add to Firefox**.

- **Safari:**
  1. Use the Safari Extensions Gallery or App Store to find uBO Scope (available starting with Safari 18.5). Search for “uBO Scope” and add it.

### Step 2: Confirm the Installation

- After clicking add, your browser will prompt to grant the required permissions.
- Accept permissions for `webRequest`, `activeTab`, and storage.
- Wait for the extension icon resembling the uBO Scope logo to appear in your toolbar.

<Tip>
Accepting these permissions is essential as uBO Scope relies on accessing web requests to provide accurate data on remote connections.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Verify the Installation

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- The extension popup will open, initially showing ‘NO DATA’ until you browse web pages.
- The toolbar badge number should reflect the number of allowed third-party domains on active tabs.

## 4. Your First Look at the Popup UI

Once installed, you can open the uBO Scope popup anytime by clicking its toolbar icon.

### What the Popup Shows

- **Tab Hostname:** Displays the current active tab's hostname and domain.
- **Summary:** The count of distinct third-party domains connected on that tab.
- **Connection Outcomes:** Grouped sections for:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Third-party domains from which content loaded successfully.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections stealthily blocked by the browser or content blockers.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were outright blocked.

Each outcome has a list of domains, with a count of connections seen.

### Example

After visiting a webpage, the popup might show:

- 5 domains connected (allowed)
- 2 domains stealth-blocked
- 1 domain blocked

This immediate feedback helps you gauge how many and which third parties a page interacts with.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

If you encounter problems during or after installation, follow these tips:

### Issue: No Toolbar Icon or Badge Not Showing

- Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements.
- Double-check the extension is enabled in your browser’s extensions page.
- Reload the browser or restart it.
- Check that permissions were accepted; reinstall if necessary.

### Issue: Popup Shows NO DATA Even After Browsing

- Refresh the current webpage or navigate to a new page.
- Make sure no other extensions or privacy settings interfere with webRequest API.
- The extension only reports network requests visible via the browser’s webRequest API; network requests outside this scope cannot be reported.

### Issue: Badge Count Does Not Update

- Switch tabs or close and reopen the current tab.
- Wait a few seconds; uBO Scope processes connection data asynchronously.
- Clear browser cache or data, and reload tabs.

<Tip>
If you continue experiencing issues, consult the troubleshooting documentation [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](https://yourdocsurl/getting-started/quick-validation/troubleshooting-setup) and [Quick Validation Steps](https://yourdocsurl/getting-started/quick-validation/quick-validation-check).
</Tip>

## 6. Best Practices After Installation

- Start with browsing your favorite websites and observing the real-time connection insights.
- Use the badge count as a privacy signal: fewer distinct third-party domains allowed means fewer external connections.
- Combine uBO Scope with your content blocker for a clearer picture of network activity.
- Avoid relying on ad-blocker test pages; they produce artificial scenarios not reflective of typical browsing.

---

## 7. Summary

Installing uBO Scope brings transparency to your browser’s network activity by reporting real-time third-party connection data from the active tabs. The extension is lightweight, integrates seamlessly with major browsers, and offers an accessible popup UI to understand connections at a glance.
