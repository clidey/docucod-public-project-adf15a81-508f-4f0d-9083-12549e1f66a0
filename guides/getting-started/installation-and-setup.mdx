## Step-by-Step Installation and Setup

### 1. Install uBO Scope Extension

#### For Chrome:
1. Visit the [Chrome Web Store uBO Scope page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
2. Click *Add to Chrome*.
3. In the permission prompt, review and accept the required permissions.

#### For Firefox:
1. Go to the [Firefox Add-ons uBO Scope page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Click *Add to Firefox*.
3. Approve the requested permissions when prompted.

> **Tip:** For Safari users, installation requires Safari 18.5 or newer and is handled from the Mac App Store or Safari Extensions Gallery. See the system requirements page for details.

---

### 2. Enable Permissions and Configuration

uBO Scope requests the following permissions for comprehensive monitoring:
- Access to active tabs.
- Persistent storage for settings.
- Access to webRequest API to observe all network requests.

These are granted during installation, but you should verify:

- **Chrome/Firefox:** Access your browser’s extension settings and confirm the permissions are enabled.
- **Check for conflicts:** Ensure no other extensions block or interfere with uBO Scope’s permissions.

> **Note:** The extension requires host permissions for all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs (i.e., `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) to fully monitor network activity.

---

### 3. Confirm Extension Activation

Once installed, verify uBO Scope is active:
- Look for the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- Click the toolbar icon to open the popup interface.
- The popup should show:
  - The domain of the active tab.
  - Categories of connection outcomes: not blocked, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
  - A badge count displaying the number of distinct third-party domains connected.

---

### 4. Initial Verification

After installation, perform these quick checks:

- Visit a commonly used website.
- Observe the badge count on the toolbar icon updating according to connections.
- Open the popup to see connection details.

For detailed verification methods, see the [First Launch Experience](https://your-docs-site/getting-started/installation-and-setup/first-launch) and [Quick Validation Steps](https://your-docs-site/getting-started/usage-and-troubleshooting/quick-validation).

---

## Best Practices
- **Keep your browser updated** to ensure compatibility, as uBO Scope requires minimum browser versions.
- **Review permissions carefully** during installation; partial permissions will limit extension effectiveness.
- **Avoid conflicting extensions** that disable or alter webRequest API behavior.

---

## Common Installation Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Extension not showing icon:** Check your browser’s extension toolbar overflow panel; pin the uBO Scope icon for easy access.

- **Empty popup or no data:** Ensure you have accepted all permissions and are browsing a supported webpage.

- **Unsupported browser version warnings:** Upgrade your browser to the required minimum version.

- **Permissions denied:** Reinstall the extension and accept all permission prompts fully.

Refer to the [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup Issues](https://your-docs-site/getting-started/usage-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting) guide for detailed help.
