## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Choose Your Browser

uBO Scope supports the following browsers with minimum versions:
- **Google Chrome** 122 or higher
- **Mozilla Firefox** 128 or higher
- **Apple Safari** 18.5 or higher

### Step 2: Install uBO Scope Extension

#### Method A: From Official Browser Stores

1. For **Chrome**, open the [Chrome Web Store page for uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
2. For **Firefox**, open the [Firefox Add-ons page for uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
3. Click **Add to Chrome/Firefox**.
4. Follow browser prompts to confirm installation.

#### Method B: Manual Developer Installation (Advanced Users)

- Download the extension package from the GitHub repository or build it manually using the provided scripts (`tools/make-package.sh`).
- Load the unpacked extension in your browser’s developer mode:
  - Chrome: `chrome://extensions` > Enable Developer Mode > Load unpacked
  - Firefox: `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` > Load Temporary Add-on
  - Safari: Enable developer options and load from the Safari Extension Builder

### Step 3: Confirm Installation and Permissions

- After installation, confirm the uBO Scope icon appears in your browser’s toolbar.
- When first activated, the extension will request permissions including:
  - Access to active browsing tabs
  - Storage access
  - Network request monitoring (`webRequest` permissions)
- Accept these permissions for full functionality.

### Step 4: Understand Badge Behavior

- The toolbar badge number indicates **the count of distinct third-party domains your browser is connected to from the active tab**.
- A lower badge count means fewer third-party connections, which is typically preferable from a privacy standpoint.

### Step 5: Open the Popup and Verify Data

1. Click the uBO Scope icon on the toolbar.
2. The popup interface shows:
   - The current tab’s hostname and domain
   - Summary of connected domains (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked)
   - Detailed lists of domains and counts grouped by outcome
3. Verify that this data appears and updates as you switch tabs or browse.

### Step 6: Validate Extension Operation

- Open websites and observe badge count changes.
- Open the popup and verify domain connection details correspond to websites visited.
- If no data appears or badge does not update:
  - Ensure the extension's permissions were granted
  - Refresh the page or restart the browser
  - Consult troubleshooting documentation if problems persist
