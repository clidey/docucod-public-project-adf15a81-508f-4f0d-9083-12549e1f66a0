# Monitoring Remote Connections on Any Webpage

## Overview

This guide walks you through how uBO Scope reports all attempts made by webpages to connect to remote servers. By following a practical example, you will learn how the extension captures both successful and failed connection attempts, enabling you to evaluate the content blocking in place and understand what remote resources a webpage tries to use.

✅ **Why This Matters:** Seeing all remote connection attempts—whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked—gives insightful visibility into third-party network activity that affects privacy and page behavior.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start monitoring remote connections using uBO Scope's popup interface, make sure:

- You have successfully installed uBO Scope. Follow the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) or the related documentation in your browser platform.
- The extension has permissions to monitor network requests (typically granted during install).
- You have at least started browsing to one or more websites in an active tab.

<Check>
Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and active. You can verify this by checking the extension icon badge is visible and updating as you browse.
</Check>

## Expected Outcome

By completing this guide you will:

- Open the uBO Scope popup and see an up-to-date report of all remote servers a current webpage attempts to connect to.
- Understand the distinctions between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.
- Gain insights into content blocking effectiveness and third-party resource usage.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open uBO Scope Popup

- Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser's toolbar.
- The popup will appear displaying connection data for the active tab.
- The page hostname will be shown prominently at the top.

_Expected Result:_ The popup displays the domain name of the current tab, along with connection summaries.

### 2. Understand the Popup Sections

The popup divides remote connection attempts into three categories:

- **Not Blocked (allowed):** Connections that succeeded and are not blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were redirected or manipulated stealthily (often by content blockers) where the page is unaware of blocking.
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked by content blockers or network errors.

Each category lists domains contacted and the count of requests made to each.

<Info>
Tip: Counts show how many requests were made to each domain, helping prioritize scrutiny.
</Info>

### 3. Review Domains and Counts

- Scroll through each section (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).
- Domains are displayed using punycode decoding for readability (e.g., internationalized domain names shown correctly).
- Next to each domain, a count badge shows how many requests targeted that server.

_Expected Result:_ You can clearly see which third-party domains are heavily used and their respective request volumes.

### 4. Evaluate Remote Requests on Your Webpage

- Compare the domains across allowed, stealth, and blocked sections to understand what resources are fetched or prevented.
- Notice the total number of distinct remote domains connected to, summarized at the top.

<Tip>
A lower number of allowed third-party domains generally means fewer external connections, which is preferable for privacy.
</Tip>

### 5. Interpret Extension Badge Count

The badge on the extension icon shows the count of **distinct allowed third-party domains** for the active tab.

- Every time new remote servers load successfully, the badge number updates promptly.
- This offers quick at-a-glance insight into the network footprint of the webpage.

## Real-World Example

Imagine visiting a news website while uBO Scope is active:

- The extension detects and records every connection attempt from your browser tab.
- The popup reveals several CDN domains under _allowed_ — these are legitimate third-party servers delivering images and scripts.
- You also see a few domains under _blocked_ — possibly trackers or ads prevented by your filter lists.
- Some stealth-blocked entries show connections silently redirected or filtered without page awareness.

By inspecting these, you conclude your content blocking setup is effective if the allowed connections make sense and the trackers are not loaded.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty lists:**
  - Ensure you have an active tab open and loaded with a webpage.
  - Refresh the tab and open the popup again.
  - Check extension permissions and browser compatibility.

- **Badge count does not update:**
  - Network monitoring might be restricted by browser settings.
  - Try reloading the webpage or restarting the browser.

### Best Practices

- Regularly open and inspect the popup when browsing sensitive or unfamiliar sites.
- Use the extension alongside other blockers but rely on uBO Scope for objective visibility.
- Interpret badge numbers in context — a higher block count does not always mean better blocking.

### Performance Considerations

- uBO Scope batches processing network events every second to minimize overhead.
- Monitoring many tabs simultaneously may increase extension resource use but generally remains efficient.

### Alternative Approaches

- For advanced users, consider using developer tools network tabs in combination, but uBO Scope simplifies domain-focused inspection.

## Summary

<u>At the heart of the Monitoring Remote Connections page is the powerful ability to see exactly what third-party servers a webpage attempts to contact, whether those connections are allowed, blocked, or stealthily intercepted. This guide empowers users to open the popup interface, understand its categorized data, and make informed judgments about their web browsing privacy and content blocking efficacy.</u>
