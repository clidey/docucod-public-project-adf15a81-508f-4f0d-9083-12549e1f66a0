# Interpreting Badge Numbers and Domain Lists

uBO Scope is a powerful yet straightforward extension designed to provide visibility into the remote server connections initiated by webpages you visit. This guide unpacks the meaning behind the badge counts and lists displayed in the uBO Scope popup, helping you understand exactly what the numbers represent and how to interpret the domain data for improved privacy awareness.

---

## 1. Understanding the Badge Count

### What the Badge Number Represents

- The badge count on the uBO Scope toolbar icon reflects **the number of distinct third-party domains with which network connections were successfully established or attempted** on the current browser tab.
- A **lower badge count** indicates fewer third-party remote servers contacted, which generally equates to stronger privacy.
- The badge count specifically tracks **third-party domains** — servers unrelated to the main website domain — which are the primary source of tracking and unwanted network activity.

### Why Lower is Better

- A lower badge count means that fewer external entities are connecting behind the scenes.
- Even well-intentioned sites often load resources from content delivery networks (CDNs), which are usually legitimate but raise the count.
- An unexpectedly high count might indicate extensive third-party tracking or ads loading.

<Tip>
Keep in mind that not all third-party domains are harmful. CDNs and analytics services can inflate the count but may be considered acceptable depending on your preferences.
</Tip>

### Badge Count Does Not Reflect Block Counts

- The badge count is unrelated to the number of requests blocked by content blockers. It only shows the number of distinct domains contacted.
- Higher block counts do not necessarily mean better blocking efficacy.

---

## 2. Reading the Popup Domain Lists

When you open uBO Scope's popup, you see three distinct sections showing domains involved in network activity:

### 2.1 Domains Listed as "Not Blocked"

- These are third-party domains **allowed by any content blocker or network rules** and successfully contacted.
- They represent the current baseline of external connections.
- Each domain is accompanied by a count showing how many requests were identified to that domain.

### 2.2 Domains Listed as "Stealth-Blocked"

- These domains were **blocked in a stealthy manner**, such as through redirects or indirect blocking.
- This means these connections were prevented but silently, without obvious failed network errors.
- Their presence indicates subtle blocking behaviors occurring behind the scenes.

### 2.3 Domains Listed as "Blocked"

- These domains had network requests blocked explicitly, resulting in connection failures.
- Blocks can stem from content blockers, browser restrictions, or network-level filters.

<Tip>
Hovering or reading the counts can help identify which domains are the most frequently connected or blocked on a page, giving clues about third-party service usage.
</Tip>

## 3. Tips to Differentiate Harmless CDNs From Trackers

- **Frequent and well-known CDN domains** (e.g., googleapis.com, cloudflare.com) often appear under "Not Blocked" and may be acceptable sources.
- **Unexpected or obscure domains** with many requests generally deserve scrutiny.
- Use domain reputation tools or check domain ownership to assess trustworthiness.
- A high number of blocked domains usually reflects a strong content blocking policy, but review stealth-blocked domains to ensure no unwanted connections sneak through.

## 4. Step-by-Step: Using uBO Scope to Evaluate Third-Party Connections

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup interface showing current tab network connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the Badge Number">
Note the badge number on the toolbar icon; this indicates the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
</Step>
<Step title='Scan the "Not Blocked" Domains'>
Look at domains allowed to connect and the count of requests made. These are active third-party connections.
</Step>
<Step title='Review the "Stealth-Blocked" Domains'>
Observe any stealth-blocked domains, indicating connections silently prevented.
</Step>
<Step title='Examine the "Blocked" Domains'>
Check the list of explicitly blocked domains to see which connections failed due to blocking.
</Step>
<Step title="Assess Domain Trustworthiness">
Use external domain info tools or your knowledge to identify potential trackers versus benign CDNs.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Common Scenarios and What to Expect

| Scenario | Badge Count & Lists Behavior | What it Means |
|----------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| Visiting a simple website with minimal third-party resources | Low badge count, mostly "Not Blocked" domains with common CDN names, few or no blocked domains | Low external exposure; likely good for privacy |
| Visiting an ad-heavy site | Higher badge count with multiple blocked and stealth-blocked domains | Many third-party trackers/ads detected and some blocked |
| Using aggressive content blockers | Possibly lower "Not Blocked" domains, increased blocked and stealth-blocked counts | Fewer active third-party connections; blocking in effect |

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Tips">
<Accordion title="Why is my badge count high on very simple sites?">
Some sites rely on multiple CDNs and analytics services that increase third-party connections without suspicious behavior. Cross-check domains before assuming tracking.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some domains appear in stealth-blocked but not blocked?">
Stealth blocking prevents connections quietly (e.g., via redirect suppression), which avoids some network errors but still inhibits communication.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="My extension badge shows 0 but I see domains in the popup, why?">
Occasionally, data synchronization or tab refresh delays cause temporary mismatches. Reload the page and popup to refresh counts.
</Accordion>

## 7. Best Practices for Effective Use

- Regularly check the badge count to detect spikes in third-party connections when browsing.
- Use the domain lists to understand and audit your web traffic origins.
- Combine with trusted blocklists or content blockers to minimize unwanted connections.
- Pay close attention to stealth-blocked domains as they indicate hidden network behaviors.
