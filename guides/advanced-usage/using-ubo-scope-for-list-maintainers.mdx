# Using uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance

uBO Scope offers filter list maintainers an indispensable way to validate and improve their lists by surfacing real network request data from active browser tabs. This guide walks you through using uBO Scope’s capabilities to detect overlooked third-party connections, uncover stealth or persistent requests that evade blocking, and verify list effectiveness even in constrained device environments.

---

## 1. Why Use uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance?

Filter list maintainers aim to optimize blocking rules that effectively prevent unwanted network connections without disrupting legitimate functionality. uBO Scope helps by providing transparent visibility into every outgoing network request and its outcome—allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked—across all devices and browsers.

Unlike development consoles or browser network panels that might be limited or inaccessible on certain devices (e.g., mobile), uBO Scope runs persistently as an extension and reports third-party connections reliably regardless of the content blocker or network environment.

> Imagine you maintain a filter list, but some third-party trackers or ad servers remain hidden from view because they use stealth redirects or persistent connection attempts that evade conventional blocking. uBO Scope helps you discover these.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- **Install uBO Scope** on your target browser. Refer to [Installing uBO Scope](/getting-started/installation-basics/extension-installation) for detailed installation instructions.
- **Activate uBO Scope** and verify it is working by following [Launching and Using uBO Scope for the First Time](/getting-started/installation-basics/first-run).

Ensure you have access to the uBO Scope toolbar badge and popup UI for the active tab where you want to analyze network connections.

## 3. What You Will Achieve

By following this workflow, you will be able to:

- Identify third-party domains your current filter list may not be effectively blocking.
- Detect stealth-blocked connections that signal possible persistent tracking methods.
- Validate your filter list’s effectiveness in preventing unwanted third-party network communications.
- Troubleshoot overlooked or new connections even on devices limited in developer tools or specialized software.

Typical time required: 15-30 minutes per website testing session.

## 4. Step-by-Step Workflow to Maintain Your Filter List Using uBO Scope

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope on the Target Tab">
Navigate to the website or web application you want to test in your browser. Click the uBO Scope extension icon on your toolbar to open the popup.

Expected Result: The popup displays a live list of all third-party domains your browser is connecting to for that page.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret the Badge and Domain Lists">
Observe the badge number on the extension icon: this represents the count of unique third-party domains with allowed connections.

Within the popup, review the three domain outcome categories:
- **Not Blocked** - domains with allowed connections.
- **Stealth-Blocked** - domains whose requests were redirected or otherwise stealth-blocked.
- **Blocked** - domains with outright blocked requests.

Expected Result: You have clear visibility into what your current filter rules allow, block, or stealth-block.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify Overlooked Third-Party Connections">
Focus on domains in the **Not Blocked** section that you expected to be blocked.

- Check if these domains should be added to your filter list.
- Use domain classification tools or lookup public suffixes to understand their nature (e.g., trackers, CDNs).

Expected Result: You find legitimate third-party connections missed by your list or confirm known safe domains.
</Step>

<Step title="Spot Stealth or Persistent Requests">
Look carefully in the **Stealth-Blocked** section:

- These are often requests that your filter list or content blocker handles in subtle ways, such as redirects that avoid incrementing block counts.
- Verify whether some stealth requests should be converted to fully blocked rules for stricter enforcement.

Expected Result: You can detect indirect or persistent third-party behavior that you might otherwise miss and take action accordingly.
</Step>

<Step title="Repeat Testing on Different Devices and Browsers">
Run the same test scenario on devices or browsers where developer tools may be unavailable or limited.

- Use uBO Scope to maintain consistency and verify your filter lists perform across environments.

Expected Result: Confidence that your filter list holds up even in constrained or mobile contexts.
</Step>

<Step title="Iterate and Refine Your Filter List">
Update your filter list based on findings:

- Add newly discovered third-party domains to block or stealth rules.
- Remove or whitelist domains that are legitimate and cause no privacy concern.
- Test changes by reloading the webpage and confirming behavior in uBO Scope popup.

Expected Result: An optimized, more effective filter list with measurable improvements.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Use the extension’s badge count as your primary indicator.** A rising badge count after updates may indicate new third-party disclosures; a falling count suggests better blocking.

- **Do not rely solely on block counts reported by content blockers.** Stealth-blocked domains often go unnoticed without uBO Scope’s transparency.

- **Validate your test cases with real-world browsing.** Avoid fabricated 'ad blocker test' sites as they often trigger artificial or unlikely network requests.

- **Focus on domain-level analysis.** Using the Public Suffix List enables precise classification of hostnames and domains for better decision-making.

- **Keep device and browser variability in mind.** Network requests and outcomes can differ due to environment differences.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope Usage for Filter Maintenance">
<Accordion title="No Data in uBO Scope Popup">
- Verify the extension is properly installed and enabled.
- Confirm you are on an active tab with network activity.
- Reload the tab to initiate fresh data capture.
- See [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup Issues](/getting-started/installation-basics/troubleshooting) for deeper help.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected High Badge Count After Filter Updates">
- Investigate domains listed under **Not Blocked**; these might be recently allowed due to insufficient filter rules.
- Consider stealth-blocked domains as a clue to indirect resource loading.
- Cross-check with filter syntax and approve or block accordingly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth-Blocked Domains Are Empty or Missing">
- Some browsers may not report certain events due to API limitations.
- Ensure your environment supports the required `webRequest` interfaces.
- Validate with multiple browsers if possible.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
