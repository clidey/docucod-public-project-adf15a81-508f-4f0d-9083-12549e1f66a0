# Debunking Common Content Blocking and Ad Testing Myths

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps users understand why traditional metrics like block counts and popular ad 'test' websites often provide misleading or inaccurate evaluations of content blockers. Through concrete case studies and practical insights using uBO Scope, you will learn to interpret network connection evidence objectively and avoid common pitfalls.

### Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and correctly set up in your browser.
- Basic knowledge of how content blockers work (recommended: see [What is uBO Scope?](/overview/introduction-value/product-intro) and [Understanding the Popup Interface](/guides/getting-started/understanding-the-popup)).
- Familiarity with the uBO Scope popup displaying domain connection outcomes.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Recognize why block count badges on various extensions are unreliable for assessing content blockers.
- Understand the shortcomings of common ad blocker test pages.
- Use factual network connection data from uBO Scope to make informed decisions about blocking effectiveness.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15–20 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate (suitable for users familiar with privacy tools and content blocking concepts).

## Common Myths and How uBO Scope Disproves Them

### Myth 1: "Higher Block Count Means Better Content Blocking"

Many users assume that an extension showing a higher block count on its toolbar icon is more effective. This is misleading.

- **Reality:** The block count only shows how many individual network requests were blocked, not the distinct third-party domains connected.
- A high block count can co-exist with a **higher number of allowed distinct third-party domains**, meaning more privacy exposure.
- uBO Scope reports the **number of distinct third-party remote servers connected**, which is a stronger indicator of privacy exposure than raw block counts.

#### How to Verify with uBO Scope:
1. Open uBO Scope and view the popup for the active tab.
2. Examine the "not blocked" section – these are distinct domains from which resources loaded.
3. Understand that fewer distinct allowed domains generally indicate stronger blocking effectiveness.

### Myth 2: "Ad Blocker Test Pages Show Reliable Results"

Popular ad 'test' pages are often trusted to benchmark ad blockers. However, these pages create unrealistic conditions.

- **Reality:** Ad blocker test sites often use fabricated requests to domains that are not commonly used in the wild.
- They cannot detect stealthy blocking techniques used by many modern content blockers.
- Results from these pages are **not representative** of actual web browsing experiences.

#### Why uBO Scope Is Better:
- uBO Scope captures **real network requests** initiated by active browser tabs, regardless of any content blocker in effect.
- It provides an unbiased view of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains per browsing session.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using uBO Scope for Debunking These Myths

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
    Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser to open the popup interface that displays connection data for the current tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Interpret Domain Categories">
    Review the three outcome sections:
    - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which resources loaded successfully.
    - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with blocked requests that may remain undetectable by webpages.
    - **Blocked:** Domains fully blocked where requests failed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compare to Block Count Badges">
    Observe that the badge number reflects distinct allowed domains, not block counts.
    Recognize that a lower badge count means fewer distinct third-parties were contacted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Avoid Using 'Ad Blocker Test' Pages as Benchmark">
    Test blockers on real websites instead of synthetic ad blocker tests, using uBO Scope to analyze network connections.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze Real-World Browsing Scenarios">
    Use uBO Scope to observe network activities on your favorite websites.
    Note the variety and count of third-party services actually contacted.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Focus on distinct third-party domains connected** for a clearer privacy picture rather than raw counts of blocked requests.
- Recognize the limitations of synthetic tests which do not mimic real browsing behavior or stealth blocking.
- Use uBO Scope as a complementary tool to understand network exposure independently of the content blocker UI.
- Regularly monitor allowed, stealth, and blocked connections during your browsing sessions to spot unexpected third parties.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t trust block count badges alone to compare content blockers; they can be counterintuitive.
- Avoid relying on popular ad blockers’ test pages as definitive indicators of block quality.
- Beware that stealth blocking may hide some connections from page scripts; uBO Scope highlights these accurately.

---

## Example Scenario

Imagine you install two content blockers: Blocker A shows a block count of 150 and Blocker B shows 75.

- Intuition may suggest Blocker A is better.
- However, opening uBO Scope while browsing with Blocker A reveals 50 distinct allowed third-party domains,
  while with Blocker B, there are only 10 allowed domains.
- This means Blocker B effectively prevents more domain contacts, offering stronger privacy despite a lower block count.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope for Myth Debunking">
<Accordion title="I see zero domains in the popup, is uBO Scope broken?">
This may indicate uBO Scope is not capturing network data for the active tab.
- Ensure the extension is correctly installed and enabled.
- Confirm your browser supports the webRequest API as required (see [Supported Browsers & Requirements](/getting-started/setup-installation/prerequisites-browsers)).
- Reload the tab and open the popup again.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The badge count does not change after blocking settings are changed">
The badge count reflects the active tab's network requests and updates shortly after activity.
- Try navigating to a different page or refreshing the tab.
- If the issue persists, check for conflicts with other extensions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I interpret stealth-blocked domains?">
Stealth-blocked domains are those where blocking prevents detection by webpages but not necessarily all network activity.
- Review the [Interpreting Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Domains](/guides/analyzing-network-connections/interpreting-domain-outcomes) guide for detailed insights.

## About uBO Scope Badge Count

Remember, the badge count on the toolbar icon is **always** the number of distinct third-party domains connected (allowed), not the number of blocked requests. This makes it a vital but sometimes counterintuitive metric.

Fewer domains connected means better privacy. High block counts can mask the reality of more domains being contacted.

Use uBO Scope to see the full picture beyond what conventional blockers advertise.
