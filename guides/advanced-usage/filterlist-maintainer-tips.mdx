# uBO Scope for Filter List Maintainers

## Overview

This guide is designed for filter list maintainers and advanced users who want to leverage uBO Scope’s capabilities to verify filter effectiveness and detect hidden third-party connections in realistic browsing environments. It focuses on using the extension’s domain-based connection data, especially when conventional browser developer tools are unavailable or limited.

By using uBO Scope, you gain practical insights into how your filter lists perform against real-world network activity, enabling you to identify leaks, stealth behaviors, and unexpected connections at the domain and hostname level.

---

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

- Installed uBO Scope on a supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+). See [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/guides/getting-started/installing-extension.mdx).
- Basic understanding of browser networking concepts, including domains, hostnames, and requests.
- Up-to-date filter lists installed in your content blocker to evaluate.


## What You Will Achieve

- Gain visibility into real network requests classified as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- Assess the effectiveness of your filter lists based on actual network outcomes.
- Identify stealth behaviors where requests are blocked but still attempted.
- Easily monitor changes and connections without relying on browser devtools.


## Time Estimate

Expect to spend approximately 15–30 minutes setting up and performing initial analysis workflows.

## Using uBO Scope to Verify Filter List Effectiveness

### Step 1: Open uBO Scope Popup

1. Navigate to a target webpage where your filter list applies.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
3. The popup will display a summary of domains connected for the active tab.

> The displayed domain counts reflect distinct third-party remote servers that were connected during page load and navigation.


### Step 2: Interpret Popup Data Sections

- **Not blocked:** Domains from which network requests succeeded
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where requests were blocked, but network activity attempts were detected
- **Blocked:** Domains fully blocked without observed successful connections

### Step 3: Compare Results Against Your Filter List

- Cross-reference domains under the **blocked** and **stealth-blocked** sections with entries in your filter lists.
- Investigate any domains showing up under **not blocked** that you expected to block.
- Pay special attention to **stealth-blocked** domains as these reveal hidden attempts that might bypass simple blocking.

<Tip>
Use the domain counts and presence in various sections to identify where filter lists need improvement or tuning for better coverage and stealth detection.
</Tip>


### Step 4: Monitor Badge Counts for Ongoing Insights

- The toolbar badge shows the count of distinct allowed domains connected by the current tab.
- A rising count indicates more distinct third-party connections, potentially unwanted or unblocked.
- Maintaining a low count affirms filter list effectiveness.


### Step 5: Analyze Across Multiple Pages and Browsing Sessions

- Repeat the analysis on representative websites commonly targeted by your filter list.
- Use uBO Scope to track patterns of connections, stealth behaviors, or leaks over time.

## Advanced Tips for Filter List Maintainers

### Leveraging uBO Scope on Platforms with Limited Devtools

- On browsers or devices with restricted developer tools, uBO Scope offers a clear window into network activity.
- Use uBO Scope to supplement or replace devtools-based network assays, especially for mobile or remote testing.


### Diagnosing Stealth Blocking

- The **stealth-blocked** section indicates requests that were blocked but still caused network activity, revealing possible bypasses or partial blocking.
- Investigate these by visiting the affected domains with developer tools if available, or analyze patterns of these domains to enhance filter rules.


### Tracking Domain Relationships

- uBO Scope aggregates counts by domain, helping identify if a domain is a top-level service or a smaller third-party.
- Recognize domains that appear in multiple tabs or pages, indicating widely-used CDNs or tracking services.


### Use Cases Beyond Filter Effectiveness

- Verifying that new filter rules actually block third-party connections without causing overblocking
- Understanding the real-world impact of filter list updates on connected domains
- Debunking misleading test sites by focusing on authentic network requests


---

## Practical Example Scenario

Imagine you maintain a filter list targeting ad and tracker domains.

1. Visit a popular news website with uBO Scope enabled.
2. Observe the **Not blocked** domains in the popup — these include approved CDNs and necessary external resources.
3. Review the **Blocked** domains and verify they match your filter list entries.
4. Notice a few entries under **Stealth-blocked** — network requests attempted but were partially blocked, possibly indicating stealth scripts.
5. Use these insights to fine-tune your filter list, for example, adding specific hostnames or adjusting rules to prevent stealth leaks.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">

<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or 'NO DATA'">
- Confirm that you have navigated to a normal webpage (not a blank tab or internal browser page).
- Ensure uBO Scope was granted all requested permissions during installation.
- Reload the page and retry opening the popup.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Remains Empty or Zero">
- The badge shows counts only for the active tab's allowed third-party connections.
- Make sure you actively browse a site with third-party content.
- Restart the browser or reinstall uBO Scope if persistent.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unexpected Allowed Domains or Low Block Counts">
- Review your filter list for accuracy and coverage.
- Remember that not all third parties are malicious; some are essential CDNs.
- Cross-reference with payload inspection tools if available.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Stealth Blocked Domains Appear Empty or No Entries">
- Not all requests can be stealth detected; the browser must expose some network event.
- Stealth blocking detection is an evolving feature; consider this a supplemental tool.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

- Regularly update both uBO Scope and your filter lists to benefit from improvements and new detections.
- Use domain-based connection counts rather than raw block counts to evaluate filter impact.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with browser devtools when possible to get full visibility.
- Avoid relying on synthetic ad blocker test pages; focus on real-world network data.

## Understanding Domain Classification in uBO Scope

For filter maintainers, it is crucial to understand how uBO Scope classifies domains:

- **Allowed:** Requests successfully completed to a domain, indicating no block.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed entirely due to content blocking.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Attempts detected through network events indicating blocking at some point but with prior connection or redirection attempt.

Using uBO Scope’s domain aggregates, you can identify which domains remain unblocked and should be targeted in your lists, and which stealth attempts suggest partial evasion.


---

<uBO Scope’s user interface helps filter maintainers focus on domains, rather than individual requests or IP addresses, simplifying complex network behavior analysis.>


---

## Summary

- Open the popup on various websites to review domain-level connection data.
- Analyze allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains for assessment.
- Investigate stealth-blocked entries for partial block leaks.
- Use badge counts as a real-time metric of third-party connection distinctness.
- Repeat assessments across different browsing sessions for reliable insights.

## Example of Domain Analysis with uBO Scope Popup

Assuming you filter list targets advertising domains, on visiting a typical media site:

| Domain                  | Status          | Description                                |
|-------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| cdn.domain.com          | Allowed         | Content CDN serving static assets         |
| ads.tracker.net         | Blocked         | Tracker domain blocked by filter           |
| stealthbanner.ads.xyz   | Stealth-blocked | Blocked but network request observed       |
| fonts.example.org       | Allowed         | Allowed third-party fonts                   |

This concise snapshot lets you decide if the filter list covers known trackers adequately and points toward domains which used stealth techniques requiring further rule tuning.
