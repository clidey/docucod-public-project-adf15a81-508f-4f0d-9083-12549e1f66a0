# Best Practices: Assessing and Reducing Third-Party Exposure

## Overview
This guide helps you leverage the data available in uBO Scope's popup interface to critically assess your browsing privacy exposure caused by third-party remote servers. You will learn how to identify unnecessary or intrusive third-party connections, distinguish legitimate Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) from potentially privacy-invasive servers, and optimize your filter lists or browsing behavior accordingly.

By applying these best practices, you can significantly reduce unwanted network connections that compromise your privacy without breaking site functionality.

---

## Prerequisites
- uBO Scope must be installed and active in your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Basic familiarity with the uBO Scope popup interface and network connection categories: **Not blocked**, **Stealth-blocked**, and **Blocked**. (See the guide on [Understanding the Popup Interface](/guides/getting-started/understanding-the-popup) for details.)
- Access to live browsing sessions or network connection data to analyze.

---

## Expected Outcome
- You will confidently interpret uBO Scope's domain connection data.
- Identify superfluous third-party servers that increase your privacy risk.
- Recognize legitimate CDNs commonly used by websites.
- Apply targeted filtering or adjustments to your content blocker/filter lists or browsing habits.

---

## Time Estimate
Approximately 15â€“30 minutes for initial familiarization and actionable assessment per website or browsing session.

---

## Difficulty Level
Intermediate privacy-aware users and filter list maintainers.

## Step-by-Step Best Practices

### 1. Open uBO Scope Popup to Review Current Tab Connections
1. Navigate to the browser tab you want to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup.
3. Examine the domain connection count summary at the top.

**Expected Result:**
- The summary shows the total number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- The list categorizes domains into **Not blocked**, **Stealth-blocked**, and **Blocked**.

### 2. Identify and Differentiate Third-Party Domains
- **Not Blocked:** Servers third parties, resources successfully loaded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests internally blocked stealthily to prevent detection (may still count network activity).
- **Blocked:** Fully blocked servers, no connection established.

**Guidance:**
- Focus primarily on **Not Blocked** domains as they represent actual potential privacy exposure.
- Review **Stealth-Blocked** to understand stealth blocking effectiveness but remember these do not represent allowed connections.

### 3. Spot Unnecessary or Suspicious Third-Party Servers
- Look for domains appearing frequently with high request counts (badges) but with no apparent legitimate content delivery purpose.
- Cross-check domain names against known privacy-invasive trackers or advertising servers.
- If unsure about a domain, use external services like [Whois Lookup](https://whois.domaintools.com/) or [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) to check reputation.

### 4. Differentiate Legitimate CDNs from Potential Trackers
- Recognize popular Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) such as:
  - `cdn.jsdelivr.net`
  - `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`
  - `fonts.gstatic.com`
  - `akamai.net`
- These usually serve static resources, fonts, or scripts that are essential for site performance.
- Legitimate CDNs typically have moderate to low connection counts and well-known domain names.

### 5. Use Request Counts (Badges) as Clues
- High counts for a domain mean many connections initiated during the page load.
- Consider investigating domains with unusual or excessive counts as these may indicate unnecessary tracking or data leaks.

### 6. Optimize Filter Lists and Browser Settings
- For third-party domains identified as unnecessary or privacy-invasive:
  - Add custom blocking rules in your content blocker or uBO Scope if supported.
  - Report consistently problematic domains to filter list maintainers or community repositories.
  - Remove or reduce dependencies on websites heavily reliant on questionable third parties.

- For legitimate CDNs, avoid blocking to maintain site functionality.

### 7. Regularly Reassess Exposure
- Perform this assessment periodically, as websites continuously change their third-party dependencies.
- Combine data from multiple browsing sessions to identify persistent privacy risks.

## Practical Example

Suppose you visit a news website and open the uBO Scope popup. You see:

- 15 domains **Not Blocked** with 10 connecting from a domain like `tracker.example.com` showing 200+ requests.
- 3 domains **Stealth-Blocked**, mostly smaller services.
- 20 domains **Blocked**.

Action:
- Recognize `tracker.example.com` as a suspicious domain due to its high request count and tracking-sounding name.
- Confirm by external lookup it is indeed a tracking service.
- Add a blocking filter for this domain in your content blocker.
- Reload the page and verify the connection count to this domain disappears or shifts to blocked/stealth-blocked categories.

## Tips & Common Pitfalls

- <Tip>
  Do not rely solely on the number of blocked connections as an indicator of privacy. Instead, focus on allowed third-party domains, which represent your actual exposure.
  </Tip>

- <Tip>
  Remember that some third-party connections are necessary for site functionality. Over-blocking critical CDNs may break websites.
  </Tip>

- <Warning>
  Avoid using 'ad blocker test' webpages as benchmarks; they often create unrealistic network requests not representative of real-world browsing.
  </Warning>

- <Tip>
  Use uBO Scope's stealth-blocked category to understand how your content blocker behaves stealthily without exposing blocking to websites.
  </Tip>

- <Tip>
  Maintain an updated filter list and contribute any new findings to filter list communities to benefit the wider user community.
  </Tip>

## Troubleshooting

- If domain counts do not update or show "NO DATA":
  - Ensure uBO Scope is correctly installed and enabled.
  - Confirm the page was reloaded after installing uBO Scope, as only active tab connections are shown.
  - Check permissions and that your browser supports the `webRequest` API fully.

- If expected domains appear missing:
  - Some connections may be blocked upstream or outside the browser's `webRequest` scope.
  - Confirm your content blocker or DNS-level blocker is active and compatible.

- To verify uBO Scope is functioning correctly, see the [Validating uBO Scope Functionality](/getting-started/troubleshooting-validation/quick-validation-steps) guide.
