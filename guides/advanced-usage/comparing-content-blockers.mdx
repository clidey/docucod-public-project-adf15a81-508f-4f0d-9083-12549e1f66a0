# Comparing Content Blockers Objectively Using uBO Scope

## Overview

This guide helps you use uBO Scope to objectively compare different content blockers by revealing the true network connection outcomes rather than just the number of blocked requests. You will learn how to understand the badge number shown by uBO Scope, interpret what it reflects about third-party connections, and make informed decisions about privacy tools based on real-world data.

## What You Will Achieve

- Learn to distinguish between block counts and actual third-party connections.
- Understand how to use uBO Scope's badge to assess content blocker effectiveness.
- Gain practical skills to compare multiple content blockers meaningfully.

## Prerequisites

- uBO Scope must be installed and active in your browser.
- One or more content blockers (e.g., uBlock Origin, AdGuard, Ghostery) installed and configured.
- A test website or typical browsing context to evaluate the blockers.

## Why This Matters

Many users and reviewers mistakenly judge content blockers solely by the number of blocked requests or claims from so-called "ad blocker test" pages. However, these metrics can be misleading. The true measure of a content blocker's effectiveness is the number of distinct third-party remote servers that remain connected after applying the blocker. This reflects real privacy impact and tracking reduction.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the uBO Scope Badge Number

The small number displayed on the uBO Scope extension icon is the count of distinct third-party domains that successfully established a network connection for the active tab.

- **Lower badge numbers are better** — fewer third-party connections means less potential tracking.
- This count excludes blocked or stealth-blocked connections.

<Tip>
  Remember: A high block count reported by a content blocker does not necessarily mean better blocking.
  uBO Scope helps reveal the actual connections made despite those block counts.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Choose Your Comparison Scenario

Select the website or type of page you want to test with multiple content blockers. Keep the browsing environment consistent for valid comparison.

- Use privacy-sensitive or media-heavy websites where third-party tracking is common.
- Avoid "ad blocker test" sites, as they often use unrealistic or synthetic requests.

### Step 3: Measure Each Content Blocker

For each content blocker you want to compare:

1. Enable uBO Scope alongside the content blocker.
2. Visit or reload the test page.
3. Observe the uBO Scope badge number on the toolbar icon.
4. Open the uBO Scope popup panel to review connection outcomes:
   - _Not blocked_: domains from which connections were allowed
   - _Stealth-blocked_: connections modified or hidden by the blocker (if any)
   - _Blocked_: domains effectively blocked

<Tip>
  Use uBO Scope’s detailed popup view to see _which_ domains are connecting and how they are categorized.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Interpret the Results

- **Compare badge numbers** across content blockers for the same page.
- Ask:
  - Which blocker has the lowest number of allowed third-party domains?
  - Do stealth blocking outcomes differ?
  - Are some blockers missing to block connections that others do?

<Tip>
  Focus on allowed domains because these are the domains your browser actually connects to and transfers data.
</Tip>

### Step 5: Make an Informed Decision

Based on these observations:

- Choose the content blocker that minimizes allowed third-party connections without breaking site functionality.
- Avoid relying solely on block counts from the blocker’s own UI, as those can be inflated by redundant or failed requests.

## Practical Example

Imagine testing two content blockers, Blocker A and Blocker B, on a news site.

| Content Blocker | Block Count Reported (by blocker) | uBO Scope Badge (Distinct Allowed Domains) |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Blocker A       | 300                                | 20                                       |
| Blocker B       | 150                                | 45                                       |

At a glance, Blocker A seems better because it blocks more requests. However, uBO Scope shows Blocker B allows more third-party domains (45 vs 20). This means Blocker B may let through more trackers despite fewer block events.

The real privacy impact is better reflected by the uBO Scope badge.

## Best Practices

- Always pair content blocker evaluation with uBO Scope badge monitoring.
- Test blockers on real-world sites, not synthetic ad blocker test pages.
- Use uBO Scope popup to understand which domains are connected and their categories.
- Remember stealth-blocking may reduce detectability of blockers but does not always equate to blocking.

## Common Pitfalls

- Judging blockers solely on block counts can be misleading.
- Using fake or synthetic test pages to compare blockers yields unreliable results.
- Ignoring stealth blocking outcomes misses nuances in blocker behavior.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If the uBO Scope badge shows no number after visiting a test page, ensure:
  - uBO Scope is installed, enabled, and has necessary permissions.
  - Your content blocker is active and running.
  - You have refreshed the page with the blockers active.

- If the popup shows "NO DATA", reopen the popup or reload the browser tab.

- For discrepancies, disable other privacy tools that might interfere with measuring network requests.

## How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Workflow

- Use uBO Scope post-installation as the definitive auditor of your privacy tools.
- Pair with [Reading the Popup Panel Guide](../core-workflows/reading-popup) to deepen understanding.
- Combine with [Network Request Visibility](../core-workflows/network-request-visibility) for advanced analysis.

## Next Steps

- Explore [Filter List Maintenance](../advanced-usage/filter-list-maintenance) to learn how to fine-tune your content blockers.
- Read [Debunking Misleading Analytics and 'Ad Blocker Test' Pages](../advanced-usage/avoiding-bad-metrics) to avoid common evaluation traps.


---

## Summary

- The uBO Scope badge represents distinct third-party servers actually connected.
- Lower badge values indicate better privacy protection.
- Compare blockers by observing uBO Scope badge and popup, not just block counts.
- Avoid synthetic "ad blocker test" pages.

## Technical Reference: How uBO Scope Counts Connections

uBO Scope internally listens to browser network requests and tracks outcomes as:

- **Allowed:** The connection to a third-party domain was successful.
- **Stealth-blocked:** The request was redirected or hidden in a way content blockers might employ stealth techniques.
- **Blocked:** The connection was stopped by a content blocker or network error.

The badge shows the count of unique allowed third-party domains for the active tab, providing a privacy-focused metric.

## Code Snippet Illustrating Badge Count Logic

This brief example (simplified) shows how uBO Scope updates the badge based on allowed domains:

```javascript
function updateTabBadge(tabId) {
    const tabDetails = session.tabIdToDetailsMap.get(tabId);
    if (!tabDetails) return;
    const count = tabDetails.allowed.domains.size; // unique allowed domains count
    browser.action.setBadgeText({
        tabId,
        text: count !== 0 ? `${count}` : ''
    });
}
```

This ensures the badge always reflects the *distinct allowed third-party domains* count.
