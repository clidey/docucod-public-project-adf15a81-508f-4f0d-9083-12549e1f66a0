# Strategies for Filter List Maintainers

Welcome to the definitive guide for filter list maintainers aiming to leverage uBO Scope effectively. This page equips you with best practices and real-world examples on how to extract detailed network request information, especially in restrictive or limited environments, to refine and validate your filter rules confidently.

## 1. Understanding the Role of uBO Scope for Filter List Maintainers

### What This Page Helps You Achieve
This guide empowers filter list maintainers to:
- Gain clear visibility into third-party network connections even when browser tools are limited.
- Extract actionable domain and hostname data that reveals the real impact of filter rules in complex or restricted browsing environments.
- Improve the accuracy and effectiveness of filter lists by leveraging uBO Scope's detailed connection reporting.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and active in a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Basic understanding of filter list creation and domain blocking concepts.
- Familiarity with browser networking and common filter list terminologies such as “third party” and “blocking”.

## 2. Workflow: How to Use uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance

Follow these practical steps to make the most of uBO Scope’s detailed network data.

### Step 1: Monitor Network Requests on the Target Webpage

- Open the browser and navigate to the webpage you want to analyze.
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- Observe the badge count representing the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- In the popup, note the segregated lists:
  - **Allowed (Not Blocked):** Domains successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with stealth blocking (redirects, blocked invisibly).
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were actively blocked.

### Step 2: Extract Precise Domain and Hostname Data

- Use the popup's domain lists as your primary data source.
- Hover over or copy domain names along with their request counts.
- Save or record these details as a baseline to compare changes after filter rule updates.

### Step 3: Validate Filter Rule Changes

- Implement or adjust filter rules, either manually or through filter list updates.
- Reload the page and reopen uBO Scope popup.
- Compare the new connection data against your baseline.
- Verify that expected third-party domains are indeed blocked or allowed per your rules.

### Step 4: Investigate Unexpected Connections

- If allowed domains appear unexpectedly, consider whether the filter rules are missing or incorrectly scoped.
- Use detailed hostname data (when available) to identify subdomains or resources that bypass your filters.
- Refine your rules to cover these more granular cases.

## 3. Best Practices

### Granular Domain Analysis
When possible, focus on hostnames and subdomains rather than just base domains. This helps:
- Identify specific services or trackers that may not be obvious.
- Tailor rules to minimize collateral blocking of legitimate content.

### Capture and Compare Data Over Multiple Sessions
Network behavior can vary based on user interaction or page state. Repeat inspections to:
- Detect stealth blocking and redirects that may appear intermittently.
- Confirm consistent blocking performance of your filter list.

### Consider Environment Limitations
On platforms or devices where developer tools or advanced browser debugging is unavailable, uBO Scope’s popup becomes essential. Use it as your primary diagnostic and validation tool.

### Use the Public Suffix List Awareness
uBO Scope integrates the Public Suffix List (PSL) to accurately identify domain boundaries. When writing filters:
- Leverage PSL knowledge to avoid blocking entire effective top-level domains unnecessarily.
- Target more specific eTLD+1 or subdomains, improving rule precision.

## 4. Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Identifying a Third-Party Tracker Hostname

While testing a shopping website, you notice unexpected connections to `ads.examplecdn.net` in the "Allowed" section.

**Action:**
- Note the hostname and domain.
- Create a filter rule targeting `||examplecdn.net^` or specifically `||ads.examplecdn.net^` to block it.
- Reload and verify with uBO Scope that the domain moves to "Blocked".

### Example 2: Detecting Stealth Blocking Interference

If you see a domain listed under "Stealth-Blocked" unexpectedly, it may indicate a redirect or stealth technique bypassing normal blocking checks.

**Action:**
- Use this insight to review or tighten filter rules.
- Confirm filtering by re-inspecting the domain status in the popup.

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Domains Appear in the Popup
- Ensure uBO Scope extension is active and properly loaded.
- Confirm the webRequest API permissions are granted in your browser.
- Reload the webpage and popup.

### Issue: Badge Count Does Not Reflect Expected Number
- Some network requests may be blocked by content blockers or DNS before the browser registers them.
- Check that the extension is allowed to monitor all network requests.
- Review filter rules for false positives or conflicts.

### Issue: Limited Domain Details in Restricted Environments
- When detailed hostname info is missing due to browser or platform restrictions, use aggregated domain counts as a proxy metric.
- Supplement data with manual network inspection when possible.

## 6. Tips for Effective Filter List Maintenance

- Regularly review connection data using uBO Scope during filter list development.
- Use domain counts and hostnames from the popup to measure filter impacts objectively.
- Prioritize minimizing allowed domains from tracking or advertising services.
- Combine insights from stealth and blocked categories to handle evasive techniques.

- Dive into the [Interpreting the Popup Panel](https://example.com/guides/getting-started/understanding-popup) guide to deepen your understanding of the uBO Scope interface.
- Check [Comparing Content Blockers Factually](https://example.com/guides/advanced-usage/analyzing-content-blockers) for broader insights on filter performance measurement.
- Refer to [Troubleshooting Common Issues](https://example.com/getting-started/first-use-and-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues) for resolving setup and inspection problems.

<u>Pro Tip:</u> Continually validate your filter rules in real browsing scenarios, leveraging uBO Scope’s transparent third-party domain reporting to maintain accuracy and minimize user disruption.
