# Best Practices: Avoiding Badge Count Pitfalls

## Understanding Badge Counts in uBO Scope

When using uBO Scope, the badge count displayed on the browser toolbar icon represents the number of **distinct third-party remote domains that your browser connected to successfully during the active tab's session**. A lower badge count generally indicates better privacy and fewer third-party connections.

However, **this count does not reflect how many network requests were blocked or allowed in total**, and it should never be used as a sole benchmark to compare the effectiveness of content blockers.

### Why Badge Counts Can Be Misleading

Many users mistakenly believe that a high block count or high badge count directly implies better blocking performance. That assumption is flawed because:

- A **higher block count can mean that more requests were made overall**, indicating possibly poorer filtering.
- A **higher badge count means more distinct third-party domains were connected to**, which usually means more exposure, not less.
- Some content blockers may allow connections to more third-party domains while blocking fewer requests, resulting in lower block counts but worse overall privacy.
- Conversely, stealth-blocking measures may prevent certain requests from appearing, misleading external "ad blocker test" sites that don't reflect real-world connection behavior.

## Leveraging uBO Scope with Best Practices

### Use uBO Scope's Badge Count as a Transparency Tool

Think of the badge count as a **measure of third-party exposure** rather than just a measure of blocking success. It tells you how many distinct remote domains were actually connected to, including those blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed.

This enables you to:

- Identify unexpected third-party connections.
- Diagnose privacy leaks beyond simple block counters.
- Verify that a content blocker isn't silently allowing numerous third parties.

### Understand the Three Outcome Categories

In the popup panel, uBO Scope shows domains grouped under:

- **Allowed:** Domains that were connected to and not blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections silently dropped or redirected without alerting the webpage.
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked with errors.

Focus on these actionable categories rather than just the block count badge to understand network behavior.

### Avoid Misleading Benchmarks

Many "ad blocker test" webpages simulate unrealistic network request patterns that do not match real browsing or content blocking behavior.

- uBO Scope helps debunk the fallacy that better blockers show higher block counts on these pages.
- Instead, evaluate content blockers based on actual third-party exposure revealed by uBO Scope.

### Focus on Meaningful Metrics

The combination of badge counts and breakdown in the popup helps you derive reliable conclusions about your browsing privacy.

- Use the **distinct third-party domain count (badge)** as your primary indicator.
- Use the **popup sections** to investigate who is allowed, blocked, or silent-stealth blocked.
- Avoid using block counts or badge counts in isolation.

## Practical Tips to Avoid Pitfalls

- **Regularly check the popup panel** for the domains your browser connects to per tab.
- **Do not compare badge counts across different content blockers** without understanding the underlying connections.
- **Verify the presence of stealth-blocked entries** in the popup as they affect privacy but may not appear in block counts.
- **Focus on the third-party domains, not just request counts.**

## Summary

By understanding uBO Scope's badge count meaning and focusing on actionable metrics like allowed, stealth, and blocked domains, you avoid common misconceptions and get a realistic view of your privacy posture in everyday browsing.

## Step-by-Step: Best Practice Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Activate the toolbar icon to open the popup panel for the active tab.
  - Outcome: Popup loads and displays network connection summary.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Badge Count Meaning">
Understand the badge count as the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
  - Tip: Lower is better for privacy.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Popup Domain Sections">
Analyze the allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domain lists.
  - Action: Look for unexpected third parties or stealth-blocked domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Avoid Relying on Block Counts or External Tests">
Do not base blocker comparisons on external "ad blocker test" sites or block count badges alone.
  - Outcome: Realistic understanding of third-party exposure.
</Step>
<Step title="Use uBO Scope for Ongoing Monitoring">
Repeatedly use uBO Scope during real browsing to track changes in third-party domains.
  - Success: Confident insights into actual blocking effectiveness.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

<AccordionGroup title="Common Pitfalls in Understanding Badge Counts">
<Accordion title="Mistake: Higher Block Count Means Better Blocking">
Counterintuitive but true: a blocker that blocks more requests could be allowing connections to more domains — increasing overall exposure. Use badge count and domain analysis to verify.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mistake: "Ad Blocker Test" Sites Reflect Real Blocking">
Many test sites use fabricated requests not representative of real-world browsing. uBO Scope’s data from actual network traffic provides more reliable insight.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mistake: Stealth Blocking Doesn’t Affect Privacy"
Stealth blocking silently prevents requests without alerts. These do reduce exposure but may not increase badge or block counts, making popup inspection crucial.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips & Best Practices

<Tip>
Regularly clear session data or reload pages with uBO Scope open to refresh connection insights.
</Tip>
<Tip>
Focus on domains at the "registered domain" level for meaningful grouping, enabled by uBO Scope's use of the Public Suffix List.
</Tip>
<Tip>
Remember that uBO Scope tracks actual network requests reported by the browser, so requests outside browser awareness are not counted.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Badge Count Confusion">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Shows Zero Despite Blocking">
Check your browser version supports `webRequest` API fully.
Verify permissions granted during installation.
Ensure you are viewing the active tab with recorded connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpectedly High Badge Count">
Review the popup domain lists.
Look for stealth-blocked or allowed domains increasing counts.
Check if other extensions or DNS filtering bypass are influencing results.
</Accordion>
