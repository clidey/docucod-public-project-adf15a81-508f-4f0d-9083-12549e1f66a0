# Using uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance

## Overview

This guide is designed specifically for filter list maintainers who need to analyze and validate content blocking effectiveness using uBO Scope. It addresses the challenges encountered on devices or browsers where traditional developer tools have limited visibility, offering a practical method to leverage uBO Scope's connection logs for auditing filter efficacy and understanding network requests.

### What You Will Achieve

- Analyze network connection logs categorized by allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains
- Validate the efficacy of specific filters by observing network request outcomes
- Use detailed domain and request data to identify unexpected connections or filtering gaps
- Compensate for limitations of browser developer tools by using uBO Scope’s transparency

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and enabled on a compatible browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Basic familiarity with filter lists and content blocking terminology
- Familiarity with browsing sessions relevant to your filter list

### Time Estimate

Approximately 15 to 30 minutes to perform an initial audit and interpretation of data for a given webpage or browsing session.

### Difficulty Level

Intermediate — geared towards maintainers with some background in browser extensions and filtering.

## How to Use uBO Scope in Filter List Maintenance

### Step 1: Open the uBO Scope Popup on the Target Webpage

1. Navigate to the webpage you want to audit.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
3. The popup will display various network connection details for the active tab.

*Outcome*: You will see the hostname of the tab, the count of connected third-party domains, and three categorized sections:

- **Not blocked (Allowed)**
- **Stealth-blocked**
- **Blocked**

These categories reflect how network requests to different domains were handled by your filter list and content blockers.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Categories to Assess Filter Effectiveness

- Review the **Allowed** domains: These are third-party domains from which resources were fetched successfully.
- Review the **Stealth-blocked** domains: These represent requests that were blocked by stealthy methods (e.g., via internal redirects) not visible as an explicit block.
- Review the **Blocked** domains: These requests were explicitly denied.

*Tip*: Pay attention to unexpected allowed domains, which may indicate gaps in filtering rules.

---

### Step 3: Utilize Domain and Request Details

- Note the frequency of requests for each domain (shown as counts in the popup).
- Use this frequency to prioritize investigation into domains that appear frequently but might not be blocked.
- Consider domain names carefully, especially subdomains and related hostnames, to detect unwanted trackers or servers.

*Best Practice*: Export or manually record suspicious domains for filter list updates.

---

### Step 4: Validate Updates and Monitor Outcomes

- After editing your filter list, reload the webpage and open the uBO Scope popup.
- Confirm that the previously allowed unwanted domains are now listed as blocked or stealth-blocked.
- Repeat audits on multiple webpages/sites to verify consistent filter performance.

*Check*: Ensure that your blocking changes do not cause legitimate content to fail loading unexpectedly.

## Practical Tips for Filter List Maintainers

- **Use uBO Scope alongside traditional browser DevTools**: uBO Scope fills visibility gaps where network requests are hidden or obfuscated.
- **Understand stealth blocking**: Stealth blocks might not appear as classical blocked requests but should be recognized and considered when assessing filter performance.
- **Do not rely solely on block counts**: High block counts do not necessarily mean better privacy; focus on domains allowed through.

<Note>
Remember that uBO Scope tracks all connection attempts seen by the browser, independent of the content blocker in use.
</Note>

- **Iterative approach**: Filter list maintenance is a cycle — continuous auditing and updating is essential.
- **Use the domain count as a privacy metric**: Fewer allowed third-party domains generally increase browsing privacy.
- **Be wary of wildcard or generic allowances**: Sometimes broad rules let in unintended domains under a permitted domain.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### 1. Missing Data in Popup

If the uBO Scope popup shows no data or loads slowly:
- Ensure the extension has the required permissions.
- Refresh the page and try reopening the popup.
- Verify that your browser version supports all uBO Scope features.

### 2. Unexpected Allowed Domains

- Check if filters matching those domains have correct syntax.
- Confirm no exceptions or whitelisting rules are overriding blocks.
- Some allowed domains may belong to Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) essential for page functionality.

### 3. Stealth Blocking Confusion

- Stealth blocks can be confused with allowed domains since they don’t always appear as blocked.
- Use the popup’s stealth section to identify such domains and adjust filters accordingly.

### 4. Browser Limitations

- Some browsers restrict visibility of all network requests due to privacy or API constraints; uBO Scope depends on `webRequest` API visibility.
- If using Firefox, ensure it is version 128 or higher for full feature support.

<Warning>
Accurate auditing requires uBO Scope’s features to be fully functional; always confirm installation validation first.
See the documentation on [Validating Your Installation](/getting-started/first-use-and-troubleshooting/validating-installation) for detailed steps.
</Warning>

## Example Use Case: Auditing a Popular News Site

1. Open the news site in your browser with uBO Scope enabled.
2. Open the uBO Scope popup and check the total connected domains.
3. Look for any allowed third-party advertising or tracking domains.
4. Record these domains for inclusion in your filter list.
5. After updating the filter list, reload and reassess to see if those domains that previously appeared as allowed have moved to blocked or stealth-blocked.

## Summary

uBO Scope empowers filter list maintainers by providing transparent, detailed insights into all third-party connections, including those that are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked. It bridges visibility gaps caused by browser tool limitations, enabling effective filter validation and refinement.

Use the categorized connection data and request frequency counts to identify filtering gaps, confirm blocking behavior, and iteratively improve your filter lists on real-world browsing scenarios.
