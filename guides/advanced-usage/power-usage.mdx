# Best Practices for Power Users and Filter List Maintainers

## Overview
This guide empowers seasoned users and filter list maintainers to perform deeper, more effective analysis using uBO Scope. You will learn how to track detailed network request outcomes, identify stealth blocking behavior, and leverage session data for ongoing monitoring and debugging. These practices unlock the full potential of uBO Scope for privacy investigations and filter list refinement.

---

## 1. Preparing for Advanced Analysis

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and activated in your browser.
- Basic familiarity with the popup interface and the meaning of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Access to developer tools or browser debugging consoles for occasional troubleshooting.

### Expected Outcome
After completing this guide, you will:
- Understand how uBO Scope records and categorizes network request outcomes.
- Recognize the significance of stealth blocking and how to detect it.
- Utilize session data stored by uBO Scope to analyze historical data and refine filter lists.

### Time Commitment
Approximately 20-30 minutes to read, practice, and familiarize with advanced usage.

## 2. Understanding Network Request Outcomes in Depth

uBO Scope classifies remote server connections into three distinct categories:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked)**: Connections successfully established without blocking.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Requests that were redirected or silently blocked, often to avoid detection by the page.
- **Blocked**: Requests clearly blocked due to errors or failures related to content blocking.

### Why This Matters
Knowing these distinctions helps you audit whether content blockers respect your privacy while minimizing site breakage. Stealth blocking indicates more subtle filtering, crucial for detailed filter list maintenance.

### How uBO Scope Tracks Outcomes
- The extension listens for `webRequest` events: redirects, errors, and successful responses.
- It aggregates counts of unique domains contacted per tab, separately for allowed, stealth, and blocked outcomes.
- Badge counts reflect the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.

## 3. Using the Popup Interface for Deeper Investigations

### Step-by-Step Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the extension icon on your browser toolbar while on the target website tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Domain Counts">
Review the domain lists for Allowed, Stealth-blocked, and Blocked categories.

- Each domain shows how many requests matched that domain in the current session.
- The summary at the top indicates total distinct allowed domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify Stealth Blocking">
Pay special attention to the 'stealth-blocked' section.

- Domains here may reflect blocking done to evade detection by the webpage.
- These are often sophisticated trackers or scripts.
</Step>
<Step title="Expand Domain Details">
For filter list maintainers, consider investigating the domain counts over various sessions for patterns.

- High stealth-block counts may guide filter adjustments.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Tips
- Reload the page with the popup open to observe real-time changes.
- Use domain names from the popup as input while curating or debugging filter lists.

## 4. Accessing and Leveraging Session Data

uBO Scope maintains session-specific data about connections per tab stored internally. This persistent data enables:

- Historical analysis of network requests beyond the popup session.
- Export or inspection for debugging filter rules or verifying blocking behavior.

### Locating Session Data
Session data includes mappings of tabs to details with domains grouped by outcome:
- Allowed.domains
- Stealth.domains
- Blocked.domains

This data is serialized and saved within the extension’s session storage.

### Practical Use Cases
- Use session data to compare changes in third-party domains after modifying filters.
- Detect domains that repeatedly appear as stealth-blocked across sessions, highlighting targets for filter updates.
- Correlate stealth domains with known trackers or suspicious services.

## 5. Workflow for Ongoing Monitoring and Filter List Maintenance

1. **Monitor Badge Counts:** Lower allowed domain counts indicate tighter connection control. Notice stealth-blocked domains as hidden blockers.

2. **Collect Data:** Regularly open the popup on target sites and document allowed and stealth domains.

3. **Analyze Patterns:** Identify recurring stealth-blocked domains; research their reputation and filter applicability.

4. **Update Filters:** Incorporate effective blocking rules for stealth domains without impacting site functionality.

5. **Verify Changes:** Reload websites to check if the stealth-blocked counts decrease and allowed domains count remains minimal.

6. **Repeat:** Continuously refine filters based on data-driven evidence from uBO Scope.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Data in Popup or Badge Shows Zero
- Confirm uBO Scope permissions are granted for the tab’s URL.
- Ensure the network requests are not made outside the browser's reported webRequest API scope.
- Verify the extension is enabled and the popup was opened after page load.

### Misinterpretation of Stealth Blocking
- Stealth blocking does not mean failure but silent intervention.
- Do not conflate stealth-blocked domains with allowed; each has a specific meaning.

### Data Persistence Problems
- Session data resets on browser restart or tab closure.
- To preserve data, export or manually record observations before navigation.

## 7. Best Practices for Maximizing uBO Scope in Filter List Workflows

- Regularly inspect the popup on multiple sites to gather diverse domain samples.
- Use the Public Suffix List (integrated internally) to accurately aggregate domains at the effective registrable level.
- Document and timestamp findings to track filter adjustments over time.
- Share discovered stealth domains with filter list communities to enhance collective blocking effectiveness.
