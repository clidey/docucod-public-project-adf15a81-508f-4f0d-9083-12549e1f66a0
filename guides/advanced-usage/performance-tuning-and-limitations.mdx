# Performance Tips and Limitations

## Overview
uBO-Scope is designed to deliver real-time, transparent insights into browser network connections with a lightweight footprint. This guide provides practical advice to keep uBO-Scope responsive and explains the inherent technical limitations that may affect what it reports. Understanding these aspects will help you get the best possible user experience and accurate information from the extension.

---

## Why Performance Matters

Every network connection your browser attempts is tracked by uBO-Scope using the browser's `webRequest` API. High volumes of network requests or complex browser environments can challenge this process, potentially slowing the extension or causing incomplete data capture. Being aware of performance considerations ensures uBO-Scope remains a smooth, reliable tool.

---

## Key Factors Impacting Performance

### 1. Volume of Network Requests

- Browsing websites with many third-party resources (ads, trackers, analytics) causes uBO-Scope to process more requests, which can increase CPU and memory usage.
- Excessive numbers of connections may lead to lag in updating the toolbar badge or popup UI.

### 2. Browser Limitations and API Behavior

- Different browsers expose different capabilities and performance characteristics for the `webRequest` API.
- Service workers (used in Chromium) powering the background script may be suspended to save resources, causing brief delays in processing network events.

### 3. System Resources

- uBO-Scope relies on your browser and system resources; limited CPU, memory, or other restrictions may reduce performance.

### 4. Third-party or System-level Blocking

- Content blocking done outside of the browserâ€™s `webRequest` API visibility (e.g., DNS-level blockers, VPN filters) will not be reported or may be inaccurately reflected.
- When external blockers interfere with requests, uBO-Scope may not detect the precise outcome.

## Practical Tips to Maintain Responsiveness

### Pin and Keep uBO-Scope Accessible
Ensure the extension icon is pinned and easily accessible to quickly open the popup UI, which loads and displays connection data on demand rather than continuously.

### Limit Browser Tabs and Background Activity
Reducing the number of simultaneously open tabs or background processes can help maintain uBO-Scope's responsiveness, especially on less powerful devices.

### Understand Badge Count Updates
- Badge counts update approximately every second, reflecting distinct allowed third-party domains.
- Be patient with short bursts of activity or heavy workloads, as badge updates may lag slightly.

### Avoid Excessive Customization or Debug Filters
Adding complex custom rules or debugging filters on your browsing environment might increase network traffic and complexity, which can make uBO-Scope work harder.

### Use Latest Browser Versions
Keep your browser updated to the latest stable version to benefit from performance improvements and better `webRequest` API support relevant to uBO-Scope.

---

## Known Limitations

### a) Incomplete Visibility of All Network Requests

- uBO-Scope only has access to network requests visible to the browser's `webRequest` API.
- Requests initiated by browser internals or extensions outside this API's scope are not reported.

### b) Network Request Timing

- Due to asynchronous processing and batching, some network request outcomes might display with slight delays.

### c) Impact of Other Extensions

- When other content blockers or security extensions modify, block, or redirect traffic at different stages, some requests seen by uBO-Scope may not reflect their final actual state.

### d) System or Network Level Blocks

- DNS-based or system firewall blocks are generally invisible to the browser and thus not reported in uBO-Scope.

### e) Service Worker Suspension

- In Chromium-based browsers, background service workers can be temporarily suspended, causing brief pauses in data processing.

### f) Domain Parsing and Unicode Handling

- uBO-Scope relies on an embedded public suffix list and punycode conversion to interpret domains and hostnames.
- Edge cases in domain parsing are rare but possible, especially with newly introduced or private domain suffixes.

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Performance Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Popup UI Loads Slowly or Freezes">
- Close and reopen the popup.
- Restart the browser if the problem persists.
- Avoid opening the popup on tabs with extremely high network request counts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating Frequently">
- Confirm uBO-Scope has required permissions.
- Check if other content blockers interfere with the extension.
- Ensure your browser's extension background process is not suspended often (common in Chromium).
- Restart the browser or update to the latest version.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Network Requests or Blocks Not Reflected">
- Remember uBO-Scope only tracks requests visible through the browser's network API.
- External blockers like VPNs or system firewall rules may block requests silently.
- Consider temporarily disabling conflicting extensions to isolate behavior.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices for Optimal Use

- Use uBO-Scope primarily as a monitoring tool rather than a real-time blocker.
- Prefer lightweight browsing sessions when using it to keep data processing manageable.
- Regularly revisit the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](https://example.com/getting-started/essentials/troubleshooting) guide if you notice anomalies.
- Pair uBO-Scope with your preferred content blocker for blocking, and reserve uBO-Scope for transparency and analysis.
