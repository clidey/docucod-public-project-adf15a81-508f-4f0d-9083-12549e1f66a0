# Comparing Content Blockers Factually with uBO Scope

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you leverage uBO Scope to accurately measure how effectively different content blockers reduce third-party network connections. By focusing on the distinct domains contacted during browsing sessions rather than raw block counts from blockers' interfaces, you will learn how to interpret badge counts and identify stealth network requests that other tools may miss.

### Prerequisites
- Have uBO Scope installed and activated following the [Installing uBO Scope](../guides/getting-started/installing-extension.mdx) guide.
- Familiarity with basic network concepts and terminology from [Core Concepts & Terminology](../overview/introduction-core-concepts/core-concepts-terminology.mdx).
- Active content blockers installed (e.g., uBlock Origin, other popular blockers) to compare.
- Open webpages for testing third-party network activity.

### Expected Outcome
- Ability to confidently interpret uBO Scope's badge counts and popup panel to assess real third-party exposure.
- Capability to detect stealthily blocked or allowed requests.
- Avoidance of common benchmarking pitfalls, leading to meaningful insights on a blocker’s reliability.

### Time Estimate
About 10–15 minutes for typical setup and initial content blocker comparison exercises.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate: requires basic understanding of browser network behavior and content blocking.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Understand What uBO Scope Measures
- uBO Scope counts **distinct third-party domains** contacted by your active browser tab, regardless of the content blocker in use.
- The toolbar badge shows the number of these distinct allowed third-party domains.
- It classifies network requests into three outcomes:
  - **Allowed:** Requests that successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Requests blocked stealthily by blockers to avoid detection.
  - **Blocked:** Requests that failed due to filtering or errors.

### 2. Prepare Testing Environment
- Install uBO Scope and your target content blockers.
- Confirm uBO Scope is active by verifying the toolbar badge appears and updates when browsing.
- Open browser tabs with webpages known to trigger third-party connections (for example, news sites or popular blogs).

### 3. Inspect Real-Time Domain Connection Data
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel.
- Review the **domains connected** count at the top — this reflects how many distinct third-party domains the tab contacted.
- Check the **Allowed** section: these are domains from which your browser fetched resources.
- Examine the **Stealth-blocked** and **Blocked** sections: these indicate network requests your content blockers prevented but classified differently.

### 4. Interpret Badge Counts Correctly
- A lower badge count means fewer third-party domains were contacted, indicating better blocking effectiveness.
- Do not confuse block counts reported by content blockers with uBO Scope’s badge — they represent different metrics.
- High block counts on some blockers can coexist with a higher number of allowed connections, meaning the blocker blocks many requests but still allows more distinct third parties.

### 5. Detect Stealth Blocking
- Stealth-blocked domains reveal when blockers silently prevent connections without causing webpage breakage or detectable failures.
- Comparing stealth lists helps identify blockers’ subtle behaviors often missed by conventional tests.

### 6. Avoid Benchmarking Pitfalls
- Do not rely on “ad blocker test” websites for evaluation; these tests often use artificial scenarios that do not reflect real-world browsing.
- Focus on actual browsing sessions and observe uBO Scope’s domain connection data.
- Understand that differences in stealth blocking and allowed domain counts paint a more accurate picture.

### 7. Comparative Testing Workflow
- Browse the same websites with different content blockers active while monitoring uBO Scope’s popup.
- Note badge counts and domain lists for each blocker.
- Look for unexpectedly high allowed domain counts or stealth-blocked domains.
- Use this data to make informed conclusions on which blocker truly limits third-party exposure.

### 8. Verify Your Observations
- Confirm that the badge count matches the number of allowed distinct domains in the popup.
- If numbers seem inconsistent or no data appears, see [Validating Functionality](../getting-started/first-use-and-validation/validating-functionality.mdx).

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Keep the uBO Scope popup open during navigation to watch real-time updates in domain connections.
- Refresh pages after changing blocker configurations to observe differences clearly.
- Use browser’s developer tools in parallel to cross-check network requests if desired.
- Understand that some legitimate services (like CDNs) will show in allowed domains; context matters when judging counts.
- Regularly update your blockers and uBO Scope to ensure accurate reporting.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="No Badge or No Data in Popup">
- Ensure the extension is enabled and pinned in the toolbar.
- Confirm page reload after installing or enabling the extension.
- Check permissions and browser compatibility ([Prerequisites and System Requirements](../getting-started/setup-and-installation/prerequisites-and-requirements.mdx)).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Not Updating as Expected">
- Network requests may not be reported if blocked outside the webRequest API’s visibility.
- Some browsers (especially with privacy modes) restrict network event tracking.
- Try restarting the browser or reinstalling the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Stealth or Blocked Domains">
- Stealth blocking might be aggressive depending on blocker settings.
- Review your content blocker’s configuration for advanced stealth options.
</Accordion>

## Examples

### Example: Inspecting a News Website
1. Visit a popular news site.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
3. See the badge count: e.g., "5" indicating 5 distinct third-party domains allowed.
4. In the popup:
   - Allowed section lists domains like `cdn.example.com` (count 10 requests).
   - Stealth-blocked section lists `tracker.example.net` (count 1).
   - Blocked section may list analytics domains.
5. Repeat with different blockers enabled to compare results.

### Interpretation
- Lower allowed domain count means fewer third-party connections.
- Presence of stealth-blocked domains signals stealth filtering activity.
- Use this data to objectively rate blocker effectiveness on real browsing.

## Next Steps & Further Reading

- Read [Interpreting the Popup Panel](../guides/getting-started/understanding-popup.mdx) to deepen understanding of popup data.
- Use [Your First Network Inspection](../guides/getting-started/first-network-inspection.mdx) for hands-on exercises.
- Explore [Validating Functionality](../getting-started/first-use-and-validation/validating-functionality.mdx) to confirm your setup.
- Consult [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../getting-started/first-use-and-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues.mdx) if problems arise.

## Summary
uBO Scope helps you move beyond simplistic block counts by providing reliable, real-world visibility into third-party network connections your browser makes. By correctly interpreting badge counts, allowed domains, and stealth blocking, you can factually compare content blockers' true effectiveness and avoid misleading benchmarks.
