# Best Practices for Filter List Maintainers

## Overview
This guide is designed specifically for filter list maintainers who utilize **uBO-Scope** to audit filter effectiveness on devices with restricted capabilities or limited browsing environments. Learn how to efficiently use uBO-Scope’s popup UI to assess which network requests are blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed, even when developer tools are unavailable or limited.

By leveraging uBO-Scope’s clear categorization and domain aggregation, you can identify unnecessary network activity, refine filter lists, and ensure your rules provide maximum privacy and performance benefits.

## Why uBO-Scope for Filter List Maintainers?
Filter list maintainers often need to validate effectiveness of their rules in constrained setups where browser dev tools cannot be accessed or on locked-down devices. uBO-Scope fills this niche by delivering:

- **Real-time visibility** into network requests categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- **Domain-level aggregation** with request counts for efficient auditing.
- **Lightweight, browser extension UI** that works even without complex dev tools.

This makes it an essential auditing tool for quickly spotting inefficiencies and verifying filter performance without a heavy setup.

---

## Prerequisites

- uBO-Scope installed on a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari). See [Installation Across Browsers](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/getting-started/essentials/installation.mdx).
- Basic understanding of filter list concepts and how they impact network traffic.
- Access to the device where you want to evaluate network requests.

## Using the uBO-Scope Popup for Auditing Filters

### 1. Opening the uBO-Scope Popup
- Click the uBO-Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar.
- The popup will load data for the active browser tab.

### 2. Understanding the Popup UI
The popup displays three primary sections:

- **Not Blocked (`allowed`)**: Domains that allowed network requests go through.
- **Stealth-blocked (`stealth`)**: Domains whose requests were redirected or stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked (`blocked`)**: Domains whose requests were explicitly blocked.

Each section lists domains with counts showing how many requests were observed per domain.

The header shows the current tab's hostname and the total number of distinct connected domains.

---

### 3. Auditing Network Requests

#### Step 1: Review Domains in Each Category
- Start with **Allowed Domains**. Excessive domains here may indicate underblocking or unwanted leakage.
- Check **Stealth-blocked Domains**. These are attempts redirected stealthily and worth inspecting for unexpected behavior.
- Confirm **Blocked Domains** included all intended trackers and ad networks.

#### Step 2: Identify Unnecessary Requests
- Domains in allowed or stealth-blocked lists that should be blocked can signal missing or incomplete rules.
- Domains in the blocked list that see very few or no requests may be candidates for cleanup.

#### Step 3: Prioritize Domains for Filter Updates
- Focus on high-count domains to maximize impact.
- Use domain names in the lists as targets for new or refined filter rules.

## Practical Tips for Efficient Auditing

- **Use Domain Aggregation**: uBO-Scope aggregates at domain level using the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/). This groups requests under registrable domains (e.g., example.com instead of tracking.example.com), facilitating focused auditing.

- **Interpret Counts with Context**: High counts can mean frequent requests but also could be due to legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs). Use user knowledge to distinguish benign domains from trackers.

- **Focus on Stealth-blocked Domains**: These indicate requests silently redirected or blocked without a visible indication. These can sometimes bypass typical blocking logic.

- **Iterative Refinement**: Regularly audit with uBO-Scope to catch regressions or new domains introduced by websites.

- **Cross-device Consistency**: Use uBO-Scope on multiple devices/environments, especially locked-down ones, ensuring filter reliability across setups.

## Example Scenario: Auditing a News Website
1. Open a news website in your browser.
2. Click the uBO-Scope icon to open the popup.
3. Observe that the allowed domains list includes benign-looking domains and a few suspicious ad-network domains.
4. Note a stealth-blocked domain that is a known tracking service.
5. Add specific filters in your list targeting these request patterns.
6. Reload the page, reopen the popup, and verify the changes in domain counts.
7. Confirm that stealth-blocked and blocked lists reflect expected results and allowed domains only include necessary domains.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Guide">
<Accordion title="The Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or is Empty">
- Ensure you have an active tab with network activity.
- Refresh the tab to generate network requests.
- Wait a moment for the extension to gather data.
- Verify the extension has necessary permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Counts Do Not Update After Navigating Tabs">
- Close and reopen the popup to refresh data.
- Wait for approximately 1 second for background processing.
- Ensure uBO-Scope extension is enabled and not blocked by browser settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domains Appear Unexpectedly in Allowed List">
- Confirm if these are legitimate third-party CDNs rather than trackers.
- Cross-reference with filter list entries.
- Consider adding more specific blocking rules cautiously.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices Summary
- Use uBO-Scope as a quick auditing tool to review network request classifications.
- Leverage domain aggregation for simpler, impactful filter tuning.
- Focus audits around stealth-blocked and frequently allowed domains.
- Apply regular iterative testing and refinement.
- Remember uBO-Scope complements, not replaces, full-fledged browser dev tools.

## Appendix: Technical Background Relevant to Maintainers

### Domain Aggregation Logic
The uBO-Scope extension uses the Public Suffix List (PSL) to determine the registrable domain from a hostname. This method groups network requests from multiple subdomains into one logical domain bucket.

Example:
- Hostnames: `tracking.example.com`, `cdn.example.com`
- Registered domain: `example.com`

This allows maintainers to see domain-wide request counts rather than being overwhelmed by many subdomains.

### Categorization of Requests
- **Allowed**: Requests that were permitted and reached their destination.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Requests that were stealthily blocked via redirects or silent interference.
- **Blocked**: Requests explicitly blocked by content blocking rules.

Understanding these distinctions guides filter refinement to target problematic requests without overblocking.
