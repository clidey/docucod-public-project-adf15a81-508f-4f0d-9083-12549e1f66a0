# Using uBO Scope for Filter List Maintenance

uBO Scope offers unique capabilities designed to assist filter list maintainers, advanced testers, and privacy champions in evaluating how well a filter list performs in a real browsing environment. By providing transparent insights into all remote server connections—including those stealth-blocked by clever filtering techniques—this guide will equip you to make informed decisions about filter quality and effectiveness.

## 1. Understanding the Role of uBO Scope in Filter Maintenance

### What Filter List Maintainers Need
A filter list maintainer aims to ensure that their list:
- Blocks unwanted or malicious third-party connections effectively.
- Minimizes false positives that break legitimate website functionality.
- Transparently reveals what domains are truly allowed or blocked.

### How uBO Scope Supports This
Unlike traditional blockers focused solely on blocking, uBO Scope reports the outcome of every network request:
- **Allowed connections:** Resources that passed through the filter.
- **Blocked connections:** Explicitly prevented by the filter.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Requests that were canceled or redirected quietly without breaking site functionality.

This tripartite reporting enables maintainers to detect subtle stealth-blocking behaviors that might not be evident from traditional tests.

<Tip>
Filter list maintainers can use uBO Scope alongside their usual blocking tools to clearly identify how rules impact network requests beyond just block counts.

## 2. Working With the uBO Scope Popup Panel

The popup panel offers a real-time window into all network requests for the active tab, categorizing domains based on connection outcomes.

### Step-by-Step Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup panel for the current tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Read the Header Domain Information">
At the top, the hostname and domain of the active tab are displayed.

This confirms you're viewing the correct tab's connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine the Domain Counts Summary">
The "domains connected" summary shows the total distinct third-party domains connected.

A smaller number usually means tighter filter control.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Each Connection Category">
Inspect the three main sections:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains that the filter allowed.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains for which requests were canceled or redirected silently.
- **Blocked:** Domains explicitly denied by the filter.

Each domain line shows the hostname and the count of requests observed.
</Step>
</Steps>

### How to Use This Information
- **High counts in stealth-blocked:** Suggests subtle blocking tactics that preserve site stability.
- **Unexpected allowed domains:** Could indicate gaps in the filter needing patching.
- **Blocked domains impacting functionality:** Might signal over-aggressive blocking.

## 3. Identifying Stealth Domains and Their Significance

Stealth-blocking often involves cancelling a request or causing silent redirects to prevent resource loading without triggering site-breakage or detection.

### Why Spotting Stealth Domains Matters
- These domains may evade some traditional block reporting.
- Excess stealth-blocked domains might indicate hidden tracking vectors.
- For maintainers, detecting stealth-blocking helps refine rules that balance privacy and usability.

### Finding Stealth Domains
- Use the "stealth-blocked" section of the popup.
- Domains here are denied connections but without noisy failures.

### Example Scenario
Suppose your filter silently redirects connections to certain ad servers so the site continues to work but the ads are blocked. uBO Scope will list these under stealth-blocked, allowing you to verify intended stealth behavior.

## 4. Monitoring Network Requests on Restricted or Mobile Platforms

### Challenge
Some platforms restrict browser tooling or have limited debugging capabilities, making filter testing difficult.

### uBO Scope Advantage
- Runs as an extension reporting directly via the browser's `webRequest` API.
- Offers detailed reporting even when traditional developer tools or network inspectors are unavailable.
- Helps maintainers and testers validate filter efficacy remotely or on platforms with constrained environments.

<Note>
Availability depends on the browser implementing `webRequest`. Some mobile or special-purpose browsers might limit this capability.
</Note>

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices for Maintainers

### Use uBO Scope as a Companion Tool
- Combine with your filter editor and test pages to see real-time effects of your rule changes.
- Observe popup domain lists while driving the filter under normal browsing.

### Regularly Check Stealth vs Blocked Counts
- A sudden surge of stealth domains may indicate newly introduced evasion techniques.
- An increase in allowed third-party domains can be a sign to update filter syntax or scope.

### Leverage the Public Suffix and Domain Grouping
uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List, so it aggregates counts at the registered domain level. This helps identify root organizations behind connections:

- When a high number of hostnames appear under a single domain, consider if blocking the whole domain is appropriate.

### Troubleshoot Unexpected Results
- If you see zero counts, verify permissions and browser compatibility (consult troubleshooting guides).
- Use the popup on various pages to differentiate noise from meaningful blocking gaps.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Misinterpreting badge counts:** The count reflects allowed third-party domains, so a higher count does not always mean worse privacy.
- **Ignoring stealth-blocked domains:** These are often invisible in other tools but critical for understanding filter impact.
- **Assuming filter is perfect from block counts only:** Use uBO Scope’s holistic view to catch subtleties.

## 7. Example: Using uBO Scope to Test a New Filter Rule

Suppose you are adding a new blocking rule targeting `tracker.example.com`. Follow this process:

1. Open a webpage that normally loads content from `tracker.example.com`.
2. Open uBO Scope popup to observe the "blocked" and "stealth-blocked" sections.
3. Enable your new filter rule in your list.
4. Reload the page.
5. Confirm if `tracker.example.com` moves from "allowed" to "blocked" or "stealth-blocked".
6. Check the popup domains and counts to ensure no unintended blocking of legitimate domains occurred.

## 9. Troubleshooting for Filter List Maintainers

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Best Practices">
<Accordion title="Zero or Unexpected Badge Count">
If the badge count is zero or inconsistent:
- Ensure uBO Scope is installed correctly and permissions granted.
- Confirm the browser version supports `webRequest` API needed for monitoring.
- Test with pages known to initiate connections to third-party domains.
- Clear session data or reload the extension if data appears stale.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stealth-Blocked Domains Missing">
If stealth-blocked domains do not appear:
- Confirm your filter rules actually apply stealth-blocking tactics (redirects or cancellations).
- Some network requests might not surface if blocked by other means (e.g., DNS-level blocking outside browser).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Not Seeing Expected Domain Changes After Filter Update">
- After updating filters, reload tabs fully to refresh connection states.
- Check for filter syntax errors or rule conflicts.
- Use uBO Scope popup alongside developer tools to correlate findings.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 10. Summary

Using uBO Scope for filter list maintenance empowers you to: 
- Reveal full network request outcomes.
- Detect subtle stealth-blocking behavior.
- Monitor filter effectiveness in various environments.
- Analyze domain-level connection data via the Public Suffix List.

With systematic use, uBO Scope becomes an indispensable ally in refining your filter list while preserving user experience and maximizing privacy protection.
