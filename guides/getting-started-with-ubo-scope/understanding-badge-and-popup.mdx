# Understanding the Toolbar Badge & Popup

## Overview
This guide walks you through how uBO Scope’s toolbar badge and popup communicate the number and categorization of third-party remote server connections initiated by the webpage open in your current browser tab. You'll learn to interpret the badge count, distinguish between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked servers, and understand what each statistic means for your browsing privacy.

---

## What You Will Achieve
- Understand how the badge count on uBO Scope's toolbar icon reflects unique third-party connections.
- Interpret the detailed statistics displayed in the extension popup for the active tab.
- Confidently differentiate allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains.

---

## How the Toolbar Badge Works

The badge number you see on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon represents the count of unique third-party domains from which network connections have been **allowed** in the current browser tab. This is a count of *distinct domains* — meaning no matter how many requests are made to the same domain, it increments the count only once.

### Why This Count Matters
This count measures your browsing exposure to third-party servers. A **lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, which generally equates to better privacy.**

> **Important:** Not all third-party connections are undesirable — some, such as common Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), may be essential and legitimate.

<u>Example Scenario:</u>
- You load a website.
- The badge shows `5`.
- This means five distinct third-party domains had allowed connections.

### Updating the Badge
The extension continuously monitors network activity in real time. As new allowed connections to distinct third-party domains occur, the badge count updates automatically for your active tab.

---

## Interpreting the Popup Data

Clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon opens the popup panel providing a detailed breakdown of third-party domains involved in the current tab's network activity.

### Popup Sections
The popup divides domains into three categories, each in its own section:

1. **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
2. **Stealth-Blocked**
3. **Blocked**

Each section lists domains with a count showing how many requests were made to them.

### Understanding the Categories
- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** These domains allowed outbound connections successfully. The badge count corresponds directly with the number of such distinct domains.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains for which connection attempts were redirected behind the scenes, without explicit blocking errors. These requests do not show as blocked, but subtly prevented.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts failed with explicit errors—typically blocked by content blockers or network rules.

### Popup View Example
```plaintext
[origins.example.com]

Domains connected: 7

Not Blocked
----------------
cdn.trusted.com       3
analytics.good.com    2

Stealth-Blocked
----------------
adserver.sneaky.com   1

Blocked
----------------
adtracker.evil.com    4
```

This layout allows easy visual assessment to see which third-party domains your browsing session is interacting with and their connection outcomes.

### Domain & Hostname Details
The popup shows domains extracted using the Public Suffix List, stripping down hostnames to their most significant sites for clarity. This enables you to see distinct third-party entities instead of every subdomain.

## Step-by-Step: Using the Badge and Popup

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon">
Find the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. It displays a badge number if there are allowed third-party connections in the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Badge Number">
Understand the badge number as the count of distinct allowed third-party domains connected to by the page.
- No badge number means zero allowed third-party connections detected.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup for Details">
Click the toolbar icon to open the popup.
- The popup shows detailed statistics and domains grouped by connection outcome.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the 'Not Blocked' Section">
This section lists domains with allowed connections, along with how many requests were made to each.
</Step>
<Step title="Check the 'Stealth-Blocked' and 'Blocked' Sections">
See which domains had requests stealth-blocked or explicitly blocked. These entries explain hidden or failed network attempts.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Verify that the badge number matches the count of distinct domains in the "Not Blocked" section. Discrepancies indicate either stale data or network activity in progress.
</Check>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Understand the badge as your privacy barometer.** A higher allowed count increases your exposure to third parties.
- **Use the popup to investigate suspicious domains.** Stealth-blocked or blocked domains might indicate trackers or unwanted connections.
- **Remember that subdomains are grouped under their main domain.** This simplifies analysis and avoids double counting.
- **Refresh the tab or navigate to a new page** to reset and accurately observe connection changes.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Badge and Popup Issues">
<Accordion title="Badge Does Not Show a Number">
Possible causes:
- There are no allowed third-party connections in the current tab.
- Extension permissions are not correctly granted or are restricted.

Resolution:
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and has necessary permissions.
- Reload the tab or open a different tab and check again.
- Consult installation and troubleshooting guides if the issue persists.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Empty Sections">
Possible causes:
- The page has not triggered connections yet.
- The extension failed to gather tab-specific data.

Resolution:
- Wait a few seconds for data to populate.
- Reload the tab to trigger new requests.
- Close and reopen the popup.
- If persistent, check extension logs or consult troubleshooting documentation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mismatch Between Badge and Popup Numbers">
If badge count and popup displayed allowed domains differ:
- The badge reflects only allowed domains while the popup shows all categories.
- Network activity might be still processing.

Resolution:
- Reload or switch tabs to refresh data.
- Confirm network activity is occurring.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary
By understanding the badge and popup, you gain precise and practical insights into the third-party network connections your browser tab initiates. This empowers you to monitor your exposure to external domains, verify blocking effectiveness, and make informed privacy decisions.

<Info>
Remember, the toolbar badge represents the unique count of allowed third-party domains only, while the popup displays a full breakdown including stealth-blocked and blocked domains.
