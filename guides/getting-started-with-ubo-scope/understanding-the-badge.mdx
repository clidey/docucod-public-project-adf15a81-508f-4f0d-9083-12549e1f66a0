# Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count

## Overview

The toolbar badge count in uBO Scope is a critical element that provides at-a-glance insight into the privacy landscape of the active browser tab. It displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by that tab. This guide helps you understand precisely what this badge count means, why it's an essential metric, and how it relates to your browsing privacy.

### What This Guide Does

This documentation clarifies the meaning of the toolbar badge count displayed on the uBO Scope extension icon. It explains how this count reflects unique third-party domains contacted per tab and why a lower count usually indicates better privacy.

### Prerequisites

- uBO Scope installed and enabled in your supported browser (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, or Safari 18.5+).
- Have visited or be actively viewing a webpage/tab you want to analyze.

### Expected Outcome

By the end of this guide, you will confidently interpret the badge count to understand how many third-party domains your current tab connects to and assess how effectively your privacy is being maintained.

### Estimated Time

Approximately 5 minutes.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner

## How the Toolbar Badge Count Works

The toolbar badge count is not just a random number; it is a precise measurement representing the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** for which network connections were made from the currently active tab.

### What Does "Distinct Third-Party Remote Servers" Mean?

- **Third-party**: Domains different from the main website domain you are visiting.
- **Remote servers**: Network endpoints that the browser attempts to connect to for loading resources or scripts.
- **Distinct**: Unique domains counted once, regardless of the number of connections.

### Why Count Domains Instead of Network Requests?

Many network requests may target the same domain multiple times. To avoid inflating the count unnecessarily, uBO Scope counts each unique domain only once. This approach offers a clearer view of your exposure to different external entities.

### How Is the Badge Count Calculated?

- As the webpage loads, uBO Scope tracks network requests through browser APIs.
- It extracts the hostname from each request's URL and reduces it to its registered domain (e.g., `cdn.example.com` simplified to `example.com` where relevant).
- Only third-party domains relative to the main page's domain are counted.
- The count shown on the badge is the number of such unique domains with a successful or attempted connection (allowed).


## Why a Lower Badge Count Means Better Privacy

Each additional third-party domain connected to potentially represents a new party which may track or collect data about your browsing behavior. 

- Fewer distinct third-parties mean fewer external data collectors.
- Many legitimate websites rely on one or two trusted third-parties like CDNs for resources.
- A high count could indicate many trackers, ad networks, or unnecessary data leaks.

Thus, monitoring this badge count gives you immediate insight into the privacy impact of the site you are visiting.

## Practical User Flow: Using the Badge Count

<Steps>
<Step title="Observe the Badge">
Check the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar while visiting a webpage. The number you see is the count of unique third-party domains connected to on this tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Understand the Implications">
A low number typically indicates fewer external connections, enhancing your privacy. A higher number suggests many third-party connections that could compromise it.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup for Details">
Click the icon to see the detailed list of connected domains categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, providing deeper context.
</Step>
<Step title="Make Informed Decisions">
Use the insight from the badge and popup to evaluate whether you want to adjust your content blockers or privacy settings.
</Step>

## Common Scenarios and Examples

### Scenario 1: A Typical News Website

- Badge count shows 3.
- You find commonly known third-party domains such as content delivery networks or analytics providers.
- This volume is expected and typically low risk.

### Scenario 2: An Advertisement-Heavy Website

- Badge count shows 15 or more.
- The extension reveals multiple advertising and tracking-related third-parties.
- This indicates more extensive third-party exposure.

### Scenario 3: After Activating a Content Blocker

- Badge count reduces significantly.
- Many third-party requests are blocked or stealth-blocked.
- The badge precisely reflects the reduced number of domains contacted.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Regularly monitor the badge count** to maintain awareness of your browsing privacy.
- Use the badge count alongside the popup details to spot unexpected third-party connections.
- Remember: the badge reflects distinct domains and not necessarily the volume of requests.
- Lower counts mean potentially better privacy but verify that critical site functionality remains intact.
- The badge dynamically updates as the tab's connections change during navigation.

## Troubleshooting Common Badge Count Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting Cases">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Doesn't Appear or Is Empty">
- Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and has the necessary permissions.
- Confirm you are on a normal website tab (private/incognito or special browser pages may not report).
- Reload the page to trigger network request tracking.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Seems Too High or Unexpected">
- Open the popup and review the listed domains.
- Check if the main page includes many legitimate third-party resources.
- Consider that some domains might be used for required assets like CDNs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Doesn't Update After Navigation">
- Sometimes, browser extensions may delay updates.
- Reload the page or switch tabs to force a badge update.
</Accordion>

## Technical Insight: How uBO Scope Manages the Badge

Behind the scenes, uBO Scope monitors all network requests for the current tab. It normalizes hostnames into domains using the Public Suffix List to identify distinct root domains. The extension’s background script maintains a data structure per tab to count unique allowed domains. It then sets the toolbar badge to match this count dynamically as browsing occurs.

This reliable tracking ensures that the badge count always reflects the real-world unique third-party server connections active in your tab.

## Summary

- The toolbar badge count indicates the number of unique third-party remote domains your tab connects to.
- Lower counts generally mean better privacy and fewer tracking entities.
- The count updates dynamically as you browse.
- Use the popup interface to explore detailed domain connection information.
