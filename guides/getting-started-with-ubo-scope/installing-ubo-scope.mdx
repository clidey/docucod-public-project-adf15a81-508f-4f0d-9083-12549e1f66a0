## Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### 1. Choose Your Browser and Access the Extension Store

| Browser             | Official Installation Link                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium (Chrome)    | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) |
| Firefox             | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)           |
| Safari              | Available through Apple's Safari Extensions Gallery (see official Safari extension mechanism) |

> **Tip:** Always download from the official store to ensure security and receive automatic updates.

### 2. Install the Extension

- Click the link for your browser to open the extension page.
- Select **Add to Browser** or **Install**.
- When prompted, review and accept the requested permissions. uBO Scope requires access to monitor network requests (`webRequest` API), storage, and active tab permissions to operate effectively.

### 3. Confirm Installation

- After installation, you should see the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar (usually near the address bar).
- The icon may display a badge count, initially showing zero or blank if not monitoring yet.

### 4. Enable and Activate the Extension

- For some browsers, the extension may be installed but disabled by default. Enable it via:
  - **Chrome:** `chrome://extensions` → Find uBO Scope → Toggle ON
  - **Firefox:** `about:addons` → Find uBO Scope → Enable
  - **Safari:** Safari → Preferences → Extensions → Enable uBO Scope

- Make sure uBO Scope has permission to access the current websites you visit.

### 5. Verify Operation

- Visit a website and observe the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
- The badge count updates dynamically, showing the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected per active tab.
- Click the icon to open the popup UI and view detailed connection statistics categorized as 'not blocked', 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'.

> **Check:** If the badge count updates and the popup shows connection data for the websites you visit, installation is successful.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter issues, consider the following solutions:

### Permissions Not Granted

- Extension cannot monitor network requests without proper permissions.
- Revisit the browser extension settings and ensure all requested permissions are allowed.

### Extension Icon Missing or Not Responding

- Confirm the extension is enabled.
- Restart the browser if necessary.
- Check for browser updates and upgrade if below the minimum version.

### No Badge or Connection Data Shown

- Make sure you visit HTTPS or HTTP sites; some special pages (like internal browser pages) cannot be monitored.
- Confirm that other privacy or security extensions or settings do not block uBO Scope's access.
