## 5. Installing on Apple Safari

### Step 2: Install uBO Scope for Safari

uBO Scope is available via Safari Extensions on the Mac App Store or can be side-loaded during development:

- Alternatively, download the source, package, and side-load the extension using Safari’s Developer menu (requires developer familiarity).

### Step 3: Enable the Extension

- Open Safari.
- Navigate to **Safari > Settings > Extensions**.
- Enable uBO Scope from the list.


<Warning>
Safari requires explicit enabling of extensions and grants networking permissions. Ensure you allow these during setup to enable full functionality.
</Warning>

## 6. Key Permissions Explained

When installing uBO Scope, the extension requests these essential permissions:

- **webRequest**: Allows monitoring of all network requests to track connections.
- **activeTab**: Enables interaction with the current active tab to display relevant network data.
- **storage**: Lets the extension save session data for ongoing monitoring.

These permissions are necessary and securely scoped to ensure accurate and transparent connection tracking.

Once installed, you can immediately:

- Click the extension icon to open the popup that breaks down connection counts.
