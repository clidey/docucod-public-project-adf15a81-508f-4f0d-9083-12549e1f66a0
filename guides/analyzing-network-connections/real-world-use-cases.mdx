# Common Use Cases: Auditing and Troubleshooting Network Requests

uBO Scope shines as a practical tool for privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers by providing clear, actionable insights into third-party network connection activity. This guide walks you through real-world scenarios where uBO Scope helps verify tracker presence, compare content blocker effectiveness, and validate filter list reliability through methodical workflows.

---

## 1. Overview of Use Cases

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
- **Detect tracker presence** on websites by checking allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.
- **Compare the impact of different content blockers** by observing changes in network connection patterns.
- **Validate the effectiveness of filter lists** ensuring that blocking rules behave as expected.
- **Troubleshoot unexpected network connections** or discrepancies in browser privacy behavior.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope extension installed and active in your supported browser.
- Basic familiarity with accessing the extension’s popup panel.
- Active browsing session with web pages loaded for auditing.

### Expected Outcomes
- Clear visibility of all third-party domains contacted by your current tab.
- Identification of which domains are blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed.
- Evidence-based assessment of your content blockers and filter lists.

---

## 2. Use Case Workflows

### A. Verifying Tracker Presence on a Webpage

**Goal:** Confirm whether trackers or third-party domains are active or blocked.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel showing connection data for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the Main Domain">
Check the header showing the tab's hostname and domain to confirm you're inspecting the correct page.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Connection Categories">
Review the three domain sections:
- **Not Blocked:** Domains for which connections succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains redirected or indirectly blocked but still observed.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts failed.
</Step>
<Step title="Count Domains and Assess Exposure">
Review the domain count summary. A lower count here generally means fewer third-party exposures.
</Step>
<Step title="Cross-check Suspected Trackers">
Look up specific tracker domains in the 'blocked' or 'stealth-blocked' sections to confirm if they are being filtered.
</Step>
</Steps>

**Verification:** The popup shows meaningful domains grouped by connection outcome, reflecting the real-time network activity of the webpage.

---

### B. Comparing Content Blockers

**Goal:** Observe differences in third-party connections when switching content blockers.

<Steps>
<Step title="Baseline Measurement">
Open a website and record the allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains shown by uBO Scope with Content Blocker A enabled.
</Step>
<Step title="Switch Content Blocker">
Disable Content Blocker A and enable Content Blocker B.
Reload the same website.
</Step>
<Step title="Re-open uBO Scope Popup">
Check the popup panel again for the updated connection categorization.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare Domain Lists and Counts">
Compare the number and identity of domains allowed or blocked under each content blocker.
Focus on whether there are fewer allowed tracker domains in one setup vs. the other.
</Step>
</Steps>

**Tip:** Focus on the **number of distinct 3rd-party domains allowed** as the key privacy metric, not just block counts.

---

### C. Validating Filter List Effectiveness

**Goal:** Confirm that new or modified filter rules block intended domains without overblocking.

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable Custom Filter List">
Activate the filter list you want to validate.
</Step>
<Step title="Visit Target Website">
Navigate to a site known to trigger the filters.
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Observe domains listed under blocked and stealth-blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Blocked Domains Match Expectations">
Check if the domains you expect to block appear under blocked or stealth-blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Look for False Negatives">
Identify any unwanted allowed domains that should be blocked, indicating filter gaps.
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust Filters as Needed">
Refine your filter rules based on your observations.
</Step>

**Verification:** The blocked/stealth-blocked sections reflect the filter’s impact accurately, allowing confirmation that rules are effective.
</Steps>

---

### D. Troubleshooting Unexpected Network Requests

**Goal:** Identify and diagnose unexpected third-party domains connected or missed blocks.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Check the current tab’s domains under allowed, stealth, and blocked categories.
</Step>
<Step title="Investigate Suspicious Domains">
Identify domains that seem unusual or should be blocked.
Look for them under allowed to suspect missed blocking.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Webpage Behavior and Filters">
Consider whether the filter lists cover these domains or if exceptions apply.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Browser Developer Tools as Needed">
Complement uBO Scope data by inspecting network requests in browser devtools.
</Step>
<Step title="Report or Adjust Filters">
Report new problematic domains for inclusion in filter lists or add custom rules.
</Step>

**Best Practice:** Regularly update filter lists and monitor the domains reported in uBO Scope for anomalies.
</Steps>

## 3. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Always Verify Domain Names:** Use the Unicode-decoded domain names shown in the popup for clarity, avoiding confusion from punycode.
- **Interpret the Badge Count Properly:** The badge reflects the number of distinct **allowed third-party domains** rather than total requests or block counts.
- **Reload Pages When Changing Filters or Blockers:** Network requests must be reinvoked to observe different outcomes.
- **Use Stealth-Blocked Section for Subtle Insights:** Domains in this category were redirected or partially blocked and may indicate complex blocking scenarios.
- **Understand Domain Aggregation:** Domains are aggregated by public suffix list rules (e.g., example.co.uk counted as a single domain).

---

## 4. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Relying solely on block counts without considering the number of allowed connections can mislead privacy evaluations.
- Using artificially constructed “ad blocker test” pages can produce misleading conclusions; prefer real websites for meaningful data.
- Ignoring stealth-blocked domains might overlook connections that were redirected or filtered in subtle ways.
- Forgetting to reload after changing filters or blocker settings leads to stale data and false conclusions.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Popup Panel Shows No Data or Incorrect Count
- Ensure you have active tabs open with network activity.
- Confirm uBO Scope has necessary permissions (e.g., webRequest).
- Reload the webpage to reset data collection.
- Check if other extensions or browser configurations interfere with webRequest API.

### Badge Count Does Not Reflect Expected Numbers
- The badge displays allowed third-party domains, not blocked counts.
- Some requests might bypass webRequest API (e.g., in background or service worker contexts) and not be counted.

### Domains Not Matching Expectations
- Verify domain grouping using the public suffix list (multi-level domains).
- Consider that redirects may place domains into stealth-blocked.

## 7. Reference Example: Reading the Popup Panel

The popup divides connected domains into three categories:

| Category           | Meaning                                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not Blocked        | Domains where requests succeeded and content was loaded properly.     |
| Stealth-Blocked    | Requests that were redirected or partially blocked, sometimes hidden. |
| Blocked            | Requests that failed due to blocking filters or errors.                |

For each category, domains are sorted alphabetically and show counts of requests.

Example snippet:

```text
not blocked
  tracker-example.com      10
  cdn-content.net           3
stealth-blocked
  ads-redirector.org        2
blocked
  knowntracker.io           5
```

This snapshot helps assess active trackers, filtering success, and unexpected connections.
