# Interpreting Badge Counts and Domain Statistics

Unlock the full power of uBO Scope by understanding exactly what the badge count and the domain statistics in the popup represent. This guide walks you through interpreting these key indicators to help you gain practical insights into your browsing privacy and security.

---

## 1. Understanding What the Badge Count Means

The badge count displayed on the toolbar icon indicates the **number of distinct third-party domains** that the current tab's webpage has successfully connected to without being blocked.

- **Third-party domain:** Any domain different from the main site you are visiting.
- **Distinct count:** Each unique domain is counted once regardless of how many requests are made to it.

### Why This Matters

A lower badge count is **better for privacy** because it means fewer third parties are loaded that might track you across the web.

> For example, if you visit example.com and see a badge count of 5, it means your browser successfully connected to 5 unique third-party domains during the page load.

### Important Clarifications

- Badge count **does not include blocked domains** or stealth-blocked domains.
- It counts only **allowed** connections, giving a direct measure of your exposure.

<Tip>
Focus on the badge count as the primary metric for how many third-party domains successfully communicated with your browser from the active tab.
</Tip>


## 2. Decoding Domain Statistics in the Popup Panel

When you click the toolbar icon, the popup shows a detailed breakdown of domain connections categorized as:

- **Not blocked (Allowed):** Domains where network requests were successful.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where attempts to connect were redirected or otherwise stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly prevented or resulted in errors.

### What You See in the Popup

- The header shows the **active tab's hostname and domain**.
- The summary section displays the **count of all unique allowed domains**.
- Each outcome section lists domains alphabetically with a **count of how many requests succeeded or failed**.

#### How Domains Are Counted

uBO Scope groups domains by their **registered domain name** using the Public Suffix List. For example:

- `cdn.example.com` and `static.example.com` both count under `example.com`.
- Internationalized domains are displayed using their Unicode equivalents for clarity.

### Practical Example

- Allowed: Shows `example-cdn.com (3 requests)`, `fonts.net (2 requests)`
- Stealth-blocked: Shows `tracker-bot.org (1 request)`
- Blocked: Shows `ads.example.net (5 requests)`

This helps you identify which domains are quietly blocked, which are explicitly blocked, and which are allowed through.

<Tip>
Use the domain counts to gain a quick sense of which third parties dominate your tab’s network activity.
</Tip>


## 3. Why These Numbers Matter for Privacy and Security

- **Badge Count = Allowed Domains:** Highlights your actual exposure to third parties.
- **Popup Breakdown:** Offers transparency on how many requests to each domain were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked Domains:** Reveal attempts to access resources that were silently redirected or blocked without raising an obvious error.

By knowing these numbers, users can:

- Detect unexpected or excessive third-party connections.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of content blocking without relying on misleading block counts.
- Understand the risks posed by certain domains slightly hidden from normal browser tools.


## 4. How uBO Scope Tracks and Updates These Numbers

- The extension listens to all network requests using the browser's **webRequest** API.
- For each request, it records the result as allowed, stealth-blocked (redirects), or blocked (errors).
- Counts are kept per tab and updated dynamically.
- The **badge count updates** to show the current number of unique allowed domains, reflecting live browsing activity.


## 5. Step-by-Step: Reading Your Badge and Popup

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Toolbar Badge">
Look at uBO Scope’s icon on your browser toolbar. If a number is displayed, it’s how many unique third-party domains the current tab connected with.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel">
Click the icon to open the popup showing detailed domain statistics.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the Tab Host and Domain">
At the top, read the displayed hostname and domain to confirm you're looking at the correct tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains Section">
See the list of domains your browser contacted successfully under the “not blocked” section with counts.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Stealth-blocked and Blocked Sections">
Look for any domains in the stealth-blocked or blocked sections to identify resources silently or explicitly prevented from loading.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Counts Holistically">
Combine this information with your knowledge of the site’s expected content to evaluate your privacy exposure.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 6. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Regularly monitor badge counts:** Sudden increases may indicate new tracking attempts.
- **Use the popup details:** If you see unexpected domains, investigate further or adjust your content blocker.
- **Don’t rely on badge block numbers:** The badge reflects allowed third-party domains only.
- **Understand stealth-blocking:** It’s a useful feature showing attempted connections that were silently stopped.

<Note>
Some legitimate websites may require connections to multiple third-party domains like CDNs or font providers. A higher badge count doesn’t necessarily mean poor privacy but can signal more exposure.
</Note>


## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **Badge count is zero but you expect connections:** Check if the tab is fully loaded or your browser supports full webRequest API access.
- **No data shown in popup:** Ensure you have navigated to an active tab with network activity.
- **Counts don’t update immediately:** The extension batches network events and updates count with slight delays to optimize performance.
