# Making Sense of the Badge Count

Understanding the toolbar icon badge count in uBO Scope is key to gaining meaningful insights into your browser's third-party network activity. This guide explains how the badge number is calculated, what it indicates about your browsing privacy, why a lower count is preferable, and how to avoid common misinterpretations. We also discuss important differences you may encounter when comparing results across other content blockers.

## 1. What the Badge Count Represents

The badge on uBO Scope's toolbar icon displays a numeric count reflecting _the number of distinct third-party remote servers_ your browser connected to or attempted to connect with while loading a webpage.

### Key points:

- **Distinct third-party domains:** The count is based on unique remote domains _not_ part of the site you are currently viewing.
- **Allowed connections:** It primarily reflects connections that were _allowed_ to succeed.
- **Third-party focus:** First-party connections to the main site domain do not increase the count.

> **Why is this important?**
> This count reveals your actual network footprint by showing how many external servers are contacted each time you visit a site — providing transparency beyond just blocked or allowed requests.


## 2. How the Badge Count is Calculated

The extension intercepts browser network requests through the `webRequest` API, categorizes each request by domain, and maintains a running tally of distinct remote servers per browser tab. 

- When a new page loads (main frame request), uBO Scope resets the tally for that tab.
- Network requests are grouped by their originating tab and resolved to their effective domain using a public suffix list for accuracy.
- Only domains for _allowed_ (successful) network requests increment the badge count.
- The badge text is updated dynamically to reflect the current count.


## 3. What the Badge Count Tells You About Privacy

A lower badge count on a webpage signals fewer third-party domains are contacted, which generally implies less external tracking and better privacy.

- **Low count examples:** Websites primarily serve content from their main domain and use few legitimate external services such as CDNs.
- **High count examples:** Sites that load numerous third-party advertising, analytics, or tracking domains.

Use the badge count to identify sites with extensive third-party tracking or resource loading practices.


## 4. Common Misinterpretations to Avoid

### Misinterpretation #1: Higher Block Count Means Better Blocking

Some users mistakenly equate a high block count with more effective blocking.

> **Reality:** A content blocker that blocks more requests may still allow connections to _more distinct third-party domains_, showing a higher badge count. Thus, a higher block count doesn't necessarily mean better privacy or more blocking efficiency.

### Misinterpretation #2: Badge Count Reflects All Blocked Domains

The badge exclusively reflects _allowed_ distinct third-party domains connected,
not the total number of blocked or stealth-blocked domains.

### Misinterpretation #3: Badge Count Should Match Other Content Blockers

Different content blockers use different detection methods, block rules, and heuristics.
Badge counts can vary significantly even on the same webpage, especially if the other tools do not use the webRequest API or if they perform stealth blocking.


## 5. Differences Across Content Blockers

uBO Scope operates independently of any content blocker by observing network requests reported through the browser’s API.

- It counts distinct remote domains actually contacted, regardless of whether some content blocking happens via other means (like DNS-based blocking).
- Other blockers might report block counts or connection attempts differently, making direct comparisons misleading.
- The badge count in uBO Scope is a _transparent, objective measure_ of how many third-party servers your browser touches.


## 6. Practical Tips for Interpreting Your Badge Count

- **Think of the badge count as your browser’s "third-party footprint."** Lower is better.
- **Focus on domains, not individual requests.** One domain may serve many resources but only counts once.
- When seeing a high badge count, consider viewing the popup UI to explore which domains were contacted and whether they were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- Use uBO Scope alongside other privacy tools for a fuller picture but trust the badge count for real network activity.


## 7. Step-by-Step User Flow: Checking the Badge Count

<Steps>
<Step title="View the Toolbar Icon Badge">
Locate the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar and note the badge count number.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Count">
Recall that the number represents distinct third-party domains your browser contacted while loading the current tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup for Details">
Click the icon to open the popup and review allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains for that tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Assess Privacy Impact">
Analyze whether the count and domains align with your privacy expectations and the site’s reputation.
</Step>
<Step title="Repeat on Other Sites">
Compare counts across sites to identify patterns of third-party network activity.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 8. Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Badge Count Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Shows Zero or No Badge">
- Confirm uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Reload the tab after installation.
- Check that site permissions and browsing activity are normal.
- Verify no browser restrictions or conflicting privacy extensions are blocking webRequest events.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Change After Navigation">
- Wait a few seconds and refresh the tab.
- The count updates asynchronously and might be delayed.
- Confirm your browser supports the `webRequest` API and uBO Scope’s permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count is Higher Than Expected">
- Open the popup to identify which third-party domains contribute to the count.
- Consider if the site legitimately loads many resources or if tracking domains are present.
- Check if other content blockers or VPNs affect network connections.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 9. Summary

Understanding the toolbar badge count in uBO Scope empowers you to see the real third-party network exposure from each website you visit. Always interpret the count as the number of distinct allowed third-party connections for the current tab — with fewer domains indicating better browsing privacy.

## 11. Additional Best Practices

- Regularly check the badge count on frequently visited sites to detect any change in third-party activity.
- Use uBO Scope's popup to investigate unfamiliar domains and better understand network behaviors.
- Combine insights from uBO Scope with trusted filter lists and privacy best practices.


<Note>
A lower badge count is your friend: it means fewer third-party exposures, fewer tracking opportunities, and typically a faster, privacy-respecting browsing experience.
