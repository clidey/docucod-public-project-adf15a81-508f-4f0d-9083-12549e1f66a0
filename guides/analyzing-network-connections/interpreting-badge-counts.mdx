# Interpreting uBO Scope's Toolbar Badge Counts and Their Privacy Implications

Understanding the toolbar badge displayed by uBO Scope is essential for making informed decisions about your online privacy and the effectiveness of content blockers you use. This guide offers a clear explanation of what the badge count represents, how to reason about its value, common misconceptions to avoid, and best practices for evaluating network connection data.

## 1. What the Toolbar Badge Count Represents

The uBO Scope toolbar badge shows **the number of distinct third-party remote servers that a webpage connected to during your browsing session on the active tab**. This count encompasses only those connections that were allowed (not blocked) by any content blockers or other mechanisms. 

- **Third-party remote servers** refers to domains that are different from the main website you are visiting.
- Each server counted is unique; multiple requests to the same domain count as one.

**Why focus on distinct third-party servers?** Because they represent the actual exposure of your browsing activity to external entities, often linked with tracking, advertising, or content delivery.


## 2. Why Lower Badge Counts Are Better for Privacy

A lower badge count indicates fewer external servers contacted, reducing your web fingerprint and limiting unsolicited data sharing.

- Legitimate third parties, such as CDN providers, often result in low counts (typically 1-3).
- A higher count usually signals more tracking or unnecessary connections.

Adopting this mindset helps you objectively measure the privacy impact of websites and the effectiveness of your content blockers.


## 3. How uBO Scope Calculates and Updates the Badge

Each network request made by the active browser tab is monitored in real time:

- Requests are categorized as **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked** (e.g., via stealthy redirections).
- Only the **allowed third-party domains** are counted for the badge.
- The count updates dynamically as requests succeed or fail.

This dynamic calculation ensures you see an accurate snapshot of all unique third-party third-party servers successfully contacted.


## 4. Reasoning About the Badge Value

### What the Count Means

- The badge reflects your true exposure to **distinct external content sources**, not just volume of requests.
- It highlights your browser’s permitted connections to domains outside the site you visit.

### What the Count Does NOT Mean

- It is **not a measure of total requests** made (which may be many more).
- It is **not a count of blocked requests** or filter effectiveness; block counts are tracked inside the extension UI but not on this badge.


## 5. Common Misconceptions and Pitfalls

<u>Myth 1: A higher block count means better privacy protection.</u>

- A higher block count can correlate with allowing connections to more distinct remote servers, paradoxically increasing exposure.
- The ultimate privacy indicator is the badge count of allowed third parties, not block counts.

<u>Myth 2: Online 'ad blocker test' webpages reliably evaluate blocker effectiveness.</u>

- Such test pages often use fabricated or unrealistic third-party servers, which do not represent real-world browsing behavior.
- Many blockers employ stealth techniques invisible to these tests.
- Trust real browsing behavior and tools like uBO Scope over synthetic tests.

<u>Myth 3: All third-party connections are malicious or trackers.</u>

- Some third parties serve essential content delivery or services.
- The badge count alone doesn’t label these domains but helps you be aware of network exposure.


## 6. Best Practices for Using and Evaluating Badge Counts

- **Use the badge as a privacy awareness indicator:** Lower counts mean reduced third-party exposure.
- **Check the detailed popup lists:** Explore allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domain groups.
- **Compare badge counts across multiple sites:** Discover which websites expose you to many third parties.
- **Do not rely on block counts alone:** They can be misleading in assessing blocker quality.
- **Avoid using ad-block test sites as benchmarks:** Focus on real-world activity visualized by uBO Scope.


## 7. Practical User Flow: Understanding Your Badge Count

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the toolbar icon to view detailed domain connection lists for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Toolbar Badge Number">
See the number displayed — this equals unique allowed third-party domains.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains List">
Confirm which third-party domains are counted under 'not blocked'.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare With Blocked and Stealth-Blocked Lists">
See which domains were blocked or stealth-blocked; they are not counted in the badge.
</Step>
<Step title="Consider Your Desired Privacy Exposure">
Lower badge counts with fewer distinct allowed third parties means better privacy.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 8. Troubleshooting Unexpected Badge Counts

<AccordionGroup title="Common Badge Count Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Badge Shows Zero or Blank When Browsing Active Tab">
- Ensure uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- Verify the active tab is fully loaded and network activity has completed.
- Reload the tab to trigger fresh data capture.
- Check for any permission issues under browser extension settings.
- Consult the [First Use Verification Guide](/getting-started/first-run-success/first-run-verification) for additional steps.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Seems Too High Compared to Expected">
- Open the popup to analyze which domains contribute.
- Look for legitimate content delivery network domains vs trackers.
- Consider browser extensions or VPNs that may inject connections.
- Review privacy settings and filters in your blockers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Change After Navigating to New Site">
- Confirm the extension’s background script is active.
- Reload the page for the tab.
- Restart the browser to clear temporary internal states.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 9. Summary

The uBO Scope toolbar badge count offers a clear, reliable indicator of how many distinct third-party servers your browser communicates with on any given page, directly reflecting your real-time privacy exposure. Use this count to assess and compare the effectiveness of your privacy tools and understand your online footprint. Remember that fewer distinct connections typically mean stronger privacy, while block counts and ad block tests are misleading metrics.
