# Using uBO Scope to Debunk Content Blocking Myths

## Overview
This guide empowers users and filter list maintainers to dispel common misconceptions arising from simplistic metrics or ad blocker test sites. By leveraging uBO Scope’s impartial monitoring of all browser network requests, you will learn how to interpret real-world connection data accurately — enabling informed decisions about privacy, content blockers, and network transparency.

## 1. Introduction to Content Blocking Myths

Many users rely on headline metrics or simple tests to evaluate content blockers. uBO Scope reveals why these methods can be misleading:

- **Myth #1: More Blocked Requests = Better Blocker**  
  A higher block count does not necessarily mean better protection. It can indicate that the content blocker permits more connections overall, despite blocking more requests.

- **Myth #2: Ad Blocker Test Sites are Reliable Benchmarks**  
  These sites generate artificial or fabricated requests that do not reflect real-world browsing. They also cannot detect stealthy blocking techniques used by modern extensions.

Understanding these myths helps set realistic expectations for content blocker effectiveness.

<Info>
Recognizing these myths clears confusion and focuses your analysis on the actual number of distinct third-party servers your browser contacts — a critical privacy metric.

## 2. How uBO Scope Provides Unbiased Insight

uBO Scope monitors all network requests reported by your browser’s webRequest API, regardless of which content blocker or DNS-based filtering is active. It:

- Tracks **all attempted and successful connections** to third-party servers
- Categorizes requests by outcome: **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked**
- Reports the **distinct count of third-party remote servers** per browser tab in the toolbar badge

This comprehensive visibility gives an honest, non-filtered view of your actual browser network activity.

## 3. Real-World Examples: Debunking the Myths

### Scenario A: Comparing Two Content Blockers by Block Counts

#### The Claim:
"Blocker A blocks more requests than Blocker B, so Blocker A is better."

#### What uBO Scope Shows:
- Despite block counts, Blocker A’s badge count shows a higher number of distinct allowed third-party servers than Blocker B.
- This means Blocker B actually blocks more unique third-party connections, providing stronger privacy.

#### Actionable Insight:
Focus on the distinct third-party domains allowed, not just block counts. A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party servers were contacted.

### Scenario B: Trusting Ad Blocker Test Websites

#### The Claim:
"A test page says my blocker fails, so it is unreliable."

#### What uBO Scope Exposes:
- Test pages use non-realistic requests that do not reflect normal webpage behavior.
- Stealth blocking methods used by blockers can hide their activity from these tests.
- uBO Scope shows actual, everyday third-party connections regardless of stealth techniques.

#### Actionable Insight:
Use uBO Scope as a practical tool to assess real browsing scenarios rather than relying on synthetic test sites.

## 4. Workflow: Using uBO Scope to Evaluate Your Content Blocker

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup on a Live Webpage">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon while browsing a real site. Wait until the popup loads to see connection data.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Badge Count">
Read the number on the extension’s badge – this is the count of distinct third-party servers your browser connected with on the current tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Connection Outcomes">
Review the three sections in the popup:
- **Not Blocked**: Domains your browser successfully connected to.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Requests silently redirected or dropped.
- **Blocked**: Explicitly blocked network requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Compare Across Different Blockers or Configurations">
Switch content blockers or tweak settings. Repeat steps to observe changes in the badge count and domain lists.
</Step>
<Step title="Draw Conclusions Based on Distinct Domains Contacted">
Recognize lower counts of allowed third-party domains as a positive sign of tighter network control and privacy.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Always consider distinct domains, not total requests or block counts.** Some domains serve many requests.
- **Trust data from real browsing sessions over synthetic test environments.**
- **Understand that some third-party connections (e.g., CDNs) are normal and usually safe.**
- **Use stealth-blocked data to detect subtle filtering behaviors that test sites don’t reveal.**

<Check>
Maintain realistic privacy expectations: no content blocker can eliminate all third-party contacts, but uBO Scope helps measure effectiveness transparently.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope Usage">
<Accordion title="No Data Shown in Popup or Badge is Empty">
- Ensure the extension is enabled.
- Check browser permissions allow `webRequest` monitoring.
- Reload the page and try again.
- Verify you are on a page with network activity.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Stagnant Despite Network Activity">
- Some content blockers or browser settings may interfere with webRequest reporting.
- Restart the browser.
- Check for conflicts with other extensions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Difficulty Interpreting Domains">
- Use the uBO Scope help sections or related guides to understand domain and outcome categories.
- Recognize that domain names may include internationalized names converted back from Punycode.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. How uBO Scope Helps Filter List Maintainers

Filter list creators can use uBO Scope to:

- Validate which third-party domains are truly contacted during browsing on various devices
- Observe differences in blocking effectiveness beyond naive block counts
- Detect potential stealth blocking or redirection patterns

This helps maintainers refine lists for better real-world usability and privacy results.

## 8. Summary

Using uBO Scope to debunk simplistic myths surrounding content blocking gives you a factual, transparent understanding of your browser’s third-party network footprint. By tracking distinct domains contacted and categorizing outcomes impartially, uBO Scope elevates your privacy awareness and supports intelligent, evidence-based filter list development.
