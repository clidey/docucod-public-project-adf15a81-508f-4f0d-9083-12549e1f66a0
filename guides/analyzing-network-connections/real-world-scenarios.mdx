# Common Scenarios and What They Tell You

This guide explores practical, real-world scenarios encountered when using uBO Scope. It helps you interpret typical popup outputs, compare how different content blockers affect connection counts, and debunks common myths around ad-blocker test sites. By understanding these scenarios, you will better interpret your toolbar badge counts and make informed decisions about your browser’s third-party connection exposures.

---

## 1. Understanding Common User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Comparing Content Blockers

**What to do:**
- Install uBO Scope alongside different content blockers (e.g., uBlock Origin, AdGuard, or others).
- Visit a frequently browsed site and observe the toolbar badge count and popup domain lists.

**What you will see:**
- The badge count displays the number of distinct third-party domains the browser connected to on the active tab.
- The popup sections show which domains were allowed, stealth-blocked (connections hidden by the content blocker), or blocked outright.

**What this tells you:**
- A lower badge count means fewer third-party domains made actual connections, indicating tighter privacy control.
- A higher block count in a blocker does **not** necessarily mean better blocking; a blocker could register many blocked requests but still allow connections to many distinct domains.

<Tip>
Always focus on the *allowed* domains count rather than the number of blocked requests to gauge true third-party exposure.
</Tip>

---

### Scenario 2: Seeing a Low Badge Count

**Typical popup pattern:**
- Fewer allowed domains; some stealth-blocked and/or blocked domains.

**What this indicates:**
- Your content blocker or combination of privacy tools (including DNS filtering) effectively prevents many third-party connections.
- Few third parties remain in the allowed list, confirming tighter control over remote connections.

**Best practice:**
- Verify that the allowed domains match known essential services (e.g., CDN providers, tracker-free domains).
- Confirm the presence of stealth-blocked entries to spot potentially hidden blocking mechanisms.

---

### Scenario 3: Observing a High Badge Count with Few Blocked Domains

**Typical popup pattern:**
- Many allowed domains, but very small or no blocked or stealth-blocked sections.

**Interpretation:**
- The browser is connecting freely to many third-party domains.
- Few requests are being blocked or stealth-blocked, meaning your blocker settings or privacy configuration might be permissive.

**Recommended action:**
- Review content blocker settings to enforce stricter rules.
- Consider adding additional privacy tools or filter lists.
- Use uBO Scope to identify which connections are allowed, then research if those domains are necessary or intrusive.

---

### Scenario 4: Zero or Blank Badge Count

**What uBO Scope means:**
- No distinct third-party connections have been recorded for the active tab.

**Possible reasons:**
- You are viewing a new tab or a page with no external requests.
- The extension lacks necessary permissions or is blocked itself.
- Browser API limitations prevent capturing requests.

**See troubleshooting in [Why Is My Badge Count Zero?](../../getting-started/troubleshooting/no-connections-badge) for detailed diagnosis.**

## 2. Debunking Myths About Ad-Blocker Test Sites

**Myth:** _These test sites reliably show how well my blocker works._

**Reality:**
- Many blockers stealth-block requests to avoid detection, which test sites cannot detect properly.
- The number of blocked requests shown on such sites does not translate to better privacy or fewer third-party connections.

**uBO Scope helps expose this by:**
- Monitoring real network connections made by browsers without relying on site-reported block counts.
- Allowing you to see exactly which third-party domains connect when browsing real websites.

<Tip>
Avoid relying on ad-blocker test sites for assessing your content blockers. Use uBO Scope's real-world monitoring instead.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Typical Popup Outputs and How to Interpret Them

The uBO Scope popup divides third-party connections into three categories:

- **Not blocked (Allowed):** Domains where connection requests succeeded.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections prevented by stealth blocking mechanisms (invisible to sites), showing as redirects in the underlying data.
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked and resulting in errors.

### Example Interpretation

| Section        | Meaning                                                  | Actionable Insight                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Not blocked    | Domains counted toward allowed connections               | Check if legitimate or potentially invasive |
| Stealth-blocked| Requests prevented quietly without obvious blocking logs | Indicates hidden blocking at work           |
| Blocked        | Explicitly errored connection attempts                    | Confirms blocking rules in action          |

Understanding this helps you distinguish between visibly blocked connections and those stealthily blocked, giving a more transparent picture of your actual exposure.

## 4. Practical Tips for Using uBO Scope in Scenarios

- **Before making conclusions,** confirm your extension is properly installed and permissions are granted.
- **Use the popup panel** actively while browsing to monitor changes in connection patterns as you navigate.
- **Focus on allowed domains count** rather than blocked request counts when comparing performance between blockers.
- **Look for stealth-blocked domains** to spot advanced blocking behaviors.
- **Cross-check domains** with known lists to identify trackers or benign services.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Scenario Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Scenario Troubleshooting"> 
<Accordion title="Badge Shows Zero Despite Expected Activity">

This often means the extension cannot monitor network requests due to:
- Insufficient permissions.
- Browser API limitations.
- Tab not active or no network activity.

**Actions:**
- Verify browser version meets [Supported Browsers & System Requirements](../../getting-started/installation-basics/system-requirements).
- Confirm extension permissions and presence on the toolbar.
- Reload the extension or restart the browser if necessary.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or Unexpected Values">

This may occur because:
- You opened the popup on a non-webpage tab (new tab, browser settings).
- The extension is still initializing.

**Actions:**
- Switch to a website tab with network activity.
- Close and reopen the popup.
- Wait briefly for the extension to gather data.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Decrease After Stricter Blocking">

Possible causes include:
- Browser caching or concurrent extensions allowing connections.
- External DNS-level blocking overlapping with uBO Scope's visibility.

**Actions:**
- Clear browser cache.
- Disable other conflicting extensions to isolate behavior.
- Consult [Compatibility & Integration Points](../../overview/how-ubo-scope-works/integration-and-compatibility) for known limitations.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Summary

Through these common scenarios and practical interpretations, you gain a clearer understanding of what uBO Scope reports and how to leverage it for better privacy insight. Focus on allowed domains seen in popup outputs, watch for stealth-blocked connections, and use the extension to debunk misleading metrics from ad-blocker tests or block counts.

Use this knowledge to adjust your content blockers, understand third-party exposures, and confidently interpret what your browser connects to in real time.

# Appendix: Typical Popup Section Example

```plain
domains connected: 5

not blocked
 • examplecdn.com (10 requests)
 • fonts.googleapis.com (3 requests)

stealth-blocked
 • tracker.example.com (7 requests)

blocked
 • adserver.example.net (4 requests)
```

Interpretation:
- 5 distinct allowed domains represent outgoing connections.
- Stealth-blocked domain shows connections prevented without direct blocking errors.
- Blocked domain reflects explicit blocked network requests.

This snapshot immediately reveals your browsing privacy posture and the active role of content blocking.
