# Interpreting Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Domains in uBO Scope

## Overview

This guide clarifies how uBO Scope categorizes network connections into **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth-blocked** domains. Understanding these categories empowers you to accurately interpret the privacy impact of web requests your browser makes for each active tab. This page focuses specifically on the domain outcome classifications shown in the uBO Scope popup interface.

## Prerequisites

- You have uBO Scope installed and active in your supported browser.
- You know how to open the uBO Scope popup to view connection data.
- Familiarity with basic domain terminology (hostname, domain, third-party domains).

## What You Will Learn

- Definitions of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.
- How these categories relate to real network activity and privacy.
- The difference between domain statuses and content blocking strategies.
- Practical tips for analyzing your tab's network connections.

## 1. Understanding Domain Outcome Categories

uBO Scope classifies connection attempts for distinct remote servers into three mutually exclusive categories displayed within the extension popup for the current active tab.

### Allowed Domains ("not blocked")

- These domains represent remote servers your browser successfully connected to from the active tab.
- Resources from these domains were fetched and processed without interference from content blocking.
- The extension counts distinct domains here because each unique domain represents a separate third-party that your browser talked to.
- For example, loading a page may connect to `google.com` and `cdn.example.net`. Both, if successfully connected, appear here.

### Blocked Domains ("blocked")

- These reflect domains for which network requests were **fully blocked** and never completed.
- Blocking can be enforced by any content blocker (e.g., uBlock Origin), browser settings, or network filtering.
- These domains appear because the browser reported network errors or failed requests.
- For example, if you configured blocking rules that disallow tracking domains like `tracker.example.com`, they will appear here if the request was blocked.

### Stealth-Blocked Domains ("stealth-blocked")

- This special category captures requests that were **intercepted and rerouted or redirected in a way that does not result in a direct block error visible to the page**.
- Stealth blocking includes techniques employed by content blockers to silently handle requests, avoiding webpage breakage or detection by hiding blocking activities.
- Domains here might represent requests that were 'redirected away' or covertly blocked without triggering an error.
- This allows users to see domains that would otherwise be invisible in traditional block lists.


<Note>
The sum of distinct domains shown across all three categories equals the total third-party domains your active tab attempted to contact.
</Note>

## 2. How Domain Status Reflects Real Privacy Impact

uBO Scope focuses on **distinct third-party domains** contacted rather than raw numbers of requests.

- The **allowed domains count is the key privacy metric**: fewer allowed third-party domains indicate less exposure.
- The badge on the browser toolbar shows this allowed domains count in real-time.
- A higher block count does not necessarily mean better protection—if a content blocker still allows many distinct third-party connections, your privacy could be more exposed.
- Stealth-blocked domains reveal hidden blocking mechanisms, informing users about subtle filtering beyond outright blocks.

## 3. Relationship to Content Blocking Strategies

Understanding domain outcomes clarifies how various content blocking approaches behave:

| Domain Status       | Content Blocker Behavior                        | User Impact                        |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Allowed            | Request completed successfully                 | Resource fetched; privacy exposed |
| Blocked            | Request fully blocked, network error reported | Resource prevented; improved privacy |
| Stealth-Blocked    | Request redirected or silently blocked        | Resources hidden from webpage; privacy enhanced without breakage |

### Common Scenarios

- **Traditional blocking:** Domains in the **blocked** list correspond to domains your content blocker outright denied.
- **Stealth techniques:** Domains in the **stealth-blocked** list show requests blocked gracefully to avoid webpage malfunctions or detection.
- **No blocking:** All domains appear in allowed.

## 4. Practical Tips for Analysis

- When reviewing uBO Scope's popup interface, prioritize reducing **allowed domains** to minimize privacy risks.
- Use the blocked and stealth-blocked domains as indicators of what your content blocker or network filtering is targeting.
- Recognize that legitimate services (like CDN providers) often appear in allowed but are generally low risk.
- Explore domains with high connection counts (shown as badges) — repeated requests from the same domain may indicate persistent tracking or resource loading.
- Combine insights from this page with the guide on [Revealing Third-Party Connections on a Webpage](/guides/analyzing-network-connections/revealing-third-party-connections) for deeper understanding.

## 5. Step-by-Step: Interpreting the uBO Scope Popup

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup showing your current tab's connections.
</Step>
<Step title="Locate the Domain Outcome Sections">
Within the popup, find the three labeled sections: 'not blocked' (allowed), 'stealth-blocked', and 'blocked'.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
Check the domains listed under 'not blocked'—these are the real connections your tab has successfully made.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Blocked and Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Identify domains in these sections to see which were fully blocked or stealthily blocked by your content blockers.
</Step>
<Step title="Assess the Summary Count">
At the top 'domains connected' summary, note the count matches the number of unique allowed domains, reflecting your tab’s exposure level.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze Connection Counts">
Within each domain row, observe the count badge representing how many connections were made or attempted for that specific domain.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Domain Outcome Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Why do some domains appear under stealth-blocked instead of blocked?">
Stealth-blocking intentionally hides blocking failures by redirecting or silently dropping requests. This avoids visible errors and webpage breakage but still prevents resource loading, so domains appear under stealth-blocked rather than blocked.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can allowed domains include resources from my own website?">
Allowed domains include all successfully connected domains from the tab. By design, uBO Scope differentiates third-party domains by using the Public Suffix List. Your site's own domain is typically shown but the focus is on third parties for privacy analysis.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is the badge count different from block counts in my content blocker?">
The badge count reflects distinct allowed third-party domains, not the number of blocked requests. A content blocker’s block count often counts total blocked requests, which can be misleading compared to distinct domains.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Best Practices

- Focus on minimizing **allowed domains** to reduce potential privacy leaks.
- Use stealth-blocked domain listings as proof your content blocker employs stealth techniques, improving stealthiness.
- Investigate frequent connections to unfamiliar domains as potential privacy exposures.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with your content blocker's dashboard for a fuller picture.
