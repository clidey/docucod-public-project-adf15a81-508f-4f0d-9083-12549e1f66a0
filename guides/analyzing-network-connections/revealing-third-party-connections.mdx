# Revealing Third-Party Connections on a Webpage

Unlock the full visibility of your active browser tab’s network activity by exploring how **uBO Scope** reveals which third-party servers your browser communicates with while visiting any website. This guide walks you through viewing the extension's popup interface, interpreting the badge counts, and investigating individual domain connection outcomes with practical, actionable steps.

---

## 1. Understanding the Task

### What You’ll Achieve
With this guide, you will:
- Open and navigate the uBO Scope popup interface to examine current tab network connections.
- Understand what the badge icon count means and how it reflects third-party server connections.
- Learn how to interpret the segmented lists of domains by connection outcome: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- Analyze individual domain connection counts to assess privacy exposure.

### Prerequisites
- uBO Scope installed and enabled on your Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser.
- Browsing at least one active webpage (preferably with rich third-party content).
- Familiarity with opening browser extension popups (e.g., clicking the extension icon).

### Expected Outcome
You will confidently interpret uBO Scope’s popup data to identify and evaluate third-party domains contacted by your current browser tab, empowering you to understand your network exposure beyond standard content blocker metrics.

### Time Estimate
5–10 minutes for a first exploration and interpretation.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate.

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Locate the uBO Scope extension icon in your browser toolbar and click it to open the popup interface. This view reports the current state of network activity for the active tab.

**Expected Result:** The popup displays the hostname of the current page and domains grouped by connection outcomes.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify the Hostname and Domain">
At the top, observe the hostname and domain names representing the active tab you are inspecting. These are shown in Unicode format (with internationalized domain names decoded).

**Tip:** If the hostname differs from the base domain, it will be displayed in two parts for clarity.
</Step>

<Step title="Understand Badge Count on Toolbar Icon">
The badge number on the extension icon indicates the number of unique third-party domains **allowed** to connect from the current tab.

**Remember:** A **lower badge count is better**, indicating fewer third-party servers accessed.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Domains by Connection Outcome">
The UI segregates connections into three categories:
- **Not blocked (allowed):** Domains your browser contacted successfully.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked:** Domains whose requests failed or were blocked outright.

Each section lists domains along with the count of connections.

**Expected Result:** Clear segregation helps you identify which third-party domains have full, partial (stealth), or blocked connection attempts.
</Step>

<Step title="Investigate Specific Domains">
Hover over or read the domain rows to see the number of individual connections per domain.

**Example:** For a busy website, you might see a CDN domain with many connections and ad tracker domains with fewer.

Use this information to evaluate the potential privacy impact or the presence of trackers.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Data in Context">
Use your insights about third-party domains to make informed decisions about content blocking and privacy settings:
- Domains with high connection counts may be key functional or tracking services.
- Stealth-blocked domains indicate invisible or redirected network activity.
- Fully blocked domains show successful prevention of unwanted connections.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Real-World Scenario

Imagine exploring a popular news website. Clicking the uBO Scope icon shows:

- The badge count displays “15”, meaning 15 unique third-party domains loaded resources.
- The **not blocked** section includes known CDN providers like `cdn.example.com` and analytics services.
- The **stealth-blocked** section shows domains where requests were redirected or obscured.
- The **blocked** section lists domains known for tracking but successfully prevented by your browser or content blocking setup.

This quick visual breakdown lets you understand the network footprint of your visit beyond simple block counts or ad blocker metrics.

---

## 4. Tips for Effective Use

- **Regularly check the badge count** while browsing different sites to monitor third-party exposure trends.
- **Compare the allowed and blocked lists** to verify your content blocker’s effectiveness.
- **Use domain connection counts** to prioritize which third parties may require additional blocking.
- **Remember** that some third parties (like CDNs) are typically essential for site functionality.

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data or ‘NO DATA’">
- Ensure the extension is properly installed and enabled.
- Refresh the website tab to initiate new network activity.
- Check that necessary permissions are granted (see installation guide).
- Confirm your browser version supports the webRequest API (see Supported Browsers & Requirements).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge Count Remains Empty or Zero">
- Visit websites that initiate third-party connections; some sites may have minimal or no third parties.
- Ensure uBO Scope is active for the current tab.
- Restart your browser if the extension badge does not update after activity.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unexpected Domain Names or Unicode Display Issues">
- Domains are converted using Punycode to Unicode for internationalized domain names.
- Some domain names may appear partially or split for clarity; this does not indicate a bug.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
