## What Does the Toolbar Badge Count Mean?

Understanding the number displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon is crucial to interpreting the extension’s insights into your browser's network activity accurately. This page clarifies what the badge count represents, how it differs from traditional block counters used by content blockers, and why this distinction matters for your privacy assessment.

---

### 1. What the Badge Number Represents

The badge count on the uBO Scope icon shows **the number of distinct third-party domains from which your browser fetched resources while viewing the current tab**. This count includes only domains with successful network connections that were allowed by the browser and any content blockers in place.

- It **does not** count blocked or stealth-blocked domains.
- It focuses on domains, not the total number of requests.

This number is a direct indicator of the breadth of third-party exposure your browser experiences on a webpage.


### 2. Why Distinct Domains Matter Over Request Counts

Many webpages make dozens or even hundreds of network requests, but these often come from a handful of third-party domains such as CDNs, analytics services, ad networks, or social media widgets.

Counting **distinct third-party domains** rather than requests provides a clearer picture of privacy exposure because:

- Each domain represents a unique external source capable of tracking you or delivering content.
- Multiple requests to the same domain do not increase the scope of exposure beyond that domain.

Thus, the badge number gives you a realistic assessment of your third-party footprint on the site you're visiting.


### 3. How This Differs From Traditional Block Counts

Content blockers often show a count on their toolbar icon representing the **number of blocked requests**. This approach can be misleading:

- A higher blocked request count does **not** necessarily mean fewer third-party connections; a blocker might block many individual requests but still allow connections to several distinct domains.
- uBO Scope's badge shows **allowed connections to distinct third-party domains**, which aligns with privacy risk rather than merely blocking activity.


#### Example Scenario
Consider two content blockers:

- Blocker A blocks 50 requests but allows connections from 10 third-party domains.
- Blocker B blocks 30 requests but allows connections from 20 distinct third-party domains.

While Blocker A shows a higher blocked count, Blocker B actually exposes you to more third-party domains, representing a greater privacy risk.


### 4. What About Blocked and Stealth-Blocked Domains?

uBO Scope categorizes domains into three outcomes:

- **Allowed**: Domains with successful connections counted in the badge.
- **Blocked**: Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains stealth-blocked by techniques designed to remain hidden from webpages.

The toolbar badge count **exclusively counts the allowed domains** because these represent actual third-party connections, reflecting what the browser retrieved successfully.


### 5. Practical Tips for Using the Badge Count

- **Aim for a lower badge number** to reduce third-party exposure and enhance privacy.
- Use the uBO Scope popup interface to explore which domains are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked for a more detailed understanding.
- Do not rely on block counts from other tools or extension badges as direct privacy indicators.


### 6. Common Questions & Misconceptions

<AccordionGroup title="Buttoning Up Common Questions">
<Accordion title="Does the badge count all network requests?">
No, it counts only the distinct third-party domains with successful connections. Multiple requests to the same domain count as one.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is a higher badge count better because it means more blocking?">
No. A higher badge count means your browser connected to more third-party domains, indicating greater exposure, which is less desirable.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are blocked and stealth-blocked domains included in the badge?">
No, only allowed domains are counted. Blocked and stealth-blocked domains are detailed in the popup but do not affect the badge.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why not show the number of blocked requests too?">
uBO Scope focuses on revealing real third-party exposure, which blocking request counts alone do not reflect accurately. The extension prioritizes clarity over potentially misleading metrics.

### 8. Summary

The uBO Scope badge count is your window into **how many distinct third-party domains your browser connected to** on a given page. This metric prioritizes accuracy in assessing privacy exposure over simple blockage statistics, helping you make informed decisions in your browsing hygiene and blocker choice.

Proper interpretation of this badge count empowers you to see beyond misleading block counts and understand your real-world network connections plainly.

<Tip>
Aim to minimize the toolbar badge count to enhance your online privacy—less third-party domain connections mean less tracking surface.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use the popup panel for a detailed breakdown of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains to contextualize the badge count effectively.
</Tip>

<Info>
Remember that some legitimate third-party domains, like CDNs, are necessary and common; a very low count is desirable but not always zero.
</Info>

<Warning>
Be cautious about drawing conclusions based on block counts alone from other extensions or tests; uBO Scope provides a unique, clearer perspective.
</Warning>

## Appendix: How the Badge Is Computed (Technical Insight)

While not necessary for basic use, understanding the background helps:

- The extension tracks network requests on a per-tab basis.
- It aggregates each request’s remote domain if the connection succeeded and was allowed.
- It maintains distinct sets of domains under categories: allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked.
- The badge count is set to the number of unique allowed domains for the active tab.

This approach ensures real-time accuracy reflecting your current tab’s third-party network exposure.
