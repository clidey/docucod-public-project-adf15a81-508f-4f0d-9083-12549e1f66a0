# Does uBO Scope test ad blockers or reveal hidden activity?

uBO Scope is designed as a transparent privacy and network connection analyzer—not as an ad blocker tester or detector of hidden blocking activity. This FAQ clarifies common misconceptions about block counts and demonstrates how uBO Scope provides meaningful insight into real-world network behavior, going beyond misleading 'ad blocker test' websites.

---

## Why doesn’t uBO Scope provide block counts like typical content blockers?

Many users expect block counts to be the primary metric of content blocking quality. However, uBO Scope intentionally **does not** focus on counting blocked requests as a measure of effectiveness. Instead, it tracks **distinct third-party domains that your browser connects to successfully**.

This approach reflects real network activity and privacy exposure far more accurately than block counts:

- A higher block count can paradoxically mean **more distinct third-party connections are still allowed**, indicating less effective blocking overall.
- Counting blocked requests inflates numbers but does not guarantee fewer allowed connections or better privacy.

**uBO Scope’s badge count is the number of distinct third-party remote servers successfully connected to. A lower badge count means fewer third-party connections and better privacy exposure.**

---

## Does uBO Scope test or rank ad blockers based on their block counts?

No. Counting blocked requests alone is an unreliable and misleading method to assess ad blockers or content blockers. uBO Scope’s purpose is to:

- Reveal **actual network connections**, including those allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Provide data about **distinct third parties loading resources on the page**, which genuinely corresponds to your privacy exposure.
- Debunk myths like “more blocks mean better blocking.”

uBO Scope **is not a tool to compare block numbers or “scores” across blockers**. Instead, it shows the **true network footprint under any blocking scenario**.

---

## What about "ad blocker test" websites? Do they show real blocker effectiveness?

<u>These sites are inadequate and should be avoided as a benchmark for real blocker performance.</u>

**Here's why:**

- They create **unrealistic and artificial network scenarios** that do not exist in real-world browsing.
- Many extension-based blockers use **stealth techniques** that obfuscate blocking behavior to prevent webpage breakage or detection.
- These tests only observe whether a request is visibly blocked, but they cannot detect stealth-blocking or complex network resolution.

Thus, the “pass” or “fail” on these sites does not correspond to how effectively an extension blocks distinct third-party connections in the wild.

uBO Scope reveals **all connections attempted or made**, independent of such tests, giving you a realistic view.

---

## How does uBO Scope reveal meaningful network activity?

uBO Scope uses browser APIs to listen to all network requests your browser makes, categorizing them as:

- **Allowed:** Connections succeeded and went through.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed or were explicitly blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests redirected or blocked invisibly (stealth mode), which typical tests do not see.

The extension then aggregates these at the domain level and presents these outcomes through a simple popup interface and toolbar badge.

This approach means **each domain listed reflects actual network behavior**, helping you see the true impact of your content blockers.

---

## Can uBO Scope detect hidden or stealth blocking techniques?

Yes. uBO Scope identifies and categorizes stealth blocking, which refers to cases where a blocker prevents resource loading without an obvious error or visible block event in the network logs.

- Stealth-blocked domains appear separately in the popup interface, giving you insight into blocking that standard tests miss.
- This helps users and filter list maintainers understand complex blocking dynamics beyond just counting failed requests.

---

## How should I interpret the data shown in the uBO Scope popup?

The popup divides domains into three categories:

- **Not blocked (Allowed):** Domains with resources that successfully loaded.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where blocking is active but stealthy.
- **Blocked:** Domains where blocking resulted in explicit errors or failed requests.

You can use this to:

- Assess how many distinct third-party domains your browser contacted.
- Detect if stealth blocking is in effect, providing a more complete picture.
- Understand that lower counts of allowed domains signify stronger privacy protection.

---

## What is the key takeaway about block counts and privacy?

The key insight is this:

> **Counting blocked requests alone is a misleading metric for assessing blocking quality. The number of distinct allowed third-party connections is more meaningful to your privacy.**

uBO Scope empowers you with this real-world measurement, debunking common myths and helping you make informed decisions.

## Tips for using uBO Scope to get the most accurate insights

- Focus on the distinct domains successfully connected rather than raw blocked request counts.
- Pay special attention to the 'stealth-blocked' category to detect stealth blocking.
- Avoid trusting "ad blocker test" sites as an indicator of real-world protection.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your blocker to monitor and understand network activity continuously.
