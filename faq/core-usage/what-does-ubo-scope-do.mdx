# What Does uBO Scope Actually Do?

uBO Scope is a specialized browser extension designed with a clear and singular purpose: to reveal **all the network connections a webpage attempts or successfully makes to remote servers.** It provides users with a transparent, real-time view of which third-party servers each browser tab connects to during web browsing.

## Revealing Outbound Network Connections

Webpages commonly request resources from multiple servers—ads, trackers, CDNs, analytics, and more. Traditional ad or content blockers focus on selectively blocking certain requests, but they don’t show the full spectrum of connections.

uBO Scope, however, is uniquely focused on **exposing every third-party remote server your browser contacts**, regardless of any blocking taking place. It categorizes these connection attempts as follows:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully made.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that were silently redirected or otherwise stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed or were explicitly blocked.

This categorization gives you a comprehensive picture of network activity per tab.

## Reporting the Number of Distinct Third-Party Remote Servers

At the heart of uBO Scope’s interface is the **toolbar badge count**. This badge dynamically displays **the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the active browser tab**.

### Why This Matters:

- The number represents **unique third-party domains** your browser connected to, not just the number of requests.
- A **lower badge number indicates better privacy**, as your browser connects to fewer external servers.
- This insight goes beyond block counts or filter list metrics and reflects actual network exposure.

## How uBO Scope Differs From Traditional Content Blockers

Traditional ad/content blockers:

- Focus on filtering and blocking specific content types or domains based on rules.
- Show counts of blocked items which can be misleading.
- Are affected by stealth techniques and browser-specific behaviors, so their data alone may not fully reflect network activity.

uBO Scope:

- Passively monitors and reports **all network connections as observed via the browser's `webRequest` API**.
- Works independently of any content blocker installed, capturing the true network footprint.
- Provides actionable insights by showing **the actual distinct third-party connections**, helping users assess privacy impact effectively.

## What Users Achieve With uBO Scope

By using uBO Scope, you can:

1. **Gain transparency** about all network connections made by webpages.
2. **Measure privacy exposure** by monitoring the count of distinct third-party servers.
3. **Evaluate blockers objectively** by comparing actual third-party connection counts rather than block numbers.
4. **Identify stealth blocking** behavior by spotting stealth-blocked connections.
5. **Understand real-world network activity** rather than relying on fabricated test pages or block lists.

## Practical Example Workflow

Imagine you're visiting a news website. While your usual ad blocker might show that it blocked dozens of requests, you want to know how many unique third-party servers are actually contacted:

- Open uBO Scope, and look at the badge count on the toolbar. Suppose it says "15", meaning 15 distinct third-party servers.
- Open the popup panel to see which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- If another blocker shows a higher block count but your badge count goes up, you realize it might be allowing more unique server connections.

This real-world data helps you make informed decisions about privacy and blocker effectiveness.

## Important Notes & Limitations

- uBO Scope reports based on the browser's `webRequest` API; requests made outside this API (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS handled beyond webRequest) are not visible.
- The extension complements content blockers but does not replace them — it’s a diagnostic and analytical tool.
- Third-party servers aren’t inherently bad; many, such as content delivery networks (CDNs), serve legitimate purposes.
