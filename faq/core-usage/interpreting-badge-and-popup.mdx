# How Do I Interpret the Badge and Popup UI?

Understanding the toolbar badge and the popup panel is essential to harnessing uBO Scope’s full potential for monitoring your browsing privacy. This page guides you step-by-step through reading the badge count, decoding the popup categories, and using these insights to quickly assess your exposure to third-party remote servers.

---

## 1. What Does the Toolbar Badge Count Represent?

The toolbar badge shows a single number relevant to your active browser tab:

- **That number is the count of distinct third-party remote servers the current webpage connected to where at least one network request succeeded.**

This represents how many different third-party domains your browser communicated with while loading or interacting with the active tab.

### Why is This Important?

Each domain on the badge is a server your browser reached outside the first-party site. Tracking this number helps you quickly assess:

- How many potentially privacy-impacting third parties your browsing session involves
- How well your content blockers limit external connections

### What Is a Third-Party Remote Server?

A third-party remote server is any domain that differs from the main website domain you are visiting. For example, if you visit `example.com` and your browser loads resources from `cdn.example.net` or `analytics.someservice.com`, these count as third-party remote servers.

<u>Tip:</u> uBO Scope relies on the browser’s publicly available [webRequest API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest) to track all network requests and categorize them accordingly.

---

## 2. Why Is a Lower Badge Count Generally Better?

From a privacy standpoint, fewer third-party connections means fewer external parties can track or profile your browsing.

- A zero or very low count implies minimal exposure
- A higher count suggests more servers possibly tracking or providing extraneous resources

<u>Example:</u> If you see a badge count of 10 on a news site with many embedded ads and trackers, and only 2 on a privacy-focused site, this reflects the expected difference in third-party exposure.

## 3. Understanding the Popup Panel Sections

Clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon opens a popup with a detailed breakdown of network connection outcomes for the current tab.

The panel is divided into three clear outcome categories:

### a. Not Blocked (Allowed)

- Lists third-party domains from which requests succeeded and were allowed to load.
- These connections actually delivered resources to your browser.

### b. Stealth-Blocked

- Represents domains from which network requests were stealthily blocked.
- These may be blocked in such a way that the page or other blockers are unaware.

### c. Blocked

- Lists domains whose requests were actively blocked, causing request failures reported by the browser.

Each section shows:

- **Domain name (in Unicode for readability)**
- **A count of successful or attempted connections for that domain**

If a section is empty, it is hidden to keep the UI focused.

### How to Read the Domain Lists:

- Domains listed here are aggregated from hostnames involved in requests.
- You can use these lists to identify domains allowed or blocked on the page.
- Seeing many domains in the stealth or blocked list indicates your blockers are actively preventing connections.

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Observe the Badge Count">
  The badge number offers an at-a-glance privacy health check for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Open the Popup Panel">
  Click the toolbar icon to get detailed context about the badge count.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Review Allowed Domains">
  Check which third parties are actually connected; these matter most for tracking risks.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: Investigate Stealth and Blocked Domains">
  Stealth-blocked domains hint at subtle blocking layers; blocked domains show explicit prevention.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 5: Use Findings to Adjust Your Content Blockers">
  If too many domains are allowed, consider tuning blocker settings or lists.

## 5. Common User Questions

<AccordionGroup title="FAQ About Badge and Popup Interpretation">
<Accordion title="Why do some sites show a high badge count despite using content blockers?">
Some sites load resources from many legitimate third-party servers like CDNs and analytics. High counts do not always mean poor privacy but indicate many external connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does it mean if I see domains in the stealth-blocked section?">
Stealth-blocked domains indicate requests that were blocked quietly to avoid detection or page breakage. This shows that blocking is in effect without alerting the site.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can the badge count ever be zero?">
Yes, on privacy-focused sites or pages with few or no third-party content, the badge can show zero.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why are some domains shown in multiple sections?">
Domains are categorized based on individual request outcomes during page load. Some domains may have requests that succeeded and others that were blocked; the UI summarizes these as per the latest session data.

## 6. Troubleshooting Badge or Popup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Steps">
<Accordion title="Badge count is always zero or missing">
- Verify the extension is installed and enabled.
- Ensure permissions for webRequest APIs are granted.
- Confirm you are on a valid webpage (some internal browser pages won’t have data).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty sections">
- Wait a few seconds for data collection after page load.
- Reload the page and open the popup again.
- Check for browser compatibility issues or conflicting extensions affecting data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count seems inaccurate or delayed">
- Network requests are processed with slight delay; patience ensures accuracy.
- Avoid rapid tab switching to allow data to stabilize.
</Accordion>

## 7. Best Practices and Tips

- Regularly monitor badge counts to understand changes in site third-party connections.
- Use the detailed domain lists to identify suspicious connections or trackers.
- Combine insights from uBO Scope with your content blocker’s interface for deeper analysis.
- Remember, a lower badge count means fewer third parties have network access, boosting your privacy.
