# Why is the Block Count from Other Blockers Misleading?

Understanding how content blockers report their activity is essential to accurately evaluate their effectiveness. This page clarifies why relying on the block count displayed by other content blockers can misguide privacy-conscious users and why uBO Scope champions a more meaningful metric: the number of distinct remote third parties contacted.

---

## The Myth Around Block Counts

Many users assume that a higher block count means better protection — more elements/referrals blocked equals a stronger content blocker. However, this assumption is often **false** and can lead to poor privacy choices.

### What is the Block Count?

The block count typically reflects how many network requests or elements a content blocker has prevented from loading. This number is displayed as a badge or summary metric in many blockers.

### Why This Metric Can Be Misleading

- **Multiplicity of Requests:** One third-party server may serve many requests (images, scripts, trackers), each counted separately. So a high block count might simply indicate a high volume of requests blocked from a **smaller number of servers**.
- **False Sense of Security:** A blocker that blocks many requests can still allow connections to **more distinct remote third parties**, increasing your exposure.
- **Allowed Connections Matter More:** What truly affects privacy is the number of **distinct third-party remote servers that are not blocked** and successfully loaded resources. More unique connections generally mean more tracking potential.

<Tip>
Think of block count as ‘how many bullets were stopped,’ but the better privacy measure is ‘how many distinct shooters were allowed to fire.’

## What Matters: Distinct Third-Party Remote Servers

uBO Scope focuses on reporting the **number of unique third-party remote servers your browser connected to**, regardless of which content blocker you use.

### Why Unique Remote Servers?

- Each distinct third-party server potentially represents a unique tracking or data-collecting entity.
- Reducing the number of unique servers contacted minimizes your digital footprint and exposure.

When evaluating blockers, your priority should be lowering the number of unique third-party domains reached, **not** maximizing how many requests were blocked.

## How uBO Scope Provides Meaningful Insights

### Independent Measurement

uBO Scope sits alongside your content blockers and listens to **actual network requests** through the browser's `webRequest` API. It passively reports:

- Which third-party domains were contacted
- Which were blocked
- Which were stealth-blocked or allowed

This data is unaffected by the internal counting mechanisms of blockers and reveals what ultimately happens on the network.

### Clear UI Distinctions

The popup panel and toolbar badge show:

- **Allowed:** Domains and counts of requests that succeeded
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were blocked silently to avoid webpage breakage
- **Blocked:** Domains which failed due to blocking

This separation helps users understand not just how many requests are blocked, but whether diverse third-party servers are still reachable.

## Real-World Scenario: Comparing Two Blockers

| Blocker A                       | Blocker B                      |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Block count: 1500               | Block count: 900               |
| Distinct allowed servers: 15   | Distinct allowed servers: 30   |

At first glance, Blocker A with a higher block count seems better. But in reality, Blocker B allows connections to twice the number of unique third-party servers, posing a higher privacy risk.

## Additional Myths Debunked by uBO Scope

### "Ad Blocker Test" Webpages

Many so-called "ad blocker test" websites are misleading and not reflective of real-world browsing:

- They generate artificial network requests to fake domains.
- Many blockers use stealth techniques making those sites unable to detect true blocking.

uBO Scope exposes actual network connections to real third parties, providing a trustworthy view beyond synthetic tests.

## Best Practices for Users and Evaluators

- **Focus on unique third-party domain counts, not raw block counts.**
- Use uBO Scope’s popup and badge to monitor real-time connections per tab.
- Avoid judging extension quality by block counts alone, especially if they are sourced from synthetic test sites.
- Consider privacy impact as lowering exposure to distinct third parties, which uBO Scope makes transparent.

<Tip>
For filter list maintainers and advanced users, uBO Scope’s insights help refine blockers’ rules to minimize third-party reach rather than just increasing blocked request counts.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions About Block Counts">
<Accordion title="Why doesn’t a higher block count always mean better protection?">
Not all blocked requests are equal; a high number of blocked requests might come from just a few servers making many requests. The blocker may allow connections to more unique third parties, compromising privacy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I verify the number of third-party servers contacted?">
uBO Scope’s toolbar badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains contacted per active tab, and the popup provides detailed categorization.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can content blockers manipulate the block count?">
Yes. Different blockers count differently (e.g., counting individual resource requests), making comparisons unreliable. uBO Scope’s independent measurement bypasses this.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope affect browser performance or privacy?">
No. uBO Scope passively listens to browser events and does not block or interfere with traffic itself.
</Accordion>

## Summary

Choosing the best content blocker requires focusing on what really affects your privacy—the number of unique third-party remote servers contacted—rather than the raw block counts. uBO Scope empowers users with transparent, accurate insights independent of how blockers count their activity, debunking false assumptions caused by misleading block metrics. Use uBO Scope to get a crystal-clear picture of your browsing exposure and make informed privacy decisions.
