# What Does the Badge Count Mean?

The badge count displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon is a concise, real-time indicator of your active browser tab's network interactions with third-party remote servers. Understanding what this number represents and its significance is essential for accurately interpreting your privacy exposure and the effectiveness of your content blocking.

---

## 1. Understanding the Badge Count

### What the Badge Represents
- The badge number indicates **the count of distinct third-party remote domains** your active tab has connected to.
- It aggregates all unique domains from network requests that succeeded (allowed) during the session.
- **Third-party** means domains different from the main site you are visiting.

### Why Third-Party Domains Matter
- Third-party connections often include ads, trackers, CDNs, and other content not controlled by the primary website.
- While some third parties (like well-known CDNs) are necessary for site functionality, the fewer third parties contacted, the smaller your privacy exposure usually is.

### How the Count is Calculated
- uBO Scope monitors network requests using the browser's `webRequest` API.
- It **counts unique domains only once**, regardless of the number of connections or resources loaded from them.
- Connections blocked by content blockers or failing for other reasons are not included in the badge count.

---

## 2. Why a Lower Badge Count is Preferable

- **Fewer distinct third parties usually mean better privacy** because your browser communicates with fewer external entities.
- High badge counts indicate many connections to different servers, which could increase tracking risks or unnecessary data exposure.
- However, a low count does not guarantee perfect privacy but is a helpful heuristic to assess the surface of third-party network interactions.

## 3. Common Misconceptions about the Badge Number

<u>Misconception:</u> *Higher block counts or badge numbers always mean stronger content blocking.*

<u>Reality:</u>

- The badge counts **allowed** third-party domains, not how many were blocked.
- A content blocker reporting many blocked requests might still allow connections to numerous third-party domains, resulting in a higher badge count.
- Therefore, a higher block count can ironically accompany more third-party connections, indicating less effective blocking.

<u>Misconception:</u> *The badge number counts all network requests.*

<u>Reality:</u>

- Only **distinct third-party domains** that have successful connections count towards the badge.
- Repeated requests to the same domain do not increase the badge number.
- Blocked, stealth-blocked, or failed requests are excluded.

<u>Misconception:</u> *The badge count fully reflects your entire browsing privacy landscape.*

<u>Reality:</u>

- The badge count only reflects connections reported through the browser's `webRequest` API.
- Network requests outside this scope (e.g., native apps, DNS-based blocking) are not tracked.

## 4. How uBO Scope Measures and Updates the Badge

### Real-Time Monitoring
- The extension listens to events such as redirects, errors, and successful network responses.
- For the active tab, it tracks domains connected to and updates the badge with the total count.

### Session Tracking
- The domain count resets when navigating to a new main document (new page load).
- The badge updates dynamically to reflect ongoing network activity.

### Example Scenario

Imagine you're visiting `example.com`, and the page loads resources from the following domains:

- `cdn.example.com` (first-party)
- `tracker1.com` (third-party)
- `ads.adserver.com` (third-party)
- `tracker1.com` (repeat, same third-party domain)

The badge count:
- Counts only `tracker1.com` and `ads.adserver.com` as distinct third-party domains → badge shows `2`.
- Does **not** increment for repeated requests to `tracker1.com`.

## 5. Tips and Best Practices for Users

- Use the badge count as a quick privacy exposure indicator for the active tab.
- Click the toolbar icon to open the popup and see a detailed breakdown of connected domains categorized as:
  - Allowed (connected)
  - Blocked
  - Stealth-blocked (blocked in ways designed to be invisible to pages)
- Monitor badge count changes as you navigate across sites to understand third-party footprint.
- Lower badge counts typically correspond to tighter network control and better privacy.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues

### Badge Count Not Updating
- Ensure uBO Scope is properly installed and active.
- Check that the browser has granted all necessary permissions for webRequest monitoring.
- Refresh the tab or navigate to a new page to trigger a badge update.

### Badge Shows Zero or Blank
- Indicates no distinct third-party domains connected yet for the active tab.
- Could occur on new tabs or pages with no third-party resources.

### Badge Count Higher Than Expected
- The site likely contacts multiple third-party domains.
- Consider reviewing the popup details to identify domains.
- Use stricter content blocking or filter lists to reduce third-party connections.

<Tip>
Use uBO Scope’s badge as an immediate privacy gauge — a simple number reflecting the diversity of external domains your browser connects to. Remember, it’s a count of unique successful third-party domains, not total connections or blocks.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Beware of interpreting content blockers’ block counts or external "ad blocker test" websites as definitive indicators of privacy. The badge count focuses on unique third-party connection exposure, a more meaningful metric.
