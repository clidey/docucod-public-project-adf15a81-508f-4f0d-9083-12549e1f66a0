# How Do I Interpret the Results in the Popup?

Understanding the popup interface is your gateway to gaining clear, actionable insights into the network activity triggered by the active browser tab. This page guides you step-by-step through reading and making sense of the categorized domain connection information shown in the uBO Scope popup, empowering you to confidently assess privacy implications on any webpage.

---

## Overview of the Popup Interface

When you open the uBO Scope popup, you are presented with a focused summary of the third-party domains the active tab interacts with, categorized by how the network requests were handled:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked)**
- **Stealth-Blocked**
- **Blocked**

At the top, the popup header displays the current page's hostname and domain for quick context. Below, a domain count summary shows the number of **unique third-party domains** connected during the session.

Each category section lists relevant domains alongside a count representing the number of remote connections made to that domain.

---

## What Each Category Means

### 1. Allowed (Not Blocked)

This section lists third-party domains to which the browser successfully connected. These connections were neither blocked by any content blocker nor stealth-blocked. The presence of domains here means resources or data were received from these remote servers.

- **User value:** Identifying allowed domains shows which third parties actively interact with the website.
- **Privacy impact:** A high number of allowed third parties increases potential privacy exposure.

### 2. Stealth-Blocked

Domains listed under stealth-blocked are those for which the connection attempts were intercepted and hidden by content blockers in a way that makes the webpage unaware of the blocking. This advanced blocking prevents certain scripts or resources from loading silently.

- **User value:** Reveals hidden blocking that the webpage cannot detect.
- **Privacy impact:** Indicates strong protection against trackers that try to evade detection.

### 3. Blocked

The blocked category shows third-party domains explicitly blocked by content blockers, preventing connections.

- **User value:** Shows which domains were prevented from loading resources.
- **Privacy impact:** Indicates active blocking; however, the extension also reports stealth-blocked domains, which may not appear here.

---

## Reading the Domain List and Counts

- **Domain Names:** Displayed in Unicode to ensure clarity even for internationalized domain names.
- **Connection Counts:** The number next to each domain indicates how many distinct remote connections (requests) were made to that domain during the current session.
- **Sorting:** Domains are sorted alphabetically within each category for easy lookup.

---

## Practical User Scenarios

Imagine browsing a news site. The popup will reveal:

- CDN domains in the Allowed section (e.g., `cdn.example.com`) delivering site assets.
- Tracker domains stealth-blocked (e.g., ad networks attempting to load but hidden).
- Domains outright blocked (e.g., third-party analytics domains you explicitly block).

This visibility lets you verify if your desired privacy protections are working and which third parties your browser talks to.

---

## Best Practices for Using the Popup

- Use the popup regularly to check privacy exposure on new websites, especially those with many third-party resources.
- Investigate suspicious or unknown domains by researching them to understand their role.
- Pay attention to the stealth-blocked list for invisible blocking that protects you silently.
- Combine information here with the toolbar badge count for a quick privacy overview.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **No Data Displayed:** If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or no domains, ensure uBO Scope is installed and active correctly (see installation guides).
- **Domain Names Not Displayed Clearly:** The extension converts internationalized domain names to Unicode for readability.
- **High Number of Allowed Domains:** Indicates lower privacy; consider refining filters or blocking more domains.
- **Understanding Stealth vs Blocked:** Stealth-blocked domains do not appear in the toolbar badge count but contribute substantially to blocking effectiveness.

## Step-by-Step Example to Interpret Popup Results

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the toolbar icon to open the popup displaying domain connections relevant to the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the Page Hostname and Domain">
Note the hostname shown at the top; this is the site you are inspecting.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Summary Count">
Check the total number of unique allowed domains connected — this number is your immediate privacy exposure indicator.
</Step>
<Step title="Explore Allowed Domains">
Look through the "not blocked" section to see which third parties successfully served content.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Review the "stealth-blocked" section to find hidden blocks that protect against secret trackers.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Blocked Domains">
See which connections were explicitly blocked in the "blocked" section.
</Step>
<Step title="Assess Privacy Exposure">
Weigh the number and nature of domains across categories to understand if additional blocking or filters are needed.
</Step>
</Steps>
