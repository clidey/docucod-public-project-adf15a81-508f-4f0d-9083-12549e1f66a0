# How Are Feature Requests or Updates Handled?

uBO Scope is designed as a focused, minimalistic browser extension that transparently reports network requests made by your browser. Its core functionality is stable and mature, and the developer does not plan to release frequent updates. This page explains how feature requests and update plans are managed, especially for filter list maintainers and technically advanced users.

## Development Cadence and Update Philosophy

Unlike many extensions with rapid release cycles, uBO Scope follows a conservative and measured update approach. This ensures stability, reliability, and a consistent user experience without frequent disruptions.

- **Infrequent Updates:** Updates happen rarely and usually only to address critical issues or to add features that significantly benefit specialized users such as filter list maintainers.
- **Focus on Core Purpose:** The extension prioritizes reliability in its primary role — accurately revealing network connections per browser tab.
- **No Frequent Feature Additions:** Most features are thoughtfully considered before inclusion, avoiding bloat and maintaining simplicity.

This approach resonates particularly well with power users who depend on consistent data for privacy audits and maintaining filter lists.

## How to Submit Feature Requests or Ideas

User feedback and community input are essential, especially to evolve uBO Scope in ways that help users who maintain filter lists or require deeper network visibility. Here is how you can contribute:

1. **GitHub Issues Page:**
   - The official place to suggest features or report bugs is the GitHub repository's [Issues section](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/issues).
   - When submitting, please provide detailed descriptions, use cases, and, if possible, examples or scenarios demonstrating the value of the request.
2. **Respect the Minimalistic Vision:**
   - Since the project focuses on a narrow domain, feature requests aligned with enhancing network insights or helping filter list maintainers will receive higher consideration.
3. **Community Engagement:**
   - Engage with other community members on discussions or forums to refine your idea before formal submission.

## What to Expect in Future Releases

While uBO Scope currently fulfills its main function effectively, planned future capabilities will be modest but targeted:

- **Enhanced Details for Power Users:**
  - Improvements in visibility into network requests and richer contextual data.
  - Tools or visualizations that help filter list maintainers better understand the nature of network connections.
- **Maintenance and Compatibility:**
  - Periodic updates to ensure compatibility with new browser versions and APIs.
- **Limited New Features:**
  - Any additional features will maintain the extension's core philosophy — no unnecessary complexity or broad scope expansion.

## Tips for Feature Requesters and Users

- **Provide Clear Use Cases:** Explain how the requested feature helps in real-world privacy or filter list maintenance scenarios.
- **Explore Existing Features:** Before requesting, consult the [Feature Overview](../overview/system-architecture-overview/feature-summary) and the [Popup & Badge Interpretation](../faq/core-usage/interpreting-badge-and-popup) to understand what uBO Scope currently offers.
- **Be Patient:** Given the deliberate release cadence, expect that your suggestion may take time to be reviewed and potentially accepted.

## Summary

uBO Scope’s development is intentionally conservative, emphasizing stability and precise network insights. Users and filter list maintainers interested in new capabilities are encouraged to contribute thoughtfully via GitHub, focusing on features that align with the extension’s focused mission. Anticipate occasional, targeted updates enhancing data detail and usability.
