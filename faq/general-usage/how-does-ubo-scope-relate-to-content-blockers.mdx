# How does uBO Scope relate to content blockers?

Understanding the relationship between uBO Scope and content blockers like uBlock Origin is essential to fully appreciate the unique value uBO Scope brings. This page clarifies uBO Scope's role as an independent monitoring and reporting tool rather than a content blocker itself, explains how it complements other blockers, and addresses common misconceptions.

## What is uBO Scope's Role Compared to Content Blockers?

uBO Scope is designed primarily to **observe and report** network connections that your browser attempts or completes, including those allowed or blocked by other tools. It does **not** block or interfere with network requests itself. Instead, it offers a transparent, unbiased view of all outgoing remote server connections your browser processes, giving you crucial insight into what third-party connections actually occur.

### Key Points:

- **uBO Scope is a measurement tool, not a blocker.**
- It detects network requests regardless of which content blocker or filtering method is active.
- It counts and categorizes connections into *allowed*, *stealth-blocked*, or *blocked* — revealing the real connections, not just those impacted by a particular blocker.
- The badge count on the toolbar icon shows the number of **distinct third-party domains** your browser connected to successfully (allowed).

<Tip>
A lower badge count means fewer distinct third-party remote servers were connected to, which generally indicates better privacy protection.

## How Does uBO Scope Work Alongside Content Blockers?

Content blockers like uBlock Origin or DNS filtering solutions prevent certain network requests from completing based on filter lists and rules. uBO Scope passively listens to the browser's network traffic via the webRequest API and records:

- Which third-party servers received connection attempts.
- Whether these requests were successfully allowed, blocked by the browser or network, or stealthily redirected/hidden.

This means:

- **uBO Scope reflects the actual outcome of content blockers without affecting them.**
- Even if a content blocker silently blocks a request (e.g., stealth blocking to avoid site breakage), uBO Scope can report it.
- The extension works transparently with any content blocker or no content blocker at all.

<Info>
This separation ensures you see the true state of network connections and are not misled by block counts or blockers’ UI representations.

## Common User Questions & Clarifications

### Why is uBO Scope not blocking connections?

Because its design goal is to **reveal** all connections indiscriminately, allowing you to see what is truly happening under the hood, rather than influencing your browsing experience by blocking.

### Can uBO Scope influence or control content blockers?

No. It operates independently and only observes network requests. It cannot modify, enable, or disable other extensions or browser-level blocking.

### How does uBO Scope define "allowed", "blocked", and "stealth-blocked"?

- **Allowed**: Network requests that successfully connected to servers.
- **Blocked**: Requests that were stopped and did not reach the remote server.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Requests that were redirected or blocked in a way that's intended to be invisible to the webpage (common in sophisticated content blockers).

Refer to the [Key Terms & Concepts](../core-concepts-arch/core-terminology) page for detailed definitions.

## Why Should You Use uBO Scope Together With Content Blockers?

### 1. **Gain Transparency Beyond Block Counts**

Content blockers may provide a block count, but that number alone is not a reliable indicator of effectiveness. The number of distinct allowed third-party servers is a much clearer signal of your privacy exposure.

<u>Example:</u>

> Two blockers may have different block counts, but uBO Scope shows you which one results in fewer connections to third-party servers—meaning better privacy.

### 2. **Reveal Stealth Blocking and Other Subtleties**

Some blockers stealth block requests to avoid detection or site breakage. uBO Scope reveals these attempts, helping experts or filter list maintainers understand actual network behavior.

### 3. **Independently Verify Blocker Results**

If you want to audit your content blocker’s effectiveness or compare multiple blockers, uBO Scope provides independent data straight from browser network events.

<Tip>
Use the uBO Scope popup interface to view categorized domains connected vs blocked, and watch the badge count for real-time feedback.
</Tip>

## What uBO Scope Does NOT Do Compared To Content Blockers

- It does **not** block ads, trackers, scripts, or resources.
- It does **not** modify webpages or prevent page elements from loading.
- It does **not** filter or whitelist domains itself.

It simply reports the **outcomes** of requests, so you can make informed decisions or analyses.

---

## How uBO Scope Collects and Classifies Network Connection Data

Behind the scenes, uBO Scope uses the browser’s `webRequest` API to observe every network request:

- Tracks requests on a per-tab basis.
- Uses domain and hostname analysis based on public suffixes.
- Maintains categorized outcomes for each domain per tab.
- Updates the badge count dynamically to reflect live browsing.

This approach ensures a reliable, comprehensive view of network activity without interfering.

## Troubleshooting Common Misunderstandings

### Why might my content blocker show a high block count, but uBO Scope badge count is not low?

Because a higher block count does not necessarily mean fewer connections. uBO Scope shows actual successful connections; your blocker could be hiding connections or allowing more third-party servers even if blocking many requests.

### Can uBO Scope detect blocking done outside the browser?

uBO Scope relies on browser `webRequest` events. Blocking done at the network level (e.g., via DNS filters or VPNs) may or may not be fully visible, depending on whether the browser reports the blocked request.

### What if uBO Scope shows connections despite using a strong content blocker?

This is expected: some third-party connections are legitimate and necessary (e.g., CDNs). The goal is to be aware, not to eliminate all.
