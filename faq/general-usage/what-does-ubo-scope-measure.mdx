# What does uBO Scope measure?

Understanding what uBO Scope measures is crucial to leveraging its full power in monitoring your web browsing privacy. This documentation explains the core focus of uBO Scope on counting distinct third-party domains your browser connects to, how the toolbar badge represents this data, and why this offers insightful transparency beyond typical content blockers.

---

## 1. Introduction to uBO Scope’s Measurement Focus

uBO Scope is built to accurately report **the number of distinct third-party remote servers** your browser contacts when you visit a webpage. This count is presented as a badge on the extension’s toolbar icon.

- **Third-party remote servers** are domains outside the one belonging to the page you are visiting.
- uBO Scope does **not** measure the number of individual network requests but rather the unique third-party domains involved.

This distinction makes the badge count a highly valuable privacy metric, giving you a clear sense of how many external entities a page communicates with.

<Tip>
Lower badge counts signal better privacy insulation, as fewer third-party domains mean fewer opportunities for tracking or unwanted connections.
</Tip>

## 2. What Does the Toolbar Badge Count Represent?

The number displayed in the badge on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon corresponds to the **count of unique third-party domains from which resources were successfully loaded or allowed on the current tab**.

- It excludes first-party domain connections belonging to the active webpage.
- It includes domains that uBO Scope has observed as "allowed" —connections that went through successfully.

### Why Focus on Unique Domains?
Counting unique domains rather than simply blocked requests or raw connection numbers reveals a truer picture of your privacy exposure.

- Many third-party domains are trackers or advertisers.
- A high unique third-party domain count increases your tracking surface.
- A low count, often just limited to essential services like CDNs, reflects better privacy hygiene.

## 3. How Does uBO Scope Differ from Other Content Blocker Metrics?

Many content blockers and privacy extensions report block counts or total network requests. uBO Scope’s approach is fundamentally different:

| Aspect           | Other Content Blockers                          | uBO Scope                               |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Badge Number     | Often shows total blocked requests or ads      | Shows distinct third-party **allowed** domains |
| What Matters?    | Block count mistaken for effectiveness          | Transparency of domains that actually connected |
| Relation to Privacy| Misleading; high block count may mean more connections | Clear privacy metric: lower third-party domains better |

---

## 4. Understanding the Connection Outcomes Shown in uBO Scope’s Popup

The extension categorizes third-party connections as follows (visible in the popup panel):

- **Allowed (not blocked):** Connections allowed to third-party domains.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections that were redirected or modified stealthily.
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked or errored.

The badge count specifically tallies **allowed third-party domains**—the ones that actually contributed network traffic.

---

## 5. Why a Lower Third-Party Domain Count Is Desirable

A lower count corresponds to:

- Fewer external entities tracking or interacting with your browser.
- Reduced attack surface from additional third-party servers.
- Less exposure to unnecessary content fetching.

For example, a website that contacts only a few trusted CDNs will have a much lower badge count than a site contacting dozens of advertising and tracking domains.

<Tip>
Be aware that some third-party remote servers (e.g., content delivery networks) are legitimate and typically few in number, so a small count is expected.
</Tip>

## 6. Real-World Scenario

Imagine surfing a news website:

- The page itself is from `example.com` (first-party).
- The site loads images from `cdn.example.com` and analytics from `tracker.example.net`.

uBO Scope will display a badge count of **2** for the two third-party domains (`cdn.example.com` and `tracker.example.net`). This informs you there are two external connections beyond the site you’re visiting.

If a content blocker blocks `tracker.example.net`, that domain would show under the "blocked" category and **not** count toward the badge. If it’s allowed, it increases your exposure.

---

## 7. How uBO Scope Collects and Processes Data (Brief Overview)

- The extension listens to browser network requests through the `webRequest` API.
- It maps requests to their outcome categories based on success, errors, or redirects.
- It groups connected hostnames into their effective second-level domains using a public suffix list.
- Only unique domains that were allowed are counted for the toolbar badge.

This data then populates the popup’s connection list and updates the badge in near real-time as you browse.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Asked Questions about What uBO Scope Measures">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count only show third-party domains?">
The extension is designed to highlight external connections since those represent potential privacy exposures. First-party domains (the site you visit) are excluded to focus your attention on third parties.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is a higher badge count good or bad?">
A higher badge count means more third-party connections, which generally means greater privacy risk. Strive for lower counts for better privacy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why might my badge count be higher than expected?">
Some pages load many third-party services, including ads, trackers, CDNs, or embedded widgets. Check the popup to see which domains are connected.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope block any connections?">
uBO Scope acts only as a reporting tool and does not block connections itself. It works alongside content blockers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How often is the badge updated?">
Badge updates occur shortly after network events, typically within seconds, reflecting the latest count of allowed third-party domains.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 9. Best Practices for Using uBO Scope’s Metrics

- Use the badge count as a privacy indicator rather than comparing block counts from other blockers.
- Open the popup panel to identify exactly which third-party domains are contacted.
- Combine uBO Scope with your preferred content blockers for active blocking plus transparent reporting.
- Regularly monitor badge counts across sites you visit frequently to detect privacy changes.

# Example: uBO Scope Badge Count in Context

```text
You visit "news.example.com".
- The site itself connects to "cdn.example.com" (delivery of site assets).
- It loads an analytics script from "tracker.analytics.net".
- It contacts "ads.adnetwork.org" for targeted ads.

Badge count displayed by uBO Scope: 3

After enabling a stricter content blocker:
- "tracker.analytics.net" and "ads.adnetwork.org" connections are blocked.

Updated badge count: 1
(The single allowed third-party domain is "cdn.example.com")
```

This transparency allows you to verify your content blockers' impact on reducing third-party connections.
