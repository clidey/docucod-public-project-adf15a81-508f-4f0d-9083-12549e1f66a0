# Which Browsers Does uBO Scope Support?

uBO Scope is designed to provide transparent, real-time reporting of all network connections made by your browser, focusing on privacy and insight into third-party connections. This page details the compatible browsers, highlights any major behavioral or platform-specific differences, and directs you to installation resources for each supported browser distribution.

## Supported Browsers and Minimum Versions

uBO Scope supports the following major browsers, each with specific minimum version requirements to ensure full functionality:

| Browser   | Minimum Version |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Chromium  | 122.0+          |
| Firefox   | 128.0+          |
| Safari    | 18.5+           |


Each browser provides a unique platform environment that uBO Scope leverages to monitor network requests through standardized web extension APIs, notably the `webRequest` API.

<Check>
Ensure your browser is updated to at least these minimum versions. This guarantees uBO Scope can operate without compatibility issues and deliver accurate connection insights.
</Check>

## Platform-Specific Notes and Behavioral Differences

While uBO Scope offers a consistent core experience across browsers, here are distinct considerations by platform:

### Chromium-based Browsers

- Uses a **service worker** as the background script, ensuring efficient and modern extension lifecycle management.
- Accesses network requests including HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket (`ws://`, `wss://`) URLs.
- Minimum supported version is **Chromium 122.0**.
- Permissions requested include `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` for capturing network activity on requested hosts.

### Firefox

- Also utilizes a background module script similar to Chromium but can work across desktop and Android versions (≥128.0).
- Supports monitoring of all network methods including WebSocket.
- Requires permissions identical to Chromium for network monitoring.
- Extensions identified by an internal ID specific to Firefox.

### Safari

- Runs in Safari Web Extensions environment with a module-based background script.
- Minimum supported version is **Safari 18.5**.
- Does **not** currently support WebSocket URL schemes in host permissions, limiting monitoring to HTTP and HTTPS.
- Permissions include `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` but some APIs behave slightly differently due to Safari's extension API nuances.
- Manifest enforces `strict_min_version` at 18.5 ensuring compatibility.

<Tip>
Due to Safari's distinct permission model and API support, some WebSocket connections may not be fully reported. Expect HTTP/HTTPS connection reporting to be complete.
