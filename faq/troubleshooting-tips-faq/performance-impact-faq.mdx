# Can uBO Scope slow down my browser?

uBO Scope is designed with transparency and performance balance in mind. This FAQ addresses common concerns about whether running uBO Scope impacts your browsing speed or browser responsiveness and explains how the extension performs monitoring efficiently.

## How uBO Scope Monitors Network Connections

uBO Scope uses the browser's native `webRequest` API to observe network requests made by webpages. This API enables the extension to record data about each connection attempt *without interfering* with the normal browsing process. 

- **Passive Monitoring:** uBO Scope listens to network events asynchronously and logs outcomes such as success, redirects, or errors.
- **No Blocking or Modification:** Unlike content blockers, uBO Scope does not block or alter requests, eliminating the overhead associated with filtering or modifying network traffic.
- **Batch Processing:** Requests are queued and processed in batches (approximately every 1 second) to reduce runtime overhead and avoid frequent UI updates or heavy computation during high network activity.

This efficient monitoring ensures uBO Scope maintains a low resource footprint.

## Does uBO Scope Affect Browser Speed?

### Minimal Performance Impact

The extensionâ€™s passive use of the `webRequest` API and its batching approach mean that:

- **Network Observation is Lightweight:** Capturing request details is handled natively by the browser and is optimized for extensions.
- **Timer-Based Processing:** Instead of processing each network event immediately, uBO Scope processes groups of requests on a timer, limiting CPU usage spikes.
- **State Management:** Internal data structures are simple maps keyed by domain and hostname for quick lookups and updates.

### Practical User Experience

Users typically do not notice any lag, freezing, or slowdown attributable to uBO Scope. Its design avoids heavy computation or frequent DOM changes during network bursts, so your browsing stays smooth.

<Tip>
If you experience any browser performance issues, verify other extensions are not causing conflicts or excessive resource usage alongside uBO Scope.
</Tip>

## When Does Monitoring Occur?

- Monitoring activates for all network requests initiated by open tabs where uBO Scope is installed and enabled.
- It tracks requests to HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS schemes as allowed by host permissions.
- Monitoring pauses or clears data once tabs are closed to avoid unnecessary resource use.

Monitoring is *real-time* within the scope of what the browser API provides and is scoped only to active tabs.

## Best Practices to Keep Browsing Smooth

- **Keep uBO Scope Updated:** Although infrequent, updates may include performance enhancements.
- **Manage Other Extensions:** Running many heavy extensions simultaneously can affect overall browser speed.
- **Close Unused Tabs:** To reduce monitoring state size and resource consumption.
- **Use Supported Browsers & Recommended Versions:** uBO Scope is optimized for recent Chrome (122+), Firefox (128+), and Safari (18.5+) versions.

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

If you suspect uBO Scope is slowing down your browser:

<AccordionGroup title="Performance Troubleshooting Steps">
<Accordion title="Step 1: Isolate uBO Scope">
Disable all other browser extensions temporarily and check browser performance.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Step 2: Verify Browser Version">
Make sure your browser meets the version requirements where the extension performs optimally.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Step 3: Check Network Activity Intensity">
Heavy sites with thousands of requests may generate more data, but batching and efficient data structures mitigate performance impact.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Step 4: Review Browser Console Logs">
Check the browser's developer console for errors or warnings related to uBO Scope.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Step 5: Restart Browser">
Restarting clears transient states that might affect extension performance.

## Summary

uBO Scope is designed for transparent, efficient monitoring of third-party network connections with negligible impact on browser performance. It achieves this through passive API usage, batching of data processing, and minimal in-memory data structures.

Users should keep their browsers up to date, avoid conflicts with other extensions, and maintain a reasonable number of open tabs to ensure optimal speed.
