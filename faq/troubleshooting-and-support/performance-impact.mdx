# Does uBO Scope Affect Browser Speed or Resource Usage?

uBO Scope is designed with an uncompromising focus on efficiency and minimal impact on your browser's performance. This page details how uBO Scope manages resource usage, the design principles behind its lightweight nature, and practical tips to keep it running smoothly while monitoring your browser’s network connections.

## Understanding uBO Scope's Lightweight Design

Unlike many browser extensions that excessively monitor or manipulate every network request, uBO Scope operates with a focused purpose: to report remote server connections transparently without interfering in your browsing experience.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Minimal Processing Overhead:** uBO Scope listens to the browser’s `webRequest` API events to track network requests. It records only essential information related to connection outcomes (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked), avoiding expensive data processing or analysis.

- **Session-Based Data Management:** Connection data is stored in efficient in-memory session maps, with periodic serialization to browser session storage — minimizing disk and memory IO.

- **Batch Request Processing:** Network request events are queued and processed in batches (once per second), which reduces CPU spikes and avoids continuous active workload.

- **No User Configuration Required:** Since uBO Scope works automatically upon installation, without heavy configuration or real-time interaction, it avoids extra overhead related to dynamic settings.

- **Light UI Footprint:** The popup interface is lean, loading data on demand with simple DOM manipulation, avoiding any heavy rendering or complex UI frameworks.


## Impact on Browser Speed and Resource Usage

Because of these careful design choices, uBO Scope:

- Does **not slow down** page load or browsing speed.
- Maintains **low CPU use** by batching network events rather than continuous monitoring.
- Keeps **memory consumption minimal** by storing compact data structures, and clearing data when tabs are closed.
- Operates **in the background with service workers or background scripts**, ensuring work happens asynchronously without blocking your browser’s main thread.

> **Real-World Observation:** Users typically will not notice any performance degradation after installing uBO Scope.


## Best Practices to Ensure Optimal Performance

To maintain the smooth operation of uBO Scope when monitoring your browser's remote connections, follow these tips:

- **Avoid Excessive Open Tabs:** While uBO Scope efficiently manages data per tab, having an extremely large number of tabs open simultaneously can increase overall browser memory usage.

- **Keep the Extension Updated:** Use the latest version of uBO Scope as improvements to performance and efficiency are made periodically.

- **Understand the Badge Indicator:** The toolbar badge simply reflects the number of distinct third-party domains connected; it does not cause extra data collection or analysis.

- **Limit Other Heavy Extensions:** Running many resource-intensive extensions alongside uBO Scope might collectively affect browser performance, but uBO Scope alone remains lightweight.

- **Regularly Restart Your Browser:** Especially after long browsing sessions, restarting your browser helps clear accumulated session data and frees resources.


## Troubleshooting Performance Concerns

If you suspect uBO Scope could be impacting your browser's speed or resource use, here are actionable steps to verify and resolve:

<Steps>
<Step title="Monitor Browser Performance">
Use your browser’s built-in Task Manager or system tools to observe CPU and memory consumption of individual extensions.
</Step>
<Step title="Disable uBO Scope Temporarily">
Temporarily disable uBO Scope and check if performance improves.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Number of Open Tabs and Connected Domains">
The badge count correlates to the number of distinct remote servers connected. High counts can reflect active browsing conditions rather than extension overhead.
</Step>
<Step title="Clear Session Data">
Closing tabs or restarting the browser clears uBO Scope’s session data, reducing memory use.
</Step>
<Step title="Update to Latest Extension Version">
Using the newest release ensures you benefit from performance and bug fixes.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Other Extensions">
Temporarily disable other extensions to isolate conflicts or combined load issues.
</Step>
</Steps>


## How uBO Scope Works Behind the Scenes

While this page focuses on performance impact from the user perspective, understanding uBO Scope's inner workings helps put its efficiency into context.

- The extension captures network requests through event listeners such as `onBeforeRedirect`, `onErrorOccurred`, and `onResponseStarted`.
- Requests are queued in a journal and processed in batches every second. Each entry updates status counts for allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains associated with browser tabs.
- Data is stored per tab in memory and periodically saved to session storage to preserve info and clear when tabs close.
- The popup interface queries this data on demand, rendering a concise summary without heavy computations.


<Tip>
The extension's non-obtrusive architecture ensures you get real-time visibility of your network connections without meaningful delay or resource drain.
</Tip>


## Summary

uBO Scope is expertly engineered to deliver insights on remote server connections within a browser environment efficiently. Thanks to its minimalistic data collection, batch processing, and lightweight UI, it does not impair browser speed or consume excessive system resources.

By following simple best practices—such as keeping your browser and extension updated, managing open tabs mindfully, and monitoring extension load—you can ensure uBO Scope remains a quiet but powerful assistant in your privacy toolkit.
