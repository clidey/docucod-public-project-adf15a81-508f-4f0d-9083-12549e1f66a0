# Will uBO Scope receive updates or new features?

uBO Scope is designed as a lightweight, focused extension that provides transparent, real-time visibility into the network connections initiated by web pages. Its development approach favors stability and minimalism over frequent feature changes or updates.

---

## Development Philosophy and Update Expectations

- **Stable and Minimal Updates:**
  uBO Scope’s primary goal is to reliably report third-party connections without interference or complexity. Because of this, frequent updates are not planned.

- **Focused on Core Functionality:**
  The extension aims to maintain a clear, simple user experience centered on its core measurement capability rather than evolving into a sprawling tool.

- **Selective Feature Additions:**
  While major structural changes or widespread feature additions are unlikely, targeted enhancements will be introduced when they directly improve usability for key user groups, particularly filter list maintainers.

- **User-Centric Improvements:**
  Planned improvements focus on providing more detailed connection insights and enhancing data accessibility rather than adding complex configuration options.


## How Users Can Stay Informed

- **Official GitHub Repository:**
  The primary channel for update announcements, issue tracking, and release notes is the [uBO Scope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).

- **Release Tags and Commit History:**
  Users interested in the technical evolution of uBO Scope can follow tagged releases and the commit history for insight into changes and improvements.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  Complementary documentation and FAQ pages will be updated alongside any feature additions or important changes.


## What to Expect from Future Releases

The short-term roadmap anticipates the following:

- **Enhanced Network Request Detail:**
  Additional data about network requests, giving users and filter list maintainers more granularity when auditing connections.

- **Bug Fixes and Compatibility Improvements:**
  Occasional maintenance updates to fix issues impacting browser compatibility or general stability.

- **No Major UI Overhauls or Feature Diversification:**
  The extension will remain focused, avoiding feature bloat and keeping interactions simple and purposeful.


## How to Provide Feedback or Request Features

Users who have ideas, experience issues, or desire specific features are encouraged to engage via GitHub:

- Open issues on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/issues) describing their feedback.

- Review existing issues to prioritize shared concerns and avoid duplicates.

- Provide clear, constructive explanations for feature requests, highlighting real-world use cases or workflows.

Active engagement helps guide the extension’s evolution, ensuring any enhancements align with user needs while preserving its core values.
