## Troubleshooting Contribution Challenges

<AccordionGroup title="Common Contribution Questions">  
<Accordion title="Where can I find the code style guidelines?">
The project uses ESLint with recommended settings as configured in the `eslint.config.mjs` file. Follow the established JavaScript style and ensure no linting errors before submitting code.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="How often are contributions reviewed and merged?">
Given uBO Scope’s occasional update philosophy, pull request reviews may be slower than typical active projects. Ensure your contribution is clear and aligns with project priorities to expedite.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="What if I have a big feature to propose?">
Large feature additions that add complexity or frequent updates fall outside the project’s scope. Such proposals may be declined or deferred. Consider creating a fork if you need more frequent customization.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="How do I verify my changes won’t break the extension?">
Test in supported browsers (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+). Use real-world browsing sessions to confirm proper connection reporting and UI updates.
