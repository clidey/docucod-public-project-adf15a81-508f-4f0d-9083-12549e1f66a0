# Does uBO Scope Affect Browser Performance?

uBO Scope is designed to provide transparent and immediate insight into all network connections an active browser tab makes, with a core focus on minimal impact to your browser's performance. This page explains how uBO Scope achieves its lightweight operation, describes the typical resource usage users can expect, and outlines actionable troubleshooting steps should you encounter performance issues during use.

## Understanding uBO Scope's Lightweight Approach

uBO Scope operates as a monitoring companion extension that passively listens to network activity without altering or blocking requests. It leverages native browser APIs, specifically the `webRequest` API, to observe network connections as they happen.

### Key Design Elements That Preserve Performance

- **Passive Monitoring:** uBO Scope only collects metadata about network requests (like URLs, domains, and request outcomes) without processing or modifying the requests themselves.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Recorded network events are queued and processed in batches on a short timer (1-second intervals), reducing frequent work that could impact responsiveness.
- **In-Memory Session Data:** Connection details are stored in session memory and serialized efficiently for persistence, avoiding costly I/O operations during active browsing.
- **Minimal UI Overhead:** The popup interface fetches and renders data only on user interaction and uses simple, lightweight rendering optimized for quick display.

This architecture ensures that uBO Scope uses limited CPU and memory resources and remains unobtrusive during regular browsing.

## Typical Resource Usage

### CPU

Because uBO Scope batches network event processing and avoids heavy computations, CPU usage during active browsing remains negligible. The most intensive work occurs briefly when processing accumulated requests approximately every second, but this activity is optimized and generally imperceptible.

### Memory

Memory usage is modest as uBO Scope only stores summarized connection data by hostname and domain per tab rather than full network payloads or large logs. Memory growth correlates to the number of tabs and distinct remote domains encountered, which in normal browsing remains within lightweight bounds.

### Impact on Browsing Responsiveness

No modification or blocking of network requests means page loads and navigation are unaffected by uBO Scope. Users will not notice delays or slowdowns attributed to the extension, even when many requests occur.

<Tip>
If you are monitoring high-traffic websites (e.g., pages with hundreds of third-party connections), uBO Scope remains efficient due to event batching, but some nominal resource activity during processing is expected.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

While uBO Scope is optimized for minimal resource consumption, some rare scenarios might introduce noticeable performance impact. Use the following steps to identify and resolve such issues:

### 1. Confirm Extension Version and Browser Compatibility

- Ensure you have installed the latest version of uBO Scope. Updates contain performance improvements.
- Confirm your browser version meets the minimum requirements:
  - Chrome 122 or later
  - Firefox 128 or later
  - Safari 18.5 or later

### 2. Minimize Concurrent Tabs Using uBO Scope

High numbers of simultaneous tabs with heavy network activity add to session data and event processing workload. Close unused tabs or restrict intensive monitoring to a subset of tabs.

### 3. Identify Third-Party Domain Volume

Use the popup panel to check how many distinct third-party domains are connecting per tab. Excessive third-party connections can increase processing time.

### 4. Restart Browser

Unusual or sustained high resource usage may clear up after restarting the browser, which resets session states.

### 5. Disable Other Extensions

Conflicts or resource contention with other extensions monitoring or manipulating network requests might exacerbate performance issues. Temporarily disable other extensions to isolate the cause.

### 6. Clear uBO Scope Session Data

Corrupt or large session data can cause delays. Clearing session data helps:

1. Open your browser's extension settings for uBO Scope.
2. Remove stored data manually or via browser storage tools.
3. Restart the browser.

### 7. Monitor Using Browser Task Manager

Modern browsers provide task managers to view resource usage per extension:

- In Chrome, open `chrome://system` or use the built-in Task Manager (`Shift + Esc`).
- In Firefox, under `about:performance`.
- In Safari, use Activity Monitor with browser-specific details.

If uBO Scope shows unexpected CPU or memory usage, report this using the support links.

<Tip>
Enabling browser-level developer tools or network profiling simultaneously may increase overall resource usage, which is not indicative of uBO Scope alone.
</Tip>

## Best Practices for Smooth Usage

- **Keep your browser updated** to benefit from performance optimizations.
- **Monitor only tabs you actively need** insights for, limiting the extension’s overhead.
- **Avoid opening a large number of tabs** with many network connections simultaneously.
- **Regularly review uBO Scope popup data** to understand connection patterns and identify if any particular site causes high load.

## Summary

uBO Scope is crafted to be a lightweight browser extension that minimally impacts browser performance while empowering you with transparent real-time network connection insights. Its efficient design and low resource footprint let it run smoothly in typical use scenarios. Should performance issues arise, the troubleshooting steps above guide you to quickly identify and resolve them.
