# Does uBO Scope work with other content blockers?

uBO Scope is designed to function seamlessly alongside any browser-based content blocker, providing transparent insights into your browser’s network activity regardless of which content blocker is active. This page explains how uBO Scope achieves this compatibility, what you can expect in terms of data accuracy, and the limitations imposed by browser APIs when other blockers or network-level filters intervene.

---

## How uBO Scope Interoperates with Content Blockers

Unlike typical content blockers that prevent or modify network requests, uBO Scope operates passively. It listens to the browser's `webRequest` API, which reports on _all_ network requests made by the browser, including whether they were allowed, redirected, or blocked.

### What This Means for Users:

- **Independent Network Monitoring:** uBO Scope tracks actual network requests as seen by the browser internally, not just what is visible to JavaScript or webpage scripts.
- **Counts Reflect True Connection Outcomes:** The badge count displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted or blocked, regardless of active content blockers.
- **Works with Any Content Blocker:** Whether you use uBlock Origin, AdGuard, or any other blocker, uBO Scope gathers and reports the collective outcome.

---

## User Experience: What You Will See

When other content blockers are active, uBO Scope still reports the network requests seen via the `webRequest` API. This includes:

- **Allowed connections:** Network requests that were successful and fulfilled.
- **Blocked connections:** Requests that the blocker or the browser prevented.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Requests that were redirected or silently blocked without being fully discarded.

This enables you to visualize the true network exposure of your browser tab in real time.

<Tip>
Use uBO Scope’s popup panel and badge as an objective way to assess the real-world effectiveness of your blocker setup—not relying solely on the block count or third-party filter lists.

## Limitations and Important Considerations

While uBO Scope provides comprehensive insights, some limitations apply due to how browsers and network layers handle requests:

### 1. Visibility Depends on the `webRequest` API

- uBO Scope can only report network requests that reach the `webRequest` API layer.
- If other blockers or network filters block requests before they reach this API (such as DNS-level blocking or privileged native firewall rules), uBO Scope will not see those requests.

### 2. Variations Across Browsers

- Different browsers implement the `webRequest` API with varying degrees of detail and timing.
- Some requests (e.g., prefetch, speculative connections) might not be fully reported or may be missing depending on browser capabilities.

### 3. Dynamic Blocking Techniques

- Some blockers use stealth blocking, where resources are allowed but script behavior is altered.
- uBO Scope attempts to detect these stealth blocks based on redirects and network errors, but some subtle behaviors may go undetected.

### 4. Conflicts With Multiple Extensions

- Running multiple content blockers simultaneously can complicate interpretation, as blocking decisions can be layered.
- uBO Scope reports what the browser network layer sees cumulatively, not which extension caused the block.

<Warning>
Because of these factors, uBO Scope reports _actual network activity_ rather than the intentions or configurations of specific content blockers.
Do not interpret uBO Scope’s data as a direct indicator of any single blocker’s performance but as a holistic view of network connections.
</Warning>

## Practical Example: Using uBO Scope with Multiple Blockers

Imagine you use uBO Scope concurrently with uBlock Origin and another content blocker (e.g., a privacy-focused DNS). uBO Scope will:

- Show blocked domains reflecting requests stopped by either extension or network filters.
- Count only distinct third-party domains actually contacted or blocked.
- Allow you to compare differences when disabling one or the other.

This enables effective evaluation of combined privacy tools in a real-world browsing session.

## Troubleshooting Integration Issues

If you notice no data or incomplete information when other blockers are active:

1. **Verify uBO Scope Permissions:** Ensure uBO Scope has all necessary permissions, including `webRequest` and `activeTab`.
2. **Check Browser Compatibility:** Certain browsers or versions may limit `webRequest` API visibility.
3. **Disable Other Blockers Temporarily:** Confirm if another extension is interfering with uBO Scope’s ability to observe requests.
4. **Review Known Browser API Limitations:** Consult documentation on your browser’s `webRequest` API to understand known blind spots.

## Summary

- uBO Scope passively reports network connections observed via the browser’s `webRequest` API.
- It works alongside any content blocker by independently tracking requests, providing unbiased insights.
- Limitations arise if requests are blocked before reaching the API or due to browser/extension technical constraints.
- It does not interfere with blocking decisions; it visualizes outcomes.

Use uBO Scope as a transparent window into your browser's true network activity, complementing your content blocking tools.

## Final Notes

If you seek to measure the real network exposure and effectiveness of your privacy tools, uBO Scope offers clear, unbiased data—even amidst complex setups with multiple blockers. Recognize its role as a monitor, not a blocker, and leverage its outputs to deepen your understanding and optimize your browsing privacy posture.
