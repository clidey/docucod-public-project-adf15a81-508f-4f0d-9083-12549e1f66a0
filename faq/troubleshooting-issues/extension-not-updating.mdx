# The Extension Isn’t Updating or Showing Data — What Can I Do?

This page helps you resolve issues where uBO Scope’s toolbar badge, popup, or data display might not be updating or showing any network connection information. By following the steps and recommendations below, you will verify your setup, diagnose permission and browser compatibility problems, and learn effective troubleshooting techniques.

---

## Common Symptoms

- The badge count on the uBO Scope icon remains empty or stale despite activity on the web page.
- Opening the popup shows “NO DATA” or does not list any connected domains.
- Data does not refresh when you change tabs or reload pages.
- The extension appears inactive after installation.

---

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Guide

### 1. Verify Your Browser Is Supported and Meets Minimum Version Requirements

uBO Scope supports the following browsers and versions:

- **Chrome:** Version 122 or newer
- **Firefox:** Version 128 or newer
- **Safari:** Version 18.5 or newer

Using older browsers will prevent the extension from receiving all necessary network events.

<Tip>
Check your browser's version via settings or `about:` page and update to the latest stable release if necessary.
</Tip>

### 2. Confirm the Extension Is Installed Correctly

- Ensure uBO Scope is installed from an official source like the Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or the Safari Extensions Gallery.
- Verify the icon appears in your browser toolbar and is enabled.
- For Safari users, enable the extension in Safari's Extensions preferences.

See the [Installation Guides](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope#installation) for detailed platform-specific instructions.

### 3. Check Extension Permissions

uBO Scope requires specific permissions to monitor network requests:

- Access to tabs (`activeTab` permission)
- Use of the `webRequest` API
- Ability to monitor all HTTP/S and WebSocket URLs

If any permissions were denied during installation, the extension will not receive network event data.

<Tip>
Review your browser's extension permissions page and ensure uBO Scope has all requested permissions granted.
</Tip>

### 4. Reload or Restart Your Browser and Tabs

Sometimes, browser extensions need a fresh context to start tracking network activity:

- Reload the active tab where you expect data to appear.
- If data still does not show, try restarting the entire browser.
- After restart, open uBO Scope's popup again and check if the badge updates.

<Tip>
Refreshing tabs forces network requests which triggers data collection for the popup and badge.
</Tip>

### 5. Confirm the Active Tab Is Monitored

uBO Scope only displays data for the currently active tab and automatically resets session data as you switch tabs or reload pages.

- Verify you have the tab active whose data you want to see.
- Open the popup immediately after loading a website that makes network requests.

### 6. Ensure Your Webpage Is Generating Network Activity

If a page has no or very few remote connections, the badge count and popup will remain empty or minimal.

- Test by visiting popular websites with typical third-party content (news sites, social media platforms).
- Observe changes in the badge count and popup list.

### 7. Browser or System-Specific Known Issues

- Some browser extensions, privacy settings, or antivirus software may interfere with uBO Scope’s ability to observe network requests.
- Corporate or managed devices may restrict extension capabilities.

<Tip>
Try disabling other extensions temporarily to isolate conflicts and check if uBO Scope starts working.
</Tip>

## Additional Troubleshooting Tips

### Check Your Browser’s Developer Console for Errors

Open the console on uBO Scope’s popup (right-click on the extension icon > Inspect) to check for JavaScript errors or warnings that may indicate issues.

### Verify the Extension Version

Make sure you have the latest version installed (currently v1.0.1). Older versions may have bugs or lack needed browser API compatibility.

### Reload the Extension Manually

Go to your browser’s extensions management page and manually reload or disable/re-enable uBO Scope.

### Clear Browser Cache and Storage

Sometimes stale data in browser storage can cause UI display issues:

- Clear browser cache (not cookies)
- Clear the extension’s local storage if possible
