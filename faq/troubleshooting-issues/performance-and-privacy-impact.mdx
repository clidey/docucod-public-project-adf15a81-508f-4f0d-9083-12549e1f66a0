# Does running uBO Scope impact performance or privacy?

This FAQ page addresses the key concerns users often have regarding the performance overhead and privacy implications of running the uBO Scope browser extension. Understanding these factors is critical to make an informed decision when using uBO Scope as a tool to gain transparency into your browser's network connections.

---

## 1. What impact does uBO Scope have on browser performance?

uBO Scope is designed to be a lightweight, informational extension. It operates passively by listening to the browser's `webRequest` API, which means it observes and records network connection outcomes rather than modifying or blocking requests directly. This design keeps the performance impact minimal.

### How does uBO Scope minimize its performance footprint?
- **Passive Observation:** Instead of interfering with network traffic, it only monitors the requests made by the browser.
- **Batch Processing:** Network request events are buffered and processed in batches every second to avoid constant CPU wakeups.
- **Efficient Data Structures:** Uses optimized in-memory data maps to track domains without excessive memory or CPU usage.
- **Avoids Heavy Computations:** Complex operations like parsing domain suffixes use efficient algorithms and caching.

### What are typical signs of performance degradation to watch for?
- Slower browser tab loading times (unlikely due to uBO Scope’s passive operation).
- Noticeable lag in the browser UI when opening or interacting with the uBO Scope popup.
- Unexpected CPU spikes that coincide with browsing activity.

If you observe such behavior, consider disabling uBO Scope temporarily to confirm whether it is the cause.


## 2. Does uBO Scope affect my browsing privacy or data security?

uBO Scope respects user privacy and does not intercept, block, or modify any network communications. Its sole purpose is to reveal connections to third-party remote servers initiated by the browser.

### How is privacy maintained?
- **No Data Transmission:** All data collection happens locally within the browser. uBO Scope does not send your browsing data to any external servers.
- **View-Only Monitoring:** The extension watches network outcomes but does not alter or block requests.
- **Limited Permissions:** It only requests permissions essential for monitoring (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).

### What privacy insights does uBO Scope provide?
- Exact third-party domains contacted by each tab.
- Counts of distinct third-party servers reached.
- Distinction between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections by other content blockers (if applicable).

<u>Important:</u> Unlike content blockers, uBO Scope’s function is purely informational and does not introduce privacy risks itself.


## 3. Are there tips to further reduce any potential overhead while using uBO Scope?

While uBO Scope is lightweight, here are best practices to keep its resource usage optimal:

- **Keep Your Browser Updated:** Newer browser versions offer better API performance and stability.
- **Run Only When Needed:** Enable the extension primarily when auditing privacy or analyzing network connections.
- **Close Tabs Not Being Monitored:** uBO Scope tracks data per tab, so minimizing open tabs helps keep resource use low.
- **Avoid Conflicts:** While uBO Scope is compatible with other content blockers, tightly integrated setups with many extensions could increase cumulative performance impact.


## 4. What makes uBO Scope’s resource usage different from traditional content blockers?

Traditional blockers actively inspect and potentially block or modify network requests, which can involve complex filtering, pattern matching, and request overrides. This can add measurable latency and CPU usage during page loads.

uBO Scope, instead,:
- Does not block or alter network traffic.
- Relies solely on browser APIs to report network outcomes.
- Focuses purely on collecting and reporting connection data.

This architectural difference ensures that its performance and privacy impact remain minimal.


## 5. Could uBO Scope leak information about my browsing habits?

No. All monitoring data stays within your browser and is only accessible via the extension's popup UI. There is no mechanism or permission in uBO Scope that transmits browsing data externally.


## 6. How can I verify uBO Scope’s lightweight operation?

You can easily verify its low overhead through:

- **Browser Task Manager:** Most browsers (e.g., Chrome’s Task Manager) show extension CPU and memory usage.
- **Extension Toggle Method:** Disable uBO Scope and compare browsing performance before and after.
- **Inspect Extension Permissions:** Confirm it only requests necessary permissions, without excessive access.


## 7. Is there any scenario where using uBO Scope is discouraged due to performance or privacy?

There are no known scenarios where uBO Scope compromises user experience or privacy. However, if you:

- Use very low-end devices with highly limited resources and notice slowdowns,
- Have setup requirements restricting additional extensions,

then you might prefer enabling uBO Scope selectively during specific investigative sessions.


---

## Summary

Running uBO Scope has negligible performance impact and no adverse privacy effects because it only passively monitors network requests through the browser's `webRequest` API. It provides valuable transparency into third-party connections without altering or intercepting network traffic.

For best results, enable it when needed and monitor resource use alongside other extensions.
