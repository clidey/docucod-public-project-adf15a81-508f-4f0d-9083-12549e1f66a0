# Where Can I Get Help or Report Problems?

Navigating the world of browser extensions and network privacy can sometimes raise questions or encounter issues. This guide provides clear directions on where and how to seek assistance, report problems, or engage with the uBO Scope community.

## Official Project Repository

The primary source for all things uBO Scope is the official GitHub repository maintained by Raymond Hill:

- **Repository URL:** [https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope)

Here you will find:

- Source code and release artifacts
- Official documentation
- Issue tracker for reporting bugs or feature requests
- Updates and changelog

This is the authoritative channel for issues and requests related to uBO Scope.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any bugs, unexpected behaviors, or conflicts:

1. Search existing issues on the GitHub repository to see if your problem has already been reported.
2. If not found, open a new issue with detailed information including:
   - The browser and version where uBO Scope is installed
   - Steps to reproduce the problem
   - A clear description of the expected behavior versus what happened
   - Screenshots or logs if applicable

This helps maintainers diagnose and resolve issues efficiently.

## Asking Questions and Getting Community Support

While the GitHub issues are for bug reports and feature requests, for general questions or usage tips consider:

- Reviewing the official **uBO Scope documentation** to clarify feature explanations and troubleshooting guidance.
- Visiting forums or communities focused on privacy, content blocking, or browser extensions where knowledgeable users may share insights.

Though there is no official community forum dedicated solely to uBO Scope, many questions are approachable by browsing related discussions in content blocker support groups.

## Contacting the Maintainer

Direct contact with Raymond Hill (the author) is typically reserved for critical reports or collaboration. The best approach is through the GitHub repository's issue tracker or pull requests for code contributions.
