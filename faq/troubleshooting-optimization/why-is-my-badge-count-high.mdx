# Why is My Badge Count Unexpectedly High?

Understanding why the toolbar badge in uBO Scope shows a higher-than-expected count of third-party connections can be puzzling. This guide helps you troubleshoot common reasons behind high badge counts, clarifies how to interpret these results, and advises on when further action might be necessary.

## Understanding the Badge Count

The badge count represents the number of **distinct third-party domains** your browser has connected to during your active tab session. Each distinct domain corresponds to a remote server where network requests from the webpage were successfully allowed.

<Tip>
A higher badge count means your browser has connected to more third-party servers, which often increases your privacy exposure. However, not all third-party connections are harmful or unwanted.
</Tip>

## Common Reasons for a High Badge Count

### 1. Legitimate Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
Many websites rely on popular CDNs to load scripts, stylesheets, fonts, or images. These CDNs are third-party domains but are usually necessary for proper website operation.

Example:
- Connecting to domains like `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `fonts.gstatic.com`, or `cdnjs.cloudflare.com` is common and expected.

### 2. Multiple Third-Party Services and Trackers
Websites often load resources from various analytics, advertising, or social media services. Each unique domain adds to the badge count.

### 3. Embedded External Content
Elements like embedded videos, widgets, or comment systems can cause network requests to external domains.

### 4. Browser or Network Configuration Influences
Certain network or browser settings, proxies, VPNs, or DNS-over-HTTPS configurations can alter how connections are routed and reported, sometimes increasing the perceived number of unique third-party domains.

### 5. Traffic from Browser Extensions or User Scripts
Some extensions or injected scripts may trigger additional network requests to domains outside the main webpage’s domain.

## How uBO Scope Counts Connections

- uBO Scope tracks actual network connection outcomes, distinguishing between **Allowed**, **Blocked**, and **Stealth-Blocked** requests.
- The badge count only reflects **Allowed third-party domains**, i.e., those with successful connections.
- Redirects and failed connections are excluded from this count.

<Tip>
Use the popup panel to review the detailed list of connected domains, categorized by their blocking status, to understand which domains contribute to your badge count.
</Tip>

## Practical Steps to Analyze and Manage High Counts

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel showing detailed connection reports for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Allowed Domains Section">
Look for domains listed under the **not blocked** category. Identify which domains are legitimate (e.g., CDNs) and which might be questionable.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Stealth-Blocked and Blocked Lists">
Examine these sections to understand what was blocked. Consider whether your content blocker or other privacy tools are performing as expected.
</Step>
<Step title="Assess Necessity of High-Count Domains">
If you notice many unexpected or suspicious third-party domains, consider adjusting your content blocker settings or investigate the source website's use of external assets.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Network and Browser Settings">
Review any proxies, VPNs, or DNS settings that could influence the tracking of network connections.
</Step>
</Steps>

## When Should You Act on a High Badge Count?

- **No Immediate Action Needed:** If the additional domains are well-known CDNs or necessary services, the high count is expected and not a sign of malfunction.
- **Action Recommended:** If you observe domains linked to trackers, advertising networks, or unknown sources and want to reduce exposure, consider tightening your content blocker rules or using more aggressive blocking.
- **Further Investigation:** Unexpected spikes during browsing might indicate injected content or extension behavior — investigate by disabling other extensions or testing with clean profiles.

<Warning>
Remember, uBO Scope **does not block** connections; it only reports them. Use it as a transparency tool to inform your blocking strategy, not as a blocker itself.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Checklist for High Badge Counts

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Checklist">
<Accordion title="Are CDNs inflating the count?">
Check for legitimate domains frequently used by websites (e.g., Google CDN, Cloudflare). These typically contribute to higher counts but are expected.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is the site loading embedded third-party content?">
Elements like videos, social media widgets, or comment platforms can cause multiple third-party connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Could network settings or VPNs affect reporting?">
Disable VPNs or proxies temporarily to see if the badge count changes. Check DNS-over-HTTPS or other privacy-focused DNS settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are browser extensions causing extra connections?">
Test by disabling other extensions to verify if any inject external requests contributing to the badge count.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is the content blocker properly configured?">
Review blocking rules and lists. Consider enabling more aggressive filters if reducing third-party requests is a priority.
</Accordion>
