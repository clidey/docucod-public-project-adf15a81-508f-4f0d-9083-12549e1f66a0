# What Are the Common Misconceptions About Content Blockers?

This FAQ page addresses widespread myths and misunderstandings users often encounter regarding content blockers, specifically focusing on the misconceptions about block counts, the reliability of "ad blocker test" webpages, and what can realistically be measured about network connections. It provides actionable tips for users who want a more accurate picture of their privacy and browsing performance.

## Why Should I Not Trust the Block Count Displayed by Content Blockers?

Many users believe that a higher block count on an extension's toolbar icon means the blocker is better at protecting privacy. This is a misconception. The block count only shows how many requests were blocked — it **does not** indicate the total number or diversity of third-party servers contacted.

<u>What really matters:</u> the number of **distinct third-party remote servers that successfully connected** during a page load. A blocker with a high block count might paradoxically allow connections to more distinct servers overall.

<u>Example:</u> Two blockers on the same site show these results:

| Blocker | Block Count | Number of Distinct Allowed Connections |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| Blocker A | 100         | 50                                    |
| Blocker B | 150         | 75                                    |

Though Blocker B claims to block more, it allows connections to 75 third-party servers, which means more potential tracking or exposure.

<u>Tip:</u> Use uBO Scope's badge count and popup interface to see the number of distinct third-party domains that were actually connected to, rather than relying on block count alone.

## Are "Ad Blocker Test" Websites Reliable for Evaluating Content Blockers?

No. These test pages are fundamentally flawed in assessing modern extension-based content blockers.

**Why?**

- Many content blockers employ stealth techniques to avoid being detected by test pages. They block or hide ads in ways that tests can't observe directly.
- "Ad blocker test" pages often use unrealistic and fabricated network requests and domains that don't reflect real-world website behavior.
- As a result, these pages may falsely report blockers as ineffective or overly aggressive.

<u>Example:</u> A test page might try to load fake ad domains that, in practice, no legitimate website uses. Your content blocker could allow or deny such requests incorrectly flagged by the test.

**Bottom line:** Relying on these tests to compare different blockers or verify protection leads to confusion and poor decisions.

<u>Better approach:</u> Use tools like uBO Scope that report all real network connections your browser makes during normal web use to judge effectiveness.

## What Can uBO Scope Measure About Content Blocking?

uBO Scope focuses on transparency — it **reports every attempted network connection** from the webpage to remote third-party servers, regardless of whether those connections were blocked, allowed, or stealth-blocked by any content blocker.

<u>Key points:</u>

- It counts the **number of unique third-party domains connected or blocked** and displays these in categorized lists (Allowed, Blocked, Stealth-blocked).
- It relies on browser APIs (`webRequest`) to detect network requests, including those blocked at DNS or elsewhere, as long as the browser reports them.
- It **does not** itself block connections but rather gives an accurate picture of what your browser attempts and succeeds or fails to connect to.

**Limitations:**

- Network requests made outside the scope of browser APIs (e.g., outside the browser or via other network protocols) cannot be detected.

<u>Outcome:</u> uBO Scope helps you independently verify blocking effectiveness and avoid misleading information from block counts or test sites.

## Practical Tips for More Accurate Privacy and Performance Evaluation

- Focus on reducing the **count of distinct third-party domains allowed**, rather than chasing higher block counts on your blocker.
- Use uBO Scope’s popup to audit actual domains contacted by websites in real-time.
- Avoid relying on "ad blocker test" websites; instead, test blockers using real-world browsing patterns and uBO Scope’s data.
- If you are a filter list maintainer or curious power user, leverage uBO Scope’s detailed reporting to analyze connection outcomes.

## Troubleshooting Common Misconceptions

<AccordionGroup title="FAQ on Misconceptions">
<Accordion title="Why does a content blocker show more blocks but I still see a high number of connected domains?">
A higher block count could mean the blocker registers many small blocks, but it still allows many distinct third-party connections. uBO Scope reveals this by showing actual distinct connected domains, so prefer its data to the block count badge.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope detect stealth blocking that other content blockers use?">
uBO Scope reports network requests as seen by the browser. Stealth blocking techniques that manipulate page behavior without blocking requests may appear as "stealth-blocked" in uBO Scope’s categories, helping identify them.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do block tests flag my content blocker as not working properly?">
Because "ad blocker test" sites use fake or non-standard domains and try tricks to detect blockers, many valid blockers appear as failing. This is normal and not a true reflection of your protection level.
