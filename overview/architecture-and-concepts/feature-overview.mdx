# Quick Feature Overview

Discover at a glance the key real-time insights that uBO Scope surfaces to help you understand the network behavior of the active browser tab. This page walks you through the main UI components visible inside the popup panel, including the toolbar badge counts, the categorized domain lists, and notification summaries — explaining what data you will see, why it matters, and how to interpret it.

## Toolbar Badge: Immediate Visibility of Third-Party Connections

At the core of uBO Scope's user experience is the toolbar icon badge. This numeric badge represents the count of distinct third-party domains currently connected to by the webpage in your active tab.

- **What It Shows:** The number displayed is the count of unique remote third-party domains from which some network traffic was allowed (i.e., resources actually fetched and used).
- **Why It Matters:** A lower badge count generally means fewer third parties are contacted, translating to improved privacy and reduced exposure.
- **Benefit:** You get instant, unobtrusive feedback on network activity without opening the popup panel.

> **Note:** The count excludes blocked or stealth-blocked domains, focusing on actual allowed network connections.

## Popup Panel: A Structured Breakdown of Network Outcomes

Opening the uBO Scope popup reveals a rich breakdown of network requests divided into three primary categories based on their outcome:

### 1. Allowed Domains ("Not Blocked")
These are third-party domains that successfully connected and delivered content.

- Presented in a scrollable list sorted alphabetically.
- Each domain shows how many times network requests succeeded.
- This section enables you to audit which servers are actively communicating with the page.

### 2. Stealth-Blocked Domains ("Stealth-Blocked")
These domains had their connections stealthily blocked — effectively hidden from the page but recorded by uBO Scope for transparency.

- Listing allows you to identify domains that attempted connections but were silently blocked.
- Useful to understand hidden activity that standard UI or tools might miss.

### 3. Blocked Domains ("Blocked")
These are domains that were explicitly blocked due to errors, rejection, or direct blocking rules.

- Detailed counts help confirm which connections were prevented.
- Enables validation of your content blocking setup.


Each of these sections shows:

- **The domain name:** Displayed in Unicode format for clarity, even for punycode domains.
- **Request count badge:** Indicating how often requests to the domain occurred.

At the top of the popup, the currently observed tab's hostname and domain are clearly shown, helping you confirm the context of the data.

## Summary Section: At-A-Glance Total Connections

Below the tab hostname, you'll see a concise summary displaying the total number of distinct domains connected to in the current browsing context.

This figure represents the sum of all allowed domains — providing a quick metric of your tab's external contact footprint.

---

## Understanding the Data Flow and UI Interaction

- The data is continuously collected in the background through browser network event listeners.
- Network requests are analyzed and classified into allowed, stealth, or blocked categories credited to their originating tab.
- When you open the popup panel, the most recent session data for the active tab is fetched and rendered dynamically.

This live data connection ensures you always see up-to-date insights reflecting your current browsing session.

---

## Practical Example: Identify Unexpected Connections

Imagine visiting a news website and noticing a toolbar badge count of 15. Opening the popup, you see many allowed domains, mostly reputable CDNs, but also a surprising "tracker.example.com" under stealth-blocked.

- This immediate visibility helps you:
  - Confirm which domains serve legitimate resources.
  - Detect attempts at hidden tracking.
  - Adjust your filters or blockers accordingly.

Without uBO Scope, stealth-blocked domains might remain invisible, leaving you unaware of potential privacy risks.

---

## Key Tips for Using the Feature Effectively

- Regularly glance at the badge count to monitor when a webpage unexpectedly contacts many third parties.
- Open the popup to investigate which domains fall into each category for fine-grained analysis.
- Use the domain counts to understand frequency and intensity of connections.
- Focus on stealth-blocked domains to uncover potentially hidden network activity.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Quick Feature Overview">
<Accordion title="Why is the badge sometimes empty (showing no number)?">
If the active tab currently has no allowed third-party connections recorded, the badge will hide the number, indicating zero distinct connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some domains appear under stealth-blocked and others under blocked?">
Domains appear under stealth-blocked when their connections were silently blocked without alerting the webpage. Blocked domains had their connections explicitly failed or rejected, often visible as errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is the domain count in the popup different from the badge number?">
The badge count reflects only allowed domains (distinct third-party servers connected to). The popup shows allowed, stealth, and blocked domains separately; the summary count represents only allowed domains to align with the badge.
</Accordion>
