# Core Terminology and Concepts

Understanding the essential terms behind uBO Scope empowers you to correctly interpret the network connection data it reports. This foundational knowledge clarifies how the extension tracks network requests, distinguishes between allowed and blocked connections, and summarizes your browsing exposure to third-party servers.

---

## What You Will Learn

- What defines a **third-party server** versus a **remote server**
- The difference between **allowed** and **blocked** network requests
- The meaning of a **stealth block**
- How the **toolbar badge count** reflects network exposure
- The fundamental role of the **webRequest API** in capturing network data

## Third-Party Server vs. Remote Server

### Remote Server

A _remote server_ is any server that a web page’s browser tries to contact over the network. This includes servers hosting site content, APIs, ads, analytics, or other resources necessary to render a webpage or support its features.

### Third-Party Server

A _third-party server_ is a remote server with a domain **different** from the main website you are visiting. For example, if you browse `example.com` but your browser loads resources from `cdn.adsnetwork.net`, the latter is a third-party server.

Understanding this distinction is crucial since uBO Scope specifically highlights connections to third-party remote servers to reveal your browser’s exposure to external entities beyond the site you intended to visit.

---

## Allowed vs. Blocked Requests

uBO Scope categorizes network requests into three outcomes:

- **Allowed Requests:** These are connections your browser successfully made to remote servers. Such requests fetched resources that loaded on the page.

- **Blocked Requests:** These represent connection attempts **blocked** before reaching remote servers, either by content blockers like uBlock Origin or due to network errors. 

- **Stealth-Blocked Requests:** These are special cases where requests are silently blocked or redirected without notifying the webpage or making the block obvious. This stealthiness is useful in preventing websites from detecting the presence of content blockers.

---

## Stealth Block Explained

A _stealth block_ occurs when a network request is intercepted and prevented from reaching its target remotely, but the blocking is hidden from the webpage’s scripting environment. This minimizes the chance of websites detecting blocking activity, enhancing your privacy.

uBO Scope identifies stealth blocks separately, so you can distinguish between outright blocked connections and those silently suppressed.

---

## Toolbar Badge Count: Your Exposure to Third-Party Servers

One of uBO Scope’s key indicators is the **toolbar badge count**—a number displayed on the extension's icon in your browser.

- It shows the **count of distinct third-party remote servers** your current tab has connected to.

- A **lower count** means fewer third-party servers were reached, typically indicating better privacy exposure control.

- It is important to understand this badge does **not** show the number of blocked requests. Instead, it reveals how many different third-party domains actively served resources.

By focusing on distinct third-party domains rather than raw block counts, uBO Scope provides a more accurate picture of your actual network exposure.

---

## The Role of the webRequest API

### What is the webRequest API?

The **webRequest API** is a browser-provided interface that allows extensions to monitor and analyze network requests made by tabs in real-time.

uBO Scope relies on this API to listen for details about:

- Requests being initiated
- Request responses starting
- Redirects occurring
- Errors or blocked requests

The extension uses this data to build a comprehensive view of network activity, categorize requests by outcome, and tally connections to third-party domains.

### Key Points

- **Coverage:** uBO Scope reports on all connections your browser attempts or completes that the `webRequest` API exposes. Some special browser features or connections outside this API's scope cannot be tracked.

- **Cross-Browser Support:** The extension supports current Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari, each implementing the `webRequest` API compatible with uBO Scope’s monitoring strategy.

---

## How These Concepts Work Together

When you load a web page, your browser makes many connections:

1. To the site’s own domain (first-party)
2. To various external domains (third-party)

uBO Scope tracks every one of these attempts. It sorts them into allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked, grouped by domain.

The popup interface presents these groups, showing how many requests each third-party domain received or was blocked from.

The toolbar badge gives a real-time count of distinct allowed third-party domains connected to in the active tab, instantly indicating your privacy exposure level.

---

## Practical Example

Suppose you visit `news.example.com`. Your browser fetches resources from:

- `news.example.com` (your site)
- `cdn.images.com` (third-party image CDN)
- `ads.adnetwork.net` (third-party ad server)

If the ad server requests are blocked by your content blocker or network filter:

- `cdn.images.com` requests appear as **allowed**
- `ads.adnetwork.net` requests appear as **blocked** or **stealth-blocked** depending on blocking type

The toolbar badge in uBO Scope would show '1' (for the single third-party domain `cdn.images.com`), helping you quickly understand your exposure.

---

## Tips for Interpreting uBO Scope Data

- Focus on the **distinct third-party domains connected** rather than simply blocked request counts.

- Remember legitimate services often use multiple domains (like CDNs and analytics).

- Use the categorization between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked to assess content blocker effectiveness.

- If you see unexpected third-party domains allowed, you may wish to investigate further or tighten filter lists.

- Understand that `webRequest` API limitations may omit some connections — uBO Scope reports all visible traffic but cannot see beyond browser API scope.

## Summary

This page introduced core terms used throughout uBO Scope documentation and user interface:

| Term               | Description                                                                                         |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Remote Server      | Any server contacted by your browser during a page load                                          |
| Third-Party Server | Remote server with a different domain than the website you visit                                 |
| Allowed Request    | Network request successfully completed and resource loaded                                       |
| Blocked Request    | Network request that was prevented from reaching the server                                      |
| Stealth Block      | Network request silently blocked to avoid detection by the webpage                               |
| Toolbar Badge Count| Number of distinct third-party domains connected in the current tab                              |
| webRequest API     | Browser API used to monitor network requests for analysis and categorization by uBO Scope       |

Understanding these concepts is essential to making sense of the detailed connection data and privacy insights provided by uBO Scope.

## Implementation Insights (Optional for Developers)

Internally, uBO Scope uses the browser’s `webRequest` API events to:

- Collect detailed network request outcomes (success, error, redirect)
- Parse hostnames and determine their registered domain using the Public Suffix List
- Categorize connections as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked
- Maintain per-tab data for real-time updates

These per-tab details are then serialized and sent to the popup UI for clear presentation. The extension uses the **toolbar badge text** to reflect the count of unique allowed third-party domains, an effective privacy exposure metric.
