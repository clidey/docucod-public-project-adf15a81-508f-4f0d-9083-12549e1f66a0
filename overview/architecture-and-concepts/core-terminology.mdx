# Core Terminology and Concepts

Understanding uBO Scope starts by familiarizing yourself with its core terms and concepts. This knowledge empowers you to interpret what the extension reports, especially regarding third-party remote connections and how they affect your privacy.

---

## Key Terms Defined

### Third-Party Remote Server
A **third-party remote server** is any domain or server that a webpage connects to that is _different_ from the website you are currently visiting. For example, if you visit `example.com` and it loads resources from `cdn.someothersite.net`, the latter is a third-party remote server.

Third-party connections are crucial to monitor because they often come from advertisers, trackers, content delivery networks (CDNs), or analytics providers. These connections can affect your privacy by sharing information beyond the primary website you trust.

---

### Allowed
**Allowed** connections are third-party network requests that have successfully completed or were permitted by whatever content blockers or privacy tools you have active.

In practice, allowed connections are those where data has flowed between your browser and the remote server. uBO Scope tracks these to help you understand how many third-party servers your current webpage is communicating with.

---

### Blocked
**Blocked** refers to network requests that were prevented from completing, either by a content blocker, browser policy, or other network-level filtering.

A blocked connection means the browser tried to reach a third-party remote server, but the request was stopped before any data was exchanged.

This status helps you identify which third-party servers are being stopped by your security or privacy settings.

---

### Stealth
The term **Stealth** refers to third-party connections that were blocked or intercepted in a subtle way that is not easily detectable by the webpage itself.

Stealth blocking is a privacy technique that prevents websites from knowing that certain connections have been blocked, avoiding detection or countermeasures from scripts on the website.

In uBO Scope, stealth-blocked connections are reported separately to highlight this special category where the blocking is effective but invisible to the remote server and web page.

---

### Badge Count
The **badge count** is the number displayed on the extension's toolbar icon. It represents the **number of distinct third-party remote servers with allowed connections** for the current tab.

- A higher badge count indicates more third-party servers this webpage communicates with.
- A lower badge count generally reflects better privacy, meaning fewer third-party sites are receiving your data.

This count ignores blocked or stealth connections; it focuses solely on successful allowed connections, providing a quick assessment of your exposure.

---

## How These Concepts Relate to Your Privacy

Knowing the difference between allowed, blocked, and stealth connections equips you to:

- **Gauge your actual third-party exposure:** Not all third-party requests are harmful, but understanding their count and identity helps you make informed decisions.
- **Validate content blocker effectiveness:** Instead of relying on block counts shown by blockers (which can be misleading), focus on the number of third-party servers _not_ blocked.
- **Spot stealth blocking:** Some connections are blocked quietly to avoid detection by websites; these stealth blocks enhance your privacy without breaking site functionality.

## Practical Browser Behavior Illustrated

When you visit a page, your browser may establish connections to several remote servers:

- The main site server (first-party).
- Third-party servers delivering ads, analytics, fonts, or other resources.

uBO Scope categorizes each connection attempt:

- **Allowed:** Connection completed successfully.
- **Blocked:** Prevented outright.
- **Stealth:** Blocked invisibly.

The extension's UI and badge provide clear summaries, aiding you in quickly grasping this network picture.

## Examples

### Scenario 1: Minimal Third-Party Connections
You open a privacy-focused news site that loads images and scripts only from its own domain and a trusted CDN.

- **Allowed:** 2 distinct third-party domains (e.g., `news-site.com` and `trustedcdn.net`).
- **Blocked:** 0
- **Stealth:** 0
- **Badge Count:** 2

### Scenario 2: Advertising-Heavy Site
You visit a popular blog that loads scripts and trackers from multiple ad networks and analytics providers.

- **Allowed:** 8 distinct third-party domains
- **Blocked:** 5 third-party requests blocked by your content blocker
- **Stealth:** 3 stealth-blocked domains
- **Badge Count:** 8

This indicates substantial third-party exposure; although some connections are blocked, 8 third-party servers still receive data.

---

## Tips for Success

- Consider the badge count as your quick privacy indicator; aim for a low number.
- Use the allowed, blocked, and stealth breakdown in the popup panel to understand individual third-party servers.
- Remember that not all third-party domains are harmful; many are essential services.
- Use uBO Scope to complement your content blocker — it reveals connections regardless of blocking and any stealth techniques.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Don’t confuse block count with total third-party exposure; a higher block count does not always mean better privacy.
- Avoid relying on ad-blocker test websites—they produce artificial scenarios that don’t reflect real browsing.
- Understand that some connections happen outside `webRequest` API visibility (rare), so uBO Scope may not see 100% of all network requests.

## Example: Understanding Domains in Practice
When uBO Scope reports a domain such as `example.cdn.com`:
- The **hostname** is `example.cdn.com`.
- The **domain** extracted is typically `cdn.com`, derived using the public suffix list, recognizing domain hierarchy.

This ensures connection counts aggregate accurately to the organizational level users can recognize easily.
