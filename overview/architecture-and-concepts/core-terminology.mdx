# Key Concepts and Terminology

Understanding the language and key terms used throughout uBO Scope is essential for interpreting the data and insights the extension provides. This page introduces crucial terminology related to connection outcomes, explaining what 'allowed connection', 'blocked connection', and 'stealth connection' mean within the context of uBO Scope, as well as how these outcomes are reflected in the extension's user interface.

---

## Core Terminology

### Allowed Connection

An **allowed connection** is a network request made by a web page that uBO Scope has identified as successful and permitted through the browser’s content blocking filters.

- **What it means:** This connection reached its destination without being blocked.
- **User impact:** These connections contribute to your actual network footprint, indicating servers that content on the page genuinely contacted.
- **In the UI:** These are listed under the 'not blocked' section in the popup panel, highlighting domains and their request counts.

### Blocked Connection

A **blocked connection** represents a network request that was actively prevented by uBO Scope’s underlying filters or by the browser’s content blocking mechanisms.

- **What it means:** The request failed due to intentional blocking.
- **User impact:** These connections reflect content that tried to load but was stopped, often advertisements or trackers.
- **In the UI:** These appear in the 'blocked' section with domains and counts indicating how often blocking occurred.

### Stealth Connection

The **stealth connection** is a special classification for requests that don’t appear directly in the network logs as allowed or blocked but are detected through indirect evidence such as redirection or other nuanced network behaviors.

- **What it means:** The request was intercepted or redirected stealthily, making its original intent or outcome less obvious.
- **User impact:** These stealth-blocked connections can represent hidden tracking attempts or redirections trying to circumvent blocking rules.
- **In the UI:** Shown in the 'stealth-blocked' section with detailed domain information.

## How Connection Outcomes Map to Reports

uBO Scope organizes all observed connections by their outcome type to give you a clear picture of the traffic your browser handles.

- **Allowed connections** indicate successful server contacts, giving an accurate count of active third-party connections.
- **Blocked connections** show attempts the extension or filters prevented, helping you identify potential privacy risks.
- **Stealth connections** reveal covert network activities that evade typical blocking, exposing more subtle privacy concerns.

Each connection aggregates counts both at the hostname level and the higher-level domain level. This allows you to see not only individual servers contacted but also the broader organizations or service providers behind them.

## Why These Terms Matter

Consider a typical user scenario:

- You visit a news website.
- The popup panel shows several **allowed connections** under 'not blocked', revealing which third-party domains the site contacted.
- The **blocked connections** section lists domains that tried to load but were stopped, such as known ad servers.
- The **stealth connections** section highlights connections that employed advanced evasion techniques, possibly hidden trackers.

This terminology equips you to interpret the connection data with confidence:

- Recognize which third-party servers you’re actually communicating with.
- Understand the scope and effectiveness of your content blocking.
- Detect subtle attempts to bypass filters.

## Frequently Used Jargon Explained

| Term               | Explanation                                                                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hostname**       | The full network address extracted from the URL of the request (e.g., `subdomain.example.com`).|
| **Domain**          | The registered or public suffix plus one label, providing the organizational domain (e.g., `example.com`).|
| **Request Count**   | The number of times connections to a hostname or domain were recorded for the tab/session.     |
| **Popup Panel**     | The main user interface panel displayed by the extension, summarizing connection outcomes.     |
| **Content Blocker** | The filtering mechanism in the browser or extension that rules which connections are allowed or blocked.|

## Practical Tips for Interpreting Terminology

- When seeing many allowed connections for domains you don’t recognize, consider investigating if they’re essential or trackers.
- Blocked connections help you validate your filter lists and blocking rules.
- Stealth connections should raise your attention—they often indicate more sophisticated tracking that requires further analysis.
- Counts are aggregated during the tab’s lifetime and reset when the page refreshes or changes to provide current session insights.

---

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **Misinterpreting stealth connections as allowed:** Stealth connections are blocked but may appear as redirects or hidden requests—don’t mistake them for normal traffic.
- **Assuming each hostname represents a unique organization:** Use the domain level grouping to understand the broader entity behind multiple hostnames.
- **Ignoring count aggregation:** Multiple requests to the same server accumulate, so high counts indicate persistent or frequent resource loads.
