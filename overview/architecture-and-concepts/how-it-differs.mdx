# How uBO Scope Differs from Content Blockers

## Understand Your True Network Exposure with uBO Scope

Unlike traditional content blockers that actively prevent connections, **uBO Scope does not block any content itself**. Instead, it provides an **objective, transparent report** of all network connection attempts your browser encounters — whether those connections were allowed, blocked by other blockers, or prevented by DNS-level filtering.

This unique vantage point offers an **unbiased view of your browser's real network activity** and exposure. It eliminates the guesswork and confusion caused by unreliable block counters or misleading ad blocker test pages, empowering you to make informed decisions about your privacy and security.

## What Is Different About uBO Scope?

- **No Blocking, Only Reporting:** uBO Scope listens to your browser’s network events without interfering, capturing every connection attempt made by web pages and browser components.

- **Transparency Beyond Blockers:** By monitoring connections at the browser level, it reveals blocked, allowed, and stealth-blocked attempts — including those blocked by other extensions, DNS filters, or network-level controls.

- **Unbiased Exposure Insight:** Unlike block counters on content blockers’ badges, which can be misleading or inflated, uBO Scope shows the **real number of distinct third-party domains contacted**.

- **Debunks Common Misconceptions:** It clears up myths such as “a higher block count means better blocking” or the notion that ad blocker test pages reliably measure effectiveness.

- **Cross-Platform Cross-Browser:** Designed for Chromium, Firefox, and Safari with consistent behavior, it collects unified data regardless of your browser or content blocker setup.

## Why This Matters to You

Content blockers display block counts based on their own filtering logic but do not reveal if your browser actually still connects to more third-party servers. uBO Scope sits outside any blocking mechanism and uses the browser's `webRequest` API to track the **true number of distinct third-party hosts involved** in loading your web pages. This approach ensures:

- **Accurate Privacy Assessment:** Knowing what domains your browser contacts helps you understand your digital footprint.

- **Effective Filter Comparison:** You can fairly compare content blockers without relying on misleading block counts.

- **Reality-Check Against False Positives:** Identify when test pages overstate blocker performance or simulate unrealistic scenarios.

- **Better Filter List Maintenance:** Filter maintainers can use scoped real-world data to improve list accuracy.

## How uBO Scope Works (User Perspective)

1. When you navigate to a website, the browser attempts to load resources and establish connections.
2. uBO Scope passively listens to these network events, categorizing individual third-party hosts based on connection outcome:
   - **Allowed (Not Blocked):** Connections successfully completed.
   - **Blocked:** Connections blocked and failed (tracked when browser reports errors).
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections redirected or stealthily prevented (occurs when blockers delay or modify requests).
3. You open the uBO Scope popup and see a clearinghouse summary showing:
   - The distinct domains contacted.
   - How many connections were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
4. The extension’s toolbar badge reflects the count of distinct third-party domains that successfully connected.

This workflow is designed to give you a **clarity-first experience**, focusing on what really happens at the network level without the noise of filtering logic or blocker implementation details.

## Practical Scenario: Resolving Block Count Misconceptions

Imagine you are trying two different ad blockers and each shows a different count of blocked requests in their toolbar icons:

- Blocker A shows a high block count but your browser still connects to many third-party hosts.
- Blocker B shows a lower block count but actually prevents more distinct connections.

Using uBO Scope, you verify the actual number of distinct third-party domains your browser connects to — regardless of who blocked them. The data reveals that Blocker B provides better network exposure protection despite showing fewer blocked events. Without uBO Scope, you might incorrectly assume Blocker A is superior just because its block count is higher.

## Tips for Effective Use

- **Check Your Toolbar Badge:** A lower count means fewer distinct remote servers contacted, which generally corresponds to better privacy.

- **Use the Popup for Details:** View detailed lists of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains for granular insight.

- **Don’t Rely on Ad Blocker Test Pages:** Instead, observe the real-world data uBO Scope provides to assess your privacy landscape.

- **Combine with Content Blockers:** Use uBO Scope alongside your blocker of choice to monitor and validate their effectiveness objectively.

- **Remember the Scope:** uBO Scope requires the browser’s `webRequest` API to track requests, so some network connections outside of this reach may not be reported.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Mistaking Block Counts for Success:** Don’t judge blocker effectiveness solely on their displayed block count.

- **Trusting Ad Blocker Test Pages:** These pages often simulate non-realistic scenarios and don’t account for stealth blocking techniques.

- **Ignoring Stealth Blocking:** Some blockers stealthily prevent connections; uBO Scope detects and reports these separately.

- **Assuming All Blockers Work the Same:** Different blockers use different mechanisms, but uBO Scope provides a consistent reporting baseline.

## Summary

Through passive network event observation, uBO Scope delivers a **clear, unbiased picture of your browser’s third-party connection landscape**. This empowers users to move beyond misleading metrics, enabling informed privacy decisions and realistic expectations about content blockers.
