# Feature Summary: uBO Scope

uBO Scope provides focused, actionable insights into your browser's network activity by summarizing all connections to third-party remote servers per browser tab. It offers real-time visibility of these connections categorized by their status, enabling users to understand exactly which domains their browser interacts with, whether blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed.

---

## Real-Time Per-Tab Reporting

The core strength of uBO Scope lies in its detailed monitoring of network requests on a per-tab basis. For the active tab, the extension presents:

- **Domain Listing:** A comprehensive list of remote domains contacted by the webpage.
- **Connection Status:** Domains are classified into three categories:
  - **Allowed:** Domains the browser successfully connected to.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with connections redirected stealthily (hidden from the main UI but captured by the extension).

This granular classification helps users discern exactly how web activity unfolds behind the scenes, empowering informed privacy decisions.

## Accurate Toolbar Badge Count

Unlike generic block counters, uBO Scope’s toolbar badge shows the **number of distinct third-party remote servers the browser connected to** from the current tab. This count reflects unique remote domains rather than the total number of blocked requests, offering a more accurate picture of actual network exposure.

By focusing on distinct domains contacted rather than just block counts, it:

- Clarifies misconceptions about content blockers that report higher block counts but allow more third-party connections.
- Highlights real network exposure rather than just filter list activity.

## Cross-Content Blocker Compatibility

uBO Scope operates independently of the content blockers in use and reports network outcomes regardless of any blocking mechanism active in the browser. It relies on the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor all network connection attempts made by web pages, including:

- Connections allowed by existing content blockers.
- Connections blocked either by content blockers or DNS-level filtering.
- Connections redirected stealthily (used by some advanced blockers to hide blocking activity).

This neutrality ensures that uBO Scope offers an unbiased view of actual network requests and their results, making it invaluable for verifying how privacy tools function together.

## Ease of Deployment Across Browsers

uBO Scope supports major browsers with modern extension APIs, including Chromium-based browsers, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari:

- Defined with browser-specific manifest files, ensuring compatibility and seamless installation.
- Utilizes modular background scripts and a compact popup UI.
- Requires minimal permissions (`webRequest`, `storage`, and `activeTab`) that focus solely on monitoring network requests.

Users benefit from a consistent experience and reliable operation across platforms, making it widely accessible.

## Practical Example

When you browse to a website, uBO Scope instantly tracks every third-party remote server your browser tries to contact. If the site's scripts load resources from `cdn.example.com` (allowed), `tracker.ads.com` (blocked), or a stealth-blocked analytics server, you will see these domains neatly organized in the popup with counts showing how many requests were made.

The toolbar badge updates in real-time to show the count of distinct allowed third-party remote domains, helping you quickly assess your exposure on the current page.

---

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Interpret Badge Carefully:** A lower badge count means fewer distinct third-party servers contacted, which is generally better for privacy.
- **Use Popup for Detail:** The popup gives a clear breakdown of domains by request outcome, helping identify unexpected connections.
- **Cross-Verify with Content Blockers:** Since uBO Scope measures network traffic beyond what content blockers report, use it to verify how comprehensive your blocking setup is.
- **Be Aware of Stealth Blocking:** Some blockers use stealth techniques—seeing these domains flagged as “stealth-blocked” can validate those protections.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **No Data Displayed:** Ensure you have an active tab selected with web traffic. If the popup shows “NO DATA,” try refreshing the page.
- **Incorrect Badge Counts:** Badge updates rely on the browser’s `webRequest` API; certain browser privacy modes or restrictions may limit data.
- **Compatibility Restrictions:** Ensure your browser version meets the minimum requirements detailed in the Supported Browsers documentation.
