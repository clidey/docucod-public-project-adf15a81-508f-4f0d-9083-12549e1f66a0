# Key Concepts & Terminology

Understanding uBO Scope starts with grasping a few foundational terms and ideas that shape how the extension works and what it reports. These concepts clarify what you're seeing when uBO Scope reveals network activity, empowering you to interpret its data accurately and leverage it effectively.

---

## Remote Server

A **remote server** is any computer or system on the internet that your browser attempts to communicate with to load resources, such as images, scripts, or API data. It is ‘remote’ because it is outside your own device and network.

**Why this matters:**
- uBO Scope focuses on *all* remote servers contacted by your browser, giving you transparency beyond a page’s own domain.
- Each server is identified typically by its hostname or domain.


## Third-Party Connection

A **third-party connection** is any network request made to a remote server different from the website you are currently visiting (the first-party).

**Example:**
- If you visit example.com and the site loads a script from analytics.com, the request to analytics.com is a third-party connection.

**Why this matters:**
- uBO Scope counts distinct third-party remote servers contacted.
- A lower count generally indicates fewer external entities are being contacted, often preferred for privacy.


## Stealth Blocking

**Stealth blocking** refers to network requests that are redirected or blocked in such a way that the originating webpage cannot detect the blocking occurred. This is often done by quietly redirecting or suppressing a connection so the page remains unaware.

**How uBO Scope reports this:**
- Stealth-blocked connections are separated from plainly blocked connections.
- This gives insight into connections that might be hidden from the webpage but stopped by filtering.


## Badge Count Measurement

The badge number you see on the uBO Scope browser icon represents **the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser contacted successfully** (or tried to contact).

**Key details:**
- It counts *servers*, not individual requests — multiple requests to the same server count as one.
- A higher badge count means your browser connected with more unique external servers.
- It does *not* count blocked servers.


## Domain vs. Hostname

- **Hostname:** The full address of a server, such as `assets.example.com`.
- **Domain:** The higher-level portion, such as `example.com`.

uBO Scope organizes and reports outcomes using domain-level grouping, helping you see aggregated data about the entities contacted.


## Outcomes of Connections

uBO Scope classifies network request outcomes into three categories:

- **Allowed (not blocked):** Connections that successfully fetched resources.
- **Blocked:** Connections that your browser or filter actively prevented.
- **Stealth:** Connections that were stealthily blocked or redirected to hide blocking from the webpage.

This categorization helps you understand how content blockers and network filters impact your browsing.

## How These Concepts Work Together

When you open the uBO Scope popup, it shows how many distinct remote domains your current tab has connected to, categorized by outcome:

- You see the site's own domain split into hostname and domain parts.
- Under **Allowed**, you find third-party domains your browser connected with.
- **Stealth** lists domains where connections were redirected or stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked** lists domains where requests failed or were actively stopped.

This structure lets you quickly assess the web connections made, uncover hidden or stealthy blocking, and understand the privacy footprint of your browsing.


## Practical Example

Imagine you're loading a news page. You might see:

- Your news site's main domain as the context.
- Under **Allowed**, CDN providers or analytics domains the page uses legitimately.
- Under **Stealth**, ad servers that the content blocker silently stops.
- Under **Blocked**, clearly blocked ad or tracking domains.

By reviewing these lists, you can judge whether the content blocking is effective and spot unexpected external connections.

## Tips for Making the Most of uBO Scope

- **Focus on the badge count:** Use it as a reliable indicator of third-party exposure; aim for a lower count.
- **Check both stealth and blocked:** Stealth blocking can hide from webpages, so evaluating both helps assess true blocking.
- **Use domain grouping:** This simplifies interpreting many requests by collapsing many hostnames under a single domain.
- **Be aware of legitimate third parties:** CDNs and trusted services often appear as allowed domains; a low number of these is normal.


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Don’t confuse count with security:** A low number means fewer third parties but doesn’t guarantee privacy or security.
- **Don’t rely on block counts in other blockers:** uBO Scope measures distinct connected domains, which is a better metric.
- **Avoid ad blocker test pages:** Those tests often do not reflect real-world browsing and can mislead about efficacy.

| Remote Server      | Any external machine your browser connects to over the internet.                                |
| Third-Party Connection | Network request to a domain different from the visited website's domain.                         |
| Stealth Blocking   | Blocking that hides its action from the webpage via redirection or suppression.                |
| Badge Count        | The number of distinct third-party domains your browser successfully connected with.           |
| Hostname           | The full domain address including subdomains, e.g., `cdn.example.com`.                          |
| Domain             | The main domain, typically the registered domain name, e.g., `example.com`.                     |
| Allowed            | Network requests which the browser successfully completed.                                      |
