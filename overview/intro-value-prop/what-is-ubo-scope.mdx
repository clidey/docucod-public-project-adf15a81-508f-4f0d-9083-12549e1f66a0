# What is uBO Scope?

## Revealing the Invisible: Understanding uBO Scope

Every time you browse the web, your browser connects to many servers behind the scenes—some essential, some third-party services that load additional content or track activity. uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to make this invisible web activity visible, empowering you to see exactly which remote servers your browser talks to.

### Why is This Important?

Understanding these connections helps you:

- **Gain transparency** into your online footprint beyond what typical content blockers reveal.
- **Identify and audit third-party domains** that your visited websites connect to.
- **Challenge assumptions** about the effectiveness of content blockers based on block counts.
- **Assist filter list maintainers** with real-world connection data, especially on devices with limited browser tools.

### Key Value Propositions

- **Independent connection tracking:** Works regardless of which content blocker you use or network-level DNS blocking.
- **Third-party server focus:** Shows distinct third-party remote servers contacted, letting you assess actual exposure.
- **Simple, clear UI:** A badge count and popup panel display connection summaries by allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked categories.
- **Helpful for filter maintainers:** Provides raw insights useful for refining filter lists and diagnosing issues.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users wanting detailed visibility into their network connections.
- Users skeptical of block counts as a quality metric for content blockers.
- Filter list maintainers seeking an independent tool to assess real-world connections.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension that reports all attempted or successful connections to remote servers initiated by web pages in your browser. It provides a clear and independent view of network activity, helping users see what happens under the hood while browsing—connections that many blockers or browsers keep hidden.

### Core Mission

The core purpose is to make these connections visible, clarifying the nature and count of distinct third-party servers your browser communicates with, independent of any content blocking in place. This transparency enables smarter decisions about your privacy and filter lists.

### How Does uBO Scope Work?

It taps into browser APIs, specifically the `webRequest` listener, to monitor network requests and their outcomes (allowed, blocked, redirects, errors). It counts unique third-party domain connections and displays this number as a badge on the toolbar icon, with further details available in a popup panel.

<u>Note:</u> It depends on the browser's ability to report network requests via the `webRequest` API. Requests outside this scope (e.g., certain internal or future browser network mechanisms) will not be visible.

### Addressing Common Misconceptions

uBO Scope helps debunk two key myths:

- **Higher block counts mean better blocking:** A higher number of blocked items may actually correlate with more connections allowed overall.
- **Ad blocker test web pages provide reliable results:** Such tests use unrealistic scenarios and fail to capture stealth blocking and real-world network behavior.

## Features That Bring Visibility and Clarity

### 1. Toolbar Icon Badge
A real-time counter shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to on the active tab. A lower badge count signals fewer third-party connections, usually a positive privacy indicator.

### 2. Popup Panel
When you click the icon, a panel appears summarizing recent connections:
- **Not Blocked:** Domains successfully connected.
- **Stealth Blocked:** Domains whose connections were stealthily blocked (usually redirects or hidden attempts).
- **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked.

Each section lists unique domains with a count of how many requests each domain had.

### 3. Independent Network Request Monitoring
It monitors network traffic regardless of content blockers or DNS-level blocking. Even when other tools filter or block requests, uBO Scope reports the true connection outcomes as seen by the browser.

### 4. Support for Multiple Browsers
Available for Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Chrome) and Firefox, ensuring broad accessibility without compromising functionality.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Privacy & Security Awareness
See exactly which third-party domains your favorite websites contact, helping to spot unexpected connections or overreaching trackers.

### Evaluating Content Blockers
Compare different content blockers beyond block counts by observing actual distinct third-party connections allowed.

### Filter List Maintenance
Get actionable data to validate or improve filter lists, especially on devices where conventional developer tools are unavailable.

### Educational Insights
Learn how web pages rely on multiple external servers and understand the network ecosystem behind modern web browsing.

## Getting Started with uBO Scope

1. **Install the extension** from [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. After installation, browse normally.
3. Observe the badge count on the toolbar icon—it updates live to show third-party server counts.
4. Click the icon to open the popup panel for detailed domain connection information.

<u>Tip:</u> Keep in mind the badge shows *unique third-party servers contacted*—a powerful metric beyond simple block counts.

## Best Practices and Tips

- Use uBO Scope as your go-to measure for connection visibility rather than relying on block counts alone.
- Review the popup regularly to stay informed about third-party connections on high-traffic or sensitive sites.
- Filter list maintainers should leverage detailed domain counts to fine-tune their blocking rules.
- Combine uBO Scope with other privacy tools to get a comprehensive picture.

## Common Pitfalls

- Some legitimate third-party services like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) may appear in the count—this is normal.
- uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API, so some requests may not appear if the browser restricts reporting.
- Badge counts do not indicate blocking power but unique server contacts, so do not interpret high counts as poor blocking without context.

By making transparent what is otherwise hidden, uBO Scope equips you with the knowledge to understand and control your web connections better than ever before.
