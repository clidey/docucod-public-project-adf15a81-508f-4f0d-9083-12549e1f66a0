# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

This page defines the core users of uBO Scope—privacy-conscious individuals, tech-savvy users, and filter list maintainers—and highlights how it addresses their key needs and common real-world scenarios.

## Understanding the Primary Users

### Privacy-Conscious Individuals

If you care about your online privacy, you want to know exactly which third-party servers your browser connects to while you browse. uBO Scope reveals these connections, making it clear how many and which remote servers your browser contacts.

**Why this matters:**
- Many third parties are hidden or obfuscated behind content blockers.
- Not all third parties are malicious, but unexpected or numerous connections can signal privacy leaks.
- Keeping the number of distinct third-party connections as low as possible improves your privacy.

### Tech-Savvy Users

For users who enjoy digging deeper into control and transparency, uBO Scope offers detailed visibility into network requests at the domain level.

**What tech-savvy users gain:**
- Real-time monitoring of connection outcomes: allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- Insights beyond what basic block counts or simple ad blocker test pages provide.
- Ability to verify how different content blockers influence actual network connections.

### Filter List Maintainers

Maintainers of content blocking lists benefit greatly from precise, unbiased data about network requests and connection outcomes.

**Use case highlights:**
- Validate the effectiveness of blocking rules by seeing actual connections reported.
- Debug filter list issues on devices lacking advanced browser developer tools.
- Plan filter improvements with real data on third-party network activity.

- Accurately reports connection attempts regardless of the content blockers in place.
- Allows validation of list changes even on locked-down devices.
- Provides a solid foundation for debugging and list enhancements.
