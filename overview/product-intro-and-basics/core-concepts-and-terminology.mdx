# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the core concepts and key terms within uBO Scope is essential for interpreting its insights into your browser's network activity. This page defines critical terminology such as 'third-party server', 'allowed', 'blocked', and 'stealth' connections, clarifying their roles in the privacy landscape that uBO Scope exposes.

---

## Why These Terms Matter

Web browsing today involves numerous invisible network interactions beyond the primary website you visit. uBO Scope shines a light on these connections, categorizing them to help you grasp the privacy implications effectively. Knowing these terms empowers you to analyze which external servers your browser contacts and how those connections are handled, enabling informed privacy decisions.

---

## Key Terms Defined

### Third-Party Server
A **third-party server** is any remote server your browser contacts that is outside the domain of the website currently being viewed. For example, if you visit `example.com` and your browser connects to `cdn.example.net` or `analytics.example.org`, these are third-party servers.

Understanding third-party servers is crucial because they often collect data about your browsing habits, impacting your privacy.

### Allowed Connections
An **allowed connection** is a network request to a third-party server that was completed successfully without being obstructed. These are the connections where resources, scripts, or data have been transferred, indicating that the browser fetched content or communicated freely with the external server.

In uBO Scope's UI, these are shown under "not blocked" connections.

### Blocked Connections
A **blocked connection** refers to a network request to a third-party server that was prevented from completing. Blocking may occur if a content blocker, browser security feature, or network policy stops the request—effectively sparing you from potentially unwanted tracking or data transfer.

In the UI, these connections appear under the "blocked" category.

### Stealth Connections
**Stealth connections** are attempts by the browser or content blockers to silently or inconspicuously handle certain requests. These requests may be redirected, modified, or silently blocked in a way designed to prevent detection or avoid web page breakage, commonly employed by advanced content blockers.

In uBO Scope, these show up as "stealth-blocked" connections, indicating that although a connection outcome was altered, it was done subtly to maintain user experience while protecting privacy.

## How These Terms Reflect Your Browsing Privacy

uBO Scope tracks all connections your browser attempts or completes during webpages loading. It records outcomes as the request progresses through the network pipeline—success, redirection (stealth), or failure (blocked). This classification helps you judge:

- How many unique third-party domains your browser connected with.
- Which requests were allowed, potentially exposing your data.
- Which were blocked, enhancing your privacy.
- Where stealth blocking is engaged, balancing protection with usability.

This awareness is more valuable than simple block counts since the true measure of privacy impact depends on the distinct servers that successfully interact with your browser.

---

## Understanding Domain Lists in uBO Scope

uBO Scope organizes connection data on a per-domain basis, differentiating between hostnames and higher-level domains using the Public Suffix List (PSL). Recognizing this hierarchy helps identify when connections are coming from distinct entities or subdomains.

- **Hostname:** The full domain name, e.g., `images.cdn.example.com`
- **Domain:** The registered domain part, e.g., `example.com` (determined with PSL rules)

By grouping connections using domains, uBO Scope presents a clearer perspective on third-party entities, rather than overwhelming you with numerous hostname variations.

---

## Practical Example

Imagine you open `news.example.com`:

- Your browser successfully loads images and scripts from `cdn.example.com` and `ads.third-party.com` — these are recorded as **allowed** connections under those domains.
- A request to `trackers.third-party.com` is silently redirected or suppressed by your blocker — shown as a **stealth** connection.
- A request to `malicious.third-party.com` is outright **blocked**, preventing data transmission.

Understanding these categories allows you to analyze exactly how your browser interacts with the web environment in terms of privacy.

---

## Tips for Users

- Focus on the **number of distinct allowed third-party domains** to understand your real privacy exposure; fewer allowed third-parties indicate better privacy.
- Don’t equate a higher block count with better privacy; more blocks might mean more overall requests, which can increase exposure.
- Use the terminology definitions here to interpret the summary and detailed domain lists shown in the uBO Scope popup UI.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Common User Questions">
<Accordion title="Why do some connections appear as 'stealth' instead of 'blocked'?">
Stealth connections represent requests that are handled quietly by advanced content blockers or browser mechanisms, employing redirection or silent drops to avoid breaking site functionality. This subtlety differs from outright blocking, which stops the connection completely and visibly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What’s the difference between hostname and domain?">
A hostname is the full specific name (like `images.assets.example.com`), while domain refers to the registered higher-level domain (`example.com`), determined by rules in the Public Suffix List. uBO Scope uses domain grouping to provide clearer insights.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is it bad if I see many allowed third-party connections?">
It depends. Some allowed third-party servers, such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), are essential for website functionality and performance. However, a large number of unknown or advertising-related third-party connections may indicate more tracking and data exposure.
