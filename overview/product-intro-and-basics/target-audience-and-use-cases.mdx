# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

## Understanding the Audience

uBO Scope is designed for users who want clear, unfiltered insight into the network connections their web browsers make. Whether you are a privacy-conscious individual, a filter list maintainer, or an investigative web user, uBO Scope equips you with critical knowledge about third-party network activity that often goes unnoticed.

### Privacy-Conscious Users

If you care deeply about your online privacy, uBO Scope is a vital companion. It uncovers every remote server connection your browser attempts or successfully makes, helping you:

- Verify that your privacy settings and content blockers are working as intended.
- Detect unwanted third-party tracking or data leaks.
- Understand the true extent of third-party resources loaded by websites.

### Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining effective filter lists requires a precise understanding of which remote servers interact with browsing activity. uBO Scope offers:

- Detailed reporting on all network requests, regardless of the content blocker in place.
- Visibility into stealth blocking and errors to optimize filter rules.
- Real-world data to ensure filters are neither overblocking nor underblocking.

### Internet Investigators and Analysts

For users who analyze web traffic to detect anomalies, troubleshoot issues, or study website behavior, uBO Scope delivers:

- Transparent, real-time monitoring of network requests.
- Clear categorization into allowed, blocked, and stealth connections.
- Reliable data unaffected by DNS or browser-level content filtering nuances.

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. Verifying Website Privacy Exposure

Use uBO Scope to check if a website loads resources from unexpected third parties, potentially exposing your browsing activity beyond your knowledge. This empowers you to make informed decisions about site trustworthiness.

### 2. Evaluating Content Blockers

Instead of relying on generic 'ad blocker test' pages, use uBO Scope’s transparent network reporting to:

- Compare how different blockers affect third-party connections.
- Understand the real number of distinct servers reached despite blocking.
- Dispel myths that higher block counts always mean better protection.

### 3. Debunking Common Privacy Myths

uBO Scope actively supports myth busting around content blockers by:

- Showing that the number of blocked requests is not the definitive measure of a blocker’s effectiveness.
- Demonstrating that some blockers might report fewer blocks yet allow fewer third-party connections.
- Revealing that browser test sites may not reflect realistic blocking behavior.

### 4. Monitoring Third-Party Connections on Limited Devices

On devices where you cannot access traditional developer tools or network inspectors, uBO Scope offers a lightweight, easy way to monitor third-party servers, aiding in privacy auditing without extensive setup.

## Why This Matters

Modern web browsing involves numerous hidden third-party connections that impact privacy and security. uBO Scope’s clear, badge-based feedback and detailed popup summary turn complex network behavior into actionable insights. It ensures you are not left in the dark about where your data is going or which servers your browser talks to as you browse.

This knowledge empowers users to adapt their privacy tools, maintain more accurate filters, and develop better web habits.
