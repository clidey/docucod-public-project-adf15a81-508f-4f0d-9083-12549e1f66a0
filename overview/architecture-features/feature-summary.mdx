# Feature Summary: Understanding uBO Scope's Core Functionality

uBO Scope is designed to provide you with clear, actionable insights into every remote server connection your browser makes when loading webpages. This page breaks down the key features you’ll engage with immediately after installation, focusing on how to interpret the badge count, understand connection statuses, dive into network request details, and benefit from multi-browser support.

## At a Glance: Your Connection Dashboard

Once installed, uBO Scope activates a toolbar icon with a badge count. This badge is your first window into the privacy and network exposure of the active browser tab.

- **Badge Count Meaning:** The number displayed represents the total count of *distinct third-party domains* to which your current web page has successfully connected. This helps you quickly gauge the level of third-party network activity.

- **Why This Matters:** A lower badge count means fewer remote servers accessed—often a sign of reduced tracking and increased privacy.

## Live Connection Status Reporting

uBO Scope classifies every network request associated with your active tab into three outcome categories, immediately visible in the popup panel:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains that received successful network requests.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where redirection or stealth blocking was detected, indicating network requests that were silently suppressed or redirected during loading.
- **Blocked:** Domains whose network requests were explicitly blocked and did not complete.

This triage allows you to quickly understand which third parties are reaching your browser, which are silently blocked, and which are openly restricted.

## Network Request Details Made Simple

Upon clicking the uBO Scope icon, the popup panel presents a breakdown of domains under each category, accompanied by the count of requests per domain. This granular insight makes it easy to:

- **Identify networks with the heaviest traffic** on your active tab.
- **Spot suspicious domains** that generate numerous requests.
- **Compare allowed vs blocked domains** to evaluate your content blocker’s effectiveness.

All domain names are normalized for readability, including internationalized domain names (IDNs), so you see the true domain in a familiar format.

## Seamless Multi-Browser Support

uBO Scope installs and operates consistently across leading browsers, including Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Chrome), Firefox, and Safari (version 18.5+). This cross-browser compatibility ensures:

- Consistent network connection reporting regardless of your preferred browsing environment.
- Identical user experience and badge semantics across platforms.
- Reliable operation utilizing each browser’s native `webRequest` API for the most accurate detection.

This makes uBO Scope a dependable companion whether you’re on Windows, macOS, Linux, or iOS.

## Practical Example: Tracking Third-Party Connections on an E-Commerce Site

Imagine visiting an online store. With uBO Scope:

1. The badge count shows 12, indicating 12 unique third-party domains loaded resources.
2. Opening the popup reveals:
   - **Allowed:** Payment gateways, CDN providers, and analytics services.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Known trackers redirected silently to protect your privacy.
   - **Blocked:** Ad networks explicitly prevented from loading.

This immediate transparency lets you verify that tracking and ads are controlled as expected, without breaking the site’s core functionality.

## Tips to Maximize Your Use of uBO Scope

- **Watch the Badge Count:** Use it as a quick privacy health check for each site.
- **Explore the Popup:** Always check which domains are allowed and blocked to identify any unexpected third parties.
- **Stay Updated:** Although uBO Scope is minimalist and rarely updated, ensure you have the latest version for best browser compatibility.

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting & Best Practices">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Reads Zero or No Data">
- Make sure you have an active tab loaded with a webpage.
- If viewing about:blank or browser internal pages, no data will be collected.
- Give the extension a moment after navigation to gather request data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Domains Despite Network Activity">
- Confirm that your browser exposes the `webRequest` API (some browsers limit this on private modes).
- Check other active content blockers that may operate outside of uBO Scope’s reach.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected High Badge Count">
- Remember the count includes all distinct third-party domains.
- Some legitimate services, such as content delivery networks (CDNs), may increase counts but are typically safe.
- Use the popup’s allowed section to distinguish these from trackers or ads.
