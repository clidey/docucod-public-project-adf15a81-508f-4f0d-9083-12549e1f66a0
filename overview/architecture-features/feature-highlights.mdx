# Feature Overview

uBO Scope delivers a focused and user-centric set of features designed to reveal the true nature of your web browsing connections. By tracking domain connections in real time, offering a transparent popup report, and providing a concise badge count on the toolbar icon, it empowers you to understand your exposure to third-party servers without relying on guesswork or misleading heuristics.

## Track Third-Party Domain Connections Accurately

At its core, uBO Scope meticulously monitors every network request your browser makes to remote servers. It tracks these connections by:

- Identifying **domains** and **hostnames** involved in web requests during your browsing session.
- Categorizing connection outcomes into _allowed_, _blocked_, or _stealth-blocked_ to clarify what traffic is actually passing through.
- Maintaining session-level data, associating observed domains with browser tabs for detailed context.

This granular tracking helps you uncover which external third-party servers your browser communicates with—valuable insight into your privacy footprint.

## Real-Time Popup Reports for Instant Insights

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup interface emerges with an easy-to-read breakdown of observed connections:

- The **tab hostname and domain** are displayed prominently, orienting you to the current browsing context.
- A **summary count** shows the total number of distinct domains connected by the current tab.
- Separate sections list domains that were:
  - **Not blocked (allowed)** — connections that succeeded.
  - **Stealth-blocked** — connections silently interfered with without alerting the site.
  - **Blocked** — connections actively prevented.

This immediate feedback loop lets you validate and interpret the effectiveness of your content blockers and better understand network activity for each tab.

## Toolbar Badge Reflects Unique Third-Party Domains

The toolbar badge number highlights a simple yet powerful metric: the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser has connected to for the active tab.

- A **lower badge count correlates with reduced exposure** to external networks, often reflecting tighter privacy controls.
- The count excludes the first-party site itself, focusing solely on third-party entities.

This feature helps you quickly gauge the degree of third-party network activity—and assess changes caused by content blocking or browsing choices—without needing to dive into detailed reports.

## Technology-Agnostic Reporting Compatible with Any Blocking Setup

Unlike tools that depend on specific content blockers or their internal APIs, uBO Scope:

- Works independently from any content blocking mechanism.
- Captures outcomes across all blocking methods the browser encounters, including DNS-based blocking or stealth methods.
- Leverages browser `webRequest` APIs uniformly to ensure comprehensive and unbiased data collection.

This broad compatibility means you receive accurate, consistent reporting of network requests no matter your preferred content blocker or blocking technique.

## Connecting Features to Your User Journey

Each uBO Scope feature is designed with your browsing experience in mind:

- While navigating websites, you gain immediate awareness of third-party connections that affect privacy.
- The toolbar badge provides a convenient, glanceable indicator of exposure.
- The detailed popup report invites deeper exploration and validation of content blocking effects.

Together, these features deliver a seamless flow from casual monitoring to expert analysis, giving you control, insight, and actionable data.

## Practical Example: Using the Popup Report

Imagine visiting a news site. You click the uBO Scope icon and see:

- A badge showing "4" — indicating four unique third-party domains connected.
- The popup lists domains such as `cdn.example.com` in **not blocked**, `ads.tracker.com` under **blocked**, and `analytics.silentblocker.net` in the **stealth-blocked** list.

This instantly tells you what data sources are active, which connections your content blocker is intercepting, and which might be slipping through stealthily.

## Tips for Maximizing Value

- **Use the badge as a quick privacy health check**: Regularly monitor the badge number to detect spikes or changes in third-party connections.
- **Leverage the popup for detailed verification**: When suspicious activity appears, dive into the popup sections to identify domains and counts accurately.
- **Combine with filter list insights**: For filter list maintainers, use uBO Scope to validate the real-world impact of blocking rules.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t interpret a higher block count as better blocking without considering actual third-party domain exposure. uBO Scope emphasizes distinct domains, not raw block counts.
- Avoid relying on simplistic "ad blocker test" sites. uBO Scope’s reports reflect true network events as captured by the browser.
