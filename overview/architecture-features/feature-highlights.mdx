description: "A concise tour of uBO Scope’s most important features: transparent tab-specific domain reporting; badge count that reflects unique 3rd-party connections (not merely block counts); clear division of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked requests; compatibility with any content blocking solution that operates via the browser’s 'webRequest' API."

# Feature Highlights

## Unlock Transparent, Tab-Specific Domain Reporting

uBO Scope reveals the network activity of your current tab by categorizing all third-party domains the page interacts with. This tailored, tab-focused insight allows you to see exactly which domains your webpage is connecting to, segmented by the context of each tab. No more guessing or generic reports — every connection is reported as it happens in your active browsing session.

### Why This Matters
Many similar tools only show aggregated data or block counts, which can be misleading. uBO Scope shows granular details per tab, empowering you to understand the real networking behavior of each website you visit.

## Badge Count Reflects Unique Third-Party Connections, Not Just Blocks

Rather than showing the number of blocked requests, uBO Scope’s toolbar badge indicates the count of **distinct third-party remote servers allowed** by your content blocker. This means:

- Fewer unique connections visible implies better privacy and fewer third-party trackers are loading resources.
- A high number signals extensive third-party network activity, regardless of block counts, helping you evaluate the true exposure.

### Real-World Impact
If your badge count is low, your content blocker effectively limits outside connections. This count is a powerful metric to gauge actual network exposure instead of relying solely on seemingly high block numbers, which might indicate more connections occurring.

## Clear Separation of Connection Outcomes: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth-Blocked

uBO Scope distinctly categorizes domains into three intuitive groups to aid comprehension:

- **Allowed**: Domains successfully connected to and not blocked.
- **Blocked**: Domains for which network requests failed due to blocking.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains blocked silently or via redirects without obvious errors, often used by modern stealthy blockers.

This transparent classification helps you see beyond simple blocking metrics, revealing hidden blocking mechanics and providing a full picture.

## Seamless Compatibility Across Content Blockers Using the `webRequest` API

uBO Scope works harmoniously with any browser content blocker or filtering technique that operates through the browser's `webRequest` API. Whether you use uBlock Origin, other extensions, or DNS-based filters, uBO Scope captures the real outcome of network requests as known to the browser.

### This Means:
- You can trust uBO Scope to reflect actual network request outcomes, independent of your current filtering stack.
- It complements, rather than conflicts with, your existing privacy tools.

## How to Use Feature Highlights in Daily Workflows

1. **Open uBO Scope's Popup**
   - Click the extension icon to view the current tab's connection summary.

2. **Review Domain Categories**
   - Quickly scan which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

3. **Interpret Badge Counts**
   - Use the badge on the browser toolbar as a real-time indicator of distinct allowed third-party connections.

4. **Make Informed Privacy Decisions**
   - If you notice unexpected allowed domains or high badge counts, consider refining your content blockers or investigating further.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Focus on Distinct Domains**: Remember the badge count relates to unique domains, not the number of requests. Optimizing for fewer unique domains effectively strengthens privacy.
- **Use Stealth-Blocked Insight**: Stealth blocking is often invisible to users and sites. If you see large stealth-blocked sections, it means your content blocker is operating effectively and invisibly.
- **Pair with Filter List Maintenance**: Filter list maintainers will find the clear domain categorization invaluable when testing filter rules.
- **Refresh Often**: Network activity can change on page reloads or navigation—in the popup, the data dynamically updates to keep you informed.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

- **Why is the Badge Count Different from My Blocker’s Block Count?**
  - uBO Scope counts unique third-party domains allowed, not blocked requests, offering a clearer privacy signal.

- **What If Domains Appear in the Stealth-Blocked Section?**
  - Your content blocker is silently blocking these connections, avoiding webpage breakage or detection.

- **Does uBO Scope Block Connections?**
  - No, it only measures and reports network connections without altering or blocking network requests.
