# Feature Highlights of uBO Scope

## Unlock Transparent, Accurate Network Monitoring Across Browsers

uBO Scope gives you an unfiltered, real-time view into all third-party remote server connections attempted or completed while browsing. Designed to work seamlessly across major web browsers, it empowers you to see beyond regular blocker statistics, revealing the true third-party network landscape on every website you visit.

### What You Gain with uBO Scope

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Works reliably on Chromium-based browsers, Firefox (including Android), and Safari, ensuring consistent insight regardless of your platform.
- **Accurate Connection Reporting:** Tracks all network request outcomes — allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked — independent of any active content blocker or DNS-level filtering.
- **Real-Time Badge Counts:** The toolbar icon badge instantly reflects the number of distinct third-party domains connected during your browsing, helping you gauge exposure at a glance.
- **Categorized Connection Outcomes:** Classifies third-party connections as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked, providing clear visibility into what your browser fetches or stops.
- **Transparent and Privacy-Respecting:** As a companion extension focused on reporting, uBO Scope never modifies traffic — it simply reveals it, supporting privacy-conscious users and filter list developers alike.

### Platform Support Details

uBO Scope is engineered for a broad range of environments:

- **Chromium browsers:** Supported with modern Manifest V3 architecture and service worker background scripts.
- **Firefox:** Includes desktop and Android, utilizing the latest web extension APIs.
- **Safari:** Delivered as a Safari Web Extension supporting macOS 18.5 and above.

This cross-platform support ensures that regardless of your favorite browser, uBO Scope equips you with the same detailed network perspective.

## Deep Dive into Core Features

### Accurate Network Request Tracking

Using browser-provided `webRequest` APIs, uBO Scope captures each network request associated with active tabs, tracking every outcome:

- **Allowed Connections:** Requests that successfully reached their remote servers.
- **Blocked Connections:** Requests that were explicitly blocked by browser-level or external content blockers.
- **Stealth-Blocked Connections:** Redirected or suppressed requests where blocking is disguised to prevent detection by web pages.

This comprehensive tracking reveals the nuanced reality of network activity — not just what blockers say they stopped, but what actually connected.

### Real-Time Badge Count

The extension's icon badge dynamically displays the count of unique third-party domains connected to from the current tab. This badge updates as you browse, giving immediate feedback about third-party exposure without opening the popup.

### Categorized, User-Friendly Popup Interface

Opening uBO Scope’s popup presents a clear, sectioned summary of domains connected during your browsing session, listing domains by outcome category:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains you connected to.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with stealth blocking applied.
- **Blocked:** Domains blocked outright.

Each domain shows the number of connection attempts, enabling you to quickly identify persistent third parties.

### Independent of Active Blockers

uBO Scope operates alongside any other content blockers or privacy tools without interference. This means it reports connections _regardless_ of whether another blocker is active, including networks blocked at different layers such as DNS or stealth modes.

### Underlying Domain Resolution

To present accurate domain-level reporting, uBO Scope uses updated public suffix lists and applies punycode decoding. This ensures that internationalized domain names and complex site hostnames are correctly resolved and grouped.

## How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Privacy Toolkit

Imagine visiting a news site with an active content blocker. The blocker might report dozens of blocked requests, but uBO Scope shows you the true number of distinct third-party servers your browser actually contacted — a more meaningful metric to assess privacy risk. 

Filter list maintainers benefit from this honest visibility to understand deeply what third parties slip through blockers in real-world browsing.

For less technical users, the straightforward badge and categorized popup provide an easy way to understand invisible web activity without sifting through verbose logs.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Monitor Badge Count Changes:** Notice spikes in the badge count when visiting new sites; high numbers usually mean more third-party exposure.
- **Use the Popup to Identify Persistent Domains:** Repeated connection attempts to unexpected domains may signify trackers or hidden analytics.
- **Complement with Other Tools:** Use uBO Scope alongside a content blocker (like uBlock Origin) for both active protection and accurate measurement.
- **Keep the Extension Updated:** While infrequent, updates may include enhancements to domain matching and reporting.

## Getting Started Preview

Once installed, uBO Scope activates automatically. As you browse, watch the toolbar icon badge for the running count of third-party connections. Clicking the icon opens the popup with a live domain breakdown. 

No configuration is required, allowing immediate insight without setup hassle.

To dive deeper, see the [Installation and Setup](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope#installation) and [Using the Extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope#usage) guides.

## Example: Interpreting uBO Scope in Action

You visit example.com with uBO Scope enabled. The badge shows **5**, indicating five distinct third-party domains connected during this session:

- Opening the popup, you see domains grouped into:
  - **Allowed:** cdn.examplecdn.com (1), analytics.trackersite.com (3)
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** ads.adnetwork.com (2)
  - **Blocked:** unwanted.domain.net (4)

This tells you that although your content blocker stopped unwanted.domain.net outright, connections to analytics.trackersite.com still happened three times — a piece of information you can’t get from blocker counts alone.
