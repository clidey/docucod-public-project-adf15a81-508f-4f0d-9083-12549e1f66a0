# Quick Feature Overview

Discover the core features of uBO Scope designed to provide instant, actionable insights into your browser's network activity. This page offers you a rapid orientation with the extension's standout capabilities, enabling you to understand and monitor network connections effortlessly.

## Why uBO Scope? Immediate Clarity on Network Requests

uBO Scope shines by delivering per-tab network request tracking that goes beyond typical content blocking tools. It counts distinct remote servers contacted by a browser tab, presenting the data in an intuitive badge and detailed popup interface. This functionality empowers you to gain precise awareness of your network exposure per tab, no matter the content blocker configurations or DNS settings you have.


## Core Features at a Glance

- **Per-Tab Network Request Tracking:** Each browser tab maintains an isolated log of network requests, letting you monitor third-party connections specific to your browsing context without noise from other tabs.

- **Badge Display of Unique Server Counts:** The extension action icon dynamically displays a badge indicating the count of unique servers connected from the active tab, providing instant visual feedback on network activity at a glance.

- **Filter- and Content-Blocker-Agnostic Reporting:** uBO Scope listens directly to the network via browser APIs to ensure all connections attempted—allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked—are included in reports, offering an unbiased and comprehensive view.

- **Integration with All Major Browsers:** Compatible with Chromium, Firefox, and Safari (with specific minimum versions), it blends seamlessly into your preferred browsing environment, guaranteeing consistent functionality across platforms.

## User Experience Flow

1. **Opening a Tab:** As you load a webpage, uBO Scope begins tracking all network requests initiated by that tab.

2. **Dynamic Badge Update:** The extension icon badge updates in real time, showing the number of distinct remote domains contacted.

3. **Accessing Detailed Insights:** Click the extension icon to open a popup that categorizes domains under “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked,” along with the count of domains connected.

4. **Continuation of Monitoring:** As you navigate or open more tabs, each tab’s connection data is tracked separately and preserved until the tab closes, maintaining accurate per-tab insights.

## Practical Example: How Features Solve Real Situations

Imagine visiting a news website in one tab and authenticating to your bank in another. uBO Scope clearly separates the network requests of each tab, so you see precisely which third-party servers each page is contacting.

- The badge on the news tab might reflect a high number of third-party advertisers and trackers.
- Meanwhile, the bank tab will show minimal remote connections, mostly trusted ones.

This per-tab clarity allows you to quickly assess privacy exposure and the effectiveness of your content blocking setup, making real-time privacy decisions effortless.

## Best Practices to Maximize Benefit

- **Use with Content Blockers:** Pair uBO Scope with your existing content blocker for complementary insights; uBO Scope reveals server connections regardless of filtering rules, including stealth-blocked requests.

- **Monitor Site Behavior Over Time:** Keep an eye on badge counts to spot unusual spikes in network domains connected by a tab.

- **Check the Popup Before Entering Sensitive Sessions:** Quickly verify the domains contacted by financial or private service tabs to ensure no unexpected third-party connections.

- **Understand Outcome Categories:** Recognize that domains listed as "stealth-blocked" indicate connections attempted but redirected or obscured, a useful signal for advanced privacy monitoring.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **Badge Not Updating:** This may occur if the tab data is not yet loaded or if the extension’s background processes are delayed. Refreshing the tab or restarting the browser generally resolves this.

- **No Data Displayed in Popup:** Ensure you have granted the extension necessary permissions and that your browser version meets the minimum requirement (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

- **Discrepancies with Other Content Blockers:** Remember uBO Scope independently monitors network requests and may show connections that your content blocker hides, reflecting a comprehensive view rather than filtered data.

---

## Getting Started Preview

To experience these features firsthand:

- **Install uBO Scope** from your browser’s extension marketplace.
- **Open any tab** and watch the badge number update dynamically.
- **Click the extension icon** to open the popup and explore allowed, blocked, and stealth connections.

For detailed setup instructions and more in-depth usage guidance, consult the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/setup/install) and [First Run & Initial Setup](/getting-started/setup/first-run).

## Technical Notes (For Interested Users)

- The extension uses browser webRequest APIs to capture real-time network request events.
- It categorizes request outcomes as **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked** based on their status and redirection.
- Data for each tab is serialized and stored in session storage, ensuring persistence during browsing sessions.
- The badge count reflects unique domains contacted per tab, not just total requests.

# Code Snippet: How Domain Counts Are Displayed in the Popup

```javascript
// This snippet in popup.js renders domain connection counts in the popup:

function renderPanel(data = {}) {
    const { allowed, stealth, blocked } = data;

    // Display counts and domains under each outcome
    const allowedSection = document.querySelector('.outcome.allowed .domains');
    allowed.domains.forEach((count, domain) => {
        let row = createDomainRow(domain, count);
        allowedSection.appendChild(row);
    });

    const stealthSection = document.querySelector('.outcome.stealth .domains');
    stealth.domains.forEach((count, domain) => {
        let row = createDomainRow(domain, count);
        stealthSection.appendChild(row);
    });

    const blockedSection = document.querySelector('.outcome.blocked .domains');
    blocked.domains.forEach((count, domain) => {
        let row = createDomainRow(domain, count);
        blockedSection.appendChild(row);
    });

    // Update summary badge with total unique allowed domains count
    document.querySelector('#summary > span').textContent = allowed.domains.size;
}
```

This direct, clear rendering offers an intuitive user interface for tracking network domains.
