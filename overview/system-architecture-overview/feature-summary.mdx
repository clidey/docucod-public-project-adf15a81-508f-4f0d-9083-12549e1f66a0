# Quick Feature Overview of uBO Scope

Dive into the core capabilities of uBO Scope—your trusted companion extension that transforms browser network activity into clear, actionable privacy insights. This page lays out its standout features, illustrating how uBO Scope empowers you to monitor and understand third-party domain connections in real time, all while seamlessly working alongside any content blocker you use.

---

## Real-Time Domain Connection Reporting

uBO Scope provides a transparent live view into the domains your browser interacts with on a per-tab basis. As you browse, it collects and categorizes every server connection attempt your browser makes, revealing:

- **Allowed connections:** Domains that successfully loaded resources.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Network requests silently redirected or hindered.
- **Blocked connections:** Explicitly prevented domains.

The extension’s popup panel aggregates this information in a clean, structured layout, presenting counts and domain names clearly broken down by these outcome categories. 

**Why it matters:**

Understanding exactly which domains are connected to during a browsing session demystifies background network activities and helps you detect unwanted third-party tracking.

<Example>
Imagine visiting a news site and instantly seeing dozens of third-party domains—including many ad or tracking domains—show up under “allowed.” This insight lets you confirm which connections your content blocker did not block.
</Example>

## Badge Counts Reflect Third-Party Server Connections

The uBO Scope toolbar icon dynamically displays a badge that shows the number of unique third-party remote servers connected for the active tab. 

- **Distinct third-party domain count:** This number helps you quickly assess the extent of external connections.
- **Lower count is better:** Fewer third-party domains indicate fewer potential tracking or privacy risks.

Because the badge directly reflects the number of unique third-party servers contacted, it provides a more meaningful privacy metric than block counts, which can be misleading.

**Practical benefit:**

You can glance at the badge to rapidly assess how “clean” or “tracking-heavy” your browsing session is, empowering informed decisions about site trustworthiness or the effectiveness of your content blocker.

## Compatibility with All Content Blockers

A defining strength of uBO Scope is its independence and compatibility with any content blocker active in your browser:

- **Universal data collection:** It listens to the browser’s webRequest API, capturing outcomes of network requests no matter how they were blocked or allowed.
- **Inclusion of DNS-based or stealth blocking:** Even network requests blocked by external DNS or stealth techniques are reported accurately.
- **Neutral insight provider:** It reveals what happens on the network without interfering or depending on any particular blocker’s internals.

This ensures you receive an unfiltered, objective view of network connections under any content-blocking configuration.

## Additional Benefits

- **Clear categorization:** Domains are grouped by their connection outcome in the popup panel, making it easy to distinguish allowed, stealth, and blocked domains at a glance.
- **Unicode domain support:** Handles internationalized domains gracefully using punycode conversion, ensuring accurate display.
- **Persistent session tracking:** Background processing maintains detailed records per tab for consistent reporting.

## How These Features Work Together

1. **Network requests intercept:** Browser network requests trigger events captured by uBO Scope’s background service worker.
2. **Categorization:** Requests are classified into allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked categories.
3. **Data aggregation:** Counts of domains involved are maintained per outcome and per tab.
4. **User display:** The popup panel presents aggregated info in a user-friendly layout, and the toolbar badge reflects the third-party domain count.

This flow translates complex network events into concise insights, helping you understand and control your browsing privacy effortlessly.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Open the popup on any active tab to review live domain connection details instantly.
- Use badge counts as a quick privacy health check.
- Recognize that some connections, especially to common CDNs and essential third-party services, are legitimate and expected.
- Combine with other privacy tools and your content blocker to maximize protection.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

- **No data visible in popup:** Ensure you have an active tab with loaded content. The extension only shows data for the current tab.
- **Unexpectedly high domain count:** Consider that some sites load resources from multiple legitimate third parties; not all connections are malicious.
- **Badge count lag:** The data updates with a slight delay due to network processing batch timers.

For more troubleshooting, consult the related documentation sections dedicated to setup and interpreting results.
