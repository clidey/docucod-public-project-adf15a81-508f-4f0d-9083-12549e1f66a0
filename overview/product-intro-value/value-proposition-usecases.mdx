# Value Proposition & Primary Use Cases

Discover why uBO Scope is indispensable for anyone serious about understanding third-party connections that occur during web browsing. This page clarifies uBO Scope’s unique value in revealing **which remote servers your browser actually connects to**—not just which network requests get blocked—empowering you to effectively assess the reliability of content blockers and elevate your online privacy defenses.

## Why uBO Scope Matters

Modern browsers interact with numerous third-party servers every time you visit a website. Content blockers like uBlock Origin reduce unwanted connections by blocking certain requests. However, many users only see block counts or filtered requests, which don’t tell the full story of actual network connections.

**uBO Scope demystifies this by showing the true outcomes of all third-party requests:**

- **Allowed connections:** Remote servers that successfully responded.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Connections silently redirected away.
- **Blocked connections:** Requests that failed outright due to blocking.

This comprehensive insight lets you verify how effective your content blocker actually is, beyond misleading block counts or superficial tests.

The toolbar badge reports the number of **distinct third-party remote servers connected to**. A lower number indicates stronger privacy protection.

## Core Benefits & Impact

- **Clear visibility into actual network connections** — Understand where your data goes by identifying the exact third-party servers your browser contacts.
- **Assess content blocker effectiveness comprehensively** — Verify if a blocker truly limits third-party connections rather than just boosting block count metrics.
- **Detect stealth or invisible blocking techniques** — Reveal requests that are redirected or silently suppressed by filter lists.
- **Support filter list maintainers with accurate data** — Ideal for contributors who need reliable feedback on how their rules affect browser connections.
- **Empower privacy-conscious users with reliable verification** — Gain actionable, real-time data on third-party connections without relying on dubious test webpages.


## Why Common Myths Fail Without uBO Scope

uBO Scope exposes common misunderstandings around content blocking:

### Myth 1: Higher Block Counts Always Mean Better Blocking
Most users judge blockers by block counts. However, a blocker logging many blocked requests may still allow connections to more distinct third-party servers, increasing privacy risk.

uBO Scope shows you the real metric: the number of **distinct third-party domains connected to**, regardless of reported blocked requests.

### Myth 2: 'Ad Blocker Test' Websites Provide Reliable Benchmarks
Such test sites often:

- Rely on artificial, unrealistic network requests rarely encountered in real browsing.
- Do not detect stealth blocking methods used by advanced content blockers.

This leads to misleading test results.

uBO Scope lets you see the *real* network events in your browser as influenced by blocklists and browsers' blocking mechanisms.


## Primary User Groups and Use Cases

<u>uBO Scope is designed for:</u>

- **Privacy-minded users:** Individuals wanting transparent, accurate network connection insight to improve their browsing privacy.
- **Content blocker users:** Anyone using blockers like uBlock Origin who wants trustworthy evidence of blocking performance.
- **Filter list maintainers and developers:** Professionals and volunteers maintaining or testing filter lists, needing exact data on how their rules operate in real browsing environments.
- **Security researchers:** Those investigating how extensions and browsers manage network requests and detections.


### Example Scenarios

- **Validate effectiveness of your ad blocker:** Confirm that only the expected third-party servers connect and others are effectively blocked.

- **Troubleshoot unexpected content loading:** Identify stealth connections that could be bypassing your blocker or DNS-based protection.

- **Filter list rule verification:** As a maintainer, use uBO Scope to observe which domains remain allowed or stealth-blocked, guiding filter tuning.

- **Compare multiple blockers:** Evaluate different content blockers by comparing their real-world impact on distinct third-party connections.


## How uBO Scope Fits in Your Privacy Workflow

1. **Install uBO Scope** alongside your preferred content blocker.
2. **Browse websites as usual.** uBO Scope silently collects network connection data across tabs.
3. **Check the toolbar badge** for the count of distinct third-party servers your browser connected to.
4. **Open uBO Scope’s popup** to review categorized results: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
5. **Make informed decisions** about your content blocker settings or filter lists based on trustworthy, real-time transparent data.


## Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope **with your primary content blocker active** to get contextual insights on what your blocker permits or blocks.
- Regularly clear and reload tabs to refresh session data and observe changes over time.
- Use the extension's detailed reports to inform filter list maintenance and share findings with the community.
- Combine uBO Scope data with browser developer tools for deeper investigation when needed.


## Avoid Common Pitfalls

- **Do not rely on block counts alone:** A high block count does not guarantee fewer connections.
- **Ignore unreliable 'ad-blocker test' webpages:** They do not reflect real browsing behavior or blocker stealth techniques.
- **Understand stealth blocking:** Some requests are silently redirected or hidden; uBO Scope specifically reveals these.
