# Core Features & Benefits of uBO Scope

## Real-Time Tracking of Domain Connections

uBO Scope stands out as a powerful extension by providing **immediate, transparent insight into all network connections** your browser initiates while browsing the web. Unlike traditional content blockers that only track blocked or allowed requests, uBO Scope captures the full spectrum — from successful connections to those silently blocked — in real time.

- Monitors every network request made by pages you visit.
- Differentiates between connections that are allowed, stealth-blocked (blocked but not reported by some blockers), and outright blocked.
- Updates instantly with changes, giving you ongoing awareness of third-party connections.

Imagine browsing a website while seeing exactly which third-party domains your browser connects to — including hidden or stealth-blocked requests — so you can judge your privacy exposure accurately.

## Clear Summaries of Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked Requests

The extension categorizes connections clearly into three outcome groups, helping you **understand not just what was blocked, but also what slipped through or was stealthily blocked**:

- **Allowed:** Domains your browser successfully connected to.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that content blockers or DNS may have blocked, but which might not show up in other tools.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked and reported.

This classification offers a granular picture of your browser's network activity, empowering you to:

- Detect if stealth-blocking protections are active or missing.
- Identify which third-party services are active or denied.
- Analyze the nature and volume of connections to balance functionality vs. privacy.

For example, if you see many stealth-blocked domains, it indicates your current blocker or DNS is stealthy, preventing sites from detecting blocking but still protecting you effectively.

## Accurate Reporting Regardless of Content Blocker or DNS Service

uBO Scope measures network requests at the browser’s `webRequest` API level, providing **consistent and independent reporting even when multiple blockers or DNS resolvers intervene**.

- Reports connection outcomes irrespective of which content blocker you use.
- Detects stealth-blocked requests that others often miss.
- Works alongside your existing privacy tools without interference.

This reliable visibility is critical to debunk myths and avoid misleading conclusions based purely on block counts reported by blockers themselves.

## Demystifying Block Count Myths: Why Fewer Distinct Connections Matter

uBO Scope shifts the focus from raw block counts to **the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected**. This is the real measure of your privacy exposure.

- A higher block count does not necessarily mean better blocking.
- Blocking many requests can sometimes lead to more unique connections, increasing your exposure.
- The toolbar badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains actually contacted.

This approach helps you make **informed decisions about which content blockers truly reduce your attack surface and traceability**.

## Why This Matters: Empowering Privacy and Filter List Maintainers

Whether you are a privacy-conscious user or a filter list maintainer, uBO Scope provides the concrete data you need to:

- See the true footprint of third-party connections on the websites you frequent.
- Validate if your current blocking strategy effectively minimizes remote connections.
- Investigate stealth-blocking behaviors that evade typical detection.
- Make smarter and more transparent filter adjustments or browser choices.

By clearly exposing real behaviors instead of relying on metrics easily gamed by blockers or misleading ad test pages, uBO Scope gives you actionable truth.

## Practical Example: How uBO Scope Helps

Imagine you visit a popular news site and see the uBO Scope badge count at **4**.

- The popup shows **2 allowed** domains, **1 stealth-blocked** domain, and **1 blocked** domain.
- This tells you that despite your blocker’s activity, your browser still connected to two third-party services.
- You notice stealth-blocking is in effect, indicating your content blocker is quietly preventing some requests.
- If your blocker’s UI showed a high block count but uBO Scope showed many allowed domains, you know there’s room to improve filtering.

## Best Practices for Users

- Use uBO Scope alongside your favorite content blocker to see true effects.
- Focus on reducing distinct connected domains rather than chasing block counts.
- Investigate stealth-blocked domains to understand silent blocking.
- Check badge counts frequently to monitor changes in your network footprints.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Do not rely solely on extension or DNS blocker block count indicators.
- Avoid trusting ad blocker test pages as benchmarks — uBO Scope exposes their limitations.
- Understand that not all third-party domains are harmful; some are essential services like CDNs.

By grounding decisions in the reality uBO Scope reveals, you greatly improve privacy outcomes.
