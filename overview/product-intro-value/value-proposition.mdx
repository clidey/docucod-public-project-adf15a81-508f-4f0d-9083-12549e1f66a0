# Key Value & Benefits of uBO Scope

## Unlock True Insight into Web Traffic

Navigating the modern web means understanding not just which sites you visit, but every connection your browser makes behind the scenes. uBO Scope shines a spotlight on these remote server connections, empowering you with clarity and transparency about your network activity.

Whether you're an avid privacy enthusiast, a filter list maintainer, or simply curious about what your browser is doing, uBO Scope delivers concrete, actionable insights.

### What uBO Scope Brings to Your Browser
- **Reveal Every Remote Connection:** Automatically capture and report all remote servers your browser contacts during a page load.
- **Authenticate Content Blocker Efficacy:** Gauge the true effectiveness of your content blocker—not by block counts, but by actual distinct third-party connections.
- **Debunk Misleading Network Myths:** Cut through common misconceptions about content blockers and web privacy using factual connection data.
- **Support Filter List Maintenance:** Provide filter list maintainers with a real-world network footprint to optimize rules and minimize false positives.
- **Enhance Privacy Awareness:** Gain detailed knowledge of which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.

### Who Benefits Most?
uBO Scope is essential for:
- Privacy-conscious users eager to understand concealed network activity.
- Content blocker users seeking to validate their protection.
- Filter list maintainers refining blocking rules.
- Security researchers and developers wanting accurate network transparency.

## Why Use uBO Scope? Real User Scenarios

### Understanding Network Activity Beyond the Surface
A user installs uBO Scope alongside their preferred content blocker. Browsing a news website, the badge on uBO Scope's toolbar icon displays the number of distinct remote third-party domains the page attempted to contact. The popup panel breaks down these domains into:
- **Not Blocked:** Allowed connections that the page successfully made.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests intercepted quietly by content blockers without breaking the page.
- **Blocked:** Connections actively denied.

This granular breakdown helps the user realize that a high block count (visible in some content blockers) does not necessarily equate to better protection. Even if many connections are blocked, the number of allowed distinct third-party domains is the true metric of exposure.

### Debunking the Block Count Myth
Many users confuse block count metrics as the sole indicator of a content blocker’s power. uBO Scope demonstrates:
- A content blocker with a high block count may allow more third-party connections.
- Conversely, a lower block count could indicate fewer overall connections, denoting stronger effective blocking.

By focusing on how many unique third-party servers load content, users get a realistic view of their exposure.

### Tool for Filter List Maintainers
Filter list authors can leverage uBO Scope to verify rule impacts across real browsing sessions, clarifying whether unnecessary connections remain allowed or if stealth blocking hides excessive network activity.

### Privacy Optimization
By reviewing which domains remain connected, users can fine-tune their content blocking tools or browsing habits to decrease their footprint and improve security.

## Tips for Success

- Remember, a **lower badge count means better protection** and less unnecessary external communication.
- Use uBO Scope in combination with your preferred content blocker for a holistic privacy approach.
- Regularly review domain connections to detect unusual network activity.

## Troubleshooting

If you do not see data in the popup:
- Ensure that the extension has permissions to observe network requests.
- Verify that you are on an active tab with network activity.
- Refresh the tab and try again.
- Make sure your browser supports required APIs (e.g., `webRequest` with `host_permissions`).

## Summary

uBO Scope transforms the abstract realm of browser network connections into clear, actionable information. By revealing which third-party domains your browser contacts—and how content blocking affects these connections—it empowers you to make informed decisions about your privacy and security online.

Explore the extension in real browsing sessions to experience the unparalleled insight it delivers.
