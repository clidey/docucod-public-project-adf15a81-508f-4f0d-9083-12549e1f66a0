# Why Use uBO Scope?

## Understand the Real Impact of Content Blocking

In the world of online privacy, users, privacy enthusiasts, and filter list maintainers often face confusion around what content blockers actually achieve. The "Why Use uBO Scope?" page introduces you to a powerful tool designed to clarify this mystery by directly monitoring your browser's network behavior.

While many ad-blockers and content blockers boast about block counts shown on their toolbar icons, these numbers can be misleading. uBO Scope steps beyond these simplistic metrics by exposing the actual network connections your browser makes or attempts to make to third-party servers.

## What Does uBO Scope Do?

- **Reveals True Network Requests:** It tracks all network requests, categorizing them into allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked.
- **Badge Counts That Matter:** Instead of superficial block counts, the toolbar icon badge reflects the number of distinct third-party servers contacted, a meaningful measure of exposure.
- **Detailed Network Insights:** Offers raw data about connections that no toolbar or standard ad-block test can provide.

## Why This Matters

When browsing, your browser interacts with numerous third-party servers, some essential and some tracking or advertising entities. Understanding which servers your browser touches directly informs your privacy strategy.

- A **low badge count** indicates fewer third-party connections, typically meaning better privacy.
- A **high block count doesn't guarantee better blocking**; sometimes, more blocks correspond to more diverse third-party requests allowing tracking through other means.
- “Ad blocker test” webpages or simulated benchmarks often fail to represent real-world browsing and can give a false sense of security.

uBO Scope distinguishes itself by monitoring actual traffic rather than relying on theoretical or superficial tests.

## Who Benefits from uBO Scope?

- **Privacy Conscious Users:** Gain clear visibility of your exposure to third-parties on every tab.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Use accurate network data to refine and validate blocking rules, especially in environments where browser tools are limited.
- **Security Researchers and Advocates:** Debunk myths about content blocker effectiveness with evidence-based network data.

## How Badges and Network Insights Work

The toolbar icon of uBO Scope displays a badge representing the number of unique third-party domains with connections on the current browser tab.

- This count excludes first-party domains.
- It counts actual network connections, not just blocked requests.
- Differentiates between allowed, stealth-blocked, and fully blocked requests as reported by the browser API.

This insight enables users to see real-time, tab-specific privacy exposure at a glance.

## Practical Example Scenario

Imagine browsing a news site with multiple embedded ads and trackers:

- Traditional ad blockers might show a high block count, yet your browser is still connecting to numerous ad servers.
- uBO Scope reveals precise domain counts showing the real exposure:

  - **Allowed:** CDN or essential domains providing site content.
  - **Blocked:** Domains prevented by your blocker.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains that were silently filtered.

This granularity empowers you to understand the actual protection level and options to enhance your filter lists.

## Best Practices When Using uBO Scope

- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to monitor real-world impact continuously.
- Pay attention to badge counts and domain breakdowns, especially when visiting new or untrusted sites.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with other privacy tools for comprehensive coverage.

## Common Pitfalls Avoided by Using uBO Scope

- Relying solely on block counts or ad-blocker tests that do not reflect actual network connections.
- Being misled by stealth features of blocking extensions that hide true blocking status.
- Assuming all third-party connections are harmful; uBO Scope helps differentiate legitimate from potentially intrusive domains.
