# Who Should Use uBO Scope? Key Use Cases

## Unlocking the True Picture of Your Browser’s Network Connections

If you have ever wondered exactly where your browser connects when you visit a website, uBO Scope reveals all those hidden details. This page is precisely for privacy advocates, filter list maintainers, and any user who demands clear, objective insight into their browser's connection footprint. Whether you're evaluating how well a content blocker works, tuning filter lists, or simply curious about real-world network traffic, uBO Scope delivers unparalleled visibility—even when traditional browser developer tools fall short.

## Why This Matters to You

Web browsing today is a complex dance of connections—not just between you and the visited webpage, but often involving dozens of third-party servers behind the scenes. This sprawling network of requests can include trackers, CDNs, advertising servers, analytics, and more. Knowing which of these connections are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked by your content blocker matters because:

- It shows your real privacy exposure rather than relying on unreliable block count metrics.
- It verifies that your filter lists and blockers perform as expected.
- It helps filter maintainers identify leaks or gaps in blocking rules.
- It clarifies the difference between counted blocks and actual network requests.

Traditional browser developer tools often miss stealthy or blocked requests, or simply provide overwhelming raw data without grouping or context. uBO Scope bridges this gap by exposing a clear, categorized summary of every remote server connection your browser attempts for each tab.

## Who Benefits Most from Using uBO Scope?

### 1. Privacy Advocates

You want an honest, transparent account of network connections your browser makes. uBO Scope helps you:

- Monitor third-party domains your browser contacts in real time.
- Confirm your content blockers effectively limit unwanted connections.
- See stealth-blocked requests that might not appear in other tools.
- Validate that your browser’s privacy posture aligns with your expectations.

*Example:* After enabling a new filter list, you can instantly verify whether tracking domains are actually blocked or still allowed by reviewing uBO Scope's categorized connection report.


### 2. Filter List Maintainers

Creating or refining filter lists requires precise, evidence-based feedback. uBO Scope provides:

- Access to granular data on allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains per tab.
- Objective measurements unaffected by the quirks of block count metrics.
- Useful insights on connections that evade current filters, highlighting gaps.
- A tool especially helpful when browser dev tools are limited or unavailable.

*Example:* While testing a filter update, you identify stealth-blocked domains that your rules failed to block explicitly, helping you tune the list for maximum effectiveness.


### 3. Technical Users and Power Users

For those curious or requiring detailed insights:

- Confirm which third-party domains your browser actually reaches, beyond superficial indicators.
- Get actionable data about how content blockers and DNS-based blocking interact.
- Understand real-world request outcomes rather than simulated test results.

*Example:* You compare results from different content blockers and find that a blocker reporting more blocked requests is actually allowing connections to more unique third parties — a crucial insight for choosing your tools.

## Practical Tips to Get the Most from uBO Scope

- **Focus on distinct third-party domains, not raw request counts.** The extension badge number counts unique third-party servers contacted—not how many requests were blocked.
- **Ignore block count badges on other blockers as absolute indicators.** A higher block count doesn’t mean better blocking.
- **Combine uBO Scope insights with your existing blocker logs.** It provides reliable confirmation beyond what those tools might show.
- **Use stealth-blocked data to surface hidden blocking done by your content blocker.** This is typically invisible in most developer tools.

## Common Challenges and How uBO Scope Addresses Them

<AccordionGroup title="Common User Challenges and uBO Scope Solutions">
<Accordion title="I’m confused by block count metrics on other blockers—how does uBO Scope help?">
Block counts often mislead by counting blocked requests rather than measuring network exposure. uBO Scope instead counts unique third-party domains contacted and categorizes them by allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked. This clear separation reveals the true browsing footprint.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="My browser's dev tools don’t show all blocked or stealth-blocked requests.">
Many dev tools miss stealth-blocked or background requests. uBO Scope captures all network connection attempts reported by the browser's webRequest API, including those invisible or stealthy, giving you a complete picture.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I tell if my filter list is missing connections to block?">
By reviewing domains shown as ‘allowed’ that you expect to be blocked, you gain real-world evidence. Stealth-blocked domains also highlight hidden blocking which may need explicit filter rules.
