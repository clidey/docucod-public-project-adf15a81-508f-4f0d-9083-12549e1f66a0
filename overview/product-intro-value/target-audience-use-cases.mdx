# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a specialized tool designed for anyone who wants a clear and accurate picture of all third-party network connections made by websites in their browser. Its value goes beyond casual browsing — it empowers privacy-conscious users, filter list maintainers, and skeptics of popular privacy metrics with real data to understand web activity at a granular level.

## Understanding the Audience

### Privacy-Focused Users
If you care deeply about your online privacy and want to monitor the connections websites attempt — whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked — uBO Scope delivers exactly that insight. It tracks and counts distinct third-party domains your browser interacts with, allowing you to:

- Identify unseen or hidden third-party connections beyond standard content blocker logs.
- Gauge the real privacy impact by seeing how many unique remote servers your browser contacts.
- Confirm if your content blockers are effectively limiting third-party resource loads.

### Filter List Maintainers
Maintaining and improving content-blocking filter lists requires testing against real behavior, not just theory or assumptions. uBO Scope is an essential companion for filter list authors, because it:

- Reports outcomes of network requests regardless of the blocking technology involved.
- Shows distinct third-party domains from network requests, providing accurate data when validating filter effectiveness.
- Helps identify stealth blocking scenarios missed by common tools.

### Skeptics of Badge-Based Metrics and Ad-Blocker Test Sites
uBO Scope addresses common misconceptions about content blockers that are based on toolbar badge counts or ad-blocker test sites, which can be misleading:

- **Badge Count Misinformation:** The number on a toolbar badge typically reflects blocked requests, which may not correlate with actual privacy protection. uBO Scope highlights this by focusing on distinct third-party domains, which matter more than mere block counts.
- **Invalidity of Ad-Blocker Test Pages:** Such test pages generate artificial network requests that don't represent real-world websites. uBO Scope's data is based on live page activity, giving authentic visibility into connections.

## Practical Use Cases and Scenarios

To see why uBO Scope matters, consider these examples:

### Scenario 1: Verifying Third-Party Blockers
You install a new content blocker and want to confirm it truly reduces third-party connections. uBO Scope's distinct server count badge and popup details reveal the actual change in third-party domains contacted, helping you validate blocking effectiveness with real data.

### Scenario 2: Debugging Stealth Blockers
Certain content blockers act stealthily to avoid detection, blocking some requests without visible logs or metrics. uBO Scope exposes "stealth blocked" domains, highlighting domains where connections were redirected or blocked without alerting the webpage.

### Scenario 3: Filter List Development
When updating or creating filter lists, you need to test if your rules catch all unwanted third-party requests. uBO Scope’s detailed per-tab network request outcomes provide invaluable feedback for test coverage and rule verification.

### Scenario 4: Educating Users on Privacy Metrics
Many users wrongly trust block counts or adblock test results. By showing distinct allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains for the active tab, uBO Scope educates users about what truly affects their browsing privacy.

## Why uBO Scope Is Different

Unlike generic blockers or tools that focus solely on counts of blocked requests, uBO Scope:

- Emphasizes the *number of distinct third-party servers* contacted, allowing for meaningful privacy assessment.
- Tracks network request outcomes independently, working with any blocking implementation that interacts with the browser’s network stack.
- Supports multiple browser platforms (Chromium, Firefox, Safari), ensuring consistent privacy insights.

## Getting Started

To begin using uBO Scope:

1. Install it from the browser’s official extension marketplace.
2. Click the toolbar icon to open the popup and view connected domains for the active tab.
3. Observe the badge count on the toolbar icon indicating distinct allowed third-party domains.
4. Use this data alongside your content blocking setups to understand and improve your privacy stance.
