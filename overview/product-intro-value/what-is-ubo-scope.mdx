# What is uBO Scope?

Discover the hidden network activity behind every browser tab with uBO Scope — an insightful companion extension designed to monitor and reveal every remote connection your browser initiates. Whether you use one content blocker or another, uBO Scope sheds light on the real connections happening behind the scenes, empowering you with the knowledge to understand and improve your online privacy.

## Introduction to uBO Scope

At its core, uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension created to **track and report all network connections made by each browser tab**. It monitors the connections regardless of any content-blocking mechanisms in place and highlights the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the active page.

Unlike traditional blockers that focus on what is blocked, uBO Scope emphasizes what actually connects — providing a transparent view of all attempted or successful remote server connections.

## Why Does uBO Scope Matter?

Understanding the true network activity that a webpage generates is invaluable for anyone serious about online privacy, security, and performance.

- **Reveal Legitimate vs. Third-Party Connections:** See exactly how many and which third-party servers your browser communicates with.
- **Verify Content Blocker Effectiveness:** Validate whether your blockers reduce connections or if blockers with high block counts paradoxically allow more third parties.
- **Debunk Misleading Metrics:** Avoid false assumptions made by ad blocker tests or block counts by focusing on distinct connection counts, not just blocking tallies.

With uBO Scope, you gain **visibility into real-world traffic**, not just hypothetical or fabricated test cases.

## How uBO Scope Works at a Glance

- **Leverages Browser WebRequest API:** Listens to network requests and categorizes their outcomes as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- **Tab-Specific Measurement:** Maps network activity precisely to the originating tab, enabling fine-grained per-tab reporting.
- **Badge Indicator:** Displays on the toolbar the count of distinct third-party domains connected by the active tab — a **lower count means fewer external connections and better privacy hygiene**.

This approach empowers you to assess privacy implications directly from your day-to-day browsing without complex configuration or guesswork.

## Real-World Scenario: Understanding Your Browser’s Connections

Imagine opening a news website. Behind the scenes, dozens of network requests might be made — some to the site's own servers, and others to ad networks, CDNs, analytics platforms, or social media domains.

- With **uBO Scope**, you see a concise summary of all distinct third-party domains your tab connects to.
- If a privacy-focused blocker is active, you can verify if fewer third parties are contacted and assess which ones are stealthily blocked or allowed.

This transparency shifts control into your hands, helping you to identify unnecessary or potentially risky external domains inflating your fingerprint or tracking you.

## Key Benefits of Using uBO Scope

- **Comprehensive Visibility:** Capture all network requests regardless of which content blocker is active or how blocking is implemented.
- **Accurate Tab-Level Tracking:** View connections related to each tab specifically — no guessing which tab triggered what.
- **Insightful Badge Feedback:** Quickly interpret active tab connections through the toolbar icon’s badge count.
- **Robust Against Common Fallacies:** Avoid misleading conclusions from block counts or synthetic ad blocker tests.

By focusing on what connections occur, uBO Scope serves as an essential tool for privacy-conscious users, researchers, and filter list maintainers.

## What uBO Scope Does Not Do

- It does **not block or filter content**; it is purely a measurement and reporting tool.
- It relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API, so requests outside its scope (e.g., some low-level network requests) may not appear.
