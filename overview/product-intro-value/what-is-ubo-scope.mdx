title: "What is uBO Scope?"
description: "uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to reveal all network connections—attempted or successful—to third-party remote servers during website visits, regardless of which content blocker is in use. The extension enables users to gain transparency into resource loading, privacy exposure, and the effectiveness of existing content-blocking solutions, even uncovering network requests missed due to stealth blocking or DNS-level blocking."

## Discover Every Network Connection Your Browser Makes

When you visit a website, dozens of network requests silently occur behind the scenes—some necessary, some tracking you, some ads. **uBO Scope** is a powerful browser extension designed to uncover all these connections, whether they succeed or are blocked, giving you a transparent view into your web traffic and privacy exposure at a glance.

### Unlock True Transparency Over Your Browsing

uBO Scope tracks every network connection attempt from your browser to third-party remote servers. It reports those that are:

- **Allowed** (loaded successfully),
- **Blocked** (stopped by content blockers or DNS-level controls), and even
- **Stealth-blocked** (network requests blocked silently, often invisible to the webpage).

This comprehensive insight helps you understand not just what resources load, but what requests your browser tries to make — often revealing hidden tracking or resource loading missed by other tools.

## What Is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a **companion extension to content blockers like uBlock Origin**, designed specifically to observe and report all network requests made by your browser during website visits. Unlike typical content blockers that only let you see what gets blocked or allowed, uBO Scope reveals the full spectrum of connection attempts regardless of which blocker is active.

**Its fundamental purpose:**

- Expose all remote server connections initiated by webpages,
- Reveal the effectiveness and stealth behaviors of content blockers,
- Provide unmatched transparency on network traffic that affects your privacy.

Because it operates independently and listens to your browser’s network activity via the `webRequest` API, it can detect network requests that may escape other block reporting, such as requests dropped by DNS-level blocking or stealth techniques.

### Key Differentiators

- **Extends across browsers:** Available for Chromium, Firefox, and Safari
- **Stealth Detection:** Detects network requests blocked silently, even those missed by conventional counters
- **Browser-Integrated:** Uses browser APIs to give accurate real-time insights without interfering with web page loading
- **Third-Party Focus:** Emphasizes connections to third-party remote servers, helping you spot tracking and ads

## How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Workflow

Imagine browsing your favorite news site. Traditional blockers may indicate "10 ads blocked" but give you no idea if some trackers got through or if some requests were completely blocked at the system level without visible effect.

uBO Scope fills that gap:

1. While you browse, uBO Scope silently logs **every network request** your browser attempts to make.
2. It categorizes requests by outcome—allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
3. You open uBO Scope's popup panel to instantly see the domains contacted during your session, complete with counts of resource requests.
4. With this data, you can assess whether your current blockers effectively limit connections or if stealth or DNS-level blocks are hidden from normal view.

This level of transparency empowers you to fine-tune your privacy setup, make informed decisions about filter lists, or simply confirm that your blockers work as expected.

---

## Practical Example

Consider a scenario where a popular content blocker reports blocking many requests, but uBO Scope reveals that despite the high block count, your browser connected to more third-party domains than expected. This tells you the block list may be missing some tracking domains.

Conversely, if uBO Scope shows fewer allowed third-party connections, you know your blocker is effectively limiting resource loading.

Use uBO Scope to compare content blocking setups realistically—based on actual network connections, not just block counts or unreliable tests.

## Summary of What uBO Scope Does

- **Reveals every network connection** your browser attempts to third-party servers
- **Shows which requests are blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed**
- **Works alongside any content blocker or DNS filter**, exposing gaps in coverage
- **Provides clear domain counts and resource requests per website session**
- **Helps identify privacy leaks and optimize filter lists with solid data**
