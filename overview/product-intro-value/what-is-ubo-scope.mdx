# What is uBO Scope?

## Discovering uBO Scope: Transparency in Remote Connections

### The Essence of uBO Scope
uBO Scope is a browser extension designed with a singular, transparent mission: to report every attempted or successful connection a web page makes to remote servers. Unlike traditional content blockers, this extension reveals *all* network interactions initiated by the page – regardless of any content blocker or privacy tool active in your browser.

### Why Does This Matter?
When you visit a website, dozens or even hundreds of requests can be sent behind the scenes to multiple third-party servers. These requests might be allowed or blocked depending on your content blocker configuration – but how can you be sure what actually happens? uBO Scope solves this by decoupling server visibility from blocker mechanics and reporting the complete truth about these network connections.

## The Philosophy Behind uBO Scope

- **Unfiltered Visibility:** uBO Scope observes network requests at the browser level via the `webRequest` API, tracking outcomes such as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked connections.
- **Content Blocker Agnostic:** It does not rely on any content blocker internals; hence, it provides an accurate and unbiased picture regardless of which blockers are in use.
- **Transparency, Not Control:** This extension does not block connections itself but reports on what other extensions or browser settings do, offering a clear, truthful insight into network activity.

## How uBO Scope Works

At its core, uBO Scope listens to the browser's network events related to outgoing requests. Whenever a webpage attempts to connect to a remote server, uBO Scope logs:

- The domain and hostname of the server
- The outcome of the request (allowed, redirected/stealth-blocked, or blocked)
- The count of distinct servers contacted

This data is aggregated and presented in an easy-to-understand UI, which categorizes connections for quick assessment.

## What You See in the Extension UI

Upon activating uBO Scope by clicking its icon, you are presented with a summary of the current active tab’s network activity:

- **Domain Header:** Displays the domain and full hostname of the website
- **Summary Count:** Shows the number of unique domains connected
- **Connection Categories:**
  - _Not Blocked_ — servers successfully contacted
  - _Stealth-Blocked_ — connections silently redirected or blocked via stealth methods
  - _Blocked_ — explicitly blocked requests

Each category lists the domains involved along with the count of requests made, enabling you to quickly identify third-party servers your browser interacts with.

## Relatable Scenario: Understanding What Happens Behind Your Favorite Website

Imagine browsing your favorite news site. While you mainly access the website itself, dozens of additional servers are contacted for ads, analytics, and content delivery.

- Without uBO Scope, you only guess or rely on your ad blocker’s reporting, which can be misleading.
- With uBO Scope, you get a full list of every remote server that tried to connect, regardless of whether it was blocked or allowed.

This empowers you to make informed decisions about privacy, security, and filter list effectiveness.

## Key Benefits of uBO Scope

- **Absolute Clarity:** Know exactly which third-party servers websites reach out to.
- **Independent Assessment:** Verify content blocker effectiveness without being misled by block counts.
- **Contextual Insight:** Discover stealth-blocking and how some requests are hidden from conventional tools.
- **Filter List Maintenance Aid:** Useful for filter list maintainers seeking to understand network behaviors.

## Getting Started with uBO Scope

To experience uBO Scope’s transparency:

1. **Install the Extension:** Available for Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers via their official stores.
2. **Activate the Extension on Any Webpage:** Click the uBO Scope icon while on a tab.
3. **Review the Connection Data:** Interpret the allowed, stealth, and blocked domains as reported.

For a detailed step-by-step guide to installation and initial usage, see the [Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope](./installing-and-setting-up-ubo-scope) documentation.

## Practical Tips

- **Interpreting Badge Counts:** The extension badge reflects the number of distinct third-party servers contacted, not the number of blocked requests. A lower badge count indicates fewer third parties being contacted, which generally implies better privacy.
- **Browser Limitations:** uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API. Network requests outside this scope (e.g., HTTP/3 or background service connections made outside the API's reach) will not be reported.
- **Stealth Blocking Identification:** Requests categorized as stealth-blocked are silently redirected or blocked by other tools to avoid detection.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Misreading Block Counts:** Do not equate a higher block count with better blocking. uBO Scope helps clarify that more blocks do not always mean fewer allowed connections.
- **Relying on Ad-Block Test Pages:** Such pages often use artificial scenarios; uBO Scope’s real-world network monitoring avoids such benchmarks.

## Summary

uBO Scope puts the power of visibility back in your hands, revealing the true network footprint of sites you visit. By separating connection visibility from the mechanics of content blocking, it empowers you with an accurate, unbiased understanding of remote server interactions.

With uBO Scope, transparency replaces guesswork, making your browsing experience more informed and secure.
