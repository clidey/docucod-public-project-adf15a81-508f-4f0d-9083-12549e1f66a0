# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Network Connection Your Browser Makes

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to give you unprecedented transparency into all the remote server connections initiated by webpages you visit. Unlike typical content blockers that simply hide or block content, uBO Scope reveals **every network request your browser attempts or successfully completes**. This empowers you to see exactly which third-party servers your browser communicates with, enabling smarter, privacy-conscious browsing decisions.

### Why You Should Care

- **Full Visibility:** See both allowed and blocked third-party connections to understand the real network footprint of any webpage.
- **Beyond Content Blockers:** While your existing blockers may filter content, uBO Scope exposes every network request attempt—including stealth or hidden connections.
- **Privacy Empowerment:** Identify unknown or unwanted third-party servers for better control of your data.
- **Lightweight and Efficient:** Runs quietly in the background without slowing down your browsing experience.
- **Unbiased Reporting:** Shows actual network activity regardless of which content blockers or DNS filters you use.

### Intended Users

uBO Scope is ideal for privacy enthusiasts, security researchers, filter list maintainers, and any user who wants a deeper understanding of their browser's network activity beyond the surface level content blocking.

## What Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension that monitors and reports **all outbound network requests made by webpages**, including both successful connections and those that are blocked or redirected. It tracks these in real time and presents the data in an easy-to-understand popup panel.

### The Core Problem It Solves

Modern web pages frequently load content from numerous third-party servers—advertising networks, trackers, content delivery networks, analytics services, and more. While content blockers prevent many unwanted resources from loading, few tools reveal the **full scope of network interactions**, leaving users in the dark about what connections are attempted or fully successful.

uBO Scope fills this gap by recording every attempted remote server connection your browser makes, irrespective of whether a content blocker intervened or not.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique

- It **records all network requests at the browser level** using the webRequest API.
- It tracks and categorizes connections by their outcome: allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- It displays the **count of distinct third-party domains connected per tab** right on the toolbar badge—giving a quick privacy indicator.
- It functions independently of content blockers, so you get **complete transparency regardless of your filtering setup**.

### How It Works (At a High Level)

1. **Network Monitoring:** Listens to all web requests your browser initiates using the browser's webRequest API.
2. **Request Classification:** Categorizes requests by their result — allowed (successful), blocked (error), or stealth blocked (redirects or filtered silently).
3. **Domain Aggregation:** Aggregates these connections by domain and hostname to present meaningful summaries.
4. **User Interface:** Displays the gathered information in a popup panel when you click the extension icon and updates a badge count on the toolbar.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### Complete Network Request Reporting
- Captures every network request made by webpages, including main frame and sub-frame requests.
- Tracks redirects and failed connections to give a full picture of network activity.

### Categorization of Connections
- **Allowed:** Connections that succeeded and resources retrieved.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed or were denied (possibly by content blockers).
- **Stealth-blocked:** Redirected or silently filtered requests not typically visible.

### Real-Time Badge Indicator
- Shows the count of distinct third-party domains your current tab connects to, right on the browser toolbar icon.
- A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, which usually aligns with better privacy.

### Intuitive Popup Panel
- Interactive panel breaking down connections by category (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).
- Lists domains along with the number of times each was contacted, helping you spot frequent third parties.
- Unicode and punycode support ensures domain names appear in user-friendly formats.

### Persistent Session Data
- Tracks network activity per browser tab during browsing sessions.
- Saves session data to allow review of connections as you navigate.

## Why Should I Care?

### Gain Real-Time Awareness and Control
Knowing exactly which servers your browser talks to arms you with the information needed to:

- Detect tracking or unwanted third-party domains invisible to regular content blockers.
- Evaluate the real effectiveness of your content blocker or DNS filtering setup.
- Investigate suspicious or unexpected connections that may impact your privacy or security.

### Use Cases Where uBO Scope Shines
- **Privacy-conscious browsing:** Visualize third-party connections behind every page you visit.
- **Filter list maintenance:** Assess and improve block lists based on actual network traffic.
- **Security research:** Monitor connections for hidden redirects and stealthy domains.
- **Comparing blockers:** Validate the actual network footprint across different content blocking solutions.

### Before and After uBO Scope
- Without uBO Scope, users often rely on assumptions or incomplete data about third-party connections.
- With uBO Scope, users see a transparent, verifiable report of network connections per tab, allowing informed decisions.

### Return on Investment
- Saves time by providing quick visual feedback (badge count and popup details) instead of digging through browser developer tools.
- Enhances browsing privacy by uncovering hidden connections.
- Supports more effective content blocking strategies.

## Getting Started Preview

### Quick Start
After installing uBO Scope from your browser’s extension store, simply click the toolbar icon anytime to open the popup panel. The panel will list all domains your current tab has connected to, grouped by connection status.

### Prerequisites
- Compatible with major browsers that support WebExtension API, including Firefox (128+), Chromium-based browsers (Chrome 122+), and Safari (18.5+).
- Requires permissions for activeTab, webRequest, and storage.

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- Ensure your browser is updated to the minimum required version for compatibility.
- Remember that some network requests made outside of the browser's webRequest API (like certain system-level DNS queries) will not appear.
- Badge count represents **distinct third-party domains contacted**, so seeing a zero or low number corresponds to fewer external connections.
- Use this tool alongside your preferred content blocker for maximum privacy insight.

# Example: Understanding Domain Connections in uBO Scope Popup

When you open the extension popup while browsing a site, you will see a breakdown like this:

- **Not Blocked:** Third-party domains your browser successfully connected to.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Redirected or silently blocked connections that were intercepted.
- **Blocked:** Connections that failed or were explicitly blocked by your content blocker.

Each domain entry includes a count representing how many times that domain was contacted within this tab session.


---

With uBO Scope’s insight, you gain a crystal-clear picture of your browser’s network activity, transforming invisible processes into actionable knowledge.
