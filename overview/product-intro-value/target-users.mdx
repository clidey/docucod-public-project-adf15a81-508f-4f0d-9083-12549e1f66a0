## Typical User Scenarios

### 1. Verifying Content Blocker Effectiveness

You have installed a content blocker to prevent tracking and unwanted ads but want to verify which third-party connections are truly being blocked or allowed. uBO Scope shows all remote server requests regardless of the blocker’s stealth, enabling you to trust what you see or uncover hidden connections.

### 2. Investigating Unexpected Network Activity

Browsing your favorite news site, you notice unusually high network requests. Use uBO Scope to reveal exactly which domains are being contacted, helping you differentiate between legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs) and potentially risky third parties.

### 3. Validating Filter List Changes

As a filter list author, after adding new rules, you want to confirm those rules block the intended domains across browsers. uBO Scope’s detailed reporting enables effective cross-browser and cross-extension verification.

### 4. Educational Demonstrations

Show students or users how websites interact with multiple remote servers in real-time, highlighting privacy implications and the complexity of modern web infrastructure.

## How uBO Scope Fits in Your Privacy Workflow

Using uBO Scope gives you unmatched clarity about your browser’s network requests without relying solely on content blockers’ UI or browser developer tools, which might omit stealth-blocked or DNS-blocked requests. This transparency strengthens your ability to:

- Identify and scrutinize all third-party network connections.
- Understand the distinction between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.
- Make informed decisions about privacy and security settings.

By integrating uBO Scope into your privacy or security toolkit, you gain a proactive lens into your browser's true network behavior.

## Practical Tips for Users

- Consider using uBO Scope alongside popular content blockers like uBlock Origin to validate blocking results.
- Regularly check the badge count on the browser toolbar icon; a lower count means fewer distinct remote third-party connections.
- Use the extension to explore which requests are stealth-blocked but still requested, providing insight into network activity that might otherwise be invisible.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Relying on Block Count Alone:** Do not mistake a higher block count on other blockers as necessarily better privacy protection. uBO Scope clarifies that what truly matters is how many distinct third-party servers are contacted.

- **Ignoring Stealth Connections:** Some network requests may be stealth-blocked but still reveal tracking or data collection. uBO Scope surfaces these to help you assess privacy risks more accurately.

- **Overlooking Legitimate CDNs:** Not all third-party connections are harmful. uBO Scope helps differentiate essential CDNs from risky trackers.
