# Purpose & Value Proposition

## Discover What uBO Scope Reveals about Your Web Connections

Imagine browsing the web with clear insight into every external connection your browser attempts or successfully completes. uBO Scope is designed exactly for this: to expose all third-party interactions initiated by web pages, empowering you to understand and evaluate your web traffic with precision.

### Why Does Counting Distinct Third-Party Servers Matter?

While many content blockers highlight the number of blocked requests, this number alone can be misleading. uBO Scope focuses on the number of **distinct third-party servers** to which connections are made. Here's why this approach delivers more meaningful privacy insights:

- **Quality Over Quantity:** Many blocked requests may target the same server repeatedly, inflating block counts without necessarily indicating broader tracking.
- **True Exposure:** The count of distinct servers reflects how many unique entities are actually interacting with your browser, providing a clearer measure of privacy risk.
- **Avoiding Misinterpretation:** A content blocker with a high number of blocked requests might still allow connections to more third-party servers than one with fewer blocked requests. uBO Scope sheds light on this nuance.

### What Problems Does uBO Scope Solve?

For privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers alike, uBO Scope offers:

- **Complete Transparency:** It reports every attempted and successful connection to remote servers, irrespective of your browser's or other blockers' filtering.
- **Reliable Metrics:** By focusing on distinct third-party domains rather than raw request counts, it prevents common misconceptions about blocker effectiveness.
- **Stealth Detection:** It reveals requests that were stealthily redirected or blocked, giving a fuller picture of web activity.
- **Filter List Maintenance Aid:** Especially on devices or browsers where developer tools are limited, it assists maintainers in validating and debugging filtering rules.

<u>Think of uBO Scope as your privacy microscope — it goes beyond surface-level numbers to show the real entities your browser talks to, enabling smarter privacy decisions.</u>

## How uBO Scope Presents Information

When you open uBO Scope's popup, you’ll see:

- **Domain Counts:** The total number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Categorized Outcomes:** Lists of domains for which requests were:
  - Allowed (i.e., requested and loaded)
  - Stealth-blocked (redirected or silently blocked)
  - Explicitly blocked

This structured view helps you quickly grasp where your network connections stand, without guessing whether blocking high counts mean better protection.

## A Closer Look at Distinctions

| Metric             | What It Means                                      | Why You Should Care                                   |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Block Count        | Number of blocked requests                         | Can be inflated by multiple attempts to the same server, misleading about exposure |
| Distinct 3rd-Party Server Count | Number of unique third-party servers contacted | More accurately reflects privacy exposure and real-world tracking risk |

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine visiting a news website. Without uBO Scope, you might see a content blocker reporting 50 blocked requests — but are these 50 different trackers? Possibly not. uBO Scope reveals you’re actually connecting to only about 8 distinct third-party servers, such as CDN providers. This knowledge lets you assess risk better and counter misleading advertising claims about blocker effectiveness.

## Important Insights and Myth Busting

### Busting the "More Blocks Means Better" Myth

- uBO Scope reveals that a higher block count doesn't always mean your blocker is more effective.
- The key is **how many unique third-party servers are blocked or allowed** — fewer distinct connections mean less exposure.

### Debunking Unreliable Adblock Test Pages

- Popular 'ad blocker test' pages often generate unrealistic network requests.
- uBO Scope works by observing real network requests initiated by web pages, avoiding fabricated scenarios.

## Who Benefits Most from uBO Scope?

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Understand who your browser talks to and make informed decisions.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Tool for auditing and improving filter lists on devices where advanced developer tools are unavailable.

## Summary

By focusing on the quality of connections — distinct third-party servers — uBO Scope elevates your understanding of online privacy beyond superficial counts. It provides concrete, actionable insights to better evaluate privacy exposure and the true impact of content blocking.

<Tip>
Always consider the distinct third-party server count as your key metric for privacy insight rather than relying solely on blocked request counts.
</Tip>

<Note>
uBO Scope works alongside any content blocker. It reports all network requests that reach your browser’s `webRequest` API — including those allowed or blocked stealthily by other tools.
</Note>

<Warning>
Because uBO Scope relies on browser APIs, it cannot report network requests made outside of these APIs, so absolute coverage depends on browser support.
