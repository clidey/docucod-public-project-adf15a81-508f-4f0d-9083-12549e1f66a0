# What is uBO Scope?

## See Every Web Connection Your Browser Makes — Transparently and Clearly

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to shine a light on all network connections your browser initiates. Whether these connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or overtly blocked by content blockers, uBO Scope gives you a clear, accessible view into exactly which remote servers your browser interacts with during your web sessions.

### Why uBO Scope?
- **Complete Visibility:** See every outgoing network request from your browser, including third-party servers stealthily blocked by content blockers.
- **Accurate Reporting:** Counts only distinct third-party remote server connections, giving a true measure of tracking exposure.
- **Transparency Around Blocking:** Understand not just which requests are blocked, but also which are stealthily canceled without your site’s knowledge.
- **Privacy Empowerment:** Gain insights that help you assess and better control your web privacy landscape.

### Who Needs uBO Scope?
Anyone concerned with their online privacy, security researchers, filter list maintainers, and even everyday web users curious about the network activity happening behind the scenes in their browser will find uBO Scope indispensable.

## What Is uBO Scope?: Definition & Purpose

uBO Scope is a companion browser extension that reports on all network connections initiated by your browser's active tabs. Unlike traditional blockers that only indicate what they explicitly block, uBO Scope captures all connection attempts—including those silently or stealthily prevented—providing a truthful, real-time snapshot of your browsing fingerprint.

#### Core Purpose
The extension demystifies the black-box nature of modern web requests by:

- Monitoring network traffic via the browser’s `webRequest` API,
- Categorizing connections as either Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, or Blocked,
- Aggregating and summarizing connection data per tab,
- Presenting information through a clear popup UI and browser badge count.

This empowers you to understand which third-party domains your browser contacts, helping you evaluate and optimize your browsing privacy.

#### Key Differentiators
- **Transparent Reporting of Stealth Blocking:** Unlike many tools, it reveals stealth-blocked connections that happen silently without triggering webpage errors or warnings.
- **Tab-Focused Insights:** Data is organized per active browser tab, contextualizing network activity with the corresponding website.
- **Minimal and Focused:** uBO Scope is purpose-built for connection reporting, without intrusive blocking or complex configuration.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Comprehensive Network Connection Tracking:** Logs and summarizes all HTTP(S) and WebSocket connection attempts across your browsing tabs.

- **Detailed Outcome Categorization:** Classifies requests as:
  - *Allowed:* Successfully completed connections.
  - *Stealth-Blocked:* Connections canceled silently, often by stealth content blockers.
  - *Blocked:* Explicitly blocked connections generating errors.

- **Per-Tab Domain Aggregation:** Groups connection outcomes by domain and hostname to highlight distinct third-party servers.

- **Real-Time Badge Counts:** The toolbar icon badge displays the total count of unique allowed third-party domains connected per tab, offering at-a-glance privacy signals.

- **Popup UI Overview:** Opens a detailed panel showing connection breakdowns, domain counts, and categorized lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

- **Robust and Compatible:** Works across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari with harmonized manifest configurations.

## Why Should You Care?

### Achieve True Network Transparency
Typical content blockers offer limited insight by focusing only on what they block. uBO Scope reveals the complete picture, showing exactly what happens below the surface — including network connections others try to hide.

### Debunk Common Myths About Content Blocking
- **Higher block counts do not mean better blocking:** uBO Scope helps you recognize that counting block events alone misrepresents effectiveness.
- **Ad blocker test sites can be misleading:** Real-world monitoring with uBO Scope provides factual evidence over synthetic benchmarks.

### Empower Smarter Privacy Decisions
With accurate counts of distinct third-party servers contacted, you can:
- Identify unnecessary or unexpected third-party tracking.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of your content blocking strategies.
- Support filter list maintainers by providing real data on network behavior.

### Real-World Use Cases
- A privacy-conscious user verifying that their content blocker is genuinely limiting exposure.
- A developer or tester confirming which third-party services a web page connects to, including hidden ones.
- A filter list maintainer assessing how new filter rules impact network connections.

### Before and After uBO Scope
Without uBO Scope, network behaviors remain unclear or hidden. With it, you see a transparent, categorized map of connections per tab, empowering informed privacy action.

## Getting Started Preview

### Quick Start
Once installed, uBO Scope immediately listens to network requests in your browser. Click the toolbar icon to open the popup panel and view a tab-specific summary of connected domains.

### Prerequisites
- Compatible browsers: Chromium (v122+), Firefox (v128+), Safari (v18.5+).
- Permissions: Requires activeTab, storage, and webRequest access.

### Next Steps
- Explore the [Using the Popup Panel](/getting-started/using-and-validating/using-popup) documentation to learn how to interpret connection data.
- Refer to [Key Value Propositions & Use Cases](/overview/product-intro-value/value-prop-use-cases) for advanced scenarios.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use the badge count as a quick indicator: fewer allowed third-party domains typically means stronger privacy.
- Regularly check the stealth-blocked section to understand silent network activity you might not be aware of.
- Combine uBO Scope with trusted content blockers to gain both control and visibility.

## Troubleshooting

- If no data appears in the popup, ensure the extension has necessary permissions and your browser supports webRequest API fully.
- Badge counts reflecting unexpectedly high numbers may indicate web pages with many legitimate third-party resources (e.g., CDNs).
