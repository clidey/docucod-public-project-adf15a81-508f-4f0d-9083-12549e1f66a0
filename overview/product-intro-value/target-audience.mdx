# Target Audience

uBO Scope is designed with privacy-conscious users, filter list maintainers, and anyone dedicated to understanding and monitoring precise network connections in mind. This extension stands out by providing transparent insights about every remote server your browser attempts to connect with, regardless of which content blocker (if any) you use.

## Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:**
  If you value knowing exactly which third-party servers your browser contacts, uBO Scope gives you clear, real-time visibility into these network interactions. You can see which requests are allowed, stealth-blocked (invisible to normal tools), or blocked.

- **Filter List Maintainers:**
  Maintaining and updating filter lists requires detailed insights into real-world network request outcomes. uBO Scope provides data independent of specific content blockers, working transparently alongside any or no content inhibiting tools, which makes it invaluable on environments or devices where traditional debugging tools are limited or unavailable.

- **Cross-Browser Enthusiasts and Professionals:**
  uBO Scope supports multiple browsers — including Chromium, Firefox, and Safari — and is not tied exclusively to any particular content blocker like uBlock Origin. This flexibility allows users and developers to use it consistently across platforms for a uniform understanding of network behaviors.

## Why This Audience Cares

- **Universal Visibility Across Browsers:**
  Most privacy tools are browser- or blocker-specific. uBO Scope extends its utility by offering network transparency independent of underlying content blockers and irrespective of whether you are browsing on Chromium, Firefox, or Safari.

- **Independent Network Request Analysis:**
  By monitoring network requests via the browser's webRequest API, uBO Scope reports precise outcomes of connections, helping users distinguish between actual connections allowed, stealthy blocks that some blockers might employ to mask blocking, and outright blocked requests.

- **Trustworthy Insights for Informed Decisions:**
  It dispels common myths about content blockers by focusing on the critical measure: the number of distinct third-party servers that successfully serve resources, rather than misleading block counts or results from unreliable ad-blocker testing websites.

- **Utility Beyond Blockers:**
  Because uBO Scope is not a content blocker but a companion tool, it complements any existing content blocker (or none), providing unfiltered insights into what really happens with your browser’s network connections.

## Real-World Scenarios

Imagine you are a privacy-conscious user curious about how many third-party servers a news site connects to. uBO Scope displays this at a glance, showing actual allowed domains, those stealthily blocked in the background, and any explicitly blocked. This transparency empowers you to adjust settings, switch blockers, or raise awareness more effectively.

For filter list maintainers, especially in environments where browser developer tools might not be easily accessible (such as mobile browsers), uBO Scope offers an essential mechanism to verify filter effectiveness and analyze network request details.

## Summary

By targeting these audiences, uBO Scope ensures you gain the clarity and control necessary over your browsing privacy and network transparency — irrespective of the content blocking landscape or your choice of browser.

# Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Install in Supported Browsers:** Ensure you use uBO Scope in Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browsers where the extension can access the `webRequest` API fully.

- **Use Alongside Existing Content Blockers:** uBO Scope does not block or modify traffic. Use it alongside blockers like uBlock Origin for an independent check.

- **Understand Badge Counts:** The toolbar badge always shows the number of unique third-party domains allowed — a lower number indicates tighter privacy.

- **Remember Limitations:** Requests not accessible via the browser’s webRequest API (e.g., certain native or isolated requests) will not be visible.

- **Avoid Relying on Block Counts or Ad-Blocker Test Pages:** Trust actual third-party connections seen in uBO Scope rather than block lists or misleading external tests.
