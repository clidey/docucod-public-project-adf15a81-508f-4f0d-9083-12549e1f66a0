# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

uBO Scope serves as an essential tool for anyone seeking deep transparency into their web browsing connections. Whether you are a privacy advocate cautious about third-party trackers, a filter list maintainer refining rules, or simply a user curious about the hidden network requests behind the pages you visit, uBO Scope empowers you with visibility beyond traditional blockers.

## Ideal Users

### Privacy Advocates and Concerned Users

If you prioritize online privacy and want clear insight into every third-party connection your browser makes, uBO Scope is indispensable. It reveals not only what is allowed or blocked by your content blockers but also stealth-blocked connections that remain hidden in many privacy tools. This transparency demystifies what your browser is truly connecting to, helping you make informed decisions and better understand your digital footprint.

### Filter List Maintainers

For those maintaining or fine-tuning filter lists, especially in environments with limited browser debugging tools (such as mobile or locked-down systems), uBO Scope provides critical data. It tracks network requests and outcomes at the domain and hostname level, helping maintainers validate blocking efficiency, discover hidden or stealth connections, and optimize rules for better performance and accuracy.

### Developers and Power Users Interested in Network Transparency

Any user, developer, or security researcher who wants to understand the complete picture of network connections during browsing sessions will benefit. uBO Scope uniquely tracks every connection—regardless of whether other blockers can detect or block it—giving a comprehensive network transparency layer that bridges typical browser and extension limitations.

## Why Use uBO Scope Despite Existing Content Blockers?

- **Unmatched Visibility:** Unlike most blockers which only report blocked requests, uBO Scope counts and presents all network connections, classified as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

- **Accurate Representation of Privacy Exposure:** By focusing on distinct third-party domains contacted, it gives a truthful picture of your browsing exposure rather than misleading block counts.

- **Clarification of Content Blocking Myths:** Many rely on block-count comparisons or unreliable ad-blocker test sites. uBO Scope provides transparent, real-world data that expose these misconceptions.

- **Works Alongside Your Existing Tools:** uBO Scope complements rather than replaces content blockers, enhancing your insight without conflict.

## What uBO Scope Users Achieve

- **Empower Decision-Making:** Understand which domains are truly contacted during your sessions and adjust your privacy posture accordingly.

- **Enhance Filter Precision:** Detect stealth connections and verify how effectively your existing lists perform in various blocking scenarios.

- **Diagnose Browsing Behavior:** Quickly identify unexpected or suspicious remote servers involved in loading web content.

- **Improve Privacy Tool Literacy:** Learn about real network activity versus blocker statistics to debunk myths and improve your privacy toolkit knowledge.

---

## Practical Scenarios

- **You suspect a website loads resources from unknown third parties.** Use uBO Scope's popup panel to see all contacted domains, helping you decide if stricter blocking is necessary.

- **As a filter list maintainer, you want to validate your rules on test pages or real browsing sessions.** uBO Scope gives direct feedback on allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains to refine your filter set.

- **A privacy-conscious user on a device with no developer tools available (e.g., mobile).** Use uBO Scope to visualize network connections without debugging overhead or external setups.

## Getting Started as a New User

- Install uBO Scope in your preferred supported browser (links can be found on the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope#installation)).
- Open the popup panel from the extension icon to immediately see connection data for your active tab.
- Explore [Using the Popup Panel](/getting-started/using-and-validating/using-popup) to interpret the data effectively.
- For filter list maintainers, see [Filter List Maintainer Essentials](/guides/use-cases-and-best-practices/filter-list-maintainer-essentials) for advanced workflows.

## Tips for Effective Use

- Treat the badge count as the number of unique third-party domains contacted—aim to minimize this for better privacy.
- Use the ‘stealth-blocked’ category to identify connections your content blocker hides but uBO Scope reveals.
- Combine insights from uBO Scope with other diagnostic tools for a comprehensive analysis.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Do not rely solely on block counts from other content blockers; they don’t always reflect actual privacy control.
- Avoid using ad-blocker test sites as a benchmark; uBO Scope helps clarify why those do not give a realistic view.

By understanding the full scope of network activity in your browser, uBO Scope gives you the power to stay informed, in control, and privacy-savvy.
