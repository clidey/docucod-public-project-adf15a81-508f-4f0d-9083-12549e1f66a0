# Target Audience and Typical Scenarios

## Understanding Who Benefits Most from uBO Scope

uBO Scope is designed to empower users with transparent insight into every remote server connection attempted by the web pages they visit. This page identifies the key user groups who gain the most value from uBO Scope and illustrates how the extension fits naturally into their workflows—especially when conventional browser tools fall short or are inaccessible.

---

## 1. Everyday Privacy-Conscious Users

For users who prioritize privacy but aren’t necessarily technical experts, uBO Scope provides a vital window into real-time network activity without requiring deep knowledge of browser internals.

- **What They Want:**
  - Understand which remote servers their browser connects to while visiting websites.
  - Detect unwanted third-party connections that bypass typical content blockers.
  - Gain reassurance that privacy protections are effective.

- **How uBO Scope Helps:**
  - **Transparent Connection Reporting:** The extension clearly lists all remote server domains a page touches, alerting users to potential tracking or hidden connections.
  - **Simple Visual Summary:** It categorizes connections as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, making it easy to interpret without technical jargon.
  - **Independent of Blockers:** It reports all connection attempts regardless of any other content blocking in place—offering a complete picture.

- **Typical Scenario:** Sampling a news website, a privacy user opens uBO Scope’s popup and identifies unexpected third-party domains connecting silently. This prompts them to adjust their content blockers or browse more cautiously.

## 2. Technical Analysts and Researchers

For privacy researchers, QA testers, or technical hobbyists who delve into the nuances of web traffic and content blocking, uBO Scope is an irreplaceable tool.

- **What They Want:**
  - Comprehensive visibility into all network requests including failed, redirected, and stealth-blocked connections.
  - Data to verify content blocker behavior and validate filter lists.
  - A means to debunk myths about block counts and ad blocker tests.

- **How uBO Scope Helps:**
  - **Accurate Connection Outcomes:** It classifies network requests by their actual result (blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed), revealing the reality behind content filtering.
  - **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Operates effectively on all supported browsers reporting network requests via the `webRequest` API, including scenarios where native devtools are unavailable or limited.
  - **Detailed Tab-Based Insights:** Analysts can view connection details per browser tab, correlating server domains with specific browsing contexts.

- **Typical Scenario:** A filter list maintainer uses uBO Scope to confirm that newly crafted blocking rules effectively prevent connections without raising false positives, even in complex redirect scenarios.

## 3. Filter List Maintainers

Filter list maintainers craft and refine rules to block unwanted content and trackers. Their work requires precise observation of network behaviors across different sites.

- **What They Want:**
  - Reliable detection of every remote server connection attempt a browser makes.
  - Confirmation of actual blocking effectiveness beyond block counts.
  - Ability to monitor stealth-blocked connections that might otherwise deceive test pages or browser internal tools.

- **How uBO Scope Helps:**
  - **Unfiltered Visibility:** Reports all network activity independently of the content blockers, enabling maintainers to see true connection attempts.
  - **Supports Devices With Limited Tools:** Crucial on environments where standard browser developer tools are not accessible or lack sufficient detail.
  - **Future Enhancements Planned:** Anticipated features will provide more granular network request details tailored to the needs of filter list maintainers.

- **Typical Scenario:** A maintainer validating filter effectiveness on mobile browsers with restricted debugging tools uses uBO Scope to identify unexpected allowed connections and update rules accordingly.

## Why uBO Scope Matters When Browser Tools Are Insufficient

Across all user types, uBO Scope fills gaps left by standard browser tooling:

- **Stealth Blocking Awareness:** Many content blockers employ stealth techniques that hide blocking from webpages and some devtools. uBO Scope reveals these silently blocked connections.

- **Network Request Transparency:** It exposes request outcomes including failures and redirects which often go unnoticed.

- **Unified Reporting Across Browsers:** Works consistently in Chromium, Firefox, and Safari environments, supporting users on their preferred platforms.

---

## How Users Interact with uBO Scope

Upon visiting a webpage, the user simply opens the uBO Scope popup (via the toolbar icon) to instantly see categorized lists of all connected domains:

- **Allowed**: Domains where connections succeeded and data was fetched.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were silently blocked by stealth techniques.
- **Blocked**: Domains where connections failed or were explicitly blocked.

This instant visibility empowers users to spot anomalies, make informed privacy decisions, or debug complex network behaviors.

---

## Practical Tips for Each User Type

- **Privacy Users:** Check the domain list regularly when visiting unfamiliar or privacy-sensitive sites.

- **Technical Analysts:** Use uBO Scope alongside other tools to correlate network activity with filter rules and browser behavior.

- **Filter List Maintainers:** Combine uBO Scope data with traffic logs to iteratively improve blocking efficiency.

---

## Troubleshooting and Limitations

- **Browser Support:** uBO Scope relies on browsers supporting the `webRequest` API for network reporting. Some platforms or browser versions may provide limited data.

- **Outside API Monitoring:** Network requests made outside the browser's `webRequest` scope (e.g., native apps or background system requests) are not observed.

- **Badge Interpretation:** The toolbar badge reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted, not the total number of requests.
