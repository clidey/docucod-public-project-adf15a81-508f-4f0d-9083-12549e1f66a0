# Value Proposition & Target Users

Unlock the full transparency of your web browsing journey by understanding every network connection your browser attempts — with uBO Scope, the indispensable partner for privacy-conscious users and content filter maintainers.

## Why uBO Scope Matters

Every time you open a webpage, your browser reaches out behind the scenes to a variety of third-party servers — from content delivery networks to analytics providers and advertisers. While content blockers take aim at unwanted content, they can’t paint the full picture of all network activity.

uBO Scope fills this critical gap by revealing all remote connections initiated by webpages, providing you with a clear, unfiltered view of your browser’s network footprint.

## Who Benefits from uBO Scope?

- **Privacy-Focused Individuals** wanting crystal-clear insight into which third-party servers your browser actually connects to, helping you make informed decisions about your online footprint and security.
- **Filter List Maintainers** who need granular, real-world data about network requests across devices, especially where advanced developer tools or browser consoles may not be accessible.
- **Auditors and Researchers** validating content blockers’ effectiveness and debunking misleading claims by directly monitoring the actual network connection outcomes.

<br/>

## Everyday Use Cases That Empower

### Stay in Control of Your Digital Privacy
Imagine visiting your favorite news site and wondering how many and which third-party domains your browser contacts. uBO Scope instantly reports the distinct remote domains your browser successfully connects to (and those it blocks), giving you the power to spot intrusive trackers or unexpected data flows.

### Validate Your Content Blocker
Many users rely on block counts or test pages claiming to evaluate ad blockers. uBO Scope lets you see network events independent of block counts, showing the real number of allowed third-party servers. This clarity helps debunk myths like “more blocks means better blocking.”

### Support Filter Maintainers with Actual Data
Filter list authors struggle to tune rules without direct insight into network requests on users’ devices. uBO Scope acts as a practical tool for maintainers to observe network behavior and adjust filter lists effectively, especially on devices where full debugging tools are unavailable.

<br/>

## Key Benefits You Will Experience

- **Complete Transparency:** See all network requests your browser attempts, including successful, blocked, and redirected connections.
- **Actionable Insights:** Understand which connections are allowed, stealth-blocked (blocked silently), or fully blocked — helping you identify privacy risks.
- **Independent Monitoring:** Works alongside any content blocker or network-level blocking, always reporting network outcomes that the browser itself observes.
- **Minimal Maintenance:** Designed with longevity and low maintenance in mind, enabling focus on useful features rather than frequent updates.
