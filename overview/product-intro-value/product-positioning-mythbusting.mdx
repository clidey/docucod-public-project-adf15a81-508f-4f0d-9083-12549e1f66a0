# Product Positioning & Mythbusting

uBO Scope plays a unique role in the ecosystem of content blockers and browser privacy tools. Unlike traditional content blockers that actively block or filter network requests, uBO Scope is a transparent, non-invasive observer and measurer of network activity. This page clarifies uBO Scope's positioning and addresses common misconceptions users often encounter when evaluating content blockers or ad blocker tests.

## Why uBO Scope Is Different: A Neutral Network Observer

uBO Scope does not block content. Instead, it reports *all* attempted network connections to remote servers initiated by webpages. This unfiltered visibility allows users to understand the actual network behavior of websites without interference or modification by blocking technologies.

### What Users Achieve with uBO Scope

- **Accurate network connection counts:** The badge count indicates the number of distinct *third-party* remote servers contacted, reflecting the true exposure to external domains.
- **Insight into content blockers' effectiveness:** By showing which requests actually succeed versus those blocked or redirected stealthily, users gain an honest view of what content blockers allow through.
- **Mythbusting illusions in content blocking metrics:** uBO Scope empowers users to move beyond simplistic block counts or fabricated test results.

## Debunking Common Content Blocker Myths

### Myth 1: Higher Block Counts Equal Better Blocking

Many users judge content blockers by the block count shown on their interface. However, a high block count can be misleading: it may indicate more detected but permitted third-party server connections.

**How uBO Scope Helps:**

- uBO Scope's badge count represents the *number of distinct third-party servers allowed*, not just block events.
- A lower badge count means fewer distinct third-party connections, which generally correlates with stronger content blocking and improved privacy.
- This shifts the focus from counting blocks to measuring actual network exposure.

### Myth 2: "Ad Blocker Test" Webpages Are Reliable Benchmarks

There are many websites claiming to test ad blocker reliability. These test pages often fail to reflect real-world browsing because they generate artificial or unrealistic network requests specifically crafted to trigger blockers.

**How uBO Scope Helps:**

- It relies on real network activity from everyday browsing rather than contrived scenarios.
- It reveals stealth blocking and other subtleties that typical test pages cannot detect.
- Users can trust its network connection data as representative of true extension performance in daily use.

## Practical Positioning: When and Why Use uBO Scope

uBO Scope complements content blockers by exposing the *network reality* behind the scenes. It is especially valuable to:

- **Privacy-focused users and researchers:** Who want an unbiased measurement of third-party exposure across visited sites.
- **Filter list maintainers:** To verify whether lists effectively reduce third-party connections.
- **Auditors and skeptics:** Interested in validating blocking technologies beyond marketing claims or badge counts.

By design, it does *not* replace content blockers but instead enriches user awareness and understanding of what is happening at the network level.

## How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Workflow

1. **Install and activate uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blocker.**
2. **Observe the uBO Scope badge and popup data:** It reports the count and details of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked third-party domains.
3. **Compare results with your blockerâ€™s reported counts:** Do not mistake block counts for exposure counts.
4. **Use real browsing sessions instead of test websites:** Let uBO Scope reveal realistic connection patterns.
5. **Leverage insights to tune filter lists or blocker configurations:** Identify connections you want to block or allow.
