# Key Value Propositions & Use Cases

## Unlock Deeper Insight into Your Browsing Connections

uBO Scope elevates your understanding of network connections by reporting every third-party remote server your browser attempts to contact—not just those blocked by content blockers. This transparency is crucial for accurate awareness of your browser's network behavior across all major browsers.

- **Reveal All Connections:** Unlike traditional content blockers that only report blocked requests, uBO Scope shows all network connections, including allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked ones.
- **Clarify Blocking Statistics:** It helps debunk misleading assumptions stemming from toolbar badge counts that often exaggerate the efficacy of certain blockers.
- **Empower Filter List Maintainers:** Provides detailed visibility into connection attempts that can inform improvements to filter lists.
- **Privacy-Conscious Control:** Supports users focused on privacy by exposing exactly which remote servers their browser communicates with, regardless of the blocking mechanism in place.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Works effectively on major browsers including Chromium-based, Firefox, and Safari, as long as the browser exposes network requests through the `webRequest` API.

## Understanding What uBO Scope Brings to the Table

At its core, uBO Scope is designed not just as a blocker, but as a transparent reporting tool. Its main goal is to show you the landscape of network activity that occurs as you navigate the web, providing clarity where common content blockers leave you guessing.

### Why the Badge Numbers Can Mislead You

Many users rely on the badge count displayed by content blockers as a measure of block effectiveness. uBO Scope reveals this metric’s limitations:

- The badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers with connections—**lower is better**, as it indicates fewer third-party connections.
- A higher block count on a content blocker’s badge does not necessarily mean better blocking; it can indicate that the browser is connecting to more unique third-party servers because of weaker or different blocking strategies.

### Avoiding Misconceptions from Ad Blocker Test Pages

Ad blocker test websites often display inflated or fabricated network request scenarios. uBO Scope helps you avoid falling for these unrealistic benchmarks:

- Extension-based blockers may employ stealth techniques, making detection by test pages unreliable.
- Test pages simulate network requests that do not occur in real-world browsing.
- uBO Scope’s direct network reporting cuts through these illusions, focusing on actual connections your browser attempts.

## Real-World Use Cases

### For Privacy-Conscious Users

Gain a fine-grained view of all network connections your browser makes during everyday browsing. By seeing what third-party domains are contacted—and which are stealthily blocked or allowed—you can better assess your exposure and make informed decisions about your browsing environment.

### For Filter List Maintainers

Limitations in browser tools on some platforms make inspecting network requests challenging. uBO Scope fills this gap by providing:

- A detailed aggregation of allowed and blocked connections across domains and hostnames.
- Insights into stealth blocking (where redirects or errors occur without explicit blocking visibility).
- Data to optimize filter lists by identifying connections that slip through or are unnecessarily blocked.

### For Developers and Security Analysts

Understand the specifics of network behavior on web pages to diagnose issues or strengthen security policies. uBO Scope collects data on redirects, errors, and successes, enabling precise analysis of web resource loading.

## How uBO Scope Delivers This Value

Through its integration with the browser’s `webRequest` API, uBO Scope listens to network events and categorizes each remote server connection attempt as:

- **Allowed:** Successfully connected to remote servers.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests stopped or redirected silently.
- **Blocked:** Requests that resulted in errors or explicit blocking.

The extension then summarizes these outcomes in its popup UI and badge count, providing a comprehensive yet approachable picture of network activity.

## Practical Tips for Using uBO Scope Effectively

- **Interpret the badge count carefully:** Remember it shows distinct third-party domains connected, not the number of blocked requests.
- **Use alongside content blockers:** uBO Scope complements blockers by providing transparency into their effectiveness.
- **Review connections by category:** Check each outcome section in the popup to understand the behavior of specific domains.
- **Configure filters thoughtfully:** Use uBO Scope insights to fine-tune filter lists and reduce unnecessary blocking.

## Common Misunderstandings to Avoid

- Don’t equate a higher block count on any content blocker’s badge with better privacy.
- Avoid relying on ad blocker test sites to judge blocking accuracy.
- Do not expect uBO Scope to report network requests outside the browser’s `webRequest` API scope (such as some DNS-level blocks).

## Getting Started with uBO Scope

Begin with installing the extension from your browser’s official store. Once installed:

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
- Observe the summary section for the number of distinct domains connected.
- Explore the categorized sections indicating not blocked, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

This transparency dashboard arms you with knowledge to better understand and manage your browser’s network behavior.
