# Core Value and Use Cases

## Unlocking Full Transparency of Remote Connections

uBO Scope empowers you to clearly see *every* remote server your browser connects to when you visit web pages, regardless of your content blockers or network configuration. This page dives into the real-world problems uBO Scope solves, demonstrating how it delivers clarity and confidence about what happens behind the scenes in your browser’s networking.

### Why This Matters

When you browse, websites initiate many background connections—to content delivery networks, tracking domains, ad servers, analytic platforms, and sometimes unexpected third-party hosts. Traditional content blockers focus on blocking certain requests, but it’s not always obvious which connections *actually* happen, which are stealthily blocked, or which succeed.

uBO Scope answers these challenges by reporting *all* remote connection attempts independently of other blockers or DNS-level filtering. This complete transparency helps you:

- **See the exact domains contacted by web pages**
- **Confirm which connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked**
- **Validate the effectiveness of your content blocker setup**
- **Detect unexpected third-party connections in real-time**


## Core Benefits and Use Cases

### 1. Privacy-Conscious Users: Empower Your Web Awareness

To maintain privacy online, knowing which third parties your browser touches is essential. uBO Scope reveals *all* domains contacted by web pages, regardless of how requests are filtered or blocked. This transparency equips you with:

- A clear picture of your exposure to third-party domains.
- Confidence that blockers like uBlock Origin or DNS filters are performing as expected.
- Insight into stealth-blocked requests that might otherwise go unnoticed.

With the extension’s toolbar badge and popup panel, you effortlessly track distinct third-party connections per tab, staying in control of your privacy footprint.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers: Validate and Enhance Block Coverage

Maintaining effective filter lists requires real-world data validating blocking results across numerous domains and scenarios. uBO Scope offers:

- Detailed visibility into allowed and blocked remote servers.
- A platform to detect stealth blocking versus outright blocking distinctions.
- An independent measure of blocklist performance without bias from extension-specific internals.

Especially on devices or environments with limited developer tools, uBO Scope becomes critical for filter list authors to verify coverage and identify gaps.

### 3. Debunking Common Blocking Myths

Misconceptions around block counts and ad block testing abound. uBO Scope exposes the truths:

- **Block count is not a quality metric:** A higher block count badge does not mean better blocking—it can mean more allowed connections and more complex bypass behaviors.
- **Ad block test pages don’t reflect reality:** Those tests rely on artificial requests and miss stealth blocking techniques, leading to misleading conclusions.

By reporting actual network request outcomes independently, uBO Scope helps clarify the real impact of your content blockers.

## Real-World Impact: Before and After

| Scenario                                     | Without uBO Scope                                   | With uBO Scope                              |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Understanding third-party connections        | Guesswork, incomplete data from extension UI       | Exact count and domains contacted per tab  |
| Validating filter list effectiveness          | Relies on heuristics and indirect stats            | Clear allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked data |
| Identifying stealth-blocking behaviors        | Difficult or impossible to detect                   | Explicitly shown in the popup, no guesswork      |
| Debunking ad-block test and blocking myths    | Confused by counterintuitive results and misinterpretations | Transparent, fact-based data on network requests  |

## How Users Interact with uBO Scope

The extension integrates seamlessly into your browsing workflow:

- **Toolbar badge:** Shows the number of distinct allowed third-party domains contacted by the active tab.
- **Popup panel:** Displays grouped domains under three outcomes — `not blocked`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked` — with request counts per domain.

This real-time information is accessible exactly when you need it, arming you with factual insights.

## Best Practices and Tips

- Review the extension badge regularly while loading sites with extensive third-party content, such as news sites or social media.
- Use the popup domain list to investigate unexpected domains and understand their network patterns.
- Combine uBO Scope with your content blocker settings to iteratively refine your privacy and filtering strategies.
- Filter maintainers should cross-reference uBO Scope’s data with filter list hits to ensure comprehensive blocking.

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- **Popup shows "NO DATA" or empty domains:** Confirm the extension is enabled and has the appropriate permissions. Network requests may not yet be captured if the tab just opened.
- **Badge count doesn’t update:** This usually means no distinct third-party connections were detected or reporting is delayed; refreshing the tab clears session data.
- **Unexpected allowed domains appear:** Investigate which sites initiate those requests and adjust filters or whitelist carefully.

## Summary

uBO Scope fundamentally and transparently reveals every network connection your browser attempts, empowering users with unmatched visibility. Across privacy enthusiasts, filter list maintainers, and users facing blocking myths, it provides indispensable, actionable data that transforms how you understand and control your browser's remote server connections.
