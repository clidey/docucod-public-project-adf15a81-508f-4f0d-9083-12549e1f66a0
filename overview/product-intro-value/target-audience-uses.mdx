# Who Is uBO Scope For?

uBO Scope is tailored for individuals who seek clarity and control over their online privacy by understanding the hidden network connections their browser establishes. Whether you're an experienced privacy advocate, a filter list maintainer, or simply curious about the invisible web requests that happen as you browse, uBO Scope offers unmatched transparency into what your browser is connecting to — beyond what traditional content blockers reveal.

## Understanding the Audience

### Privacy-Minded Users
If you prioritize safeguarding your personal information, uBO Scope empowers you by showing every attempted and successful connection your browser makes to third-party servers. This visibility helps you recognize unwanted trackers, reduce your digital footprint, and make informed decisions about your browsing habits.

### Filter List Maintainers
Maintaining effective filter lists requires comprehensive insight into real-world network requests. uBO Scope serves as a practical tool by capturing network outcomes across various blocking scenarios, helping maintainers identify stealthy connections and evaluate filter effectiveness, especially in environments with limited access to browser tools.

### Content Blocker Enthusiasts and Advanced Users
For those dedicated to understanding and optimizing content blockers, uBO Scope debunks common myths, such as the reliability of block count badges or so-called ad blocker test pages. It uncovers the actual number of distinct third-party connections, providing a clearer picture of blocker performance.

## Why uBO Scope Matters to You

Imagine browsing your favorite site, unaware of numerous hidden connections taking place behind the scenes. These third-party connections could expose your data, load ads, or collect tracking information without your knowledge. uBO Scope brings this backstage activity into the spotlight, categorizing each connection's outcome as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

This insight offers you three critical benefits:

- **Transparency:** See the distinct domains and hostnames your browser connects to per tab, highlighting connections unnoticed by standard blockers.
- **Control:** Gauge the effectiveness of your existing blockers and privacy settings by understanding what is truly blocked and what slips through.
- **Empowerment:** Make smarter privacy decisions and contribute to better filter lists backed by real-world data.

## How You Interact with uBO Scope

Using uBO Scope is seamless — the browser extension sits quietly yet vigilantly, tracking network requests as you browse. When you click the toolbar icon, the popup panel reveals a summary:

- The total number of distinct third-party domains connected to by the current tab.
- Grouped lists of domains categorized by connection outcome:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Connections that successfully fetched resources.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections intercepted to avoid detection but effectively blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Connections that failed due to blocking or network errors.

Each domain listing includes a count of how many requests were made, giving you granular insight into network activity.

## Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Privacy-Conscious Web User
You visit a news website and want to check if additional trackers are silently pulling data. After loading the page, you open uBO Scope's popup. You see a clear breakdown of which third-party domains loaded content and which were blocked. Applying this knowledge, you may choose to adjust content blockers or avoid certain sites.

### Scenario 2: Filter List Author
You're maintaining a filter list and want to analyze how often particular domains appear in connections and if they are blocked or allowed stealthily. uBO Scope's detailed counts and categorization provide actionable intelligence to refine your filters, ensuring better protection for users.

### Scenario 3: Content Blocker Enthusiast
You have multiple content blockers installed and wonder which is most effective. By comparing the number and nature of allowed connections shown by uBO Scope with the block counts from your blockers, you gain an objective understanding beyond misleading badge counts or ad test pages.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Always consider the broader context: not every third-party connection is harmful. Recognizing legitimate service domains like content delivery networks (CDNs) can help you avoid unnecessary blocking.
- Use uBO Scope alongside other privacy tools to get comprehensive protection and monitoring.
- For filter list maintainers, regularly analyze connection data to catch emerging stealth domains.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Misinterpreting Badge Counts:** The toolbar badge reports the number of distinct third-party servers connected to, not blocked requests. A lower number indicates fewer external connections with potentially less tracking.
- **Relying on Ad Blocker Test Pages:** These test pages often don't reflect realistic browsing behavior and can't detect stealth blocking by extensions. Use uBO Scope for real browsing sessions to get accurate insights.
