# Who Should Use uBO Scope—and Why?

Discover the core user groups for uBO Scope and how the extension addresses their specific challenges. Whether you're a privacy-conscious individual, a filter list maintainer, or someone questioning the reliability of content blockers, this page explains why uBO Scope is an indispensable tool in your browser arsenal.

## Understanding uBO Scope’s Primary Audiences

### Privacy-Focused Users Seeking Transparent Network Visibility

If your priority is to see exactly which remote servers your browser connects to—beyond what traditional content blockers disclose—uBO Scope provides unmatched transparency. It surfaces **every attempted and successful connection**, helping you understand your online exposure.

**Why this matters:**

- Many privacy tools highlight block counts but neglect to reveal connections allowed.
- uBO Scope shows the *distinct third-party remote servers* involved, directly reflecting potential tracking or resource loading.
- Lower badge counts on uBO Scope indicate fewer third-party domains your browser interacted with — a clearer privacy indicator.

**Typical workflow:**

1. Install uBO Scope on a supported browser.
2. Browse normally, watching connection counts update.
3. Open the popup UI to analyze which domains were allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.
4. Use insights to adjust your privacy settings or blockers accordingly.

### Filter List Maintainers Needing Real-World Data

Maintaining effective filter lists requires concrete data on which third-party connections websites attempt. uBO Scope serves as a practical aid by revealing live network behaviors directly from the browser.

**Why this matters:**

- Provides real-time, accurate reporting on hostnames and domains seen in normal browsing.
- Shows categories: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections, giving precise feedback on filter rule effectiveness.
- Helps in refining filter lists for better coverage without breaking legitimate resources.

**Typical workflow:**

1. Use uBO Scope alongside content blockers to monitor network request outcomes.
2. Identify domains frequently bypassing filters or slipping through stealth blocking.
3. Adjust and test filter lists with confidence, based on live data.

### Users Questioning Content Blocker Effectiveness and Myths

Do you suspect that block counts alone don’t tell the whole story? Many users mistakenly assume a blocker with a higher block count is better. uBO Scope dispels this myth by focusing on *distinct third-party domains allowed* rather than just block statistics.

**Why this matters:**

- Block badges can be misleading; higher blocking can mean more connections are being made.
- uBO Scope measures actual network connection outcomes, not just requests blocked.
- Fictional “ad blocker test” pages fail to capture realistic browsing scenarios, but uBO Scope captures real network activity during everyday use.

**Typical workflow:**

1. Run uBO Scope while comparing different content blockers.
2. Compare distinct allowed remote servers to gauge true privacy impact.
3. Make informed decisions rather than relying on block count badges or artificial test pages.

## Key Problems uBO Scope Solves

- **Lack of visibility into network requests:** Many users can only see block counts without insight into the actual network connections, leaving privacy unclear.
- **Difficulty assessing content blocker efficacy:** Block counts are unreliable metrics, and stealth blocking can hide true blocking behavior.
- **Filter list maintenance challenges:** Without concrete data, maintaining and improving filter lists risks over-blocking or under-blocking.

Through its transparent reporting and precise categorization of connection outcomes, uBO Scope fills these critical gaps.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Favor the number of distinct allowed domains over block counts.** A lower allowed domain count signals better privacy protection.
- **Use uBO Scope in combination with established content blockers** to get comprehensive network visibility.
- **Regularly check the popup UI to monitor stealth blocking** which is often invisible to typical tools.
- **Filter maintainers should leverage domain metrics** to fine-tune lists without relying on artificial test scenarios.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t assume a high block count means better blocking. Use uBO Scope’s allowed connection insights.
- Avoid trusting ad blocker test pages; real-world browsing data from uBO Scope is far more reliable.
- Don’t overlook stealth-blocked domains; these can represent connections your blocker caught silently.

## Practical Example

When browsing a news website, you activate uBO Scope. The badge shows "7", indicating seven distinct third-party domains were connected to during page load. Clicking the icon, you find:

- **Allowed:** CDN providers serving images and scripts.

- **Blocked:** Known ad servers.

This insight gives you confidence that your content blocker is allowing only essential third-party connections, enhancing your browsing privacy without breaking the site’s functionality.
