# Common Use Cases and Scenarios

uBO Scope empowers you to gain unparalleled insight into how websites interact with remote servers during your browsing sessions. This page highlights the most frequent, valuable real-world tasks that uBO Scope solves, transforming opaque network activity into transparent data you can act upon.

## Discover and Audit Third-Party Connections

Often, websites silently initiate connections to multiple third-party domains, which may track your activity or load unwanted content. With uBO Scope, you can monitor these connections live and see which are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked by your content blockers.

**How It Helps:**
- Identify unexpected third-party servers your browser contacts on any webpage.
- Audit the effect of your current content blockers by viewing blocked vs allowed connections.
- Quickly spot excessive third-party trackers that impact privacy.

**Example Scenario:**
Imagine visiting an online news article. With uBO Scope, you can immediately see a list of third-party domains contacted — such as ad networks or analytics providers — and verify if your blockers are effectively preventing those connections.

## Validate Effectiveness of Other Content Blockers

Content blockers vary widely in how aggressively they block network requests. uBO Scope does not block by itself but monitors and reports all connection attempts regardless of blocking status.

**Benefit:**
- Objectively measure which remote servers still receive connections despite your blockers.
- Avoid misleading block count metrics used by other tools.
- Detect stealth-blocked connections that traditional tools may miss.

**Practical Use:**
Filter list maintainers and privacy-conscious users leverage uBO Scope to validate how well popular blockers actually reduce third-party connections, helping fine-tune filters or investigate blockers’ behaviors.

## Gain Insight into Cross-Site Tracking Attempts

Tracking attempts often use various domains and redirections that may evade simple blocking solutions. uBO Scope categorizes connections into three key types:
- **Allowed:** Connections that succeed.
- **Blocked:** Connections that fail due to blocking.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections that browsers redirect or obscure to protect privacy.

**Why This Matters:**
Understanding these categories gives you a clear picture of what data might be leaking out and what blocking mechanisms are doing behind the scenes.

**Scenario:**
When browsing social media platforms or large e-commerce sites, you can use uBO Scope to detect which companies are trying to track you across websites, even if they are stealth-blocked.

## Troubleshooting Privacy Issues

If you suspect a website is leaking data or connecting to trackers you don’t want, uBO Scope lets you investigate precisely what connections are made.

**How to Use:**
Open uBO Scope’s popup while on the target website to view detailed domain counts and connection outcomes. This assists in troubleshooting privacy leaks or misconfigured blockers.

## Educate and Debunk Common Content Blocker Myths

Many users rely on block counts or ad blocker test pages to judge content blockers, but these metrics can be misleading.

**uBO Scope’s Role:**
- Provides real-world connection data instead of synthetic tests.
- Shows the true number of distinct third-party servers contacted, which is a more meaningful privacy metric.

**Outcome:**
Users become empowered to make informed decisions about blockers based on actual network behavior.

## Best Practices for Using uBO Scope in These Scenarios

- Always check the popup panel immediately after loading a webpage to get an up-to-date view.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with your existing blockers for optimized privacy.
- Use the allowed, blocked, stealth distinction to understand privacy exposure risks.
- Remember to consider that some third-party domains are legitimate (such as CDNs).
