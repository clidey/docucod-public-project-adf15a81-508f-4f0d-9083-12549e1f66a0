## Unlocking Transparency: The Core Audience for uBO Scope

At its heart, uBO Scope is designed for anyone who cares about understanding what’s really happening when a webpage makes network connections. Its user base is broad but focused on those seeking clarity and control over their browser’s network activity beyond just blocking ads or trackers.

### Primary Users

- **Privacy-Conscious Individuals:**
  - You want to know exactly which remote servers your browser connects to while you browse.
  - You’re concerned about third-party trackers, CDNs, or unknown connections but need an accurate, no-nonsense tool to reveal them.
  - You want to validate how well your content blockers actually protect you by seeing which requests are truly allowed or blocked.

- **Filter List Maintainers:**
  - You develop or maintain blocklists and need data to verify what connections are slipping through or being stealthily blocked.
  - You may work on devices with limited access to developer tools and require a lightweight extension to audit network connections.
  - You prefer tools that provide categorized outcomes, helping you improve list accuracy and maintenance.

- **Skeptics and Myth Debunkers:**
  - You question the common claims comparing content blockers purely based on their blocking counts.
  - You want to prove or disprove misleading statistics from ‘ad blocker tests’ or badge counts.
  - You need a tool that reveals the reality: that a higher block count doesn’t always mean better protection.

## When uBO Scope Becomes Essential

Certain contexts increase the value of uBO Scope and make it indispensable for users:

- **Devices with Limited Developer Tools:** Many mobile browsers or managed environments lack built-in network debugging tools. uBO Scope fills this gap by providing clear visibility into network requests.

- **Verifying Content Blocker Performance:** When you install multiple blockers or custom filters, it’s difficult to know which third-party requests are permitted. uBO Scope reports actual network activity, regardless of how content blockers intervene.

- **Evaluating Third-Party Connections:** Whether for privacy audits or security reviews, understanding distinct third-party domains contacted by your browser is a critical insight uBO Scope provides.

- **Avoiding Misleading Metrics:** Instead of trusting toolbar badge counts or test sites that simulate unrealistic network requests, uBO Scope shows live, browser-reported network interactions that reflect real-world behavior.

## What Makes uBO Scope Unique for These Users

- **Raw Visibility Into Network Requests:** It taps into your browser’s `webRequest` API to present a comprehensive, tab-scoped summary of remote server connections.

- **Categorization of Outcomes:** uBO Scope doesn’t just list domains; it classifies them as 'allowed', 'blocked', or 'stealth-blocked', helping you interpret the quality of your content blocking environment.

- **Independent of Blocker Bias:** It reports requests regardless of which content blocker is installed, including those blocked at DNS or stealth levels, providing an unfiltered view.

- **Low Overhead and Broad Browser Support:** Compatible with major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, with efficient usage of resources.

## Real-World Scenario: A Privacy-Conscious User’s Workflow

Imagine you’re browsing your favorite news site with uBO Scope installed alongside your main content blocker. The badge shows a count of distinct third-party servers contacted. Curious, you open uBO Scope’s popup.

You see a clear split:
- Domains marked as **not blocked** include some essential CDNs.
- A few domains appear as **stealth-blocked**, indicating invisible blocking.
- Some connections are outright **blocked**.

This visibility reassures you that despite some network activity, most unwanted trackers are stopped, while critical resources still load seamlessly. You adjust your filter list based on these insights, improving your privacy without breaking websites.

## Common Pitfalls Avoided by Using uBO Scope

- Misinterpreting high block counts as better privacy protection.
- Trusting ‘ad blocker test’ websites that simulate unrealistic requests.
- Relying solely on content blocker badges that don’t reveal distinct remote server counts.
- Missing stealth-blocked connections that other tools do not expose.
