# Feature Overview: What Can You See and Do?

uBO Scope equips you with clear, real-time insights into the network connections your browser makes, focusing on third-party remote servers. This feature overview guides you through the main capabilities exposed by uBO Scope’s user interface, explains how its popup summarizes connections per active tab, clarifies badge meanings, and briefly outlines platform compatibility to set a confident foundation for your daily use.

## Real-Time Tracking of Third-Party Connections Per Tab

Every time you navigate to a new webpage or interact with an active tab, uBO Scope monitors and records network requests initiated by that tab. It captures not only the primary domain but more importantly the third-party servers involved:

- **Allowed** connections: Remote servers from which resource loads completed successfully.
- **Blocked** connections: Remote servers where requests were explicitly blocked (e.g., by content blockers).
- **Stealth-blocked** connections: Network requests that were silently redirected or suppressed, typically for stealth blocking techniques.

uBO Scope maintains these connection outcomes separately for each open tab, letting you understand the unique connection footprint per webpage.

> **Example:** When you load a news website, uBO Scope tracks how many third-party servers delivered visible content versus those that were blocked behind the scenes by your content blocker.


## Popup UI Connection Summary

The primary interface for viewing connection data is the popup window that appears when you click uBO Scope’s toolbar icon. Here’s what you will find:

### Current Tab Hostname Display

At the top, the popup displays the hostname of the active tab in a two-part format:

- The subdomain prefix (if any)
- The main registered domain in Unicode form (to handle internationalized domain names)

If no data exist for the current tab, a clear **NO DATA** indicator is shown.

### Domains Connected Summary

Below the header:

- A succinct count of the total distinct domains connected to by the current tab, representing its network footprint.

### Connection Outcome Sections

Three distinct sections list domains, grouped by the outcome of their requests:

- **Not Blocked** (Allowed): Domains from which connections succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains involved in stealth blocking.
- **Blocked**: Domains where requests failed or were blocked explicitly.

Each domain entry includes:

- The domain name
- The number of individual hostname requests under that domain

An intuitive color scheme and layout visually differentiate each outcome, facilitating quick assessment.

<Callout type="note">
Keep in mind that a lower count of connected third-party domains indicates less exposure and generally greater privacy.
</Callout>

## Toolbar Badge Indicator

The small badge on the toolbar icon dynamically reflects the number of unique allowed third-party domains in the current tab.

- It updates in near real-time as new connections are observed or as tabs change.
- The badge is blank if no third-party domains are connected or if no data are available.

This count serves as a quick privacy indicator, helping you spot sites with many external connections at a glance.

## Platform and Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope’s core features work across major browsers (Chromium-based, Firefox, and Safari) with slight variations under the hood, but the user-facing aspects remain consistent:

- **Background Monitoring:** Runs as a service worker or background script that listens for all webRequest events.
- **Popup UI:** Responsive and optimized for the typical browser popup size.
- **Badge Updates:** Supported via browser action APIs across platforms.

This consistent behavior ensures a seamless user experience regardless of browser choice.

## Practical Example: Understanding Your Network Exposure

1. Navigate to a popular social media site.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
3. See the hostname clearly displayed; subdomains, if present, separated for clarity.
4. Review the count of connected domains — noting those allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
5. The badge shows the number of allowed third-party domains, giving instant feedback on network exposure.

You now have a comprehensive snapshot of the remote servers your current tab interacted with, enabling informed privacy and security decisions.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Regularly check the badge and popup when visiting unfamiliar sites to gauge the level of third-party exposure.
- Use the popup’s domain listings to identify unexpected or suspicious third-party connections.
- Understand that not all third-party domains are harmful; many are essential CDNs or service providers.
- Combine observations from uBO Scope with your content blocker to optimize filter lists and block unwanted trackers.

## Troubleshooting

If the popup shows **NO DATA**, or the badge count does not update:

- Ensure the extension has necessary permissions, especially the webRequest API access.
- Confirm you are viewing an active tab that has made network requests since activating uBO Scope.
- Try refreshing the tab or reopening the popup.

For deeper troubleshooting, consult the [Troubleshooting Scope & Understanding Limitations](../guides/practical-usage-patterns/troubleshooting-coverage) guide.

## Summary

- Real-time tracking of third-party remote server connections per tab.
- Intuitive popup UI showing hostname, connection outcomes, and detailed domain counts.
- Toolbar badge summarizing allowed third-party domains as a quick privacy indicator.
- Consistent multi-browser platform support.

Next, explore practical workflows in the [Monitoring Network Connections on Webpages](../guides/getting-started-usage/monitoring-connections) guide or deepen your understanding of domain outcomes in [Core Concepts & Terminology](../overview/how-it-works-core-concepts/core-concepts-terminology).
