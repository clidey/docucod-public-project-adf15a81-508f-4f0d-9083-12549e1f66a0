# Popup Panel and Badge Explained

Understanding your browser's network connections at a glance is the core goal of uBO Scope. This page unpacks how the popup panel UI and toolbar badge work together to present real-time insights on domain connections, helping you decode the privacy exposure of the current tab effortlessly.

---

## At a Glance: The Badge Count

The toolbar badge, visible on the extension icon, instantly shows the **number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections** on the active tab. This count reflects how many unique outside servers the current webpage actually contacted without being blocked.

- **Lower badge counts indicate better privacy exposure.**
- The badge does **not** count blocked or stealth-blocked domains.
- Only third-party domains — servers different from the loaded website's domain — are counted.

This immediate metric empowers you to assess how openly a webpage communicates beyond its primary domain and guides you in adjusting content blocking to reduce unwanted network exposure.

<Tip>
Remember, not all third-party connections are harmful — legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs) often appear. The badge count helps distinguish how many unique third-party domains are in play, but it’s up to your discretion to decide what to allow or block.
</Tip>

## The Popup Panel: Detailed Connection Summaries

Clicking the extension icon opens the popup panel, a comprehensive real-time report on the network connections initiated by the active tab's webpage. Here’s what you’ll see:

### 1. Tab Hostname Display

At the top, the panel shows the full hostname of the current tab’s webpage, split visually into two parts if applicable:

- **Subdomain portion** (e.g., "www." or any other prefix) in a lighter font
- **Base domain** (e.g., "example.com") prominently

This helps you identify exactly which website is being analyzed.

### 2. Summary Section

Below the hostname, a summary line displays the **total number of distinct third-party domains connected to and allowed** by the webpage.

Example:

```
domains connected: 12
```

This confirms the badge count in the popup panel for deeper context.

### 3. Connection Outcome Sections

The main content is divided into three outcome categories, each with a header and a list of domains with their connection counts:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains from which resources successfully loaded. 
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with connections stealthily blocked by your content blocker (i.e., prevented but hidden from the webpage).
- **Blocked:** Domains where network requests failed or were actively blocked.

Each domain is accompanied by a count indicating how many requests to that domain occurred.

For example:

| Outcome    | Description                                              | User Insight                          |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked| Allowed third-party domains with successful connections   | Domains actively contacting your browser, revealing privacy exposure |
| Stealth-Blocked| Attempts blocked quietly without webpage detection    | Indicates the stealth blocking effectiveness and hidden network attempts|
| Blocked    | Domains where requests were visibly blocked or failed      | Shows domains prevented outright, helping configure blocking rules|

<Tip>
Use the distinct domain counts and lists here to identify third parties interacting with the webpage, which helps in fine-tuning your content blocking strategy for enhanced privacy.
</Tip>

## How to Interpret the Data: User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Monitoring Privacy Exposure on a News Site

You visit a news site. The badge shows “8,” meaning eight unique third-party domains are connected. Clicking the popup reveals several well-known ad servers under "Not Blocked." You spot a stealth-blocked tracker domain in the "Stealth-Blocked" section.

**Your action:** You can decide to enhance blocking rules or add filters based on stealth-blocked domains to tighten privacy.

### Scenario 2: Diagnosing Unexpected Connections

On a webpage where you expect minimal tracking, the badge shows a surprisingly high number. Opening the popup, you discover multiple third-party CDNs and ad providers.

**Your action:** Investigate and adjust content filters or block suspicious domains directly from your blocker to reduce unwanted connections.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Check the badge after loading a new page** to get immediate clues about privacy exposure.
- **Use the popup panel to dive deeper** when suspiciously high or unexpected counts are seen.
- **Focus on third-party domains,** as first-party connections are typically necessary for site functionality.
- **Look for stealth-blocked domains to verify your content blocker’s efficacy** in silently preventing tracking.
- **Regularly review connection trends** for sites you frequent to stay ahead of privacy risks.

<Warning>
Domains may appear under different outcomes based on network events (success, redirect, error). Refresh the page and revisit the popup for the most up-to-date data.
</Warning>

## Behind the Scenes: Data Flow Overview

Behind the popup panel and badge, uBO Scope continually listens to network events in the browser:

- Network requests are monitored for **success, redirect, or error events.**
- Requests are categorized into allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked based on their outcomes.
- Counts of unique domains and hostnames are tracked per tab session.
- The data is dynamically sent to the popup panel on demand.
- The toolbar badge reflects the count of allowed third-party domains instantly.

This seamless flow means you always get fresh, accurate connection insights aligned with your browsing session.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Popup Panel and Badge Questions">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge sometimes show no number or zero?">
This means either no third-party connections were made or data for the active tab hasn't been recorded yet. Try reloading the page and ensure the extension is enabled.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some domains appear under stealth-blocked but not blocked?">
Stealth-blocked domains are blocked silently without informing the webpage, while blocked domains are overtly blocked or failed. This distinction helps in understanding how effectively blocking is hidden from trackers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The panel shows 'NO DATA' for hostname. What to do?">
This occurs if no network data is available for the active tab, possibly because the tab is inactive or the page hasn't completed loading. Refresh the tab or switch to another tab.
</Accordion>

## Example Screenshot of the Popup Panel UI

```
[Hostname display]
www.example.com

[Summary]
domains connected: 5

[Not Blocked]
- cdn.example.net (3)
- ads.analytics.com (1)

[Stealth-Blocked]
- tracker.hidden.io (2)

[Blocked]
- blocked.badsite.org (4)
```

The badge icon beside your browser toolbar will show “5” reflecting the five unique domains under "Not Blocked."
