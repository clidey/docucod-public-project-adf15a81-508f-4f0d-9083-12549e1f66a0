# Features At a Glance

Discover the essential capabilities of uBO Scope that empower you with deep insight into your browser's network behavior. This page provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the core features that make uBO Scope an indispensable companion for anyone who values transparency, privacy, and control.

## Clear Reporting of All Remote Connections

uBO Scope exposes every attempt your browser makes to connect to remote servers — regardless of whether these requests succeed, fail, or are stealth-blocked by your content blocker or DNS provider. This transparency is vital for understanding the true network footprint of webpages you visit.

- **Allowed Requests**: Connections that completed successfully.
- **Blocked Requests**: Connections explicitly denied or failed.
- **Stealth-Blocked Requests**: Connections suppressed in a way that aims to avoid detection or webpage breakage.

This triage helps you distinguish between what is actually loaded by your browser and what your blocking tools intercept silently.

## Intuitive Popup Panel

At any time, click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open a popup panel revealing the network overview for the current browser tab:

- The top header prominently displays the active tab's hostname and domain.
- Three distinct sections categorize and list remote domains:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which connections were allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with stealth-blocked requests.
  - **Blocked:** Domains whose requests were blocked explicitly.
- Each domain entry shows the hostname and the count of connections observed.

This clear layout allows rapid comprehension of your browsing exposure, as well as easy identification of third-party services involved.

## Toolbar Badge Reflecting Third-Party Connections

uBO Scope dynamically updates its toolbar icon badge with a numeric count:

- This count represents the **number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections** in the active tab.
- A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party services reaching your browser, supporting privacy goals.

**Important:** The badge does not count blocked or stealth-blocked domains — it highlights actual network exposure, not just blocking activity.

## Unbiased Insight Regardless of Content Blocker or DNS Filters

A key strength of uBO Scope is its independence from your content blocking or DNS filtering setup:

- It leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to track network requests.
- This enables detection of allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked requests no matter which extensions or DNS services are active.
- As long as the browser reports these requests through the API, uBO Scope provides an accurate picture.

Consequently, uBO Scope offers a reliable measure of network requests beyond the scope or stealth tactics of other extensions or blocking mechanisms.

## Real-World Value

Imagine browsing your favorite news site and instantly seeing a concise summary of every remote server your browser contacted — including trackers and ads silently blocked or stealthily filtered out.

- Quickly assess your third-party exposure.
- Compare the true impact of different content blockers.
- Debug misconfigurations or unexpected network behavior.

## Practical Tips

- Use the popup panel regularly during your web browsing to monitor third-party access.
- Pay attention to the badge count as a quick privacy health metric — lower is better.
- Investigate domains under the "stealth-blocked" section to understand stealth technologies in play.
- Remember that not all third-party domains are harmful; some provide essential content like CDNs.


## Common Pitfalls

- Do not confuse the badge number with the number of blocked connections; it counts allowed distinct third-party domains.
- Some network requests may not be captured if the browser does not expose them through the `webRequest` API.
- Stealth-blocked domains do not appear in the badge count, so consider them in privacy evaluations.

## How It All Comes Together

Behind the scenes, uBO Scope uses its background logic to classify each network request associated with your tabs, sorting them into allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked categories. It then surfaces this organized data through the popup panel and the toolbar badge, providing you with immediate, actionable insight.
