# Value Proposition & Use Cases

## Understand the True Scope of Network Connections

uBO Scope empowers you with transparent visibility into **every remote server connection your browser attempts or completes**, cutting through the noise of content blockers and DNS-based filtering. By revealing which third-party servers your browser interacts with—whether connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked—uBO Scope gives you the confidence to truly understand your web privacy.

### Who Benefits Most?

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Track every external connection and identify hidden trackers lurking behind complex web pages.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Gain valuable insights into network request patterns, helping verify and improve filter lists across multiple environments.
- **Security Auditors & Researchers:** Audit third-party network activity effortlessly, even on devices where traditional browser tools are limited.


## Why uBO Scope Matters

### Reveal Hidden and Stealth Tracker Activity

Even well-configured content blockers can miss subtle or stealthy third-party connections. uBO Scope exposes these connections, showing you precisely which third-party domains are:

- Allowed (loaded successfully)
- Stealth-blocked (requests blocked without the page being explicitly aware)
- Fully blocked (requests completely stopped)

This clarity helps you understand who is really tracking you and whether your content blockers perform as expected.

### Validate Content Blocker Effectiveness Beyond Block Counts

Common misconceptions about content blockers rely on superficial metrics like block counts or results from ad blocker test pages, which can be misleading or inaccurate. uBO Scope goes beyond these myths by focusing on **the number of distinct third-party domains connected**, which is the true indicator of tracking exposure. 

Lower distinct third-party connections mean better privacy — a critical insight you cannot get from block counts alone.

### Real-World Use Case Examples

- While browsing a news website, you notice dozens of third-party domains connecting behind the scenes. uBO Scope's categorized listing helps you spot non-essential trackers and advertising networks.
- As a filter list maintainer, you use uBO Scope to test the impact of new filter rules, observing live network outcomes across domains and spotting stealth bypasses.
- Security researchers auditing enterprise environments validate privacy compliance by confirming which third-party servers are contacted during typical browsing sessions.

## Benefits in Your Hands

- **Full Transparency:** uBO Scope captures network requests regardless of whether they are blocked by extensions, DNS filtering, or browser settings.
- **Enhanced Privacy Control:** Identify and focus on reducing connections to unwanted third parties.
- **Actionable Insights:** Filter list maintainers get data essential for refining lists outside typical developer tool environments.
- **Cross-Platform Utility:** Works on all major browsers supporting `webRequest` API, ensuring consistent auditing capabilities.
