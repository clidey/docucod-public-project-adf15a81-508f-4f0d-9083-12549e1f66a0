# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlocking the True Picture of Remote Connections

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to offer unparalleled transparency into your web browsing’s network activity. It reveals **every connection attempt—whether allowed, blocked, or stealthy—to remote servers** initiated by websites you visit. By tapping directly into the browser’s `webRequest` API, uBO Scope exposes the actual network requests processed by your browser, independent of any content blocking measures currently active.

### Why This Matters to You

Modern browsers often interact with dozens of third-party servers in the background, sometimes invisibly. Understanding exactly which servers are contacted—and whether those connections are permitted or blocked—empowers you to:  

- Assess the **real-world impact** of your content blocking tools.
- Detect **unexpected or stealthy connections** that might affect privacy or security.
- Make **data-driven decisions** about your browsing hygiene rather than relying on guesswork or misleading test sites.

### What uBO Scope Does

- **Tracks all network requests** initiated by active browser tabs, including those redirected, successfully completed, or blocked.
- **Differentiates connection outcomes** into three clear categories:
  - **Allowed:** Connections successfully made to remote servers.
  - **Blocked:** Connections prevented by your content blocker or browser.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Connections that were redirected or otherwise stealthily blocked.
- **Counts unique third-party servers connected per tab**, offering an immediate badge indicator on the browser toolbar to help you gauge network exposure.

### How uBO Scope Works Under the Hood (User-Focused Overview)

Rather than diving into technical backend details, here’s what uBO Scope’s operation means for you as a user:

- It **listens continuously to network events** your browser reports, logging details like hostnames and connection results.
- It **aggregates these events per browser tab**, building an ongoing picture of server connections as you browse.
- The extension **updates a visible badge count** on its icon that represents the number of unique third-party domains contacted—helping you quickly evaluate the level of external connections on any site.
- You can **open the extension’s popup to get granular, categorized lists** of all domains contacted, separated by outcome, enabling detailed inspection.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

- **Content blocker agnostic:** It reveals network requests regardless of which blocking tools or DNS filters are active, as long as the browser reports them.
- **True connection visibility:** Unlike simulated or fabricated tests, uBO Scope monitors **actual web traffic** happening in real user browsing sessions.
- **Focus on distinct server counts:** The badge emphasizes **unique third-party servers contacted**, providing a meaningful metric often overlooked by other tools.

## Concrete Example: Tracking Connections on a News Website

Imagine visiting a popular news website. uBO Scope silently tracks every network request:

1. It sees that the main site’s domain is loaded (e.g., `news.com`).
2. It notices connections to the primary content delivery network (CDN) of the site.
3. It detects that a known advertising server connection was **blocked** by your content blocker.
4. It flags stealthy redirects that tried to bypass blocking.
5. It updates its badge to show you exactly how many **distinct third-party servers** your browser connected to during this visit.

With this visibility, you understand precisely what’s happening behind the scenes, far better than generic "ad blocker test" websites or vague block counts.

## Key Benefits

- **Complete transparency** into network activity.
- Ability to **verify your content blockers' effectiveness** with real data.
- Identify and monitor **unexpected server connections**.
- A quick, intuitive badge indicator with detailed inspection on demand.

## Getting Started

To begin, simply install uBO Scope from your browser’s extension store. Upon visiting websites, watch the badge update to reflect your network interactions and open the popup for detailed breakdowns.

*Note: uBO Scope depends on the browser’s `webRequest` API. Connections not reported by this API (such as some internal or privileged requests) will not be visible via the extension.*
