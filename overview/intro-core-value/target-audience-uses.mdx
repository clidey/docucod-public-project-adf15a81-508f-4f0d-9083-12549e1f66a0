# Who Is uBO Scope For?

Understanding who benefits most from uBO Scope helps you see why this extension is uniquely valuable. Whether you're a security-minded individual wanting greater transparency, a filter list maintainer needing real network data, or a privacy researcher trying to decode complex web requests, uBO Scope delivers actionable insights into your browsing connections.

## Introduction: Identifying Your Needs

If you've ever felt uneasy about third-party connections loading invisibly in your browser, or if you maintain adblock filter lists and need real-world feedback on remote connections, then uBO Scope is designed for you. It reveals the full picture of every network request a webpage attempts — not just the allowed ones, but also those stealthily blocked or outright blocked by your content blocker.

This clarity empowers you to understand, analyze, and respond to the third-party infrastructure influencing your web experience.

## Primary User Groups and Their Objectives

### 1. Security-Conscious Users

**Goal:** Know exactly which remote servers any visited webpage connects to.

**Challenges:** Modern web browsing involves many hidden third-party requests — some necessary, some intrusive or dangerous. Typical content blockers might display incomplete or misleading information.

**How uBO Scope Helps:**
- Displays all remote server connections attempted by any webpage.
- Differentiates between connections that are allowed, stealth-blocked (blocked invisibly to the webpage), or blocked outright.
- Provides domain-level detail so you can identify each connection’s source and potential purpose.


### 2. Filter List Maintainers

**Goal:** Obtain precise, real-time data about which third-party domains webpages actually contact.

**Challenges:** Filter lists need to target domains based on real usage patterns, but without detailed telemetry, maintainers rely heavily on assumptions or incomplete testing.

**How uBO Scope Helps:**
- Acts as a practical data source for maintainers, especially on devices or environments where traditional browser tools aren’t accessible.
- Helps verify which third-party connections occur and assess the effectiveness of blocking rules.
- Upcoming features aim to provide even deeper detail to assist list refinement.


### 3. Researchers and Privacy Advocates

**Goal:** Analyze how different webpages behave with respect to external network activities.

**Challenges:** Without transparency tools, understanding invisible third-party activities and verifying privacy claims is difficult.

**How uBO Scope Helps:**
- Reveals the behavior of webpages irrespective of the content blocker in use.
- Supports debunking myths about content blockers by showing real network traffic.
- Can track complex scenarios where multiple blocking layers (DNS, extension) interplay.


### 4. Everyday Users Curious About Their Network Activity

**Goal:** Gain a clear, easy-to-understand overview of what kinds of servers their browser talks to.

**Challenges:** Network requests often go unseen, leaving users puzzled about unexpected data connections.

**How uBO Scope Helps:**
- Provides a simple popup dashboard showcasing the number and identity of connected domains.
- Offers visual feedback on the status of each connection category.
- Enhances trust and control over one’s browsing experience.

## Real-World Scenarios Where uBO Scope Shines

- **Verifying Content Blocker Effectiveness:** Instead of guessing which connections get blocked on your browser, see a true count of distinct third-party servers still contacted.
- **Investigating Suspicious Webpage Behavior:** Identify rogue or unexpected remote servers that might track you or inject content.
- **Improving Filter Lists:** Get concrete data to optimize filter lists by targeting only actually contacted third parties.
- **Educating Privacy Newcomers:** Help friends or team members understand hidden web connections via tangible examples.

## Summary

uBO Scope is built for anyone who wants undeniable insight into the network activity happening behind webpages. It empowers security-conscious users with clarity, helps filter maintainers optimize protections, and provides researchers with an honest lens into internet communications.

## Practical Tips

- Use the extension alongside your regular content blocker to verify what truly gets blocked or allowed.
- Regularly check the popup dashboard to monitor third-party domains connected during your browsing sessions.
- For filter list maintainers, watch for updates as uBO Scope will evolve to offer advanced analysis tools.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t rely solely on third-party block counts from your content blocker; instead, use uBO Scope's count of distinct connected domains for a more accurate assessment.
- Avoid trusting "ad blocker test" sites uncritically, which often don’t represent real-world requests; uBO Scope shows actual network activity regardless.
