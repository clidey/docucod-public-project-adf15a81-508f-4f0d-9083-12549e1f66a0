# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover the Network Activity Behind Every Webpage

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension built to bring transparency to the hidden connections your browser makes when loading webpages. It reveals every attempt — whether allowed, stealthily blocked, or outright denied — to connect to remote servers as a webpage loads and runs.

### Why This Matters
When you browse the web, tens or hundreds of network requests often happen behind the scenes, connecting to various servers fetching resources like ads, analytics, content delivery, and more. uBO Scope's primary mission is to **make all these connections visible and quantifiable**, empowering you to understand your web traffic independently of any content blocker you use.

### Key Benefits
- **Visibility Into Network Requests:** See all third-party servers your browser communicates with—attempts, successes, or blocks.
- **Independent of Content Blockers:** Works alongside any content blocking tool to report actual network activity.
- **Actionable Details:** Quickly identify which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or explicitly blocked on a per-tab basis.
- **Real-Time Updates:** The extension’s badge dynamically shows the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.

### Who Will Find uBO Scope Valuable?
If you’re a privacy-conscious Web user, researcher, filter-list maintainer, or a power user curious about what your browser does behind the scenes, uBO Scope provides reliable insight into your network connections.

## What is uBO Scope?

Simply put, uBO Scope is a companion extension to uBlock Origin designed to measure and report network connections initiated during webpage loads. It listens to all network requests your browser makes and organizes this data by tab, showing which remote servers were contacted and categorizing the results into allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked outcomes.

### The Problem It Solves
Content blockers often focus on blocking unwanted requests but give you little insight into what actually connects or attempts to connect. Because some blockers stealthily block requests, webpages and standard testing tools cannot reliably detect true network activity. uBO Scope fills this visibility gap, providing an accurate, browser-level view of all network connections, regardless of blocking method or list used.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?
- **Third-Party Distinction:** Counts and displays distinct third-party domains contacted, enabling clearer assessment of external connections.
- **Network-Level Reporting:** Utilizes the browser’s `webRequest` API to capture all network requests, whether blocked or allowed.
- **Stealth Blocking Awareness:** Detects stealth-blocked requests, shedding light on complex blocking behaviors.
- **Minimalist and Focused:** Stripped of unnecessary UI complexity to focus purely on revealing network connections.

## Core Features & Capabilities

### 1. Real-Time Network Request Monitoring
Monitors all outgoing network requests per browser tab using the `webRequest` API, including main page requests and all embedded resource loads.

### 2. Categorization of Connection Outcomes
Each request is tracked and categorized into one of three buckets:
- **Allowed:** Connections the browser successfully made.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections silently blocked by content blockers (hidden from webpage scripts).
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly denied.

### 3. Domain and Hostname Aggregation
Groups requests by their hostnames and resolves these into domains using the Public Suffix List, providing clear aggregation at a domain level to help identify third-party connections.

### 4. Toolbar Badge Count
Displays a badge on the browser toolbar icon representing the count of distinct third-party domains contacted on the current tab, giving an at-a-glance indicator of network footprint.

### 5. Popup Dashboard
Provides a clean dashboard accessible from the toolbar icon with detailed breakdowns of all domains and counts grouped by outcome (allowed, stealth, blocked). Domain names are displayed using Unicode for readability.

### 6. Resilient Session Management
Maintains tracked data across tabs efficiently using browser storage, cleaning data when tabs are closed.

## Why Use uBO Scope? Understanding Its Value

Using uBO Scope elevates your understanding of hidden web activity and enhances your privacy strategy:

- **Verify and Cross-Check Content Blockers:** Don’t rely on blockers’ reported counts or unofficial tests; uBO Scope shows *actual* network connections.
- **Detect Leakages:** Identify unauthorized or unintentional data connections happening behind the scenes.
- **Filter List Testing and Development:** Filter maintainers can validate if rules effectively prevent unwanted domains from connecting.
- **Educate Users on Web Complexity:** Reveal the surprisingly large number of third-party connections most webpages initiate.

#### Typical Use Cases
- Checking third-party network access on privacy-sensitive sites.
- Auditing the effectiveness of multiple content blockers side-by-side.
- Researching stealth blocking behavior and its impact on user privacy.
- Tool for advanced users to monitor real-time network activity on open tabs.

#### Before and After Using uBO Scope
| Without uBO Scope | With uBO Scope |
|-|-|
| Blind to network requests behind blockers | Clear, actionable insight into network requests | 
| Reliance on claimed block counts which can mislead | Accurate distinct third-party domain counts visible | 
| No awareness of stealth blocking impact | Visibility into stealth-blocked requests |

## Getting Started with uBO Scope

Using uBO Scope is straightforward:

### Step 1: Install the Extension
Available for Chromium-based browsers and Firefox via their respective stores. For example,
- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

### Step 2: Observe the Toolbar Badge
When you browse, notice the badge indicating the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.

### Step 3: Open the Popup Dashboard
Click the toolbar icon to display detailed breakdowns of:
- Total domains connected
- Domains allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked

### Step 4: Review and Analyze
Use this data to make informed decisions about your privacy setup or for research purposes.

## Pro Tips & Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope alongside your primary content blocker, not as a replacement.
- Interpret a **lower badge count** as a generally positive sign—fewer third-party connections.
- Pay special attention to stealth-blocked domains to understand what your blocker handles silently.
- Refresh tabs after changing content blocking settings to see updated reports.
- For filter maintainers, repeated network domain attempts can indicate rules needing improvement.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

**Q: Why don’t I see any data for some tabs?**
> A: uBO Scope depends on browser tabs being active and the page network activity being trackable via webRequest API. Some pages (e.g., internal browser pages) or extensions’ own requests might not be reported.

**Q: Badge count shows zero but I know network activity occurred?**
> A: The badge reflects distinct third-party domains contacted, filtered by the tab. First-party domains or internal requests may not increase this count.

**Q: Does uBO Scope block anything?**
> A: No, uBO Scope only measures and reports network activity. Use it alongside blockers that manage filtering.

# Example: Reading the Popup Dashboard Contents

When you open the uBO Scope extension popup on an active tab, you’ll see:

- The main hostname and domain of the page you’re viewing
- A summary showing total distinct domains connected
- Three sections labeled:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains where connections succeeded
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections silently blocked, invisible to the webpage
  - **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked connections

Each domain listed shows the number of requests made.

```html
<section class="outcome allowed">
  <h3>not blocked</h3>
  <div class="domains">
    <div class="row"><span class="domain">cdn.example.com</span><span class="count badge">15</span></div>
  </div>
</section>
```

This intuitive display helps you identify where your browser is networking in real-time.
