# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlock Transparency Into Web Connections

uBO Scope is a privacy-focused browser extension designed to provide crystal-clear visibility into all third-party connections that occur when you visit a webpage. It reveals every remote server your browser attempts to reach or successfully connects with, enabling you to understand the true network activity behind the scenes — regardless of any content blockers or DNS filters you might already be using.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **See Every Third-Party Connection:** Learn exactly which external servers websites contact, not just what your adblocker or firewall blocks.
- **Independent of Blockers:** Connection data is reported independently of content blockers or DNS filters, offering unbiased transparency.
- **Privacy-Centric Insight:** Discover hidden trackers, analytics, or third-party services that might not be obvious from just browsing.
- **Supports Filter List Maintainers:** Provides granular connection details to help maintain effective content blocking lists.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Works with popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari that support the `webRequest` API.

### Who Benefits From This Page?

This page is crafted for anyone curious about what happens behind the scenes when they browse the web—privacy-conscious users, developers, content blocking enthusiasts, and filter list maintainers seeking accurate insights into network requests.

## What Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a simple, yet powerful browser extension that listens to your browser's network activity and reports every attempted or successful connection to third-party remote servers. Using the browser’s `webRequest` API, it captures network requests made by webpages, categorizes them, and presents this information in an easily digestible format.

Its mission is to remove mystery from the invisible network traffic that websites generate, empowering you with complete transparency.

### Core Purpose

When you surf the web, browsers automatically establish many connections to remote servers — some necessary, some for ads, trackers, or analytics, and some possibly unwanted. While many tools block some connections, uBO Scope reveals each and every connection attempt, regardless of what your blockers do.

This empowers you to:

- Identify which third-party domains your current visited page connects to.
- Understand which connections are allowed, stealth-blocked (redirected or subtly blocked), or outright blocked.
- Gain evidence-based insight rather than relying on assumed block counts or misleading tests.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

- **Neutral and Comprehensive:** Unlike content blockers that reveal only what they block or allow, uBO Scope reports all connection attempts, unbiased by any blockers.
- **Independence from Content Blockers:** It works alongside blockers and DNS filters without interference.
- **Counts Connected Remote Servers:** The toolbar icon badge displays the distinct number of connected third-party domains, a key indicator of privacy exposure.

### How It Works, Simply Explained

Behind the scenes, uBO Scope hooks into the browser’s network request lifecycle events through the `webRequest` API. It records every network request event, such as redirects, errors, and successes, tracking which server was contacted and the outcome of that request.

Connections are grouped by domains and categorized as:

- **Allowed:** Requests that succeeded.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that were redirected or blocked in less obvious ways.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed or were explicitly blocked.

The extension updates its data per browser tab and shows the count of unique allowed third-party domains on the toolbar badge.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### 1. Real-Time Visibility of Third-Party Connections

uBO Scope captures network requests as you browse and immediately reports the connected third-party domains, providing you with actionable insight.

### 2. Outcome Categorization

- **Allowed connections:** Servers successfully contacted by the page.
- **Stealth Blocking:** Redirected or altered requests that attempt to evade detection.
- **Blocked connections:** Failed or prevented requests.

This helps differentiate between invisible or subtle tracking and explicit blocking.

### 3. Toolbar Badge with Live Count

The extension's toolbar icon displays the number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections for the active tab. A lower number here indicates more effective blocking and reduced exposure.

### 4. Works Regardless of Content Blockers

Because it listens directly to the browser’s network events, uBO Scope can report connections regardless of which blockers or DNS filters are active, as long as the network traffic goes through the `webRequest` API.

### 5. Unicode Domain Handling

Utilizes Punycode to decode internationalized domain names, showing you domain names in a human-readable format.

### 6. Session Persistence

Tracks and saves connection data across tabs during your browsing session for continuity.

## Why Should I Care?

### Understand Your Exposure

Most users have no clear visibility into what remote servers their browser is contacting silently. uBO Scope exposes this data, helping you:

- Spot potential trackers or unnecessary third-party services
- Validate the effectiveness of your current content blockers
- Make informed decisions to improve your online privacy

### Debunk Mythical Metrics

uBO Scope sheds light on common misconceptions, such as:

- A higher block count doesn’t always mean better privacy.
- Block counts can be misleading if more connections are allowed in the background.
- Popular "ad blocker test" websites often simulate unrealistic conditions that don’t reflect real browsing.

### Real-World Use Cases

- **Privacy Enthusiasts:** Verify which third-party domains are accessed and gauge your overall exposure.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Get data-driven insights to refine blocking lists effectively.
- **Developers & Analysts:** Understand third-party loads affecting websites you build or audit.

### Before & After uBO Scope

Without uBO Scope: You only guess or rely on your blocker’s statistics without knowing the actual distinct remote servers touched.

With uBO Scope: You see exactly how many and which third-party domains are contacted, giving you clear insight and peace of mind.

## Getting Started Preview

Ready to explore the connections your browser makes?

### Quick Start

- Install uBO Scope from your browser’s official extension store.
- When you visit any webpage, open the uBO Scope popup to see the domains connected.
- View categories showing allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Watch the toolbar badge for a quick privacy snapshot.

### Prerequisites

- A supported browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) with `webRequest` API support.
- Basic knowledge of browser extensions and permissions.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Lower Toolbar Badge Is Better:** Aim to have fewer third-party domains connected to reduce privacy risks.
- **Check Stealth-Blocked Domains:** These sometimes indicate trackers that try to evade detection through redirects.
- **Use in Tandem with Your Blocker:** Combine uBO Scope with your favorite content blocker to analyze and optimize protection.
- **Validate Before Trusting Tests:** Use uBO Scope as an objective tool over misleading "ad blocker test" sites.

## Troubleshooting

- If no data appears, ensure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions and your browser supports the `webRequest` API.
- Keep in mind that some network requests outside the browser's API scope (e.g., low-level socket operations) won't be visible.
