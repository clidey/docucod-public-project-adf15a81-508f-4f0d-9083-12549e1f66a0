# Core Purpose & Use Cases of uBO Scope

## Unveiling the True Network Behavior of Webpages

uBO Scope serves a precise and critical purpose: it provides **accurate, unbiased measurement of every network request made by your browser**, no matter what content blocker is currently active or how it operates. This transparency at the browser level enables users, privacy advocates, and filter list maintainers to **see beyond the obscured network activity** that typical blockers or testing tools cannot reveal.

### Why This Matters

With the increasing complexity of web content delivery, many webpages connect silently to numerous third-party servers, often without users' awareness. Content blockers try to limit these connections, but evaluating their effectiveness or uncovering hidden connections is challenging:

- Third-party servers may be stealth-blocked or obfuscated
- Content blockers differ greatly in how they report blocking
- Browser APIs and DNS-based blocking add layers of complexity
- Common assessment tools, like “ad blocker test” pages, use artificial scenarios


## What uBO Scope Enables You to Do

### 1. Evaluate Third-Party Exposure on Any Webpage

Using uBO Scope, you can inspect **all distinct remote servers** your browser attempts to reach when loading a webpage. This empowers you to understand precisely which third parties your browsing activity touches, regardless of content blocking layers.

For example, on a news site, uBO Scope reveals which advertising, analytics, or CDN domains actually connect, helping you grasp potential privacy risks.

### 2. Verify Content Blockers’ Actual Effectiveness

Many users make mistaken conclusions based on toolbar badge counts of blockers, assuming higher block counts mean better protection. uBO Scope debunks this:

- It reveals **which requests were truly allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked**.
- It shows the **number of unique third-party domains allowed**, which is the **more important privacy indicator**.

You can compare your content blocker’s blocking behavior against uBO Scope’s precise measurements to uncover misleading metrics.

### 3. Debunk Misleading Metrics and Common Myths

Many so-called "ad blocker test" webpages fail to provide realistic or comprehensive assessments. uBO Scope:

- Shows real network behavior instead of synthetic test requests.
- Demonstrates why high block counts can mask allowing connections to many more domains.
- Highlights the stealthy blocking approaches some content blockers employ that standard webpages cannot detect.

### 4. Support Filter List Maintainers, Especially on Constrained Devices

Filter list maintainers can use uBO Scope to reliably study network requests without needing heavyweight browser or developer tools. This is especially beneficial on devices that:

- Have limited developer tool access (e.g., mobile or locked-down environments).
- Require clear, session-based connection data for refinement of filter lists.

The extension's session persistence and domain summaries make it a lightweight yet powerful companion in this workflow.

## Real-World Scenarios

Consider the following typical user workflows where uBO Scope proves indispensable:

### Scenario A: Privacy-Conscious User Scrutinizing a Social Media Page

- User installs uBO Scope alongside their content blocker.
- Upon visiting the social media site, they open uBO Scope’s popup.
- They see a detailed categorized list of connected domains: allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked.
- Noticing unexpected allowed connections, the user investigates further or adjusts their blocker.

### Scenario B: Content Blocker Researcher Comparing Filter Lists

- Researcher wants to objectively assess the difference between two popular content blockers.
- They simultaneously run each blocker and visit the same set of pages.
- Using uBO Scope, they gather data on distinct third-party domains actually connected per blocker.
- Data reveals surprising trends where higher block counts correlate with more connections, clarifying true efficacy.

### Scenario C: Filter List Maintainer Working on Mobile Device

- Maintainer accesses a command website on a constrained tablet.
- Using uBO Scope, they capture all network connections in an easily digestible form.
- They export or record domain lists for offline filter list tuning and validation.

## What You Will See in uBO Scope

- **Domains Connected Count:** Total unique domains connected, displayed prominently.
- **Categorized Domains:**
  - *Allowed:* Requests permitted by the content blocker.
  - *Stealth-Blocked:* Connections silently redirected or hidden.
  - *Blocked:* Requests explicitly blocked.

Each category clearly reveals the state of each remote domain interaction, enabling precise privacy assessment.

## Best Practices for Using uBO Scope

- Always refresh the page after installing or configuring content blockers to get accurate session data.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your blocker’s native UI but interpret badges with uBO Scope insights.
- Avoid relying on third-party "ad blocker test" sites; trust uBO Scope’s real network data.
- For filter list maintainers, leverage the domain lists per category to identify needed filter updates.

## Common Pitfalls Avoided by uBO Scope

- Misinterpreting block badge counts as an indicator of privacy.
- Relying on artificial test pages that do not reflect real-world network activity.
- Overlooking stealth blocking methods that evade detection by webpages.
- Assuming no network requests equals full blocking — uBO Scope reveals even hidden or redirected attempts.

## Summary

uBO Scope is your **transparent lens** into the true behavior of network requests originating from your browser. It complements content blockers, reveals hidden activity, and equips users and maintainers with reliable, **real-world data** that cuts through assumptions and misleading metrics.

By providing session-based, categorized domain visibility unaffected by blocking method or stealth techniques, uBO Scope empowers users to take full control over their browsing privacy and security.

<Tip>
Learn to interpret the distinct domain lists (allowed, stealth, blocked) in the popup for actionable insights about your network exposure.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Do not rely solely on the content blocker badge count; use uBO Scope for an accurate picture of connected third parties.
</Warning>

<Check>
Check that your browser supports the `webRequest` API with your content blocker to ensure uBO Scope delivers accurate data.
