# Why Use uBO Scope?

Discover how uBO Scope reveals the full picture of your web browsing connections, going beyond what traditional content blockers show. This page explains why the badge count on the uBO Scope toolbar icon truly matters — it reflects the number of distinct third-party servers that your browser attempts to connect to, whether these connections succeed or are blocked. Understanding this empowers you to better judge your privacy, security, and the real effectiveness of any content blockers you use.

## See the True Landscape of Third-Party Connections

Webpages today rarely operate in isolation. Behind every site you visit, multiple third-party servers might be contacted — for analytics, ads, content delivery, social widgets, tracking, or other services. While most content blockers report the number of blocked connections, this can be misleading. A high block count doesn’t always mean better protection; it could actually mean that more unwanted connections are attempted.

uBO Scope shifts the focus from just blocking activity to exposing the full scope of network requests - both attempted and successful. The badge number shows how many unique third-party domains your browser interacts with during your visit. This transparency lets you:

- Understand the **actual diversity** of third parties involved, not just those blocked.
- See the **attempted connections**, even if blocked by other means.
- Recognize **stealth blocking** activities by examining domains that triggered redirects or errors.


## What the Badge Count Represents

Unlike simple block counters, uBO Scope's badge count reflects the **distinct number of third-party domains where a connection was attempted or succeeded**. It includes:

- Domains with **allowed connections** — resources that were successfully fetched.
- Domains with **stealth-blocked connections** — attempts halted silently via redirects or maneuvers.
- Domains with **blocked connections** — requests explicitly blocked by network or browser controls.

This approach is grounded in real network activity reported by the browser's `webRequest` API, giving you an unemotional, factual view of which third parties are trying to engage with the site you are browsing.


## How This Enhances Security and Privacy Awareness

Knowing the number of distinct third-party connections paints a clearer picture of your exposure and security risks:

- **Assess your real privacy footprint**: Few distinct external domains typically indicate fewer tracking and data-sharing points.
- **Detect hidden or stealthy trackers**: Domains involved with redirects or stealth blocking point to more subtle tracking attempts.
- **Avoid being misled by superficial block counts**: High block counts that come with an increasing number of allowed third parties mean your privacy might be compromised despite what block counts imply.

By understanding both what was blocked and what was allowed or attempted, you gain a better sense of your browser’s protective efficacy.


## Why Traditional Content Blocker Metrics Can Be Misleading

Many content blockers publish block counts or blocked request lists as proof of effectiveness. However, these numbers alone can be deceptive:

- A **higher block count** can sometimes indicate more overall third-party connections being made—not fewer.
- Some blockers engage in **stealth blocking**, where requests are redirected or silently prevented, invisible to 'ad blocker test' pages.
- Fabricated or synthetic 'ad blocker test' webpages often do not reflect real-world behavior and can misrepresent blocker performance.

uBO Scope avoids these pitfalls by counting distinct third-party domains based on actual network requests, regardless of the content blocker's method.


## Real-World Examples of uBO Scope’s Value

Imagine you visit a news website. The badge count shows 5 unique third-party domains. However, your content blocker’s block count is high. With uBO Scope, you’ll see:

- Exactly which domains were contacted and their connection outcomes (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).
- If stealth-blocking was involved, domains might appear under a different category, alerting you to hidden requests.
- How many distinct third-party entities truly received your data or content requests.

This empowers you to:

- Verify the efficiency of your content blocker.
- Adjust your privacy settings or switch blockers based on factual data.
- Gain deeper insight than what typical content blocker test pages can provide.


## Practical Tip

**Focus on lowering the badge count** on the uBO Scope toolbar. Fewer distinct third-party connections mean less exposure. However, don’t rely solely on block counts or simplistic metrics from other blockers — uBO Scope highlights what truly matters.
