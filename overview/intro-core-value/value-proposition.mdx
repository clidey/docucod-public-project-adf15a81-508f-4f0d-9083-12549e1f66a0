# Why Use uBO Scope?

Understanding the true scope of your browser's network connections is essential for maintaining privacy, security, and control over your browsing experience. uBO Scope offers a clear window into the complex web of third-party remote servers that webpages interact with—far beyond simple block/allow indicators.

## See Beyond Block/Allow: Reveal the Hidden Network Reality

Most content blockers display only binary block or allow results. However, this simplistic view often masks what's really happening in the background. Many network requests may be "stealth-blocked," redirected, or otherwise manipulated without your direct knowledge.

uBO Scope exposes these nuances by tracking the outcome of **all** remote server connections attempted during page loads. It categorizes them into three clear groups:

- **Allowed connections:** Third-party servers your browser successfully communicated with and fetched resources from.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Requests that were silently redirected or blocked in ways that are not obvious to typical tools.
- **Blocked connections:** Requests that were explicitly blocked and failed to complete.

This clear categorization helps you understand what your content blocker permits, what it intercepts covertly, and what is outright denied.

## The Badge Count Tells the True Story

The badge on the uBO Scope toolbar icon represents the **number of distinct third-party remote domains your browser connected to** successfully for the active tab. In other words, it reflects the count of external servers your browsing session truly depended upon.

This count is more meaningful than just a tally of blocked or allowed requests since it reveals the **actual remote surface exposed by each webpage**.

> A **lower badge count** is a **better indicator** of stricter content blocking or fewer third-party dependencies, while a higher count often means more potential tracking or content exposure.

## Why Visibility Into Third-Party Connections Matters

### Privacy
Webpages often rely on third-party trackers, ads, and analytics hosted on multiple domains. Without tools like uBO Scope, you cannot easily see how many of these remote domains load resources silently, evading your block lists.

Knowing exactly which domains are contacted can help you:

- Identify excessive or suspicious third-party connections.
- Tune your filtering rules to enhance your privacy.
- Understand the true exposure of your browsing data.

### Security
Third-party connections might lead to malicious servers or unexpected redirects. uBO Scope’s visibility into network request outcomes helps you spot unusual or unauthorized connections that could pose security risks.

### Content Blocking Evaluation
Many users mistakenly judge content blockers by the number of blocks reported, but this number is misleading. uBO Scope allows you to evaluate the effectiveness of content blocking based on the real number of **allowed connections** to third-party domains, instead of just block counts.

## Debunking Common Myths with uBO Scope

### Myth: "A higher block count means better blocking."

uBO Scope clarifies that a higher block count can coexist with more allowed third-party connections. Thus, a blocker showing many blocks but allowing many distinct third-party connections may be **less effective** at protecting your privacy.

### Myth: "Ad blocker test pages show reliable content blocking results."

Such pages often generate artificial requests and fail to account for stealth blocking methods. uBO Scope reveals the real network behaviors across all browsing contexts.

## Real-World Scenarios You’ll Benefit From

- **Filter List Maintenance:** Inspect which domains are truly contacted and refine your lists to target unnecessary third parties.
- **Privacy-Conscious Browsing:** Observe the exact domains your current content blocker allows through.
- **Security Audits:** Detect suspicious or unexpected remote connections linked to tracking or malware.

## How To Use This Page’s Insights

1. Install uBO Scope from your browser’s official extension store.
2. Browse websites and watch the badge count on the toolbar icon.
3. Open the popup to see detailed breakdowns of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains.
4. Use this information to decide if your content blocking setup matches your privacy and security needs.

<Tip>
Remember, not all third-party connections are harmful—many are content delivery networks (CDNs) essential for website performance. However, knowing exactly who you connect to empowers smarter decisions.
</Tip>

<Note>
uBO Scope tracks network requests reported via the browser’s webRequest API, including those blocked at DNS or by other content blockers. However, connections outside this API’s scope (e.g., some browser-native requests) are not visible.
</Note>

### Practical Tips

- Use the badge count to quickly gauge the third-party exposure on any tab.
- Explore the popup’s domain lists to identify frequent or suspicious domains.
- Combine uBO Scope with your existing content blocker to enhance monitoring.
- Avoid relying solely on block counts from content blockers to assess their effectiveness; check actual allowed connections.

### Common Pitfalls

- Missing the distinction between counted requests and allowed unique third-party servers leads to false assumptions.
- Trusting ad blocker test sites as reliable benchmarks can lead to misunderstanding.
