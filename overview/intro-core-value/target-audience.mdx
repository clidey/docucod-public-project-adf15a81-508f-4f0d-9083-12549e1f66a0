# Who is it For?

Discover how uBO Scope uniquely serves a diverse range of users by offering unparalleled visibility into your browser’s third-party network activity. Whether you prioritize privacy, maintain filter lists, or need transparency on limited-resource devices, this page details how uBO Scope addresses your needs with precision and clarity.

## Understanding uBO Scope’s Audience

uBO Scope is designed with privacy, transparency, and technical insight at its core. It surfaces all attempted and successful connections to third-party servers—regardless of your content blocker settings. This approach benefits three main audiences:

- **Privacy-Conscious Users** who want to see beyond standard metrics
- **Filter List Maintainers** who need precise, unbiased connection data
- **Users with Resource-Constrained Devices** where traditional tools may fall short

Let’s explore each audience and the use cases that make uBO Scope an indispensable companion.

## 1. Privacy-Conscious Users

If privacy is your priority, you want complete and honest insight into your browser’s network traffic. Most content blockers provide counts of blocked connections but don’t give a full picture of:

- Which third-party domains your browser actively contacts,
- Which connections were blocked stealthily,
- Whether connections were allowed or failed.

uBO Scope reveals all these outcomes transparently in its popup and toolbar badge count. This empowers you to:

- Measure the true number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted,
- Understand stealth-blocked connections that evade traditional block reporting,
- Avoid common misconceptions based on block counts alone.

> **Scenario**: You install a new ad blocker and notice a higher block count. With uBO Scope, you discover this blocker actually allows more unique third-party connections than your previous one—crucial knowledge for protecting your privacy.

## 2. Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining reliable filter lists requires precise data about network requests regardless of the blocking method or the environment. uBO Scope provides:

- Accurate reporting of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked third-party domains,
- Visibility into network request outcomes regardless of the filter engine or DNS-level blocking,
- A simple, consistent interface that works on browsers even on devices with limited access to developer tools.

This transparency aids in curating and verifying filter lists by exposing which connections are genuinely blocked versus those that go unnoticed.

> **Scenario**: While refining a filter list, a maintainer uses uBO Scope to detect stealth-blocked requests that do not cause increment in traditional block counters, ensuring the list addresses all real third-party requests.

---

## 3. Users on Resource-Constrained or Restricted Devices

On some devices, especially mobile or minimal setups, access to deep browser debugging or extension internals is limited. uBO Scope bridges this gap by:

- Leveraging the browser's `webRequest` API to report all connection attempts transparently,
- Providing a lightweight but comprehensive summary of third-party network activity without complex setup,
- Enabling visibility even when other content blockers or DNS filters are operational but opaque.

> **Scenario**: A user on a low-power device can monitor third-party connections without taxing system resources, making informed decisions about privacy and performance.

---

## Why uBO Scope Matters for These Audiences

- **Truth over Metrics**: uBO Scope debunks common myths about blocker efficiency by focusing on unique third-party domains rather than raw block counts.
- **Comprehensive Visibility**: By showing allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked outcomes, it paints a true picture of web tracking and resource downloading.
- **Independence**: The extension reports network request outcomes regardless of which content blocker (if any) is active or how requests are blocked.
- **Simplicity and Accessibility**: The popup presents data clearly, making technical insights accessible to non-experts.

## How to Recognize Your Needs and Use uBO Scope Effectively

Whether you want to validate if your privacy tools work as expected, enhance filter lists with reliable data, or simply get transparency into your browsing, start by opening uBO Scope’s popup and observing:

- The number of distinct third-party domains contacted (badge count).
- The breakdown of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Frequency of connection attempts per domain to spot suspicious patterns.

This information helps you tailor your privacy setup or list maintenance workflow with confidence.

## Practical Tips for Getting the Most Out of uBO Scope

- Do not rely on the block count from content blockers alone; compare with uBO Scope’s domain counts to understand true connectivity.
- Use uBO Scope’s visibility to spot stealth-blocked connections, which might bypass detection in standard extension UIs.
- Combine uBO Scope data with your existing blocker logs to fine-tune filter lists and blocking strategies.

### Example: Understanding Your Active Tab’s Network Connections

When you activate the uBO Scope popup on your current browser tab, you instantly see:

- The total number of third-party domains your browser contacted during page load (badge count).
- Lists of domains categorized as:
  - `Not Blocked`: Actually connected domains.
  - `Stealth-Blocked`: Requests blocked silently by filters.
  - `Blocked`: Requests denied visibly or outright.

This immediate clarity helps you assess your privacy posture or debugging state without hunting through complex network logs.
