## Intended Audience

### Privacy-Conscious Users
If you care about your online privacy and want clear evidence about which third-party servers your browser connects to while visiting websites, uBO Scope puts the data directly at your fingertips. It strips away assumptions and guesses by reporting actual network requests and their outcomes, empowering you to:

- Learn which third parties are truly contacted on each page
- See in real time whether connections are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked
- Judge your content blocker’s behavior based on meaningful metrics instead of vague claims

### Security Researchers and Web Analysts
For researchers who require unbiased, comprehensive data on web connections, uBO Scope acts as a low-overhead, transparent tool to capture network activities independent of content blocking filters. Use it to:

- Analyze third-party exposure on any webpage
- Cross-verify the impact of different content blocker configurations
- Collect accurate data on network request outcomes for privacy audits

### Filter List Maintainers
Maintaining high-quality filter lists demands thorough testing and reliable evidence. uBO Scope assists maintainers by highlighting exact third-party domains contacted and whether connections are blocked or allowed. Key benefits include:

- Quick verification of filter list effectiveness
- Identification of stealth-blocked versus explicitly blocked domains
- Practical insights on real-world connection outcomes beyond simulated test scenarios

### Developers & Web Enthusiasts
