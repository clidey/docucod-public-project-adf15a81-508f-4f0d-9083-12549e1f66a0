## Target User Groups

### 1. Privacy-Minded Individuals

If you care deeply about your online privacy and want to know exactly which third-party servers your browser communicates with as you visit websites, uBO Scope delivers the transparency you need. It reveals every network connection—whether allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked—giving you concrete visibility into your digital footprint.

**Why you should care:**
- Verify that suspected trackers or unwanted domains are truly being blocked.
- Understand what legitimate third-party domains (like CDNs or essential services) are connected.
- Gain confidence about the real network exposure of your browsing activities.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers

Lists that block trackers, ads, and malicious content need continuous refinement. As a maintainer or contributor, you require precise tools to analyze network connections efficiently, especially when access to standard browser developer tools might be limited.

**Why you should care:**
- Quickly assess which third-party domains are actively connecting, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Optimize filter lists based on actual network behavior rather than guesswork.
- Plan improvements with insights directly derived from real browsing data.

### 3. General Users Curious About Extension Statistics

Many users rely on ad blockers and content filters but may be confused by the numbers displayed, such as block counts on extension badges that can be misleading.

**Why you should care:**
- Demystify confusing statistics by focusing on distinct third-party connections, not raw block counts.
- Debunk common myths about content blocker performance.
- Develop a more informed perspective on what content blockers do behind the scenes.

## Real-World Use Cases

uBO Scope is crafted to empower users through concrete scenarios that reveal insights beyond ordinary browser tools:

### Verifying Network Exposure
Imagine you want to confirm which third parties a website connects to. By monitoring allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections, you get an accurate picture of which external domains are contacted, removing guesswork.

### Evaluating Content Blocker Performance
Instead of blindly trusting block count badges, use uBO Scope to see how many distinct third-party servers have been successfully blocked or allowed. This gives a true measure of content blockers' effectiveness.

### Debunking Popular Ad Blocking Myths
Many believe a higher block count means better blocking. uBO Scope shows this is false by revealing that more blocks can coincide with connections to more unique third parties, meaning less effective blocking overall.

Furthermore, it warns users against relying on "ad blocker test" webpages, which often use unrealistic or fabricated network requests unsuitable as benchmarks.
