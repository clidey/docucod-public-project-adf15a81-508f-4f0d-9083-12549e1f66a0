# Key Terms and Concepts

Understanding uBO Scope depends on getting familiar with several core terms and concepts. These define how the extension gathers, categorizes, and presents data about the remote servers your browser interacts with. This page clarifies these foundational ideas, connecting them directly to the extension’s user interface and underlying features so you can confidently interpret what you see.

---

## Third-Party Remote Server

A **third-party remote server** refers to any server outside the primary domain of the webpage you are visiting. For example, if you are browsing `example.com` and your browser loads scripts or resources from `cdn.example.org` or `ads.network.com`, these are considered third parties. 

uBO Scope tracks connections to these servers to provide visibility into your web activity beyond the site you intentionally visit.

**Why this matters:** Identifying and counting third parties helps reveal your network footprint and potential exposure to tracking or unwanted connections.

---

## Outcome Categories: Allowed, Stealth, and Blocked

Every network request made by your browser falls into one of three categories according to uBO Scope’s observation and classification:

- **Allowed**: Requests to servers that completed successfully. These reflect connections your browser made where no blocking occurred.

- **Stealth-blocked (Stealth)**: Requests that were redirected silently, often hidden from normal interruption flows. This typically represents browsers or content blockers handling requests in a way that avoids detectable blocking events but prevents the resource from loading.

- **Blocked**: Requests known to have been actively blocked by content blockers or failed due to errors. These requests never completed reaching the server.

Understanding these categories helps you assess which third parties are effectively kept from loading and which are quietly bypassed or allowed.

---

## Public Suffix List (PSL)

The **Public Suffix List** is a robust database of domain name suffixes managed by the community at [publicsuffix.org](https://publicsuffix.org). It defines domain boundaries that determine where domain ownership ends and subdomains begin. 

For instance, `.com` is a public suffix, while `example.com` is a registered domain. Likewise, `.co.uk` is a public suffix, and `example.co.uk` is a registrable domain.

uBO Scope leverages the PSL to accurately parse hostnames and aggregate data at the correct domain level.

**What you get:** Meaningful grouping of connection data under domains users expect rather than raw hostnames, avoiding noise from subdomain proliferation.

---

## Badge Count

The **badge count** is a key indicator shown on the browser toolbar icon for uBO Scope. It displays:

> *The number of distinct third-party remote domains your browser connected to successfully in the current tab.*

This count emphasizes the breadth of your exposure to external domains. Contrary to typical block counters, a **lower badge count is better**, signaling fewer third-party connections and a smaller privacy footprint.

---

## How These Concepts Link to the UI

### Popup Panel

When you click the uBO Scope icon, the popup panel shows:

- The hostname of the active tab broken down into two parts: a subdomain portion (if any) and the main domain.
- A summary count of distinct connected domains.
- Three sections listing domains grouped by outcome:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
  - **Stealth-blocked**
  - **Blocked**

Each domain is shown alongside a count of individual requests made to it.

### Data Interpretation

- **Allowed domains** represent third parties your browser contacted without interference.
- **Stealth domains** are those requests managed invisibly by blockers or browser behaviors.
- **Blocked domains** show explicit blocking impact by your content blockers.

Together, these sections give you a practical, transparent view of your real-time network interactions.

## Practical Example

Imagine you visit a news website. The popup might show:

| Section        | Domains                 | Description                         |
|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Allowed        | `cdn.news.com`           | Assets loaded successfully         |
| Stealth        | `ads.network.com`        | Ads requests silently blocked     |
| Blocked        | `tracking.analytics.net` | Analytics requests explicitly blocked |

This overview helps you understand how many and which third parties are part of your browsing session and their filtering status.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Misinterpreting badge count:** The badge counts successful allowed connections only, not the total number of requests or blocked attempts. A high block count elsewhere does not mean a better blocker.
- **Confusing hostname and domain:** Hostnames often have multiple levels (e.g., `media.cdn.example.com`), but uBO Scope aggregates at the registrable domain level using the PSL (e.g., `example.com`).

---

## Tips to Maximize Value

- Use the popup to identify unexpected third parties contacting your browser.
- Watch for unusual stealth-blocked domains that might indicate hidden tracking.
- Leverage understanding of the PSL to appreciate why uBO Scope groups data under certain domains.
- Cross-reference badge count trends with your privacy settings to evaluate blocker effectiveness.
