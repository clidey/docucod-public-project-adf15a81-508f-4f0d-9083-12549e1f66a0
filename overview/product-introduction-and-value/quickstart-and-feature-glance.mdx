# Quick Feature Overview

Discovering uBO Scope's core features offers a clear window into how this extension empowers you to monitor and understand webpage network connections effortlessly. This page provides an essential snapshot of what you will interact with most frequently—allowing you to grasp key elements quickly before diving deeper.

## Distinct Server Connection Counts

At the heart of uBO Scope lies the badge count displayed on the browser's toolbar icon. This badge represents the **number of distinct third-party remote servers that a webpage has connected to during your browsing session**.

- **Why it matters:** This count helps you gauge the exposure of the webpage to external entities.
- **Benefit:** A lower number typically indicates fewer third parties contacted, often a sign of greater privacy.

Unlike simplistic block counts, this distinct server count uniquely reflects the *variety* of connections rather than just the quantity of blocked requests.


## Badge Behavior and Real-Time Updates

The badge dynamically updates in real-time based on network activities detected for the current tab.

- When you load or navigate a page, uBO Scope listens to network requests and adjusts the badge.
- The badge shows a number only if there are active, allowed third-party connections.
- The badge count resets as you move between tabs or reload pages, giving you an instant snapshot of network exposure per tab.


## Domain Categorization: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth-Blocked

uBO Scope distinctly classifies third-party domains involved in network requests into three categories, visible in its popup UI:

- **Allowed:** Domains from which connections were successfully established.
- **Blocked:** Domains whose connection attempts were explicitly blocked (e.g., by your content blocker).
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were intercepted or redirected in a way that conceals blocking details from the webpage, providing invisibility.

### How These Categories Help You

This categorization gives valuable transparency to understand:

- Which domains are actively loaded by the page.
- Which domains are blocked, preventing unwanted content.
- Where stealth blocking techniques affect network visibility.


## Popup UI: Detailed Data Visibility

Clicking the uBO Scope icon opens a concise popup interface that organizes domain information clearly:

- **Summary Section:** Shows the total count of connected domains.
- **Domain Lists:** Sorted lists show the domains under each category (allowed, stealth, blocked).
- Each domain entry includes a badge denoting the number of network requests observed.

For example, when visiting a complex webpage, the popup instantly reveals all third-party domains contacted and their connection outcomes.


## Setting the Scene for Exploration

This overview primes you to understand why uBO Scope offers unique insight beyond typical content blocking tools:

- The server count badge quantifies third-party exposure rather than mere block counts.
- The popup detailed view invites you to explore network activities per category.
- Categorizing domains by connection outcome surfaces nuanced network behaviors.

Together, these features enable you to **quickly assess and interpret the third-party footprint of any webpage**, making uBO Scope a vital tool for privacy-conscious browsing and informed content blocker evaluation.

## Practical Example: How These Features Work Together

Imagine you visit a news website:

1. The badge number updates to "5", indicating 5 distinct third-party servers contacted.
2. You open the popup and see:
   - **Allowed:** `cdn.example.com` (10 requests), `ads.example.org` (2 requests)
   - **Blocked:** `track.example.net` (3 requests)
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** `analytics.example.io` (1 request)
3. You immediately understand that the page loads content from 5 unique sources, but some trackers are blocked or stealth-blocked.

This insight helps you make informed decisions about your privacy and the effectiveness of your content blocker.

## Tips for Using This Page

- Refer to this overview when you first install uBO Scope to understand what the badge and popup display.
- Use the domain categories in the popup to investigate suspicious or unexpected connections.
- Remember, a lower badge count generally reflects fewer third-party connections—but always consider the context and role of each domain.
