# Value Proposition & Use Cases

## Unlock Clear Visibility into Webpage Network Connections

uBO Scope empowers you to precisely identify all remote servers a webpage attempts to connect to — whether those connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked by any content blocking measure. It cuts through misleading statistics and false assumptions, delivering direct insight into actual network exposure.

- **See all remote third-party connections made by webpages regardless of blocking method**
- **Distinguish between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections**
- **Debunk misleading claims about ad-blocker effectiveness**
- **Monitor third-party network activity even on browsers or platforms with limited developer tools**
- **Aid filter list maintainers with objective, real-world network data**

### Who Benefits Most
- **Privacy-conscious individuals** seeking factual transparency on the true extent of remote server connections
- **Filter list maintainers** requiring consistent, impartial data to improve and test blocking rules
- **Researchers and testers** comparing the effectiveness of different content blockers or setups
- **Users on limited platforms** where built-in browser tools are unavailable or insufficient for network analysis

## What Problem Does uBO Scope Solve?

Typical methods of measuring content blocker effectiveness — such as toolbar block counts or popular “ad-blocker test” webpages — provide incomplete or deceptive results. They fail to show whether a content blocker actually prevents connections to unique third-party servers, which is the meaningful measure of network exposure and privacy risk.

uBO Scope delivers an unvarnished report of remote connections initiated by webpages, regardless of which content blocker or DNS filter is active. By categorizing connections into those allowed through, stealthily blocked, or fully blocked, it clarifies real-world network behavior.

This transparency enables users to:

- Understand precisely which third-party domains are contacted during browsing
- Objectively compare blocking effectiveness across different extensions or configurations
- Identify failures in content blocking that remain hidden behind misleading metrics
- Monitor connections on browsers that restrict access to developer tools or network logs

## Typical Use Cases

### Comparing Content Blockers or Privacy Tools
Imagine you want to verify if a new ad blocker is actually more effective than the one you currently use. Instead of trusting block counts—which can be skewed—uBO Scope reveals the exact distinct third-party domains connected to, showing the genuine network exposure difference.

### Debunking Ad-Blocker Test Webpages
Many so-called "ad-blocker test" sites do not simulate real-world conditions accurately and return unreliable results. uBO Scope exposes these flaws by showing actual network request outcomes as the browser handles them, not as fabricated by test pages.

### Monitoring on Limited Platforms
When browsing on platforms or browsers where developer tools and network panels are limited or nonexistent—such as browsers on mobile devices—uBO Scope offers direct network insight through its extension popup and badge count, allowing privacy monitoring anywhere.

### Assisting Filter List Maintainers
Maintaining effective filter lists requires knowledge of what domains are contacted frequently, and how blocking rules interact with network connections. uBO Scope provides up-to-date, hands-on connection data to refine and validate filtering rules across browsers and devices.

### Everyday Privacy Awareness
Simply seeing the number and identity of third-party domains a webpage contacts gives privacy-minded users critical awareness and control over their browsing footprint.

## What Results Can You Expect?

- **Real-time, accurate representation** of third-party network exposure for each active browser tab
- **Clear categorization** into allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked domains, facilitating nuanced understanding
- **Reliable badge counts** reflecting the true number of distinct external servers connected to, not just request counts
- **Reduced guesswork** in evaluating and trusting content blockers, ad blockers, or DNS filtering services

### Before uBO Scope
- Rely on error-prone block counts or shallow test sites
- Misinterpret higher block counts as better blocking
- Have limited visibility on stealth blocking mechanisms

### After uBO Scope
- See actual network connections, with factual categorization
- Objectively compare protection effectiveness
- Identify stealth or DNS-level blocking impact
- Gain insight on any browsing platform supporting the extension

## Getting Started Preview

Kick off your transparency journey quickly: install uBO Scope, open its popup on any webpage, and instantly see how many third-party domains your browser connects to — sorted by allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

### Prerequisites
- Modern browser supporting WebRequest API and extension manifests (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+)
- Basic familiarity with browser extensions and installing add-ons

### Next Steps
Explore related documentation to learn more:

- [Understanding the Extension Popup and Badge Count](/guides/getting-started/first-look-popup) for immediate usage insight
- [Step-by-Step: Monitoring Website Connections](/guides/analyzing-connections/workflow-monitoring) to become an expert at analyzing site connections
- [Evaluating Effectiveness of Content Blockers](/guides/analyzing-connections/content-blocker-assessment) to assess and benchmark your privacy setup

<Tip>
For the most meaningful insights, focus on the number of distinct third-party domains connected rather than raw block counts. A lower count means fewer external entities receive your data.

<Warning>
Beware of "ad-blocker test" webpages as definitive indicators. They often do not represent realistic browsing scenarios and can mislead your conclusions.
