# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Remote Server Connection Your Browser Encounters

When you browse the web, your browser connects to numerous remote servers — some obvious, others hidden behind layers of content blocking or DNS filtering. **uBO Scope** shines a light on all these interactions, revealing every attempted or successful connection to remote servers regardless of any content blocker or DNS solution in use.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Transparent connection tracking:** Understand exactly which third-party servers your browser talks to while you browse.
- **Accurate privacy indicator:** Measure the number of distinct third-party servers involved — a critical metric for assessing privacy exposure.
- **Independent of blockers:** See connections irrespective of whether they were allowed, stealth-blocked, or explicitly blocked by other tools.
- **Helpful for everyone:** Valuable for everyday users seeking privacy insights and filter list maintainers requiring precise network data.

### Who Benefits From uBO Scope?

- **Privacy-conscious users** who want honest visibility on third-party network activity beyond what typical ad blockers reveal.
- **Filter list maintainers** who need reliable, real-world data on network requests to improve and validate blocking rules.
- **Developers and security researchers** investigating how pages interact with external servers.

## What Exactly is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension companion to uBlock Origin that **measures network connections initiated by webpages**. Instead of blocking or modifying traffic, it simply reports every connection attempt — successful or not — supplying an unfiltered view of your browsing footprint.

### Core Purpose

Webpages load assets and make network requests not only from their own servers but also from a variety of third-party services — including content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics providers, trackers, and advertising domains. These third-party connections often impact your privacy and browsing experience.

uBO Scope reveals:
- Which third-party servers contacts were **allowed** through your current content blocker or DNS.
- Which were **blocked** explicitly.
- Which were **stealth-blocked**, meaning blocked in ways that may be invisible to webpages but still effective.

This unbiased insight helps you gauge real privacy levels and better understand your web traffic.

### How uBO Scope Works

It leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to listen to network request events, capturing URLs and outcomes as pages load or interact online. Regardless of your content blocking setup, uBO Scope collects:

- Origins of network connections by hostname and domain.
- Counts of connections per domain, grouped based on whether they were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

The extension’s popup interface then presents these details in a clear, intuitive format focused on domains rather than raw URLs, enhanced with user-friendly domain name conversion (punycode decoding).

## Key Differentiators

Unlike standard content blockers or browser tools that may display only partially visible data:

- uBO Scope **counts distinct third-party domains**, emphasizing the real privacy impact.
- It is **blocker-agnostic**, meaning it shows connection data irrespective of what any active content blockers might do.
- It focuses on **real-world practical visibility**, not synthetic or test-page results.

<u>Most importantly</u>, uBO Scope confronts common misconceptions such as "higher block counts mean better blocking" or the reliability of “ad blocker test” sites, offering a trustworthy metric based on actual network observations.

## Real-World Scenario: Using uBO Scope

Imagine you visit a news website. While the site loads, uBO Scope quietly records all the servers the site connects to:

- It lists the site’s main domain (e.g., `example-news.com`) connections as allowed.
- Shows CDN servers that served images or scripts as allowed but third-party ad servers as blocked.
- Reveals stealth blocking that prevents certain trackers without breaking the page.

Instead of guessing or relying on badges or test sites, you see exactly how many and which third parties are involved — giving you a strong privacy snapshot and confidence.

## How uBO Scope Supports Filter List Maintainers

Filter list maintainers can leverage uBO Scope’s accuracy to:

- Detect which domains are truly being contacted by sites, including those missed by blocklists.
- Observe stealth blocking effectiveness to refine stealth rules.
- Collect reliable statistics on third-party domain prevalence during everyday browsing environments.

This makes uBO Scope an essential companion tool for professionals who craft and validate filters to improve overall content blocking quality.

## Practical Tips

- **Interpret badge counts correctly:** The badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to — the lower, the better for privacy.
- **Do not rely on ad blocker test sites:** uBO Scope exposes why such sites are misleading and encourages measuring privacy using real network data.
- **Use alongside content blockers:** uBO Scope complements blocking tools rather than replaces them, offering enhanced transparency.
