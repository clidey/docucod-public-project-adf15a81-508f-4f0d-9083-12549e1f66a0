# What is uBO Scope?

## Revealing All Third-Party Connections — Transparency Beyond Blocking

uBO Scope is a lightweight, privacy-focused browser extension whose core mission is to reveal every attempted or successful connection that webpages make to third-party servers. Unlike conventional content blockers or DNS-level filters that limit or alter connections, uBO Scope strips away the mystery by displaying all network activity — no matter which blockers are in use.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You

- **Complete transparency:** Know exactly which remote servers a webpage connects to, whether those connections were blocked or allowed.
- **Independent of blockers:** See network requests regardless of any content blocking tools or DNS filters you use.
- **Focus on security and privacy:** Understand your exposure to third parties to better manage your online fingerprint.
- **Minimal complexity:** No complex configurations — just clear, straightforward information.
- **Insightful badge indicator:** The extension’s badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains contacted, giving you an instant snapshot of third-party reach.

### Who Benefits From uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is designed for anyone who values web privacy and wants to get a truthful view of network connections web pages make, including:

- Privacy-conscious users and researchers.
- Filter list maintainers seeking empirical data.
- Developers and security auditors analyzing third-party requests.
- Anyone puzzled by conflicting content blocker statistics or curious about web tracking.

## What Is uBO Scope?

At its essence, uBO Scope is an extension that listens to your browser’s network activity to catalog all network requests webpages attempt. It doesn’t block, filter, or modify connections; it only measures them, reporting back details on which third-party servers are contacted and the outcome of those requests (allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked).

### The Problem it Solves

Most content blockers only show partial data — often limited to what they block or allow themselves. Furthermore, DNS-level filtering adds another shadowy layer that hides network activity beyond the browser’s knowledge. This makes it difficult to truly understand which third parties a site accesses.

uBO Scope solves this by working *alongside* any content blocker or DNS filter, reporting the raw facts of network traffic as exposed by the browser’s `webRequest` API. This reveals the full extent of connections a page attempts to make, cutting through misconceptions generated by block counts or ad blocker tests.

### What Sets uBO Scope Apart

- **Non-intrusive measurement:** It passively gathers connection data without blocking, ensuring you see the full story.
- **Works across blockers:** Whether you use uBlock Origin, DNS-level filters, or none at all, uBO Scope reports connections transparently.
- **Focus on third-party domains:** Highlights distinct third-party servers contacted, not just request counts.
- **Myth-busting insights:** Helps debunk common misunderstandings about content blocker effectiveness and ad blocker test validity.

### How It Works, Simply

1. **Monitor network requests:** Uses browser `webRequest` listeners to detect all outbound requests from the webpage.
2. **Classify connections:** Determines if a request was allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked by the current content blocker or filter in place.
3. **Group by domain:** Consolidates requests by their third-party domains using an efficient domain parsing method based on the Public Suffix List.
4. **Display counts and details:** Presents this information in a concise popup panel and via a badge count on the browser toolbar.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Comprehensive network visibility:** Captures all main-frame and subresource requests with their outcomes.
- **Third-party domain aggregation:** Counts and lists domains contacted, helping users understand third-party reach.
- **Badge count indicator:** Displays the number of distinct allowed third-party domains for quick reference.
- **Outcome categorization:** Separates domains into 'allowed', 'blocked', and 'stealth-blocked' categories.
- **Independent operation:** Functions alongside any content blocker or DNS filter without interference.
- **Efficient session tracking:** Maintains data per browser tab for easy per-site analysis.

## Why You Should Care

### Understand Your Exposure to Third Parties
Websites often load resources from many external domains, increasing your privacy risk. uBO Scope shines a light on these hidden connections so you can make informed decisions.

### Assess Content Blockers Objectively
uBO Scope shows that a higher block count does not always mean better blocking. It reveals the number of distinct third-party connections actually allowed, which is a more reliable metric.

### Avoid Misleading Ad-Block Tests
It exposes the fallacy of online "ad blocker test" pages, which rely on unrealistic network requests and do not reflect real-world blocking performance.

### Empower Filter Maintainers
Filter list authors can use uBO Scope as a tool to validate and refine their blocking rules with real data.

### Save Time and Effort
The badge count and popup simplify understanding connection behavior at a glance, without needing to dive into complex developer tools.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine visiting a news site with uBO Scope installed. The badge displays a small number, indicating few third-party servers were contacted. Upon clicking the extension icon, you see a categorized list showing which domains were allowed and which were blocked. This empowers you to evaluate how tightly your content blockers are controlling third-party content and take action if needed.

## Getting Started Preview

Getting started with uBO Scope is seamless:

1. **Install the extension** from your browser’s official store.
2. **Browse as usual.** The extension quietly observes network requests behind the scenes.
3. **Watch the badge count** on the toolbar update to reflect third-party domains accessed.
4. **Click the badge** to open the popup panel displaying detailed breakdowns by outcome.

No special configuration is required to start learning about your web exposure.

## Tips for Best Use

- A **lower badge count** generally means fewer third-party connections and better privacy.
- Pay special attention to the **allowed** category to understand what servers your browser still reaches despite blocking.
- Use the tool to **compare different content blockers** by observing real-world third-party reach instead of relying on block counts.

## Common Pitfalls

- uBO Scope cannot report network requests that do not pass through the browser’s `webRequest` API, such as those made by native OS processes.
- The badge count reflects distinct domains, not total requests — a site might make many requests to the same domain, which counts as one.
