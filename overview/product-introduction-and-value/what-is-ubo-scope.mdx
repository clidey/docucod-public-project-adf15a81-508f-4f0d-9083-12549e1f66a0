# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover the Invisible Connections

uBO Scope is a powerful yet remarkably simple browser extension designed to uncover every connection your browser attempts to make to third-party remote servers — whether those connections are allowed or blocked. Unlike conventional content blockers that operate by silently preventing unwanted content, uBO Scope shines a light on all network activity, bringing full transparency to what typically remains hidden.

## Why Visibility into Third-Party Connections Matters

Modern websites often load resources from various remote servers. While some are essential and benign, many third-party connections can impact your privacy, security, and browsing experience. Understanding exactly which servers your browser communicates with helps you make better decisions about content blocking, filter lists, and improving your web security.

## What Makes uBO Scope Different?

While typical content blockers focus on blocking unwanted content, uBO Scope serves a unique purpose:

- **Comprehensive Connection Reporting:** It tracks all third-party connections, including those allowed by your content blocker, stealthily blocked, or outright denied.
- **Unbiased Measurement:** It does not filter or block any connections itself, enabling you to see an accurate picture of network activity beyond what is visible in browser tools.
- **Compatibility with Existing Blockers:** uBO Scope works alongside your favorite content blockers, reporting outcomes regardless of which blocker is active.

This transparency dismantles common misunderstandings about what blocking really entails and helps you evaluate the effectiveness of your current protections accurately.

## Simple yet Powerful Architecture

At its core, uBO Scope uses the browser's webRequest API to listen to all network requests your browser makes. It categorizes these requests into three distinct outcomes:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully established.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections that were circumvented or redirected stealthily by a content blocker.
- **Blocked:** Connections outright denied or failed.

This classification lets users understand the true behavior of network requests in real time.

### Real-World Scenario

Imagine you visit an online news site. Although you use an ad blocker, that site still connects to several analytics and CDN servers. uBO Scope reveals each of these servers, whether your blocker allowed or blocked them, helping you assess whether your privacy settings are sufficient or need adjustment.

## Key Benefits of uBO Scope

- **Empowers Informed Decisions:** Make better choices about your content blocker configurations based on precise data.
- **Demystifies Content Blocking:** Avoid relying on misleading block counts or test pages by examining actual server connections.
- **Ideal for Filter List Maintainers:** Gain insight into how filters affect real-world network requests.
- **Lightweight and Non-Intrusive:** Provides valuable data without interfering with browsing.

## Getting Started Preview

Once installed, uBO Scope places an icon on your browser toolbar displaying a badge count representing the number of distinct third-party domains connected during the active tab’s session. Clicking the icon opens a popup view listing these domains, grouped by their connection outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).

This instant visual feedback guides you effortlessly in monitoring and analyzing third-party connections as you browse.

## Practical Tips

- **Remember:** A lower third-party connection count typically indicates better privacy control.
- **Understand that not all third parties are bad:** For example, CDNs delivering website assets are usually legitimate.
- **Use uBO Scope to validate blocker effectiveness:** Do not rely solely on block counts reported by blockers.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Avoid assessing blocker quality by comparing simple block counts.
- Do not trust synthetic ad-blocker test pages; rely on real browsing data for evaluation.
