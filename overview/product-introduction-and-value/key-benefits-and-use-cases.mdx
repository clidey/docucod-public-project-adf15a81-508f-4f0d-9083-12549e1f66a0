# Key Benefits & Use Cases

uBO Scope offers a distinctive window into your browser's network activity by revealing all attempted and successful remote server connections. This page unpacks who benefits from uBO Scope and explores the most impactful use cases, empowering privacy-conscious users, filter list maintainers, and anyone evaluating the true effectiveness of third-party blockers.

## Who Benefits From uBO Scope?

### Privacy-Minded Users
If you value your online privacy and want to fully understand which third-party domains your browser connects to when visiting websites, uBO Scope is the essential tool. It exposes connections that are allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked, giving you a truthful reflection of your web traffic beyond what typical content blockers reveal.

### Filter List Maintainers
Maintaining effective content blocking lists requires accurate insight into real-world network requests. uBO Scope helps maintainers observe exactly which third-party servers are contacted during browsing sessions—even on devices with limited access to built-in developer tools—supporting precise tuning and validation of filter rules.

### Evaluators of Third-Party Blockers
This extension is ideal for anyone who wants to go beyond shallow block counts or unreliable "ad blocker test" pages. It provides clear visibility into the actual distinct remote servers contacted, enabling better-informed decisions and assessments of content blocking strategies.

## Primary Use Cases

### Monitoring Server Connections in Real Time
uBO Scope actively monitors network requests through browser APIs to track every connection attempt made by web pages:

- **Allowed connections:** Third-party servers the browser successfully reached.
- **Blocked connections:** Servers where requests failed due to blocking.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Subtle blocking occurring without obvious failure but limiting tracking or resource loading.

This classification helps users accurately visualize the exposure to third-party activity on a per-domain basis, directly from the toolbar popup UI.

### Debunking Misleading Adblock Test Claims
Many popular "ad blocker test" webpages simulate artificial and unrealistic network conditions that do not reflect the web’s true complexity. uBO Scope uncovers the flaws of these test pages by showing actual, factual connection attempts and outcomes, helping users distinguish reliable blocking from fake performance metrics.

### Supporting Better-Informed Content Blocking Strategies
By reporting on network requests regardless of which content blocker (or network-level blocking mechanism) is active, uBO Scope provides filter list maintainers and users with honest data on blocking effectiveness. It avoids being fooled by inflated block counts and highlights the true number of distinct third-party servers accessed.

## Real-World Scenario: Understanding Your Web Exposure
Imagine you visit a news website using a popular ad blocker. The site loads mostly as expected, but a few trackers still send data silently. Without uBO Scope, you might assume no connections slip through because the extension counts a high number of blocked requests.

With uBO Scope, you can open the popup to see exactly which third-party domains were contacted or stealth-blocked. You notice some unexpected domains allowed through—domains you can now scrutinize or block with more targeted rules. This visibility empowers you to control your privacy rather than rely on opaque block counts.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Use the Toolbar Badge as a Privacy Indicator:** The badge number represents how many distinct third-party remote domains your browser connected to. A lower count typically indicates less exposure.
- **Review the Popup Data Regularly:** Check the detailed breakdown of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains to understand changing network behaviors.
- **Avoid Relying on Block Count for Effectiveness:** Remember that a higher block count can be misleading; the key metric is how many unique third-party servers are contacted, not how many requests were blocked.
- **Leverage uBO Scope for Filter List Testing:** Use uBO Scope data to verify that your filter lists block all intended domains and to identify overlooked connections.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Misinterpreting Stealth-Blocked Domains:** Stealth blocking may not always be visible as outright blocking but still impacts resource loading or tracking. Don’t ignore this category when analyzing data.
- **Relying on Synthetic Ad Blocker Tests:** Real usage scenarios differ significantly from scripted test sites, which often fail to represent actual network request patterns.
- **Assuming All Third Parties Are Harmful:** Not all third-party connections are detrimental; content delivery networks and essential services often appear as third parties but are integral to website functionality.

## Summary

uBO Scope uniquely empowers you to see beyond simple block metrics by offering a clear and unvarnished view of all third-party network interactions. Whether you are protecting your privacy, fine-tuning filters, or evaluating blockers, uBO Scope’s insights deliver the factual foundation you need.
