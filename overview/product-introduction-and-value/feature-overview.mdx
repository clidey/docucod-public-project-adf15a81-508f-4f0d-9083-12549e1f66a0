# Features at a Glance

Discover the core capabilities of uBO Scope that empower you to monitor and understand third-party network connections right from your browser. This page provides a clear snapshot of the extension’s primary features and guides you through the user experience from installation to live network monitoring.

## Instant Third-Party Connection Monitoring

uBO Scope tracks all network requests initiated by web pages you visit. It categorizes these requests in real time based on their outcome:

- **Allowed:** Requests that successfully connected to remote servers.
- **Blocked:** Requests that were actively blocked by content blockers or caused network errors.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests hidden or redirected to prevent detection, offering nuanced insight beyond simple blocking.

By seeing these outcomes, you gain transparent visibility into exactly how your browser interacts with third-party services.

## Toolbar Badge Reporting

The extension’s toolbar icon showcases a dynamic badge count representing the number of distinct third-party domains that made successful connections on the active tab. This immediate visual summary helps you gauge the extent of third-party engagement at a glance.

## Cross-Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope supports major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, ensuring a consistent experience regardless of your preferred environment. It leverages each browser’s native webRequest API to capture network activity with high reliability.

## High-Level User Flow

1. **Install uBO Scope** from your browser’s extension store.
2. **Browse the web normally.** Behind the scenes, uBO Scope monitors all network requests on each tab.
3. **Open the extension popup.** Instantly see a categorized, live summary of all third-party domains contacted during the page load, segmented by outcome.
4. **Interpret the toolbar badge.** The number displayed represents distinct allowed third-party servers, guiding your privacy or filter testing concerns.

## Why These Features Matter

- **Transparency:** No more guesses about which third parties are contacted — uBO Scope lays it out clearly.
- **Privacy & Security:** Know which domains your browser connects to, helping you identify unexpected or unwanted connections.
- **Filter Testing:** Evaluate content blocker effectiveness by observing which requests are effectively blocked or stealthily hidden.
- **Efficiency:** Quickly understand network outcomes without digging into developer tools or complex logs.

## Practical Example

Imagine visiting an e-commerce website. By opening uBO Scope’s popup, you can instantly see:

- How many and which third-party domains loaded resources successfully (e.g., CDN providers).
- Which requests were blocked, potentially by your content blocker.
- If any stealth blocking occurred, signifying advanced content blocking behavior.

This immediate insight helps you trust your blocker settings and understand site behavior.

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of This Page

- Regularly check the badge and popup when visiting new or privacy-critical websites.
- Use the categorized outcomes to verify whether your content blockers meet your expectations.
- Combine this real-time visibility with deeper workflow guides such as "Analyzing Page Connections and Third Parties" to expand your diagnostic capabilities.

## Troubleshooting Common Concerns

- **No data appears in the popup:** Ensure you have properly installed and enabled the extension. Sometimes refreshing the tab or opening a new tab triggers data capture.
- **Badge count doesn’t update:** Data updates occur after network requests complete, typically within a second. Wait briefly or reload the page.
- **Differences with other blockers’ reports:** Remember, uBO Scope reports actual network requests, not filter hits, providing distinct perspectives.
