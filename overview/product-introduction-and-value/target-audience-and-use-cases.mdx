# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Understanding who benefits most from uBO Scope is key to unlocking its full potential. Whether you’re an everyday privacy-conscious user, a researcher comparing content blockers, or a filter list maintainer working with limited resources, uBO Scope provides transparent, actionable insight into web connections.

---

## Empowering Privacy-Focused Users

If you care deeply about your online privacy, frequency and diversity of third-party connections are critical signals. uBO Scope reveals every attempted or successful third-party connection made by the browser, bypassing the usual invisibility created by content blockers or DNS filters.

- **Why This Matters:** Many privacy tools focus on blocking ads or scripts, but you can’t block what you don’t see. uBO Scope lifts the veil, showing you exactly which remote servers your browser talks to.
- **Example Use Case:** Verify that your content blocker is effectively minimizing your exposure by watching the list of allowed third parties.

## Comparing and Validating Content Blockers

Users testing various ad blockers or privacy extensions often encounter confusing or misleading information about blocking efficacy.

- **Debunking Myths:** uBO Scope provides a factual basis to dispute common misconceptions such as ‘higher block count means better blocking’ or trusting unreliable ad blocker test websites.
- **Real-World Testing:** It measures actual third-party connections during your everyday browsing, not contrived test pages.

## Essential Tool for Filter List Maintainers

Creating and maintaining filter lists demands detailed knowledge of how web connections operate in real environments.

- **Insight on Locked-Down or Mobile Devices:** On some platforms, browser developer tools are limited or unavailable. uBO Scope works as a portable diagnostic to observe third-party domains in these contexts.
- **Support Maintenance Efforts:** Quickly see what third parties are being allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked (via redirects), helping you refine filter rules more effectively.

## Typical Use Cases

- **Verifying Effectiveness of Blockers:** Confirm that your blocker blocks unwanted connections by observing the "blocked" section.
- **Debunking Ad Blocker Test Results:** Identify misleading results from synthetic testing sites by relying on real connection data.
- **Understanding Third-Party Resource Exposure:** Gain clarity on what domains your visited websites actually contact.
- **Working Without Developer Tools:** Use uBO Scope’s compact popup interface to gain insights when other diagnostic tools aren’t accessible.

## Before and After Using uBO Scope

Consider the experience of checking privacy manually without insight:

- You rely on the blocker’s badge counts or web page assertions, which may not reflect the true number of third-party connections.
- You lack detailed visibility into "stealth-blocked" connections — those that were redirected or prevented through subtler mechanisms.

With uBO Scope:

- You see a clear, categorized list of connected domains grouped by outcome: allowed, stealth-blocked, and outright blocked.
- You can verify the true effectiveness of your privacy tools.
- You base decisions on real network data rather than assumptions or misleading tests.

## Why Mobile and Locked-Down Environments Benefit Most

On devices or platforms where browser developer consoles and network panels are limited or inaccessible (such as certain mobile browsers or locked-down OS environments), uBO Scope becomes an indispensable instrument:

- It reports network connections consistently through browser APIs.
- Enables researchers, maintainers, and curious power users to perform diagnostics that would otherwise require advanced tooling.

## Key Takeaways

- uBO Scope is designed for users who want transparency behind browser network activity, regardless of blocking.
- It empowers you with reliable data to evaluate content blockers and understand third-party exposure.
- Filter list maintainers gain a valuable ally in diagnosing and improving blocking rules, especially on constrained platforms.

## Code Example: How uBO Scope Categorizes Domains in the Popup

When uBO Scope detects connections, it categorizes domains as follows:

```javascript
const allowedSection = document.querySelector('.outcome.allowed .domains');
const blockedSection = document.querySelector('.outcome.blocked .domains');
const stealthSection = document.querySelector('.outcome.stealth .domains');

// allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked sets of domains are appended here
```

This clear UI separation reflects your real browsing exposure at a glance.
