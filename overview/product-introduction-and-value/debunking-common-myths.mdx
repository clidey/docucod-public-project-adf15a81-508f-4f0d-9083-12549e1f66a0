# Debunking Common Myths

Discovering the truth behind popular misconceptions about ad blocking and browser privacy tools is essential to making informed decisions and properly interpreting network activity. This page exposes widespread falsehoods that users often encounter, helping you gain a deeper understanding of what content blockers actually report and how you should evaluate their performance.

## Why Badge Counts Can Be Misleading

A common misconception is that the badge count—displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon—represents the effectiveness of your content blocker. The reality is far more nuanced:

- **Badge Count Meaning:** The number shown is the count of distinct third-party remote server domains where connections were established and allowed.
- **Lower Count Is Better:** A lower badge count means fewer third-party servers fetched resources, which is generally desirable for privacy.
- **Block Count Is Different:** Some users mistake the number of blocked requests as a measure of blocking strength. In truth, a high block count could coincide with **more** allowed connections to **different** servers, indicating less effective blocking.

<u>Example Scenario:</u> A content blocker shows 50 blocked requests but lets connections from 40 unique third-party servers proceed, versus another showing 20 blocked requests but allowing only 10 unique third-party connections. The second blocker is more protective despite a lower block count.

### Key Takeaway

> Use the count of distinct allowed third-party servers—not block counts—for judging content blocker reliability.

## The Deception of 'Ad Blocker Test' Pages

Webpages that claim to test ad blockers often give misleading impressions:

- **Unrealistic Test Requests:** These sites generate artificial network requests that real-world websites rarely, if ever, use.
- **Blind Spot for Stealth Blocking:** Many content blockers employ stealth techniques to block without detection. These stealth blocks are invisible to the test page's scripting, falsely indicating failure.
- **Confirming Trustworthiness:** Such pages don't reflect actual performance or privacy guarantees.

<u>Implication:</u> Relying on these tests leads to misguided trust or unwarranted doubt about your content blocker.

### Best Practice

> Avoid judging ad blocker reliability based on ad blocker test pages. Instead, use insightful tools like uBO Scope that reveal real network activity.

## Empowering Users with Meaningful Data

uBO Scope equips you to evaluate connections based on real network events, showing:

- **Allowed Connections:** Third parties your browser successfully fetched resources from.
- **Stealth-Blocked Connections:** Requests blocked invisibly, preventing scripts or servers from knowing.
- **Blocked Connections:** Requests explicitly blocked and failed.

Understanding these distinctions lets you **read beyond the numbers** and grasp the actual privacy and security status.

## Practical Tips for Interpreting uBO Scope Data

- Look at the **allowed third-party domains count** in the badge for an indicator of exposure.
- Use the popup interface to review domains categorized into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
- Treat high allowed domain counts on sensitive sites as an alert for potential privacy risks.
- Remember, legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs) often reduce the number of distinct third-parties legitimately needed.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Comparing block counts between different blockers without context.
- Trusting synthetic test pages instead of real-world browsing insights.
- Interpreting stealth blocking as failures.

## Next Steps

- Explore the [What is uBO Scope?](./what-is-ubo-scope) page to get foundational understanding.
- Dive deeper into [Key Benefits & Use Cases](./key-benefits-and-use-cases) to see how uBO Scope can fit your privacy workflow.
- Try the extension hands-on—install it as guided in the [Installing uBO Scope](../../getting-started/install-and-setup/installing-extension) section.

<Tip>
Properly interpreting content blocking data protects you from myths and misleading metrics, enabling smarter privacy decisions.
