# Browser & Integration Support

## Introduction

uBO Scope is designed to provide you with a clear and comprehensive view of all network connections a browser tab attempts or successfully makes. This page outlines the browsers currently supported and explains how uBO Scope operates seamlessly alongside other content blocking tools and DNS-based filtering solutions without interference.

## Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is a versatile extension built with compatibility in mind, supporting the following major browsers:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave)
  - Requires minimum version **122.0** or later
  - Utilizes Manifest Version 3 service workers

- **Mozilla Firefox** (desktop and Android)
  - Requires minimum version **128.0** or later
  - Leverages the WebExtensions API with module background scripts

- **Safari** (macOS)
  - Requires minimum Strict Version **18.5** or later
  - Uses Manifest Version 3 with modular background scripts

These versions ensure that uBO Scope can reliably integrate with each browser's extension APIs, especially for capturing and reporting network requests.

## Integration With Other Content Blockers and Filtering Solutions

### Independent Operation

uBO Scope is designed to operate **independently** of any other content blockers running in your browser. It neither blocks requests nor intervenes in the content filtering process but instead transparently monitors network activity to report what actually happens.

This independence implies:

- uBO Scope **does not replace or conflict** with existing content blockers such as uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus, or similar extensions.
- It can coexist with multiple content blockers without interference or duplication of monitoring.
- Users can verify and audit network activities both before and after content blockers have applied their rules.

### Complementing DNS-based Filtering

Many users also employ DNS-based filtering tools like Pi-hole or system-level firewalls to control network access. uBO Scope works alongside these tools by:

- Capturing the network requests as seen by the browser, regardless of whether DNS filtering has blocked or redirected them at a lower level.
- Revealing requests that may have been stealth-blocked (redirected or blocked implicitly) at the network level, offering real insight into filtering effects.
- Allowing users to compare DNS-based blocking with browser-level blocking outcomes to optimize privacy and security strategies.

## Why This Matters

By showing **what network connections are actually attempted and their status** (allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked), uBO Scope empowers you to:

- Verify that your content blockers and DNS filters are working as intended.
- Understand the true exposure of the websites you visit to third-party services.
- Maintain and tweak your blocking rules with an unbiased tool that reflects real-time activity.

## Practical Considerations

- The extension requests permissions for key URL schemes (http, https, ws, wss), granting it visibility over most web traffic.
- Badge counts in the toolbar reflect distinct allowed connections, updated dynamically per tab.
- The popup interface categorizes connected domains and hosts by outcome, making identification clear and straightforward.

## Common Scenarios

- **Multiple Blockers Active:** Running uBO Scope alongside other blockers lets you detect if some requests slip through or are stealth-blocked, a common point of confusion.
- **DNS Filtering in Place:** Even if DNS blocks a certain domain, uBO Scope can reveal attempts and show if redirects or failures occurred.
- **Browser Limitation Detection:** In browsers with limited developer tools or APIs, uBO Scope offers a transparent perspective on network interactions.

## Troubleshooting

- If the extension does not appear to track connections properly, ensure your browser meets the minimum version requirements.
- Confirm that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions listed during installation.
- Remember that uBO Scope is not a blocking tool; it will not prevent connections but report on them.

For UI-related or installation issues, refer to the relevant troubleshooting pages in the documentation.
