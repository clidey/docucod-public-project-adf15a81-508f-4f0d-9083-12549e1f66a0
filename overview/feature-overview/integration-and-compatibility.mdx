# Integration & Compatibility

## Seamless Interoperation with Other Content Blockers

uBO Scope is designed to complement, not replace, your existing content blockers. It operates independently and passively, observing network connections through your browser’s `webRequest` API regardless of which content blocking extensions or DNS-level filters you have enabled. This means:

- **Unbiased Reporting:** uBO Scope records the true state of network requests — whether they are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked — without interfering or altering the flow.
- **Resilience to Other Blockers:** Even if other blockers silently block or redirect requests, uBO Scope can detect these outcomes and categorize them accordingly.
- **No Conflicts or Overlap:** Since uBO Scope does not modify browser behavior or block requests itself, it coexists cleanly with blockers like uBlock Origin, enabling you to audit and evaluate their real-world effectiveness.

## Supported Browsers and Permissions

uBO Scope supports all major modern browsers that provide access to the `webRequest` API, with explicit manifest declarations for each platform to ensure smooth installation and maximum compatibility:

- **Chromium-based Browsers:** Uses a service-worker background script.
- **Firefox:** Uses a module-type background script with specific browser ID and minimum version requirements.
- **Safari:** Uses a module-type background script with Safari-specific minimum version requirements.

Each manifest requests the following permissions essential for uBO Scope’s core monitoring:

- `webRequest` and `host_permissions` to intercept network requests across HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS schemes.
- `storage` for persisting session data.
- `activeTab` to interact with the currently active browser tab.

This adherence to platform-specific manifest formats ensures that uBO Scope operates smoothly while complying with browser security models.

## Core Integration: Monitoring via webRequest API

At its heart, uBO Scope listens to traffic through the browser's `webRequest` API, which provides a comprehensive view of network requests made by web pages.

### How uBO Scope Tracks Requests

- **Captures Redirects, Errors, and Responses:** Listeners are registered for onBeforeRedirect, onErrorOccurred, and onResponseStarted events, allowing the extension to classify network request outcomes precisely.
- **Independent Outcome Categorization:** Each request is classified into allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked categories regardless of third-party content blockers.
- **Per-Tab Session Persistence:** Data is stored and aggregated per browser tab, enabling focused analysis on a tab-by-tab basis.

### Advantages of webRequest API-Based Monitoring

- **Browser-Level Visibility:** Observes network activity including what content blockers or DNS rules modify, enabling accurate insight.
- **Cross-Content-Blocker Accuracy:** Bypasses the limitations of content blocker UI reporting, revealing the real network situation behind all filters.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Data feeds directly into badge count updates and the popup UI, reflecting the current network state.

## Example: Browser Permissions from Manifest

```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "storage",
    "webRequest"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://*/*",
    "http://*/*",
    "wss://*/*",
    "ws://*/*"
  ]
}
```

This configuration allows uBO Scope to detect and report network requests made over common web and websocket protocols.

## Interoperability Across Browsers

| Browser         | Manifest Type      | Background Script Type    | Important Notes                   |
|-----------------|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Chromium        | Manifest V3        | Service Worker (`background.service_worker`)  | Requires minimum Chrome 122.0    |
| Firefox         | Manifest V3        | Module (`background.scripts`)                 | Uses browser-specific ID and min version 128.0 |
| Safari          | Manifest V3        | Module (`background.scripts`)                 | Strict minimum version 18.5     |

This table helps you understand how uBO Scope adapts to each browser’s extension system while maintaining consistent functionality.

## Practical Tips for Integration

- **Keep Other Content Blockers Active:** Use uBO Scope to audit their effectiveness without disabling them.
- **Ensure Browser Permissions:** Confirm the extension has necessary permissions during installation.
- **Understand Badge Count:** The badge reflects the number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections, highlighting overall exposure, not just blocked attempts.

## Common Pitfalls

- **`webRequest` API Limitations:** Some browsers or configurations might restrict `webRequest` events, impacting visibility.
- **Network Requests Outside `webRequest` API:** Requests made by browser components that do not funnel through the API cannot be reported.
- **Misinterpretation of Block Counts:** Differences in block counts compared to other blockers do not equal reliability but reflect different blocking approaches.
