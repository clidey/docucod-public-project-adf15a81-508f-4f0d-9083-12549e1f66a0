# uBO Scope Features at a Glance

Discover at a glance the essential capabilities that make uBO Scope a transparent, reliable tool for monitoring your browser’s network connections. This page distills the core features into clear bullet points, helping you quickly understand the value uBO Scope delivers.

---

## Why uBO Scope?

When you browse the internet, your browser communicates with many remote servers—some expected, others less so. uBO Scope reveals these connections in real time, clarifying what network activity occurs behind the scenes. Whether you want to verify your content blocker’s effectiveness or simply maintain privacy awareness, uBO Scope’s features provide the data you need without dependency or complexity.

---

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Connection Tracking**  
  uBO Scope actively monitors each network request your browser makes. It tracks allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked (hidden) connections instantly to give you an accurate and current view of your browsing footprint.

- **Toolbar Badge Reporting**  
  The browser toolbar badge shows the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected during your current browsing session. This count quickly summarizes your exposure, where fewer third-party connections generally mean higher privacy.

- **Third-Party Connection Breakdown by Type**  
  uBO Scope categorizes connections into three clear outcomes:
  
  - **Allowed:** Connections successful and not blocked
  - **Blocked:** Connections prevented by your content blocker
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections intercepted and hidden by stealth blocking techniques

  This breakdown appears in the popup interface, delivering immediate insight into the behavior of sites and your blockers.

- **Independence from Other Blockers**  
  Unlike many tools that rely on specific blocking software, uBO Scope functions independently. It uses the browser’s native `webRequest` API to observe network activity, reporting outcomes accurately even when various content blockers or DNS blocking approaches are employed.

- **Multi-Browser Compatibility**  
  Compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and other Chromium-based browsers, uBO Scope ensures consistent monitoring across your favorite platforms. Your protections and insights remain stable no matter where you browse.

## Practical Example: What You See When You Use uBO Scope

Imagine visiting your favorite news site. Open uBO Scope's popup and instantly see:

- A summary count of unique third-party domains your browser connected to.
- Lists of domain names grouped by connection outcome: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.

This immediate decomposition helps you gauge the complexity of the page’s network traffic and your blocker’s reach.

---

## Tips for Maximizing uBO Scope

- Use the toolbar badge as your quick privacy gauge; aim for a lower count of distinct third-party connections.
- Review the stealth-blocked list specially to catch subtle blocking your main blocker might be doing.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with your knowledge of common third-party services (e.g., CDNs) to identify potential unwanted tracking.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Remember, the badge count reflects distinct third-party domains, not total connections or blocked requests.
- Not all third-party connections are harmful—some are required CDNs or essential services.
- Some network requests that bypass the browser’s `webRequest` API may not appear in uBO Scope and require complementary tools.
