# Works With Any Content Blocker

uBO Scope stands apart by providing unbiased, comprehensive insight into network requests made by your browser, regardless of the content blocker in use—including DNS-based blocking solutions.

## Why This Matters

Most content blockers operate invisibly, making it difficult to accurately measure their effectiveness. Many users fall victim to misleading statistics such as block counts or results from so-called 'ad blocker test' sites, which don’t reflect real-world blocking performance. uBO Scope cuts through this confusion by monitoring network requests independently of any content blocker.

## What uBO Scope Observes

- **Complete Network Requests Visibility:** uBO Scope listens to the browser's `webRequest` API to capture every attempted network request that the browser encounters.
- **Independence from Blockers:** Whether you use uBlock Origin, another extension, or even DNS-level blocking, uBO Scope measures connections without reliance on the blocking mechanism.
- **Comparison Reliability:** This independence means uBO Scope can be used as a trusted benchmark to evaluate how many third-party connections actually occur regardless of any blocking layers.

## Debunking Common Myths

### Myth 1: Higher Block Count Means Better Blocking

It's a common misunderstanding that a higher number on a blocker’s badge or block count directly translates to better protection. However, a high block count can correlate with the browser still making more distinct connections to third-party servers, potentially allowing more requests through rather than less. uBO Scope’s approach of counting distinct connected third-party domains provides a more meaningful metric for assessing blocking effectiveness.

### Myth 2: 'Ad Blocker Test' Sites Are Reliable Benchmarks

Many sites designed to test ad blockers rely on artificial and unrealistic network requests, which don’t represent the complexity or real-world behavior of modern web pages. Moreover, stealthy blockers often prevent detection by such pages. uBO Scope ignores these traps by reporting what is truly happening in the network stack, providing clear, real-time data.

## Practical Example

Imagine you're using a DNS-based content blocker alongside an adblocking extension. Normally, you might believe all unwanted connections are blocked because your blocker shows a high block count. But with uBO Scope activated, you see all network requests your browser attempts, whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked, giving you a transparent view of real-world connections.

## How uBO Scope Achieves Content Blocker Independence

- **Browser-Level Monitoring:** The extension uses the browser’s `webRequest` API, which logs requests that the browser is aware of, independent of the reason why a request is or isn't allowed.
- **Categorized Request Outcomes:** uBO Scope differentiates between allowed, stealth-blocked (requests that were redirected or canceled silently), and blocked requests.
- **No Reliance on Blocker Internals:** Because it does not interact with or depend on the blocking extension or DNS service's internal data, it provides an objective measurement.

## Tips to Maximize Value

- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to regularly audit how many third-party hosts are actually connected.
- Do not rely solely on block counts or test pages; instead, interpret the real connection counts shown by uBO Scope.
- Filter list maintainers can benefit from these insights especially on devices with limited access to browser developer tools.

## Common Pitfalls

- Remember that uBO Scope can only track requests visible through the browser’s `webRequest` API. Network activity outside this scope (such as requests made by browser internals or other software) will not appear.
- Avoid trusting block counts displayed by other content blockers as accurate indicators of effectiveness.
