# Intended Audience & Use Cases

## Unlocking the Full Potential of uBO Scope

uBO Scope is designed for users who demand precise, actionable insights into the network behavior of webpages. Whether you are a privacy advocate passionate about limiting third-party tracking, a filter list maintainer seeking a reliable way to validate content blocking effectiveness, or a researcher analyzing browser network traffic, uBO Scope delivers clarity and confidence.

By revealing every remote server connection—successful or blocked—this extension empowers you to understand exactly what happens behind the scenes during web browsing and make informed decisions based on data rather than assumptions.

## Who Benefits Most from uBO Scope?

### Privacy Advocates
Privacy-conscious users want to verify which third-party servers their browsers contact and whether content blockers truly limit unwanted network connections. uBO Scope provides a transparent view by categorizing remote server connections into:
- **Allowed**: Domains your browser connected to without obstruction.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections silently blocked to prevent tracking without breaking webpages.
- **Blocked**: Explicitly blocked network requests.

This insight allows you to evaluate your privacy posture in real time and detect hidden or unexpected third-party activity.

### Filter List Maintainers
Maintaining and improving content blocking filter lists requires detailed, accurate feedback on what network requests are made and their outcomes. uBO Scope:
- Reports actual network connection outcomes regardless of which blocker is active.
- Helps validate if filters are effectively reducing unwanted third-party connections.
- Is especially valuable on devices or environments where traditional developer tools are unavailable.

Filter list maintainers can leverage uBO Scope to enhance blocklists with confidence backed by real network data.

### Researchers and Analysts
For researchers studying web tracking, content blocking behaviors, or mobile browser traffic, uBO Scope offers a unique window into network request outcomes independent of blocking method nuances. Key use scenarios include:
- Evaluating and contrasting the effectiveness of different content blockers.
- Understanding the prevalence and patterns of third-party connections across websites.
- Investigating mobile browsers where visibility into network requests is often limited.

Such detailed measurements enable robust, data-driven analyses.

## Key Use Cases: When uBO Scope Shines

#### Evaluating Content Blockers Seriously
Instead of relying on misleading metrics such as block counts or test webpages that may not reflect real browsing, use uBO Scope to see the true number of distinct third-party servers successfully connected. This metric offers a far better indicator of content blocker efficacy.

#### Exposing the Invisible
Many content blockers use stealth techniques that hide connections from webpages but not necessarily from all network observers. uBO Scope bypasses these illusions by reporting results through browser network APIs, revealing stealth-blocked connections that might otherwise remain hidden.

#### Mobile Browser Network Analysis
When developer tools or extensions have limited capabilities on mobile browsers, uBO Scope provides an accessible means to monitor network activity and understand the third-party connections occurring on your device.

#### Enhancing Filter Lists
Filter maintainers can use uBO Scope's reports to identify new or missed tracking domains, observe connection outcomes in real usage scenarios, and prioritize list improvements based on actual impact.

## Real User Flow Example

Imagine you're a privacy advocate browsing the web with a content blocker enabled. You notice the badge on the uBO Scope icon shows a surprisingly high count of connected domains. Curious, you open the popup panel and immediately see a breakdown:

- Some domains were allowed — meaning resources loaded successfully.
- Others were stealth-blocked — connections prevented without breaking the page.
- A few were outright blocked.

This straightforward insight helps you adjust your settings or filters, confirm the effectiveness of stealth blocking features, or identify potentially unsafe or unnecessary third-party domains.

## Practical Tips for Users

- Use uBO Scope alongside your primary content blocker to get a holistic view of network activity.
- Regularly check the popup panel after visiting key sites to track changes in third-party connections.
- Filter list maintainers should test updates and new rules by comparing changes in allowed and blocked domains using uBO Scope.
- Researchers can aggregate data over sessions to assess trends in third-party server engagement.

## Common Pitfalls and How uBO Scope Helps Avoid Them

- **Mistaking block count for effectiveness:** uBO Scope emphasizes the number of distinct allowed third-party domains as the true privacy metric.
- **Relying on synthetic ad-blocker tests:** uBO Scope uses real browser network APIs to show actual connections, avoiding deceptive benchmarks.
- **Ignoring stealth connections:** By highlighting stealth-blocked domains, uBO Scope reveals hidden tracking attempts often missed by other tools.

## Summary
uBO Scope uniquely addresses the needs of privacy advocates, filter list maintainers, and researchers by delivering unfiltered, categorized insights into every remote server connection made by your browser. Understanding the audience and their use cases frames how to derive maximum value from this tool — turning raw network data into clarity and actionable knowledge.
