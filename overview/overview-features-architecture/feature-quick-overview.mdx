## What uBO Scope Delivers

uBO Scope is designed to provide clear, precise insights into your browser's network activity regarding external servers. It offers:

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Supports major browsers including Chromium, Firefox, and Safari, assuring seamless integration regardless of your browser choice.
- **Real-Time Badge Count:** Displays a dynamic badge on your browser’s toolbar icon showing the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted. This number updates live, reflecting the current scope of external connections.
- **Network Request Categorization:** Segregates remote server connections into three categories:
  - **Allowed:** Connections that succeeded and were permitted.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests silently redirected or blocked by content blockers without being easily detectable.
  - **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked or failed.
- **Popup UI for Detailed Insights:** Clicking the toolbar icon opens a popup showing a comprehensive breakdown of these connections, listing the domains and how frequently each is contacted.

## Why These Features Matter to You

By exposing detailed third-party connection data, uBO Scope helps you:

- **Visualize Privacy Exposure:** Understand exactly which and how many external servers your current browsing session touches.
- **Validate Content Blockers:** Confirm how effective your content blockers are by observing actual network outcomes rather than block counts alone.
- **Make Informed Decisions:** Empower your browsing with knowledge, deciding to allow or block specific servers or adjust your filter lists accordingly.

## Exploring the Popup and Badge

### Toolbar Badge

The badge count reflects the number of unique third-party domains your browser contacted during the current tab session. A lower count typically indicates fewer external connections, contributing to better privacy.

### Popup Panel Breakdown

Upon clicking the badge icon, the popup displays the following:

- **Hostname Summary:** Shows the main website domain currently active in the tab.
- **Connection Summary:** The total number of connected third-party domains.
- **Detailed Sections:** Three clearly labeled sections categorize domains:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains with allowed connections.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Domains for which connections were explicitly blocked or errored.

Each domain is accompanied by a count indicating the number of requests involving it.

## Real-World Example

Imagine loading a news website that pulls advertisements, analytics, and content from various third parties. With uBO Scope:

- The badge number immediately indicates how many distinct third-party domains the site attempts to communicate with.
- Opening the popup reveals which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, exposing potential privacy risks or the effectiveness of your blocking setup.

## Tips for Using Feature Quick Overview

- Regularly glance at the badge to monitor changes in external connections as you navigate websites.
- Use the popup panel whenever you want to investigate unexpected connections or validate that important third parties aren’t unnecessarily blocked.
- Combine insights from these features with other uBO Scope pages such as the [Monitoring Third-Party Connections Guide](/guides/core-workflow/monitor-connections) to deepen your understanding.
