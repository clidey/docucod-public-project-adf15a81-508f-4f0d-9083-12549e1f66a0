# Why Use uBO Scope?

Discover the essential benefits of using uBO Scope, an insightful tool designed to empower you with accurate reporting on third-party server connections. Beyond simple block count metrics, uBO Scope reveals the true landscape of your browser’s network activity, helping you and filter list maintainers make informed, privacy-conscious decisions.

## Understanding the Real Impact of Third-Party Connections

When you visit a website, your browser doesn't just communicate with that one site — it often connects to many remote third-party servers. These connections can impact your privacy silently. uBO Scope shines a light on these interactions, providing a detailed picture of:

- Which third-party servers your browser actually connects to,
- Which requests were allowed,
- Which were stealth-blocked (redirected or hidden),
- Which were fully blocked.

This transparency enables you to clearly assess the real network activity taking place and make decisions based on actual connection data.

## Debunking Misleading Metrics

Many users rely on simplistic block count badges to judge the effectiveness of content blockers. uBO Scope clarifies the misconception:

> The toolbar badge represents the *number of distinct third-party servers your browser connected to*, not a raw count of blocked elements.

### Common Misunderstandings uBO Scope Challenges:

- **"Higher block count means better protection."**
  - A higher block count may indicate more requests blocked *but* can also mean the browser fetched from more third-party servers overall. This can counterintuitively mean *less* effective blocking.

- **"Ad blocker test sites are definitive."**
  - Such sites often use contrived network requests that don't represent real-world browsing behavior. uBO Scope’s data reflects *actual* network requests made during typical browsing.

By delivering accurate counts of distinct third-party connections rather than inflated block tallies, uBO Scope helps you evaluate privacy protections correctly.

## Support for Privacy-Conscious Choices

With uBO Scope, users gain actionable insights:

- Understand the network footprint of visited websites beyond just counts.
- Identify stealthy redirects or blocked connections that might not be obvious.
- Distinguish between allowed and blocked domains at a glance.

These insights help you choose and configure content blockers or filter lists more effectively.

### Helping Filter List Maintainers

Filter list maintainers can leverage uBO Scope to:

- Analyze real-world domain connection data where browser tools might be limited,
- Refine filter lists based on precise outcomes rather than guesswork,
- Understand the nuances between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains for improved filter accuracy.

## A Practical Tool for Real-World Privacy

uBO Scope fills a unique niche as an unobtrusive utility that measures the network activity underpinning your browsing privacy. It uses your browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor and report:

- All network requests made by the browser,
- Outcomes of these requests: success, error, or redirect,
- Aggregated domain counts for allowed, stealth, and blocked outcomes per tab.

This approach ensures you see reliable, in-browser data that reflects actual behavior, no matter which content blocker you use.

The badge count shown on the toolbar icon is a count of *distinct allowed third-party domains*, making it a direct indicator of your exposure to third-party servers — lower counts mean fewer third parties accessed.

## Real Scenario: Why Does This Matter?

Imagine you use two different content blockers. One shows a higher block count — you might think it’s better. But uBO Scope reveals that this blocker still allows connections to more distinct third-party servers, exposing you to more potential tracking. Conversely, a blocker with fewer block counts might actually restrict more third-party connections, protecting your privacy better.

By providing clarity here, uBO Scope helps avoid misguided choices based on superficial metrics.
