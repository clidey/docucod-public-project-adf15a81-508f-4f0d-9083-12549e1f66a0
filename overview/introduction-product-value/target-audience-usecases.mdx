# Who Is It For? Key Use Cases

uBO Scope is thoughtfully designed for a select group of users who value transparency, control, and insight into the web connections their browsers make. Understanding the typical users helps you see how uBO Scope fits seamlessly into privacy-conscious workflows and filter maintenance tasks.

---

## Primary User Profiles

### 1. Privacy-Conscious Individuals

Every time you visit a website, your browser may connect to multiple third-party servers—often without your knowledge. These interactions can compromise your privacy by sharing your browsing data across domains. If you care about who your browser talks to and want a clear window into these connections, uBO Scope gives you that transparency.

**How they benefit:**
- **Real-time insight:** See exactly which domains your browser communicates with, at every browsing session.
- **Informed decisions:** Understand which third-party connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked.
- **Badge count clarity:** The toolbar badge displays the number of distinct third-party servers your browser successfully contacted, helping you gauge exposure.

**Example:** A privacy-aware user visits a news site and wants to verify no unexpected third-party trackers are active. Using uBO Scope, they immediately see all the connected domains categorized by allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining effective content blocking lists requires a deep understanding of how browsers interact with various network connections. uBO Scope serves as a powerful companion tool for maintainers by reporting network requests regardless of whether an extension or DNS server blocks them.

**How they leverage uBO Scope:**
- **Network observation:** Track all remote server connection attempts on devices where direct browser developer tools may be limited or unavailable.
- **Validation of filter efficacy:** Confirm what is actually blocked versus allowed in real-world use cases, beyond ideal test scenarios.
- **Insight into stealth blocking:** Identify connections that are redirected or blocked stealthily by content blockers.

**Practical scenario:** A list maintainer tests changes on a mobile device with limited debugging tools. uBO Scope transparently reports the domain-level connections, helping verify the impact and identify new third parties to add to the filter.

### 3. Curious and Security-Minded Web Users

Not everyone must be a privacy expert to gain value from uBO Scope. Users who simply want to peek behind the curtain of website network activity, debunk myths around blockers, or satisfy curiosity about the behavior of web pages also gain from employing uBO Scope.

**Why they care:**
- **Myth busting:** Understand why ad blocker test pages don’t tell the full story and why block count alone doesn’t indicate blocker quality.
- **Exploratory analysis:** Discover third parties involved on sites they trust or question.
- **Educational value:** Learn how network requests work and how blockers affect them.

**Example:** A user notices odd network activity from a site and uses uBO Scope to uncover unexpected third-party domains, helping them decide whether to block these sites or stay cautious.

## Integration into User Workflows

Whether you're protecting your privacy, maintaining filter lists, or satisfying your curiosity, uBO Scope fits naturally into your browsing process:

- **Monitoring:** Open the uBO Scope popup after loading a webpage to promptly review domain connections.
- **Decision-making:** Use the insights to tweak block settings, whitelist trusted domains, or report suspicious activity.
- **Verification:** Quickly confirm the effectiveness of blockers beyond simplistic badge counts or unreliable ad-blocker tests.


## Key Takeaways

- uBO Scope **empowers privacy-conscious users** to gain clarity on third-party connections.
- It provides **filter list maintainers with crucial data** in environments lacking full debugging tools.
- It serves **curious users interested in demystifying** network activity and common blocking misconceptions.

By focusing on outcome-driven transparency, uBO Scope transforms complex network tracking into actionable, understandable insights for these users.
