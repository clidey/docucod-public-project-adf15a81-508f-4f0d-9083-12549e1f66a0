# Who Is It For & Typical Use Cases

## Understanding the Audience for uBO Scope

uBO Scope is designed with a diverse group of users in mind—ranging from privacy-focused individuals to professionals who maintain filter lists or need detailed visibility into web network activity. By revealing all network connections attempted or completed by your browser on a per-tab basis, uBO Scope empowers users with clarity and control over what behind-the-scenes activity occurs while surfing the web.

### Primary Audiences

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Individuals committed to understanding and minimizing their exposure to third-party trackers and remote connections. For these users, uBO Scope offers a transparent window into real-time connections, helping them verify the effectiveness of their content blockers beyond mere block counts or external tests.

- **Filter List Maintainers:** Those who create or maintain filter lists for content blockers benefit from uBO Scope’s detailed insights into actual network requests and outcomes. It reveals domains and hosts allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, enabling the refinement of lists with real evidence collected from browser activity.

- **Browser Power-Users and Developers:** Professionals and tech-savvy users who want to audit third-party connections, verify stealth blocking techniques, or evaluate how different content blockers behave in practice will find uBO Scope indispensable for revealing the truth behind various network requests.

## Typical Use Cases

### Auditing Third-Party Connections

When browsing, webpages often connect to various third-party domains, some of which are related to trackers, ads, analytics, or content delivery networks (CDNs). uBO Scope helps users audit these connections by reporting:

- Which third-party domains the browser contacted
- Which connections were allowed
- Which were blocked outright
- Which were stealth-blocked, i.e., blocked without alerting the webpage

This auditing allows users to verify if their content blocker or network filters are effectively limiting unwanted connections.

### Debunking Misleading Metrics from Content Blockers and Adblock Tester Sites

Many assume that a content blocker that reports a higher block count is more effective or that "ad blocker test" websites provide reliable measures of blocker quality. uBO Scope disproves these myths by providing accurate data on actual connections:

- **Clarifying Block Count Myths:** Users see that a higher block count badge can sometimes mean more network requests are being made and then blocked, not fewer allowed connections. The real measure is the number of distinct third-party servers allowed.

- **Neutralizing Adblock Tester Fallacies:** Since many extension-based blockers use stealth techniques to prevent detection, traditional adblock test sites that rely on artificial requests give misleading results. uBO Scope shows the actual behavior independent of these tests.

### Evaluating Network Request Stealthiness and Effectiveness

Stealth blocking prevents webpages from detecting that a connection has been blocked. uBO Scope categorizes such stealth-blocked connections separately, helping users and developers:

- Understand how stealth blocking affects network visibility
- Detect stealth-blocked domains versus fully blocked or allowed domains
- Evaluate the behavior of content blockers or DNS filtering setups irrespective of their internal mechanisms

This reveals a deeper picture of the network landscape behind any webpage visit.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine you are using a content blocker and notice conflicting information: a high number of blocked requests but still receiving targeted ads. Using uBO Scope, you open the extension's popup while browsing to see:

- A list of allowed third-party domains—showing some connections that slipped past the blocker
- Stealth-blocked domains—these connections were hidden from the webpage, explaining why block counts alone don’t tell the full story
- Fully blocked domains—webpages tried to connect, but your blocker stopped them outright.

This insight helps you tune your filters or decide on a better blocking strategy.

## Summary

uBO Scope is an essential tool for anyone serious about transparent web browsing and content blocking. By providing detailed real-time insights into third-party connections, it lets users audit, analyze, and verify network activity beyond the surface metrics typically offered. Whether you’re a privacy advocate, content blocker maintainer, or power user, uBO Scope equips you with the knowledge to make informed decisions about your web experience.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Regularly review connections reported by uBO Scope when visiting sensitive or frequently used websites to understand and manage your exposure.
- Filter list maintainers should use uBO Scope to cross-check real-world request outcomes with filter rules for improved accuracy.
- Use the separation of allowed, stealth, and blocked domains to better understand what kinds of requests your current content blockers hide versus outright block.
- Always interpret badge counts in context; a lower number of distinct allowed domains indicates tighter control of third-party connections.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **No data showing on the popup:** Ensure you have the extension properly installed and permissions granted, as uBO Scope relies on browser `webRequest` API access.
- **Badge count seems inaccurate:** Remember, it counts distinct allowed third-party domains per tab, not the total number of requests.
- **Differences in blocking results compared to other blockers:** uBO Scope reports actual network requests observed by the browser, independent of content blocking methods; discrepancies can help diagnose stealth or DNS-based blocking.
