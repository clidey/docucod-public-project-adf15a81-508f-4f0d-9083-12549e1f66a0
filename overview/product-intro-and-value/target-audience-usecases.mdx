# Who Should Use It and Why?

uBO Scope is designed to serve a distinct set of users who all share one common need: transparency and accuracy in understanding their browser's network connections. This page clarifies who benefits most from uBO Scope and provides practical scenarios that demonstrate its powerful role in empowering users to make informed decisions about their online privacy and content blocking strategies.

## Target Audiences

### Privacy-Focused Browser Users
Every day, browsers connect silently to numerous remote servers, often without explicit awareness. For users deeply concerned about their privacy, uBO Scope shines a light on every connection attempt made by the browser—whether allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked—offering an unfiltered view of network activity. This transparency reveals which third-party domains your browser really connects to, helping you maintain control over your data exposure.

### Filter List Maintainers and Content Blocker Developers
Filter lists form the backbone of content blockers by defining what should be blocked or allowed. For maintainers working on these lists, uBO Scope acts as an indispensable auditing tool. It provides reliable, network-level insights that remain consistent regardless of the content blocker in use or environmental variables such as DNS-blocking. On devices where developer tools are limited or unavailable, this perspective is crucial for verifying filter list effectiveness and refining blocking strategies.

### Users Fact-Checking Ad Blocker Claims
Ad blocker performance claims on websites often rely on superficial metrics such as block counts or fabricated test cases. Those skeptical of these claims can use uBO Scope to independently verify what connections are actually being allowed or blocked in real browsing sessions. This helps separate marketing noise from genuine blocking efficacy, empowering users to choose solutions that truly protect their privacy.

## Primary and Secondary Use Cases

### Empowered Testing of Content Blockers and Filter Lists
You want to know if your content blocker is working as promised — not just by reported block counts but by actual network outcomes. uBO Scope tracks every network request your browser initiates and classifies them as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked. This classification equips you to:

- Validate if your content blocker stealthily blocks trackers without leaving telltale signs.
- Identify unexpected allowed connections that might undermine your privacy.
- Confirm that your filter lists are performing correctly in real-world conditions.

**Example:** After applying a new filter list update, you observe the network connections in uBO Scope’s popup. You spot a suspicious third-party domain still marked as allowed, prompting you to adjust your filters or raise an issue with the list maintainers.

### Audit Network Connections on Restrictive or Limited Devices
Not all browsing environments support advanced developer tools or extensive installation permissions. uBO Scope fills this gap by providing a lightweight way to audit network requests directly from the toolbar popup. This is invaluable for administrators or power users who need to perform quick checks or diagnostics without complex setups.

### Fact-Based Diagnosis and Myth Busting
Users often rely on misleading metrics, such as badge block counts or ad block test sites, to infer privacy protection quality. uBO Scope helps debunk these myths by:

- Explaining that a high block count does not necessarily mean better blocking.
- Demonstrating that test sites may fail to accurately reflect real-world blocking behavior.
- Offering a precise badge count reflecting distinct third-party domains contacted, which is a truer privacy indicator.

## Key Benefits for Users

- **Transparency Over Network Activity:** See every third-party domain your browser connects to in real-time — not filtered by content blockers or DNS-based filters.
- **Unbiased, Accurate Insights:** Gain confidence that the network outcomes reported are accurate and independent of extension stealth or site tricks.
- **Improved Privacy Decision-Making:** Use detailed connection data to tune blockers, choose between privacy tools, and verify claims independently.

##### Example User Journey

Imagine you're a privacy-conscious user who has just installed a new ad blocker. You notice the block count badge, but feel uncertain if it's working correctly. Opening uBO Scope, you see a manageable number of third-party domains actually contacted, all marked clearly as allowed or blocked. You spot one domain marked "stealth-blocked," revealing your ad blocker silently prevented a connection without raising alarms, confirming its stealth feature is working as advertised. This transparency gives you confidence and control over your browsing privacy.
