# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover the True Reach of Every Webpage Connection

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to give you a transparent, vendor-neutral view of all network connections attempted or successfully made by webpages you visit. It reveals every third-party remote server contacted per browser tab, providing you a clear picture of who your browser is actually talking to behind the scenes.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You

- **Transparent mapping of connections:** See every distinct remote domain a webpage communicates with, beyond what typical content blockers reveal.
- **Third-party focus:** Track the variety and number of third-party servers accessed, helping you understand external dependencies.
- **Independent of content blockers:** Reports network connections regardless of which blocker you use or if they are blocked by DNS or other means — as long as the browser reports the request.
- **Badge count insight:** The toolbar icon shows how many unique third-party servers connected per tab — a lower number means fewer external connections.
- **Myth-busting data:** Debunks common misconceptions about blocker effectiveness by focusing on what really matters: distinct remote servers, not just block counts.

### Who Benefits from uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users wanting visibility into external connections made by websites.
- Filter list maintainers seeking accurate data for improving ad and tracker blocking.
- Security professionals analyzing third-party reach of web content.
- Anyone curious about the network footprint of their browsing.

## What Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension that listens to network requests reported by the browser through its `webRequest` API. It collects and aggregates data on the origins of these requests, categorizing them by their outcome per tab:

- **Allowed (not blocked):** Domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections that were redirected or silently prevented.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed due to content blocking or errors.

Its core purpose is to illuminate all remote servers contacted by a webpage, especially third-party domains. Unlike traditional block counters, which measure the number of blocked requests, uBO Scope highlights the diversity and count of distinct external domains reached. This offers users a truer sense of their exposure network-wide.

### Unique Advantages

- **Vendor-neutral reporting:** Shows connections regardless of which content blocker or DNS filter is active, relying on native browser network event reporting.
- **Per-tab awareness:** Tracks third-party domains individually per browser tab for precise context.
- **Real-world accuracy:** Avoids misleading metrics from synthetic "ad blocker test" websites, focusing on actual browsing behavior.

## How uBO Scope Works

Operating silently in the background, uBO Scope listens to the browser’s network events:

- When a **network request starts, redirects, succeeds, or fails**, uBO Scope records details including URL, hostname, and outcome.
- It aggregates allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains separately.
- For each open browser tab, the extension dynamically updates the count of distinct allowed third-party domains, reflected as a badge on the toolbar icon.
- Within the popup interface, users can explore detailed lists of connected domains sorted by their access status.

This data empowers you to understand the real network activity per site without guessing.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Real-time connection monitoring:** Active tracking of all network requests initiated by webpages.
- **Distinct domain counting:** Counts unique third-party domains instead of raw request numbers to give meaningful insights.
- **Per-tab tracking:** Isolates data to individual tabs for contextual clarity.
- **Outcome categorization:** Splits connections into "allowed," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" for precise analysis.
- **Badge display:** Shows an at-a-glance summary of third-party connection count on the browser toolbar.
- **Popup UI details:** Provides an easy-to-read interface listing domains and request counts in each category.

### Example Scenario

Imagine you open a news website. uBO Scope immediately counts and displays that this site connected to 12 unique third-party domains—perhaps content delivery networks, analytics providers, or advertisers. Even if your content blocker blocks many requests, this count reflects all third-party connections that ultimately succeeded, helping you make informed decisions.

## Why Should You Care?

### Outcomes You Can Expect

- **Enhanced transparency:** Understand exactly which external domains your browser communicates with per website.
- **Improved privacy control:** Identify unexpected or excessive third-party connections.
- **Reliable blocker assessment:** Move beyond block-count myths to evaluate real blocking effectiveness.
- **Filter list improvement:** Support filter list authors with accurate, real-world data.

### Common Use Cases

- Privacy-conscious individuals auditing their online footprint.
- Filter list maintainers refining blocklists based on observed third-party connections.
- Security analyses focusing on reducing attack surface by minimizing external calls.
- Users comparing content blockers beyond the simplistic block count metrics.

### Before & After uBO Scope

| Without uBO Scope                             | With uBO Scope                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Guessing the number and impact of third parties based on block counts. | Seeing exact counts and categories of third-party connections per tab. |
| Misinterpreting higher block counts as better protection.            | Understanding that fewer allowed connections represent stronger privacy. |
| Relying on synthetic tests that don’t represent real browsing.        | Evaluating connections on actual websites you use every day.             |

## Getting Started Preview

Getting up and running with uBO Scope is straightforward:

1. **Install the extension** from the Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons site, or relevant browser marketplace.
2. Watch as the toolbar icon displays a badge count showing the number of distinct third-party domains for each active tab.
3. Click the extension icon to open the popup, where you can explore detailed lists of domains categorized by allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.

### Prerequisites

- A supported browser such as Chromium-based browsers, Firefox (version 128+), or Safari (version 18.5+).
- Browser support for the `webRequest` API to allow network request observation.
