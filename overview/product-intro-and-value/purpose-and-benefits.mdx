description: "An easy-to-understand summary of uBO Scope’s mission: revealing all connection attempts—blocked, allowed, or stealth—to remote servers, regardless of which content blocker you’re using. Explains the badge count and why distinct third-party requests matter more than raw block counts, helping demystify common misconceptions about ad blocking and privacy. Establishes the business value for users and filter list maintainers."

# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Your Browser Makes — Clearly and Reliably

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to expose every network connection attempt your browser makes—successful, blocked, or stealth. By tracking requests to remote servers with precision, it equips you with an accurate understanding of web activity, independent of any content blocker you use.

### Why This Matters

- **Complete Visibility**: See all third-party servers your browser interacts with in real-time.
- **Accurate Insights**: Distinguished between allowed, stealth-blocked, and outright blocked connections — no guesswork.
- **Simplified Metrics**: The badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party servers connected, not just raw block totals.
- **Myth Busting**: Understand why high block counts don't necessarily mean better blocking.
- **Support for Filter Maintainers**: Identify real-world behavior to refine privacy and blocking lists.

### Designed For

- Privacy-conscious users wanting transparency about their web connections.
- Filter list maintainers seeking to verify filter efficacy.
- Anyone interested in debunking misconceptions about ad blockers and network activity.

## What is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a companion extension to uBlock Origin, dedicated to monitoring network requests made by webpages. It listens to all network traffic reported by the browser’s `webRequest` API, regardless of the content blocker in use, capturing every remote server connection attempt.

uBO Scope reveals:

- Connections that succeeded (allowed).
- Connections that were blocked outright.
- Connections that were stealth-blocked (blocked before the browser considered them).

By focusing on the number of **distinct third-party remote servers contacted** rather than the number of individual blocked requests, uBO Scope presents a more meaningful measure of exposure and tracking surface.

### What Problem Does uBO Scope Solve?

Content blockers often report raw counts of blocked requests, but these are misleading. A higher block count can mean the blocker *allowed* more unique third-party connections because it lets many requests from fewer servers through, while a lower block count may reflect more aggressive domain-level blocking.

uBO Scope bridges this gap by offering a clear, easy-to-understand count — the number of unique third-party domains contacted — providing actionable insight into the true extent of remote resource fetching.

### Key Differentiators

- Works alongside any content blocker, showing network activity as reported *independently* of blocking rules.
- Monitors connections at multiple levels: domain, hostname, and request outcomes.
- Tracks stealth blocking, allowing debunking of false impressions created by ad-blocking test sites.
- Provides intuitive real-time feedback through a browser badge and detailed popup insights.

### How It Works (High-Level)

uBO Scope hooks into the browser’s `webRequest` API to observe requests for every tab. It categorizes each request outcome as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked and aggregates counts per hostname and domain. These details are then summarized and visualized for the user, updating dynamically as you browse.

It also leverages a public suffix list to accurately derive domain boundaries for grouping counts.

## Understanding the Badge and Connection Counts

The toolbar icon badge displays the **number of distinct third-party domains** your current tab has connected to. "Third-party" means servers that are different from the main website’s domain you’re visiting.

**Why focus on distinct third-party domains?** Because true exposure to third-party trackers and content servers is best represented by how many different domains your browser interacts with. Multiple requests to the same domain count as one, reflecting the actual reach of external connections.

### Practical Implications

- A *lower* badge count suggests fewer third-party communications and potentially better privacy.
- A *higher* number indicates more distinct remote connections, highlighting increased exposure.

## Debunking Common Myths

### Myth 1: "Higher block counts mean better blocking."

Block counts alone are misleading. A content blocker might have more blocked requests but still allow connections to a larger number of third parties. uBO Scope clarifies that what truly matters is how many unique third-party domains are contacted unblocked, not the sheer volume of blocked requests.

### Myth 2: "Ad blocker test sites show reliable blocking results."

These test sites often rely on fabricated network requests that don’t reflect real-world browsing, and can’t detect stealth blocking methods. uBO Scope reports live traffic from actual browsing, avoiding misleading conclusions.
