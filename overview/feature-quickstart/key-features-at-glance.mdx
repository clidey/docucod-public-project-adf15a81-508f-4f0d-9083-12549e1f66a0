# Key Features at a Glance

Discover uBO Scope’s essential capabilities that empower you to uncover your browser’s remote network connections with unprecedented clarity and accuracy. This page summarizes the core features designed to give you actionable insights for privacy analysis during everyday browsing.

---

## What This Page Covers

This documentation focuses on the main features accessible via the uBO Scope popup interface and browser toolbar icon badge. It outlines how uBO Scope identifies and reports third-party domains per browser tab, its reliability regardless of content blockers, the intuitive badge count, and compatibility with major browsers. These features combined enable you to analyze the privacy implications of your browsing in real time, without guesswork.

## Understanding uBO Scope’s Core Features

### 1. Comprehensive Third-Party Domain Listings Per Tab

uBO Scope monitors every network request your browser attempts or completes for each open tab and categorizes involved third-party domains. The popup interface groups these domains into three distinct categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains from which the browser successfully fetched resources.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were redirected or stealth-blocked by content blockers.
- **Blocked**: Domains where connections failed or were explicitly blocked.

This granular view lets you quickly identify all third-party servers contacted during your browsing session, helping you understand which domains could impact your privacy.

### 2. Reporting Connection Outcomes Independently of Content Blockers

Unlike tools that rely on block counts or filter list indications, uBO Scope reports actual network request outcomes based on browser webRequest events. This means it reveals whether a request succeeded, was redirected silently (stealth-blocked), or blocked, regardless of which content blockers or DNS filters you use.

**Benefit:**
- See the real network activity your browser performs rather than relying on blocker claims.
- Validate effectiveness and transparency of your content blocking setup.

### 3. Intuitive Toolbar Badge Counts

The toolbar icon badge number reflects the count of **distinct third-party domains successfully connected to** on the active tab.

- A **lower count** indicates fewer third-party connections, generally better for privacy.
- If the count is zero, the badge is empty, signaling no third-party connections observed.

This live count gives you at-a-glance awareness of network activity without opening the popup.

### 4. Cross-Browser Compatibility Support

uBO Scope runs seamlessly on all major browsers that expose the `webRequest` API:

- Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.)
- Mozilla Firefox (desktop and Android)
- Apple Safari (with limited support)

This ensures you can apply the same transparency and privacy insights regardless of your preferred browser.

## Real-World User Scenario

Imagine you are visiting a news site:

1. The toolbar badge shows 5, informing you that 5 distinct third-party domains were contacted by the page.
2. Opening the popup reveals the list of these domains grouped by whether they were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
3. You notice that three domains are stealth-blocked — suggesting your content blocker is silently preventing tracking.
4. One domain is blocked outright due to a failed connection.
5. The allowed domains include content delivery networks (CDNs) known for legitimate resource hosting.

This immediate transparency lets you understand the real network footprint of the visited site and adjust your privacy settings accordingly.

## Practical Tips for Maximizing Feature Value

- **Regularly monitor the badge count** as you browse different sites to quickly spot unusual third-party activity.
- **Use the popup to drill down on domains** involved in stealth- or outright blocking for filter list troubleshooting.
- **Combine uBO Scope with other privacy tools** to validate the effectiveness of your overall content blocking setup.
- **Remember** that not all third-party domains are malicious—some are essential CDNs or service providers.
