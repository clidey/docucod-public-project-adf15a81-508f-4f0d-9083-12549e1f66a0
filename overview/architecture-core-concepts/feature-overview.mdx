# Feature Overview & Quickstart

## Discover the Power of uBO Scope at a Glance

uBO Scope provides an immediate window into your browser's network activity, revealing every connection attempt webpages make to remote servers in real time. This page previews the extension’s cornerstone features—live visualization of server connections, detailed domain summaries per browser tab, intuitive status badges, and seamless multi-browser support. Additionally, it offers a rapid startup guide to help you install and begin leveraging uBO Scope within minutes.

---

## Key Features in Focus

- **Real-Time Server Connection Visualization:** Watch your browser’s outgoing connections as they happen, categorized by whether requests were allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked.
- **Detailed Per-Tab Summaries:** View comprehensive breakdowns of connected domains for each active tab, enabling you to quickly identify third-party servers involved.
- **Intuitive Status Badge:** The extension’s toolbar icon dynamically displays the count of distinct third-party domains connected — a direct measure of network exposure.
- **Multi-Browser Compatibility:** Supports popular browsers including Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari, ensuring a consistent experience across your devices.
- **Lightweight and Non-Intrusive:** Built as a companion extension to uBlock Origin, it unobtrusively tracks and reports network activity without altering webpage behavior.

## Why This Matters for You

Webpages often call out to numerous third-party servers, which can impact your privacy, security, and browsing speed. With uBO Scope, you gain clarity on exactly which remote servers your browser interacts with, no matter which content blockers or DNS filters are active. Seeing this data in real time empowers you to:

- Understand and audit your web browsing footprint.
- Validate the effectiveness of content blockers beyond simple block counts.
- Detect stealth blocking behaviors that hide blocked requests from webpages.
- Inform filter list maintainers or privacy audits with precise network insights.

Real examples include discovering unexpected connections on a new website or verifying the stealth-blocking efficiency of your filters.

## Quickstart Guide: Install and Explore in Minutes

Getting started with uBO Scope is straightforward. Follow these practical steps for immediate insights:

### Step 1: Install uBO Scope

- **Chromium Browsers:** Get uBO Scope from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
- **Firefox:** Install via [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
- **Safari:** Available via the Safari Extensions Gallery, compatible with Safari 18.5 and above.

### Step 2: Launch the Extension

After installation, click the uBO Scope icon next to your address bar. The popup UI will load and display a summary for the active browser tab.

### Step 3: Explore the Real-Time Network Summary

- The top header shows the current active tab’s hostname.
- Below, see counts of distinct domains connected, separated into “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked.”
- Each section lists domains and the number of requests seen.
- The toolbar icon badge reflects the total count of distinct allowed third-party domains.

### Step 4: Use Regularly for Transparency

Check uBO Scope as you browse to gain continuous awareness of third-party connections and blocking effectiveness.

## Understanding the Popup UI

The popup consists of three outcome sections that classify network request results:

| Outcome         | Meaning                                                                             |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked** | Requests allowed through—resources fetched from these domains are loaded normally.   |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Requests silently blocked without site knowledge—blocking occurs stealthily.     |
| **Blocked**     | Requests explicitly blocked by the content blocker or browser.                      |

Each section lists connected domains alongside request counts. This detailed view helps you pinpoint which third parties are active, which are silently blocked, and which are outright denied.

---

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Interpret Badge Counts Wisely:** A lower badge number signifies fewer third-party connections, which is preferable for privacy.
- **Combine with Content Blockers:** Use uBO Scope alongside uBlock Origin to validate blocking behaviors effectively.
- **Review Stealth Blocking:** Leverage the stealth-blocked category to detect sophisticated blocking methods that don’t cause visible errors.
- **Periodic Monitoring:** Regularly check connections on new or unfamiliar sites to be aware of unexpected tracking or CDN usage.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

- **Popup Showing ‘NO DATA’:** Ensure you have active tabs loaded with content and reload the popup.
- **Badge Not Updating:** Verify uBO Scope has proper permissions and is enabled.
- **Incompatible Browser Version:** Confirm your browser meets the minimum version requirements (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

If issues persist, refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](https://docs.uBoScope/getting-started/validation-support/troubleshooting) guide.
