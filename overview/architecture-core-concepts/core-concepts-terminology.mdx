# Essential Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the terminology behind uBO Scope is the foundation for effective use and accurate interpretation of its network connection insights. This page clearly defines the key concepts and terms you'll encounter within uBO Scope’s interface and reports, empowering you to confidently navigate and interpret every detail.

## Core Terminology

### Third-Party Remote Server
A 'third-party remote server' is any external server contacted by your browser that is not part of the current website you are visiting. These connections often include requests to domains such as ad networks, analytics providers, CDNs, and other services.

*Why it matters:* Tracking these third-party connections reveals the extent of external monitoring and resource loading beyond what the main site serves.

### Domain Connection
A domain connection represents an attempt by your browser to communicate with a domain (group of related hostnames under a common domain name). uBO Scope tracks connections per domain rather than just per hostname, focusing on the actual third-party domains involved.

*Example:* Connections to `cdn.example.com` and `images.example.com` both count towards the single domain `example.com`.

### Request Outcomes
uBO Scope classifies each network request based on its final state:

- **Allowed:** The request succeeded and was not blocked.
- **Blocked:** The request was explicitly blocked by the content blocking mechanism.
- **Stealth-blocked:** The request was blocked in a way designed to be invisible or stealthy to the webpage, often through redirects or silent drops.

These outcomes help you distinguish between visible block actions and stealthy behaviors, providing a clear picture of what network traffic truly reaches third parties.

### Badge Count
The badge on the uBO Scope browser toolbar icon shows the number of *distinct third-party domains* for which at least one connection was allowed during the current tab session.

*Why it matters:* A lower badge count means fewer distinct third-party servers connected to, indicating potentially better privacy and content blocking effectiveness.

### Session Data
Within a browsing session, uBO Scope maintains detailed records per browser tab including:

- The main domain and hostname of the tab being monitored.
- Counts of connections grouped by outcome (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked).
- Network connection counts aggregated on both domain and hostname levels.

This session data underpins the real-time reports you see and is preserved for continuity during browsing until a tab is closed.

## Understanding the Popup Visual Indicators

The popup UI organizes network connection data into three distinct sections, each representing one of the request outcomes:

- **Not Blocked:** Lists all domains with allowed connections, alongside the number of times each domain was connected to.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Shows domains that were stealth-blocked, which may not appear as blocked to the visited webpage but are prevented silently.
- **Blocked:** Displays domains with blocked connections explicitly stopped by blockers.

Above these sections, the popup header shows the current tab's hostname and domain in a readable, Unicode format, helping you identify the scope of monitoring.

The summary area provides the total count of distinct domains connected during the session.

### Real-World Example
Consider visiting a news website that loads content and ads from multiple providers. The popup will show:
- Domains like `news.example.com` under not blocked,
- Domains like `tracker.adsnetwork.com` under blocked,
- Domains like `cdn.analytics.com` under stealth-blocked if the requests were silently suppressed.

Seeing these categories separately helps you grasp what third parties your browser really talks to and what is blocked or modified behind the scenes.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Focus on Domain-Level Insight:** Assess privacy impact and blocking effectiveness based on distinct domains rather than raw counts of requests.
- **Use Badge Count as Your Quick Privacy Indicator:** The badge number instantly informs how many distinct third parties your tab has contacted.
- **Interpret Stealth Blocks with Care:** Stealth-blocking means the blocking is hidden from page scripts, possibly indicating stronger privacy protection.
- **Refresh or Revisit Tabs to Update Stats:** Session data updates dynamically, but to see fresh results, refresh your tab or open uBO Scope’s popup frequently during your session.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Confusing Block Counts with Total Requests:** The badge reflects allowed domain connections, not blocked request counts. Higher block counts don't always mean better blocking.
- **Ignoring Unicode Conversion:** Domain names shown are converted to Unicode for clarity. Don't mistake the encoded domain for a different address.
- **Assuming All Network Requests Are Visible:** uBO Scope relies on the browser’s webRequest API, which may not report requests made outside its scope.

By mastering these essential concepts and terminology, you'll unlock the full power of uBO Scope, gaining clarity on every connection your browser makes and making informed decisions about your privacy and content blocking setup.
