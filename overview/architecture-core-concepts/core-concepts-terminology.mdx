# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the essential terminology and foundational concepts of uBO Scope is key to making the most out of this extension. This page defines critical terms related to how uBO Scope tracks and reports network activity, and explains how the extension categorizes network request outcomes to present a clear, actionable view of your browser's remote connections.

## What Is a Third-Party Remote Server?

A **third-party remote server** refers to any external server that your browser connects to when loading a webpage, excluding the website's primary domain. These third-party servers often serve ads, analytics, content delivery, or other resources.

Why this matters: The badge count on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon represents the number of *distinct* third-party remote servers contacted during a browsing session. Monitoring these helps you discern how many unique external connections occur, an indicator of potential tracking or additional data sharing.


## Understanding the webRequest Listener

The extension leverages the browser's **webRequest API listeners** to capture network requests:

- It tracks all requests your browser attempts to make, including redirects, successful connections, and errors.
- These listeners monitor the lifecycle of network requests, enabling uBO Scope to categorize and record their outcomes.

Because uBO Scope reads straight from the browser's network traffic, it provides accurate insight regardless of the content blocker in place, assuming that network traffic is visible through the webRequest interface.


## Badge Count Explained

The **badge count** displayed on the extension’s icon shows the number of unique third-party domains from which resources were successfully allowed to load.

- A **lower badge count** generally means fewer third-party connections, which is often more desirable for privacy-conscious users.
- Note that the count only includes domains marked as "allowed"; blocked or stealth-blocked domains do not add to this count.


## What Is a Session in uBO Scope?

A **session** consists of all tracked network requests and their outcomes that are associated with a browser tab while it remains open.

- uBO Scope maintains a session state to aggregate connection details per tab.
- When a tab is closed, its session data is discarded.

Sessions enable the extension to present a comprehensive view of network activity restricted to a specific tab, improving clarity when analyzing connections.


## Categorizing Network Request Outcomes

uBO Scope classifies all network requests into three distinct categories to aid interpretation:

### Allowed

- These are requests that successfully connected to remote servers without being blocked.
- They represent third-party servers from which resources were actually loaded.

### Blocked

- Requests that failed due to being actively blocked by content blocking mechanisms.
- This lets users identify domains that did not succeed in loading resources during page load.

### Stealth-Blocked

- A special category for connections that were redirected or suppressed silently to avoid detection by webpages, ensuring content blockers remain stealthy.
- These requests never fully materialize as network connections but are intercepted early, invisible to web pages.

## How uBO Scope Determines Domains and Hostnames

To provide meaningful summaries and organize network requests, uBO Scope breaks down URLs into **hostnames** and **domains**:

- **Hostname:** The full server part of the URL, e.g., `cdn.example.com`.
- **Domain:** The registered domain extracted according to the Public Suffix List rules, e.g., `example.com`.

This distinction helps in grouping requests meaningfully by domain while still accounting for specific hostnames.


## Practical Workflow: How uBO Scope Works Under the Hood

When you load a webpage:

1. The extension listens to all network requests originating from the tab.
2. Each request is captured along with the event indicating its outcome (`success`, `redirect`, or `error`).
3. The domain and hostname are parsed from the request URL.
4. Based on the outcome, the request is categorized into one of the three buckets (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked) within the current tab's session.
5. These details accumulate until the tab is closed.
6. The toolbar badge updates in real-time to reflect the current count of allowed distinct third-party domains.
7. The popup interface presents a detailed breakdown of domains and their requests grouped by outcome category.

This approach ensures you see a live, tab-specific account of all server connections, enabling immediate insight into web tracking surface.

## Tips for Successful Interpretation

- **Remember the badge count is a count of unique third-party domains, not total requests.** Multiple requests to the same domain count as one.
- **Stealth-blocked connections show hidden blocking behavior:** Even when a request isn't visibly blocked, stealth blocking means the extension is silently preventing certain connections.
- **Domains shown are normalized using the Public Suffix List:** This means subdomains that share a registered domain are grouped together for clearer reporting.
- **Sessions are tab-specific:** To understand connections on multiple tabs, view the badge and popup for each tab separately.


## Common Pitfalls

- Confusing badge count with total blocked requests: A low badge count means fewer unique allowed domains, *not* necessarily that blocking was weak.
- Assuming all third-party domains are malicious: Some are legitimate CDNs and essential services.
- Expecting absolute blocking visibility on all network layers: uBO Scope relies on the browser's webRequest API; traffic outside that (e.g., native apps or browser internals) isn't reported.

## Summary

This page establishes the core terminology and operational framework essential for interpreting uBO Scope’s reports:

- Defines **third-party remote servers**, the counts of which drive the toolbar badge.
- Explains the **webRequest listener** role in capturing network activity.
- Clarifies **badge count meaning** and **session** scope.
- Describes how uBO Scope categorizes requests into **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth-blocked**.
- Outlines domain/hostname extraction and normalization.

These concepts underpin the extension's reporting and interface, forming the foundation for effective use and accurate privacy analysis.
