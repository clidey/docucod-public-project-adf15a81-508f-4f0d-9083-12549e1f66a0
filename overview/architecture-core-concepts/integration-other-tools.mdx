# Integration & Compatibility Overview

## Discover How uBO Scope Coexists with Other Content Blocking Tools

uBO Scope is designed to provide transparent, unbiased insight into your browser's network activity without interfering with your existing content blocking setup. In this overview, you'll learn how uBO Scope operates independently, integrates seamlessly alongside popular content blockers, and where practical limits exist in its observation capabilities. Armed with this knowledge, you'll have realistic expectations and best practices for leveraging uBO Scope in your privacy and network analysis workflows.

## How uBO Scope Operates Independently

At its core, uBO Scope is a passive observer of network requests your browser processes. It attaches listeners to the browser's `webRequest` API to track every connection attempt your browser makes, whether the request was allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked by other tools.

This means:

- **No Interference:** uBO Scope does not block or modify requests; it only monitors and reports outcomes.
- **Autonomous Data Collection:** Regardless of the presence or absence of other content blockers, uBO Scope maintains its own view of network requests.
- **Real-Time Visibility:** It captures these network events live as they happen during your browsing session, providing immediate and accurate feedback.

By observing through `webRequest` listeners, uBO Scope ensures its data remains unaffected by the control logic of other extensions, giving you an honest window into all third-party connections your browser attempts.

## Working Alongside Browser and Network-Level Blocking

Many users combine multiple layers of blocking to enhance privacy and reduce unwanted content. uBO Scope is built to coexist comfortably alongside these setups:

- **Browser Extension Blockers:** Whether you use powerful blockers like uBlock Origin, privacy extensions, or simpler ad blockers, uBO Scope continues to track network requests without interrupting their behavior.
- **DNS-Based or Network-Level Blocking:** Even when DNS servers or routers block certain domains upstream, uBO Scope captures the browser-side request attempts and resulting outcomes as visible through the browser's APIs.

This compatibility allows you to use uBO Scope as a verification and auditing tool to:

- Confirm third-party requests your blockers did not block.
- Detect stealth blocking where requests fail silently.
- Assess whether upstream DNS or network blocking impacts your browsing connections.

## What uBO Scope Can (and Cannot) Observe

Despite its broad reach, uBO Scope's observation depends on the browser's `webRequest` API, and this entails some limitations:

- **Scope of Observation:** It observes all HTTP and HTTPS requests as well as WebSocket connections (`ws://` and `wss://`) initiated within the browser.
- **Outside of webRequest Reach:** Requests made outside the browser's control or APIs, such as those by external applications or certain VPNs, are not visible to uBO Scope.
- **Network Protocols Not Covered:** Protocols other than HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket (e.g., FTP, DNS queries themselves, custom protocols) fall outside uBO Scope's reporting.

Understanding these boundaries helps you set realistic expectations. uBO Scope focuses on what the browser internally reports and cannot expose network traffic invisible to the browser’s APIs.

## Practical Benefits of This Compatibility

By operating as a passive observer with a broad but clearly defined visibility:

- You get **transparent network insights** without altering your browsing or blocking experience.
- You avoid conflicts, crashes, or performance degradation that could arise if multiple tools fought for request control.
- You can **correlate connection data** with the outcome of other blockers for a holistic understanding of your privacy posture.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to validate and compare actual network outcomes versus block lists.
- Remember that the count on uBO Scope’s badge reflects distinct third-party servers connected—not the number of blocked requests alone.
- Trust uBO Scope's insights, even if they differ from block counts reported by content blockers, because it reflects network reality.
- For advanced workflows, use uBO Scope data to support filter list maintenance, helping understand which third parties are genuinely contacted.

## Troubleshooting Common Integration Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title='Troubleshooting Integration Issues'>
<Accordion title='Why am I seeing connections that my content blocker claims to have blocked?'>
Even if your content blocker shows certain requests as blocked, uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API, which may report upstream failures such as DNS blocking or network errors as blocked outcomes. Additionally, stealth blocking—where requests fail silently or redirect without visible notification—can appear differently across tools. Use uBO Scope to verify these distinct behaviors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title='Does uBO Scope work with all major browsers?'>
Yes. uBO Scope supports Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari by using standardized `webRequest` APIs and following each platform’s extension manifest requirements. However, minimum browser versions apply (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title='Will uBO Scope slow down my browsing?'>
Because uBO Scope only listens to network events without interference, performance impact is minimal. Nonetheless, monitoring many tabs concurrently may increase resource usage marginally; this is typical for any network observer.

## Summary

- uBO Scope works as a passive observer using the browser’s `webRequest` API, ensuring no interference with other content blockers.
- It operates alongside browser extensions and network-level tools without conflict, capturing accurate real-time connection data.
- Observation scope covers HTTP/S and WebSocket protocols within the browser but excludes traffic outside `webRequest` reach.
- Understanding these boundaries allows users to set realistic expectations and leverage uBO Scope effectively for privacy analysis and filter list maintenance.
