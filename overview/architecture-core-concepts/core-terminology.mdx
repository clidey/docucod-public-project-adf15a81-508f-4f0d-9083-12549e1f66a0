# Key Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the core terminology behind uBO Scope is essential to fully grasp how the extension reports network connections and why these details matter for your online privacy and security. This page breaks down fundamental terms in clear, user-focused language, empowering you to interpret connection data confidently and effectively.

---

## Allowed Connections

An _allowed connection_ is a network request that successfully reaches a third-party server without being blocked. These connections indicate resources the browser fetched from remote servers during page loading or interaction.

- These represent third-party domains that your browser actually communicated with.
- A lower number of allowed connections means fewer external entities received your data.


## Blocked Domains

Blocked domains are third-party servers for which requests were made but were prevented from establishing a connection. Blocking can occur due to content blockers or network filters.

- Such domains do not have an active connection.
- They are counted separately to help distinguish blocked attempts from successful connections.


## Stealth-Blocking

_Stealth-blocking_ refers to network requests that were silently redirected or prevented without explicit browser error messages. This technique is commonly used by content blockers to avoid alerting the webpage or causing breakage.

- Stealth-blocked connections do not appear as errors.
- They represent a subtle but important layer of blocking happening behind the scenes.


## Third-Party Server

A _third-party server_ is any remote server contacted by a webpage that does not match the site's domain you are visiting.

- Examples include Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), analytics servers, ad providers.
- uBO Scope tracks connections to these servers regardless of blocking status.


## Badge Count

The _badge count_ is the number displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon. It indicates the **number of unique third-party remote servers for which a connection was made**.

- This is a crucial privacy metric, showing actual external connections.
- Unlike block counters on other content blockers, this count focuses on the real number of third-party domains contacted.
- Lower is better: fewer external connections means tighter privacy.


## webRequest API

The _webRequest API_ is a browser-provided interface that exposes network request lifecycle events to extensions.

- uBO Scope leverages this API to observe and record all network requests made by the browser.
- It captures requests regardless of content blockers being present, provided the browser reports them.
- Some network requests outside of the API’s scope, like certain DNS-level blocking or custom browser features, may not appear.

---

## How These Terms Fit Together

When you visit a webpage, it attempts to load resources from various servers. uBO Scope listens via the webRequest API to classify each connection attempt into one of these categories:

- Allowed connections: confirmed successful requests.
- Blocked connections: failed or refused requests due to blocking.
- Stealth-blocked connections: silently prevented requests.

The count of distinct third-party domains in allowed connections is prominently shown in the toolbar badge.


## Practical Examples

Imagine loading a news website:

- The page may load fonts from a CDN (allowed connection).
- It attempts to contact an ad server that your content blocker blocks (blocked domain).
- It also silently redirects an analytics request to prevent tracking (stealth-blocked).

uBO Scope reports all of these, giving you a holistic insight into third-party communications.


## Tips for Users

- Use the badge count as a trusted indicator of your exposure to third-party servers.
- Remember: a high block count on another extension does not guarantee fewer connections; always cross-check with uBO Scope.
- Review allowed domains carefully to identify unexpected or suspicious connections.


## Further Technical Exploration

For deeper understanding of how these concepts underpin uBO Scope’s architecture and workflows, consult the [How uBO Scope Works](/overview/architecture-core-concepts/system-architecture) page. It explains how the extension uses the webRequest API, manages session data, updates badges, and presents the connection data in the popup.

|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Allowed Connection| Network requests successfully completed to third-party servers.                             |
| Blocked Domain    | Third-party servers for which network requests were blocked or failed.                       |
| Stealth-Blocking  | Silent blocking or redirecting of requests without explicit errors.                          |
| Third-Party Server| Any remote server not matching the main site’s domain, contacted by the webpage.            |
| Badge Count       | Number on the extension icon indicating how many unique third-party servers were contacted. |
| webRequest API    | Browser interface that lets extensions monitor and react to network requests.               |

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions about Key Concepts">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count only show allowed domains and not blocked ones?">
The badge count reflects the number of unique third-party domains your browser successfully connected to. Blocked domains are intentionally excluded to show actual exposure rather than attempted access, giving you clearer insight into what data has potentially been shared.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is the difference between stealth-blocked and blocked connections?">
Stealth-blocked connections are silently prevented or redirected without notifying the webpage or the user. Blocked connections typically result in explicit errors or failures visible to standard monitoring tools.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope detect all network requests?">
uBO Scope listens to network requests reported through the browser's webRequest API. Any requests not observable by this API, such as those bypassing the browser or handled through DNS outside of the API's visibility, will not be reported.
