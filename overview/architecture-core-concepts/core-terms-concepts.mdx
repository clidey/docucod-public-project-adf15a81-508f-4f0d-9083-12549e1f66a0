# Key Concepts & Terminology

Welcome to the foundational page of uBO Scope, where we clarify the core concepts and terminology central to understanding how this privacy auditing and connection tracking extension works. Here, you'll gain a clear grasp of terms like third-party requests, badge counts, domain statuses, and more—expressed in straightforward language that connects directly to what you see and do within the extension.

## Why Understanding These Concepts Matters

Imagine browsing the web and wanting to know exactly which external domains your visited page connects to—and whether those connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked by your security settings. Without clear definitions, interpreting these signals could become confusing or misleading. This page serves as your guide to decoding uBO Scope's data, empowering you to glean meaningful insights about your online privacy.

## Core Terms Explained

### 1. Tab Hostname and Tab Domain
- **Tab Hostname:** The full hostname of the webpage currently active in your browser tab, e.g., `news.example.com`.
- **Tab Domain:** The registrable domain derived from the hostname by trimming subdomains based on the Public Suffix List. For example, for `news.example.com`, the tab domain is `example.com`.

#### Why This Matters
Understanding the difference helps you see which third-party servers are distinct from the main page's domain.

### 2. Third-Party Requests
These are network requests made by a webpage to domains other than the tab domain. For instance, if you visit `example.com`, but the page loads scripts or images from `analytics.com`, that counts as a third-party request.

**User Intent:** Identify external entities connected to a page, often a key privacy concern.

### 3. Domain Status Categories
uBO Scope classifies external domains into three statuses, reflecting how connections are handled:

- **Allowed:** Connections that successfully loaded and were not blocked.
- **Blocked:** Connections that were explicitly blocked, either by your browser or filter rules.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were stealthily blocked, typically avoided via redirection or other subtle means so as not to alert the third party.

Each category appears clearly in the popup interface, helping you interpret the nature of network connections.

### 4. Badge Counts
The badge visible on the browser action icon displays the count of distinct *allowed* third-party domains for the active tab. It doesn't count stealth-blocked or blocked domains.

**User Benefit:** Quickly understand how many external, successfully connected domains a webpage has, giving a snapshot of its third-party footprint.

### 5. Hostname vs. Domain Aggregation
- Requests are tracked both at the hostname level (e.g., `cdn.analytics.com`) and aggregated up to the domain level (`analytics.com`).

This distinction helps clarify the granularity of connections and aids effective summary in the interface.

### 6. Public Suffix List (PSL)
uBO Scope uses the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/), a registry of domain suffixes that helps determine the boundary between registrable domains and their subdomains. This allows the extension to accurately extract the tab domain from any hostname, recognizing complex domain structures like `co.uk` or `example.github.io`.

### 7. Network Request Outcomes
The extension monitors network requests and classifies them by outcome:

- `success` — Connection completed and data received.
- `redirect` — The request was redirected, possibly triggering stealth blocking.
- `error` — The connection failed or was blocked.

These outcomes feed into domain status categorization and data presentation.

## How These Concepts Tie Together in Your Usage

When you activate uBO Scope on a given tab, it:

1. Detects the current tab's hostname and domain.
2. Observes all outgoing network requests initiated by the tab.
3. Classifies each request's outcome (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked).
4. Aggregates request data by hostnames and domains.
5. Displays a clear count badge reflecting allowed domains.
6. Presents categorized lists of domains in the popup UI for deeper analysis.

This process ensures you get actionable, privacy-relevant insights with minimal confusion.

## Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- **Tip:** Don't confuse the badge count with total domains contacted. The badge counts **only** allowed third-party domains.

- **Tip:** A domain could be stealth-blocked — meaning no visible connection — even though it's listed. Understanding stealth blocking helps explain discrepancies.

- **Pitfall:** Some domains may share the same registrable domain but differ in subdomains; uBO Scope aggregates counts appropriately.

- **Tip:** Updating or resetting your browser session can clear old connection data. The extension persists session data for continuity.

- **Tip:** Familiarize yourself with how uBO Scope derives tab domains via PSL. Misinterpretation can occur if you assume subdomains are independent domains.

## Visualizing Domain Resolution with the Public Suffix List

Consider this example:

- Tab Hostname: `shop.us.example.co.uk`
- Public Suffix: `co.uk` (from PSL)
- Registrable Domain: `example.co.uk`

Here, uBO Scope classifies all third-party connections relative to `example.co.uk`, ignoring `shop.us` as a subdomain.
