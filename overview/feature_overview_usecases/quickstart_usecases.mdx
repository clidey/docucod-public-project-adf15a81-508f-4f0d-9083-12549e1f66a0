# Quick Start: Common Use Cases

Welcome to the practical gateway of uBO Scope — this page guides you through simple, real-world examples showing how to leverage the extension’s powerful insights into remote server connections. Whether you're a privacy enthusiast curious about how many distinct third-party servers a webpage contacts, a user validating the effectiveness of your content blocker, or a filter list maintainer seeking to uncover hidden connections, this guide puts you on the fast track to mastering uBO Scope.

## Understand Your Tab’s Remote Server Connections

When you browse, every active tab attempts to connect to multiple remote servers. uBO Scope counts these distinct third-party connections and presents them in real time. Here’s how you can quickly check this:

### How to Check Unique Remote Servers for the Current Tab

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon while on your active tab.
2. Open the popup panel, which presents:
   - The exact hostname of the tab's page.
   - The number of distinct remote domains connected.
   - Lists divided into three outcome categories:
     - **Not blocked:** Domains where connections succeeded.
     - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains with requests silently redirected or altered.
     - **Blocked:** Domains where connections failed or were actively blocked.

<u>Example:</u>

If you visit a news site, the popup might show 15 connected domains — some allowed, some stealth-blocked, indicating which third-party services are active behind the scenes.

### Why It Matters

The distinct domain count reflects your exposure to third-party servers, helping you evaluate real privacy risks beyond raw block counts.

## Verify Content Blocker Results Effectively

Many blockers report block counts, but these numbers alone don’t guarantee better privacy. uBO Scope helps you confirm what really happens.

### How to Cross-Check Your Content Blocker

- After enabling or switching your content blocker, navigate to a website and open the uBO Scope popup.
- Observe the number of allowed vs. blocked remote servers.
- Compare these results against your content blocker's reported block counts.

<u>Scenario:</u>

You might find that a supposedly "stronger" blocker shows a high block count but allows connections to more third-party servers — meaning it’s less effective than you thought. Conversely, a lower block count but fewer allowed domains means stronger real-world protection.

### Best Practice

Use uBO Scope’s domain-level observations, not just block counts, to assess and tweak your blocker’s configuration.

<Note>
Block counts are not a reliable metric for blocker effectiveness. Focus on the actual number of distinct third-party remote servers allowed.
</Note>

## Detect and Reveal Stealth Blocking

Stealth blocking involves silently redirecting or modifying requests to avoid site errors or detection, making it invisible to typical block counters. uBO Scope exposes these stealth-blocked connections.

### How to Identify Stealth Connections

1. In the uBO Scope popup, look at the **stealth-blocked** section.
2. Domains listed here have been involved in redirected or modified requests that did not completely fail but were controlled by a blocker or other mechanism.

<u>Example:</u>

A page might silently redirect ad requests to a local or safe domain instead of outright blocking, which conventional blockers won’t report as blocked.

### Why Knowing Stealth Blocking Is Crucial

This transparency helps you understand true privacy outcomes and detect subtle tracking or connection behaviors that evade normal detection.

## Tips for Privacy Enthusiasts and Filter List Maintainers

- **Monitor Your Browsing Exposure:** Regularly check the popup during browsing sessions to see which third-party servers are allowed.
- **Identify New or Unexpected Domains:** Use the displayed data to spot domains unfamiliar to you—these could be trackers or unwanted third parties.
- **Validate Filter Lists:** If you maintain or evaluate filter lists, use uBO Scope to test whether your filters effectively reduce unwanted connections.

<Check>
If you observe unexpectedly high allowed domain counts, consider adjusting your blockers or updating filter lists.
</Check>

### Using uBO Scope Alongside Your Workflow

- Combine with your current content blocker setup for layered privacy checks.
- Use uBO Scope’s clear categorization to spot trends and subtle loopholes in blocking configurations.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Quick Start Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="No Data in Popup or 'NO DATA' Message">
This usually happens if the active tab has no recorded network connection data yet. Try refreshing the page or navigate to a different tab with active web content.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows Zero Domains but Site Loads Normally">
Some types of network requests or non-web protocols might not be captured. Also, some content blockers or browser settings may prevent data collection through the webRequest API.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpectedly High Domain Counts">
Review whether any content blocker or DNS filtering is bypassed unintentionally. Look out for stealth-blocked domains which might hint at silent redirects or modified requests.
</Accordion>
