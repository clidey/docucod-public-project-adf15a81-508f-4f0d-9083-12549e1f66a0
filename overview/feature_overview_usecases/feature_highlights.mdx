# Feature Highlights

Discover the essential capabilities of uBO Scope that empower you to gain transparent, actionable insights into third-party network connections attempted by websites. This page concisely presents the core features that make uBO Scope a unique and independent tool for monitoring web privacy without relying on any content blocker or DNS configuration.

---

## Visualize All Third-Party Connections

uBO Scope instantly reveals every remote server connection attempt made by a webpage, showing you the full picture beyond what traditional content blockers report. It tracks all third-party domains your browser interacts with while loading a page, giving you real-time feedback on the breadth of external connections.

### Why This Matters

By uncovering all third-party connections, you gain clear visibility into your web session’s network footprint, helping you identify unexpected or undesired connections that may impact privacy.

---

## Report Network Request Outcomes for Every Connection

uBO Scope categorizes each network request into one of three outcomes:

- **Allowed:** Connections that successfully fetched resources
- **Blocked:** Connections denied by content blockers or network errors
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections silently redirected or prevented without explicit blocking signals

Every outcome is reported per domain, alongside occurrence counts, giving you precise insights on how network requests are treated.

### Real-World Impact

This granular outcome reporting helps debunk misleading block count metrics from other tools and clarifies what really happens during web navigation — enabling informed privacy decisions.

---

## Works Independently of Content Blockers and DNS Setup

Unlike tools dependent on specific content blockers or DNS configurations, uBO Scope operates purely by monitoring browser network requests through the `webRequest` API. This approach means:

- It reports network activity regardless of which content blocker you use, or none at all
- It detects blocking performed stealthily by extensions or DNS without false assumptions
- It remains compatible across major browsers supporting the required APIs

### Benefit to Users

You get an unbiased, transparent view of network behavior that reflects what is actually happening rather than relying on opaque block counters or DNS logs.

## Intuitive Toolbar Badge and Popup UI

The uBO Scope toolbar icon displays a dynamic badge count representing the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted for the current browser tab. Clicking the icon opens a popup detailing:

- The base hostname and domain of the active tab
- Counts and lists of domains in each outcome category (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked)

This interface provides quick, at-a-glance insights and detailed network connection data in a tidy, accessible format.

## Practical Example: Analyzing a Webpage

Imagine visiting your favorite news site. uBO Scope will display how many distinct third-party domains are contacted, such as advertisement networks, analytics providers, or content delivery networks (CDNs). For each, it shows if the connection was allowed, blocked by your extensions, or stealth-blocked (hidden from regular detection).

This empowers you to quickly spot if unexpected trackers are loaded or if your content blocker is effectively preventing certain connections.

---

## Tips for Maximizing Value

- Use uBO Scope in parallel with your content blocker to verify what is actually fetched versus blocked.
- Check the stealth-blocked section to identify when blocking happens silently and may affect your browsing experience.
- Regularly monitor different websites to build awareness of common third-party domains and their behavior.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If the badge count doesn’t update, ensure your browser supports the `webRequest` API and uBO Scope is allowed to monitor all sites.
- Remember that uBO Scope cannot see network requests made outside of browser control, such as system-level DNS filtering.
