# Works with Your Current Content Blockers

uBO Scope is designed to operate seamlessly alongside your existing content blockers, DNS filtering solutions, or even built-in browser protections. This page explains how uBO Scope coexists with these tools and what you can expect from its reports under various browser configurations.

---

## Understanding Coexistence with Other Blockers

When you install uBO Scope, it does not replace or interfere with your current content blockers like uBlock Origin or any DNS-level blocking mechanisms you might use. Instead, it acts as a transparent observer that records the exact network connection attempts your browser makes, including those allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked by other layers of protection.

### How uBO Scope Tracks Connections Regardless of Blockers

- **Extension-Based Content Blockers:** If you use extensions such as uBlock Origin, uBO Scope tracks network requests as they appear to the browser's `webRequest` API. Since uBO Scope taps into the same API, it can accurately record whether connections were allowed, stealth-blocked (blocked in a way that attempts to be less detectable), or fully blocked.

- **DNS Filtering:** Some users rely on DNS filtering (like Pi-hole or DNS-over-HTTPS filtering) to block domains before the browser even attempts a connection. uBO Scope can report these DNS-filtered connections as blocked if the browser reports the blocked request through the `webRequest` API. However, DNS blocking that occurs entirely outside the browser's visibility may not be reflected by uBO Scope.

- **Built-In Browser Protections:** Modern browsers may include built-in tracking prevention or blocking features. uBO Scope can report on network requests based on how the browser exposes these events. If the request is not visible to the `webRequest` API, it will not be reported by uBO Scope.

<Info>
Because uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API, it captures only what the browser itself processes and reports. Network requests fully blocked or rerouted outside the browser (e.g., by an OS-level firewall) are not visible to this extension.

## Reporting Behavior Under Different Blocker Configurations

uBO Scope categorizes network connection outcomes into three groups for each tab:

- **Allowed:** Connections that were established successfully, including those explicitly allowed by your content blocker or otherwise unblocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were silently blocked by your content blocker using stealth techniques designed to avoid detection by web pages.
- **Blocked:** Connections outright blocked and reported as errors or failures.

### What to Expect in the Popup Interface

When viewing the uBO Scope popup for an active tab, you will see domains grouped by these outcomes, making it clear how your current blocking setup is performing.

| Outcome       | User Expectation                                   | Explanation                                              |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Allowed       | Domains you connected to successfully             | These are third-party servers your browser fetched resources from. Fewer domains generally indicate stronger or more effective blocking. |
| Stealth-Blocked | Connections silently stopped by blockers          | These connections were blocked without alerting web pages, preserving site functionality while preventing unwanted loading. |
| Blocked       | Connections explicitly denied by blockers         | These are clear-cut blocks where the browser refused to load resources. |

Stealth-blocking is unique as it can prevent connection attempts without obvious errors showing up, leading to more realistic but still effective blocking.

### Effects of Running Multiple Blockers

If you run uBO Scope alongside multiple blockers (e.g., an extension plus DNS filtering), you might notice:

- **Complementary Reporting:** uBO Scope reports what the browser observes. If a DNS server blocks a domain but the browser still reports the request due to fallback mechanisms, uBO Scope will capture the request outcome.
- **No Conflicts or Duplication:** uBO Scope does not block anything itself, so it never conflicts with or duplicates another blocker's work.

## Practical Scenarios Explaining uBO Scope Behavior

### Scenario 1: Using uBlock Origin and DNS Filtering

- You have uBlock Origin installed and configured for typical tracking protection.
- You've also configured Pi-hole at the network level for DNS filtering.
- uBO Scope will report network requests allowed or blocked by uBlock Origin, including stealth blocking.
- If Pi-hole blocks a domain, uBO Scope sees the connection fail only if the browser reports it via `webRequest`. Otherwise, DNS-level blocking may be invisible to uBO Scope.

### Scenario 2: Using Browser Built-in Protections

- Browsers like Firefox or Safari include tracking prevention features.
- uBO Scope will show network requests as allowed or blocked based on what the browser exposes.
- Some requests stealth-blocked internally by the browser may appear as blocked or stealth-blocked in the popup.

### Scenario 3: No Other Content Blocker Installed

- uBO Scope will simply report all third-party domains the browser tries to reach.
- The badge count on the toolbar icon reflects the actual number of distinct remote connections made.
- This scenario provides a baseline for understanding the connections a website makes without interference.

---

## Tips for Accurate Interpretation

- **Badge Count as a Proxy:** The toolbar badge number shows the count of distinct allowed third-party domains. Lower numbers typically imply better privacy protection.
- **Understand Stealth Blocking:** Not all blocked requests generate errors or failures visible on the web; stealth blocks prevent resource loads subtly.
- **DNS Filtering Visibility:** Remember that DNS filters external to the browser might not report all blocked attempts.
- **Check for All Extensions:** If results seem inconsistent, verify which extensions and protections are active that might affect network requests.

<Warning>
Relying solely on block counts from different blockers can be misleading. uBO Scope focuses on revealing the real network activity to provide transparency, not to declare which blocker is "better".
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting and Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common questions about coexistence and reporting behavior">
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope block any connections?">
No. uBO Scope is purely observational and does not modify or block network traffic itself. It only reports what happens with network requests processed by the browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do I sometimes see domains allowed that my blocker should have blocked?">
uBO Scope reports based on browser-level visibility of requests. Some blockers stealthily allow certain connections or block them in a way that does not report failures. Also, DNS-level blocking outside the browser might not be visible if the browser does not expose that information.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can multiple blockers cause misleading results in uBO Scope?">
Multiple blockers can affect what the browser reports. However, uBO Scope simply aggregates what is visible at the browser API level without interference, providing a consolidated view of outcomes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why does my badge count not match block counts from other blockers?">
Block counts reflect number of filtered requests, while uBO Scope badge reflects distinct third-party domains actually connected. These metrics measure different things and represent different privacy perspectives.
