# Key Features at a Glance

Discover the core capabilities of uBO Scope that empower you with unparalleled transparency over your browser's network activity. This page highlights key features designed to help you monitor, analyze, and understand third-party remote server connections directly within your browser, regardless of other content blockers in place.

---

## Comprehensive Network Connection Reporting

uBO Scope captures and reports all network connections attempted or made by your browser during web browsing sessions. Whether a request is allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked, uBO Scope logs every distinct third-party remote server involved with:

- **Allowed Connections**: Remote servers that successfully received requests.
- **Stealth-Blocked Connections**: Requests blocked quietly without site detection.
- **Blocked Connections**: Requests failed or prevented by content blockers or network errors.

### Why This Matters
Traditional content blockers often hide stealth blocking or do not provide a full picture of remote connections. uBO Scope gives clarity on every remote server your browser interacts with, regardless of the blockers used or DNS filtering.

---

## Seamless Integration Alongside Any Content Blocker

Unlike traditional blockers that may conflict, uBO Scope works harmoniously alongside any existing content blockers you have installed. It listens to your browser’s network requests via the `webRequest` API to transparently report outcomes without interference.

### Benefits

- Understand your current blocker’s effectiveness without disruption.
- Debunk myths about blocking by verifying actual network connections.
- Monitor stealth blocking that other extensions or filters may conceal.

---

## Multi-Browser Support for Wide Compatibility

uBO Scope supports all major modern browsers, including Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari (minimum version 18.5). Your choice of browser won’t limit your ability to audit network connections.

### What This Enables

- Consistent user experience and accurate reporting no matter where you browse.
- Unified data across browsers when managing privacy or filters.

---

## Intuitive, Concise Popup Interface for Tab-Specific Insights

Access uBO Scope’s findings instantly through a clean, compact popup UI tied to your active browser tab. The popup includes:

- **Hostname Header**: Displays the current tab’s hostname and domain.
- **Domains Connected Summary**: Shows the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- **Outcome Sections**: Visually segmented lists for allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains, each with counts.

### How It Helps You

- Quick visibility into network activity for the page you’re viewing.
- Actionable insights at a glance without navigating away from your workflow.
- Clear distinction between various network outcomes for focused analysis.

---

## Real-Time Badge Count on Toolbar Icon

uBO Scope updates a badge on its browser toolbar icon representing the count of distinct allowed third-party remote servers detected in the active tab. A lower count indicates fewer third-party connections, which typically aligns with stronger privacy.

### Use Case

- At a glance, verify the extent of third-party connecting entities on any webpage.
- Quickly assess whether a site loads resources from many remote servers or just a few.

---

## Advanced Domain and Hostname Classification

Utilizing an embedded Public Suffix List, uBO Scope uniquely identifies domains versus hostnames from network requests. This classification ensures you see meaningful groupings relevant to privacy and filtering.

### Value to You

- Avoid confusion from raw hostnames by viewing grouped domains.
- More intuitive understanding of which companies or services might be collecting data.

---

## Practical Examples of Features in Action

Imagine visiting a news website with multiple embedded third-party content providers:

- The popup UI shows dozens of allowed third-party domains, highlighting potential tracking sites.
- uBO Scope shows a handful of stealth-blocked domains you didn’t know were attempted, revealing silent blocking by your filters.
- The toolbar badge updates dynamically as you navigate tabs, indicating varying levels of network connections per page.

These insights enable you to make informed decisions about adjusting filters or privacy settings.

---

## Tips for Maximizing uBO Scope's Value

- Regularly check the popup UI on different sites to understand normal versus suspect network activity.
- Use the stealth-blocked and blocked sections to verify your content blockers' true effectiveness.
- Look for unusually high domain counts in the badge as a prompt for privacy risk assessment.

<Note>
If you don’t see data in the popup, ensure your browser and uBO Scope extension are correctly installed and that the page has fully loaded network requests.

### Example Code Snippet: Interacting with the Popup UI

Below is a simplified example demonstrating how the popup renders domain data into categorized sections:

```javascript
// Pseudo-code example showing categorization
function renderDomains(data) {
    const containerAllowed = document.querySelector('.outcome.allowed .domains');
    const containerStealth = document.querySelector('.outcome.stealth .domains');
    const containerBlocked = document.querySelector('.outcome.blocked .domains');

    data.allowed.domains.forEach(([domain, count]) => {
        containerAllowed.append(createDomainRow(domain, count));
    });
    data.stealth.domains.forEach(([domain, count]) => {
        containerStealth.append(createDomainRow(domain, count));
    });
    data.blocked.domains.forEach(([domain, count]) => {
        containerBlocked.append(createDomainRow(domain, count));
    });
}

function createDomainRow(domain, count) {
    const row = document.createElement('div');
    row.className = 'row';
    row.innerHTML = `<span class='domain'>${domain}</span><span class='count badge'>${count}</span>`;
    return row;
}
```

This workflow exemplifies uBO Scope’s approach to organizing network details for quick inspection.
