# Popular Use Cases & Scenarios

Understanding where and how uBO Scope delivers distinct value helps users maximize its benefits. This page highlights real-world scenarios where uBO Scope’s transparent reporting of remote server connections offers critical insights—ranging from evaluating content blocker effectiveness to supporting filter list maintainers working on devices with limited browser tools.

---

## Why uBO Scope Matters in These Scenarios

Imagine browsing the web and wanting a clear, unfiltered picture of exactly which third-party domains your browser connects to. Whether you’re a privacy-conscious user scrutinizing potential trackers, a filter list maintainer ensuring your rules are effective, or an analyst verifying content blocker claims, uBO Scope delivers unmatched visibility that complements your goals.

---

## Use Case 1: Evaluating and Comparing Content Blockers

Users often wish to know which content blocker better protects their browsing experience. Rather than relying on opaque metrics like block counts or test sites that can be misleading, uBO Scope exposes the true extent of allowed connections to third-party servers.

- **What You Get:** A precise count and listing of distinct third-party remote servers your browser actually connects to.
- **Why It Helps:** Helps you understand if a blocker truly limits third-party connections or if higher block counts mask connections to more distinct servers.
- **Example Scenario:** You install two blockers, A and B. Knocked down to raw connection data, you discover blocker B lets through fewer unique third-party domains despite a higher block count. This challenges assumptions about which blocker is "better."

### Best Practice

Always consider the *number of distinct third-party domains connected to* rather than just block counts. Fewer connections indicate stronger privacy enforcement.

---

## Use Case 2: Educating About Privacy Risks and Third-Party Tracking

Many users are unaware how many and which third-party domains their browsers contact during routine browsing. uBO Scope reveals this in a clear, tangible way, making invisible connections visible.

- **What You Get:** Real-time reporting of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains per tab, helping users see the network footprint of each website.
- **Why It Helps:** Facilitates informed decisions about privacy settings and promotes awareness of potentially invasive third parties.
- **Example Scenario:** While visiting a news site, a user sees connections not just to the main domain but to multiple advertising and tracking servers, helping them understand the scope of data sharing.

### Practical Tips

Use the popup interface to inspect domains contacted by tabs of interest and research those domains for reputation. Lower the badge count by configuring blockers accordingly.

## Use Case 3: Supporting Filter List Maintainers on Limited-Access Devices

Filter list maintainers often require detailed, accurate network data to refine rules but may work on systems or environments where advanced browser debugging tools are unavailable.

- **What You Get:** A reliable, extension-based way to capture all network requests visible to the browser’s `webRequest` API, independent of DNS-level or stealth blocking.
- **Why It Helps:** It enables maintainers to audit connections, detect stealth blocking cases, and verify actual third-party interactions without needing heavy toolchains.
- **Example Scenario:** A maintainer remotely troubleshooting an issue uses uBO Scope’s popup reports to pinpoint connections slipping past filter rules on mobile browsers.

### Pro Tip

Pair uBO Scope with your existing filter testing workflows to cross-reference network outcomes and identify discrepancies efficiently.

---

## Use Case 4: Verifying Blocker Behavior in Complex Network Environments

uBO Scope shines when content blockers employ stealth techniques that hide blocking actions from webpages or when network filtering occurs outside the browser.

- **What You Get:** Transparent outcomes of network requests regardless of whether blocking occurs at the browser, extension, or DNS level.
- **Why It Helps:** Confirms whether requests are truly blocked or just stealth-blocked, dispelling common misconceptions from ad blocker test sites.
- **Example Scenario:** An advanced user suspects some blocking occurs silently without increasing the block count; uBO Scope reveals stealth-blocked domains alongside allowed and fully blocked ones.

### Caution

Avoid relying on "ad blocker test" sites as they fail to reflect stealth blocking behavior correctly. Instead, use uBO Scope’s raw data for validation.

## Before and After: Illustrating the Difference uBO Scope Makes

| Scenario                        | Without uBO Scope                             | With uBO Scope                              |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Blocker Effectiveness Analysis | Assumptions based on block counts or tests  | Accurate count of distinct third-party connections  |
| Privacy Awareness              | Unseen persistent third-party connections    | Clear visibility into all connections, alerting to potential risks |
| Filter List Maintenance        | Limited data on actual requests in restricted environments | Real-time, reliable network data to refine filters |
| Complex Blocking Behavior     | Misinterpretation of stealth blocking as allowed requests | Explicit categorization of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections |

## Getting Started With These Use Cases

To make the most of uBO Scope in these scenarios:

1. **Install the extension** from your browser’s official store.
2. **Browse as usual** and open the popup to view active tab connection details.
3. **Observe badge counts** on the toolbar for quick insight.
4. **Explore the popup’s lists** to identify connections allowed, stealth blocked, or fully blocked.
5. **Compare data with blocker configurations** or filter lists to assess effectiveness.
6. **Iterate and refine** settings or filters based on transparent network request reporting.

For detailed guidance on interpreting results or integrating uBO Scope into workflows, see the [Key Features at a Glance](./feature-overview) and [Auditing Third-Party Connections](../../guides/core-workflows/auditing-third-party-connections) documentation.

## Troubleshooting Common Challenges

<AccordionGroup title="Common Challenges in Use Cases">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Doesn’t Update as Expected">
Possible causes include timing delays in network request processing or inactive tabs. Reloading the tab or restarting the browser can resolve this. Check [Understanding Badge Counts and What They Mean](../../guides/core-workflows/understanding-badge-counts) for details.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Data Displayed in Popup">
Ensure the extension is enabled and granted necessary permissions. The extension requires `webRequest` permissions and access to host URLs. Verify installation was successful and refer to [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../../getting-started/first-use/troubleshooting).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected High Number of Connections">
Not all third-party connections indicate malicious or unwanted requests. Some are legitimate services like content delivery networks (CDNs). Use domain reputation tools to investigate.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
