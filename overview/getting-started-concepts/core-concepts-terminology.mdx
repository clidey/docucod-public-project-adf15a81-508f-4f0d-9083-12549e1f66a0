# Core Concepts and Terminology

Understanding the terminology used in uBO Scope is key to unlocking the full power of the extension. This page introduces and clarifies the core terms and concepts—such as *third-party remote servers*, *badge count*, *network request outcome*, and *stealth domains*—that shape how uBO Scope reports network activity. By grasping these terms, you'll better interpret the data shown in the popup interface and make informed decisions about your web connections.

## Third-Party Remote Servers

At the heart of uBO Scope's mission is revealing connections to *third-party remote servers*. 

- A **third-party remote server** is any server that serves content or data and whose domain differs from the domain of the browser tab's main page. For example, if you are visiting `example.com` and your browser connects to `cdn.examplecdn.com`, the latter would typically be considered a third-party unless it shares the same registered domain as `example.com`.

- uBO Scope categorizes connections from tabs based on these third-party domains, focusing on the actual distinct remote servers contacted.

This concept matters because the extension’s toolbar badge shows the number of unique third-party remote servers contacted by the active tab. Since connections to third parties can affect privacy and security, visualizing them enables you to evaluate the trustworthiness and extent of external dependencies on a webpage.


## Badge Count Explained

The badge count on the browser toolbar icon is a distinctive feature of uBO Scope:

- It represents the **number of distinct third-party remote domains for which connections were allowed** from the active browser tab.
- If no third-party connections occur or if all are blocked, the badge is empty.

For example, visiting a site with a badge count of "5" means your browser successfully connected to five separate third-party domains.

Remember: A lower badge count is more desirable as it indicates fewer external domains are connected to.

## Network Request Outcome

Each network request from a browser tab to a remote server has a *network request outcome*, which uBO Scope tracks precisely:

- **Allowed**: The request was successful and the connection was made.
- **Blocked**: The request was blocked, typically by a content blocker or DNS filtering.
- **StealthBlocked** (or stealth domains): Requests that were effectively blocked in a way that the page or certain scripts cannot detect.
- **Redirected**: Requests that were redirected to other URLs.

These outcomes enable uBO Scope to provide detailed statistics and group third-party domains accordingly.

### Why Outcomes Matter

By separating outcomes, uBO Scope helps users:

- Understand which third-party servers their browser is actually connecting to.
- Identify whether a content blocker is effectively preventing unwanted connections.
- Recognize stealth blocking, which is blocking without leaving easily detectable traces for trackers or scripts.


## Stealth Domains

**Stealth domains** refer to third-party servers whose requests were blocked invisibly or discreetly, without raising obvious signals in the browsing environment:

- Unlike straightforward blocking, stealth blocking hides blocking actions from the webpage’s scripts.
- This technique prevents trackers from detecting that their requests have been blocked, avoiding them altering their behavior to circumvent blockers.

In uBO Scope, these stealth-blocked domains are reported in a separate section under "stealth" in the popup interface, distinguishing them from domains that were simply blocked.


## Domains vs. Hostnames

uBO Scope tracks both domains and hostnames in its analyses:

- A **hostname** represents a fully qualified domain name like `ads.example.com`.
- A **domain** refers to the registered domain extracted from a hostname using the public suffix list (PSL), for example, `example.com` from `ads.example.com`.

Grouping connections by domains rather than raw hostnames is critical because it provides a higher-level view of the number of distinct entities contacted, eliminating over-counting caused by multiple subdomains.


## What’s Reported vs. What’s Blocked

uBO Scope reports only the distinct third-party domains for which **allowed connections** have occurred. However, it also tracks and separately reports:

- Blocked domains, which represent connection attempts that failed due to blocking.
- Stealth domains, where blocking occurred invisibly.

This reporting helps users understand not only which connections are successfully made but also which are prevented, giving a full picture of network activity relevant to privacy and filter effectiveness.


## Practical Example — Interpreting a Popup Snapshot

Imagine opening the extension popup while visiting `example.com`:

- The header shows the tab's *hostname* and *domain*.
- The **badge count** at the top indicates the number of unique third-party domains connected.
- Three sections display lists of domains under "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked", each accompanied by how many requests were made per domain.

This structure instantly shows which third parties your browser actually talked to, which were stealthily blocked, and which were overtly blocked.


<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Asked Questions about Terminology">
<Accordion title="Why does uBO Scope focus on third-party domains instead of all requests?">
Focusing on third-party domains highlights external entities a website interacts with, which are most relevant to privacy and tracking concerns. First-party requests are less critical since they are part of the site itself.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is the public suffix list and why is it important?">
The public suffix list (PSL) helps identify the registered domain portion of a hostname. Using the PSL prevents counting subdomains from the same entity as separate third parties, providing accurate domain-level aggregation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does stealth blocking differ from traditional blocking?">
Traditional blocking stops requests visibly and can sometimes be detected by the website. Stealth blocking blocks requests silently, without revealing blocking events to page scripts, enhancing user privacy.

## Summary

Mastering these concepts will empower you to use uBO Scope effectively, helping you judge the number and nature of third-party network connections arising from your browsing sessions. With this vocabulary, the icon badge and popup content become clear indicators of your current tab's third-party server communication landscape — letting you assess privacy risk and content blocker performance with confidence.
