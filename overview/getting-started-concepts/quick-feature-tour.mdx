# Quick Feature Overview

Discover the essential user experience components of uBO Scope that make understanding your browser's network activity straightforward and insightful. This overview highlights how badge counts, popup visualizations, and domain categorizations work together to give you clear visibility into allowed, blocked, and stealth connections.

## What You See: Badge Counts and Popup Visualizations

When you install uBO Scope, the extension integrates smoothly with your browser to deliver at-a-glance and in-depth information about the network connections initiated by the active browser tab.

- **Badge Counts on the Toolbar Icon**: A concise number displayed on the extension icon represents the count of unique third-party domains that the current tab has successfully connected to without being blocked. This instant indicator helps you gauge the extent of third-party activity on the page immediately.

- **Popup Interface with Categorized Lists**: Clicking the toolbar icon opens the popup — a detailed panel that categorizes all third-party domains involved in the tab’s network activity into three distinct groups:

  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains your browser contacted successfully.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were redirected or concealed, indicating a form of stealth blocking.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where connection attempts failed or were intentionally blocked.

Each section presents domains sorted alphabetically, accompanied by a badge count reflecting how many times each domain was connected or blocked during the tab’s session.

## How Data is Collected and Surfaced

uBO Scope continuously monitors network events related to your active tab using the browser's WebRequest API and related event listeners. It captures all relevant requests, tracking their outcomes as allowed, stealth, or blocked, then aggregates the data per domain.

- **Unified Domain Identification**: The extension extracts domains from hostnames using an authoritative public suffix list, ensuring that you see a clean, consistent set of domains rather than fragmented hostnames.

- **Real-Time Badge Updates**: As connections are recorded, the badge count dynamically updates to reflect current allowed domain counts, providing live feedback.

- **Popup Rendering Logic**: When the popup opens, uBO Scope requests the collected data for the current tab, deserializes it, and populates each category section with the relevant domains and their connection counts.

- **Punycode Conversion**: Domains displayed in the popup are converted from punycode to Unicode for readability, especially important for internationalized domain names.

## User Experience Flow

1. **Observe the Badge**: See a number on the uBO Scope icon indicating how many unique allowed domains the active tab connects to.
2. **Open the Popup**: Click the icon to open a categorized, easy-to-navigate popup showing detailed domains involvement.
3. **Interpret Categories**: Quickly understand which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked, each with clear visual separation and counts.
4. **Investigate As Needed**: Use this insight to verify privacy settings, troubleshoot unusual connections, or analyze the third-party landscape of the webpage.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Regularly Check Badge Counts**: Badge numbers give you quick feedback on how many third-party domains are engaged per tab, helping you spot unexpected behaviors.

- **Use Categorization to Investigate**: The distinction between allowed, stealth, and blocked domains helps you pinpoint suspicious or problematic connections.

- **Understand Counts**: Multiple connections to the same domain increase the count badge, revealing repeated or persistent network activity.

- **Consider Browser Performance**: The extension processes network request batches every second to avoid interfering with browser responsiveness.

- **No Configuration Needed**: By default, uBO Scope immediately surfaces connection data with no manual setup required.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Empty or Missing Data**: If the popup shows 'NO DATA', ensure you have active tabs with network activity and the extension has permission.

- **Interpreting Stealth-Blocked Connections**: Stealth-blocked domains indicate connections that were redirected or obscured — these might not indicate full blocking but partial interception.

- **Badge Shows Only Allowed Domains**: Remember the badge count reflects only domains successfully connected; blocked or stealth domains are not counted here.

## Example: Interpreting a Popup View

Consider this simplified snapshot from the popup:

### Domains Connected: 3

### not blocked
- analytics.example.com (2)
- static.content.org (5)

### stealth-blocked
- tracking.adnetwork.net (1)

### blocked
- ads.badsite.com (4)

From this, you know:
- Your tab has allowed connections to two domains (analytics and static content), counted with usage repeated.
- One domain was stealth-blocked, indicating a redirected or obscured connection.
- One domain was fully blocked, potentially an unwanted ad or tracker.
