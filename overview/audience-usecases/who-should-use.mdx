# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Discovering exactly which remote servers your browser contacts as you surf the web is vital for anyone who values transparency and control over their online experience. This page helps you identify if uBO Scope is the right tool for your unique needs — whether you're a privacy advocate, a developer, a filter list maintainer, or testing content blockers.

## Empowering Privacy-Conscious Individuals

If you care deeply about understanding your exposure on the internet, uBO Scope lays bare every attempt your browser makes to connect with third-party servers. It reveals both successful and attempted connections, empowering you to:

- Identify hidden trackers and analytics servers lurking behind your favorite websites.
- Gain clear insights into the number of distinct third-party servers contacted during your browsing sessions.
- Make informed decisions about which connections to allow or block, beyond simple blocking lists.

This transparency helps you actively manage your privacy instead of relying on blind trust.

## An Indispensable Tool for Developers

Developers benefit profoundly from uBO Scope’s fine-grained visibility into network requests initiated within tabs. Whether debugging web pages or fine-tuning content blockers, uBO Scope helps you:

- Monitor in real-time which third-party domains your site interacts with, including dependencies loaded via redirects or background scripts.
- Verify the effectiveness of your content blocking policies or DNS-level filtering setups by seeing the actual network outcomes.
- Detect stealth blocking by comparing blocked versus allowed network requests.

By surfacing network request outcomes irrespective of the blockers in place, uBO Scope sharpens your understanding and validation workflows.

## Essential for Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining filter lists that effectively block trackers requires accurate data about what third-party connections happen during real-world browsing. uBO Scope uniquely:

- Collects network connection data even when browser developer tools are inaccessible or limited.
- Demonstrates the real impact of filter rules by reporting outcomes (allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked).
- Exposes connections at a granular domain and hostname level, enriching your filtering strategies.

This makes uBO Scope a vital companion for improving list quality, especially on restricted devices or environments.

## Critical for Testing Content Blockers and DNS-Level Blocking

Users and testers seeking to evaluate or validate multiple content blockers, including those that operate via DNS, will find uBO Scope invaluable because it:

- Works compatibly alongside any content blocker installed in the browser, measuring actual network outcomes reported by the webRequest API.
- Detects connections blocked stealthily or via DNS filters, not just visible browser-based blocking.
- Allows direct comparison of network exposure between different blocking setups without relying on flawed page-based tests or block count metrics.

uBO Scope reveals whether block lists truly reduce the number of distinct third-party servers reached.

## Ideal Across Devices and Constraints

Some environments impose restrictions that limit the visibility or control over network requests. uBO Scope excels in these scenarios by:

- Operating entirely as a browser extension without requiring complex setups.
- Relying solely on the browser's webRequest API to detect remote server connections, enabling broad compatibility.
- Presenting clear, actionable data in a simple popup without overwhelming with technical jargon.

Whether on mobile browsers, locked-down enterprise setups, or niche platforms, it offers trustworthy network exposure insights.

## Summary

This page helps you see how your role, device, or network constraints align with uBO Scope’s strengths: ensuring you understand who should use it and why.

# Getting Started with uBO Scope

If you recognize yourself in one of the user groups above, begin by installing the extension available from your browser's Web Store, then start monitoring your browsing tabs’ network exposure.

- [Interpreting Connection Insights](/guides/getting-started-essentials/interpreting-connection-insights)

## Tips for Success

- Always check the toolbar badge count to understand the number of distinct third-party servers contacted.
- Verify your existing content blockers’ impact by comparing outcomes with uBO Scope's reports.
- Use the extension alongside your preferred content blocker or DNS filtering services without conflicts.

## Common Pitfalls

- Remember that uBO Scope relies on the browser's webRequest API; network requests made outside this API (e.g., from separate apps or VPNs) are not reported.
- The extension does not block connections itself but reports their outcomes; use it as a diagnostic and transparency tool.

# Appendix: Real-World Scenario

Imagine you are a privacy-focused user who installs uBO Scope alongside a content blocker. Browsing a news website, you notice the toolbar badge count rising unexpectedly. Opening the popup reveals multiple third-party domains, including unexpected trackers you've never heard of. Armed with this insight, you adjust your content blocker or report the findings to filter list maintainers, much improving your browsing privacy.

Similarly, a developer working on a website can ensure their embedded third-party services behave as expected and do not cause extraneous network requests, using the data surfaced in uBO Scope.

# Why uBO Scope Matters

Unlike tools that merely count blocked requests or show generic warnings, uBO Scope quantifies unique third-party domain exposure in real time, independent of filtering method. This makes it indispensable for users striving to see through the complexity of modern web content delivery.

Start seeing your web’s hidden connections like never before — because understanding comes before control.
