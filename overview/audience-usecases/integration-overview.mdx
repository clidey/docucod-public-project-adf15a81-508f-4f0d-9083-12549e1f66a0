# Integration & Compatibility

## Seamless Integration Across Major Browsers

uBO Scope is designed as a versatile companion extension that fits effortlessly into your existing browser environment, no matter if you use Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, or Safari. Its platform-agnostic architecture ensures uniform behavior and reporting, giving you consistent privacy insights across different browsing contexts.

- **Chromium-Based Browsers:** Implements a modern service worker background script with manifest version 3, leveraging the latest Chrome extension technologies to deliver efficient network request tracking.
- **Firefox:** Uses Firefox-specific manifest settings and permissions, including support for WebSocket URLs, ensuring comprehensive coverage of network requests relevant for privacy.
- **Safari:** Adapts its background script as a module, meeting Safari Web Extension requirements while maintaining all core measurement capabilities.

This broad compatibility means you can install uBO Scope on your favorite browser without worrying about missing features or inconsistent data.

## Platform-Agnostic Design for Flexibility

uBO Scope uses standard browser APIs like the `webRequest` interface to monitor all network requests. This choice allows it to:

- Work independently of which content blockers you use.
- Report on network activities regardless of DNS filtering, host-based blockers, or extension-based filtering.
- Capture both successful and failed connection attempts, staying agnostic to blocking methods.

Whether you rely on uBlock Origin, other content blockers, or DNS-level privacy tools, uBO Scope complements them by filling in crucial visibility gaps.

## Complementing Your Existing Tools and Workflows

uBO Scope does not replace ad blockers or privacy tools — it enhances them by providing transparent, real-time reporting of third-party connections. Here’s how it fits in:

- **With Content Blockers:** Verifies which third-party domains are truly blocked or allowed, helping validate filter lists.
- **For Developers and Privacy Enthusiasts:** Reveals stealthy network requests that might otherwise be hidden from regular debugging tools.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Enables validation of blocking effectiveness on constrained devices or browsers where traditional tools might falter.

Integration goes beyond compatibility; it means adding meaningful insights into your browsing ecosystem without changing your routine.

## Practical Examples of Integration

- Installing uBO Scope alongside uBlock Origin in Chromium instantly adds detailed connection metrics without configuration changes.
- Firefox users benefit from support of `wss://` and `ws://` URLs, capturing WebSocket network requests that other browsers might miss.
- Safari users get a fully functional extension employing the latest manifest and API patterns customized for Apple’s architecture.

These practical adaptations ensure that wherever you browse, uBO Scope is ready to provide actionable data.

## Best Practices for Integration

- **Install from Official Stores:** Use the Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari Extensions Gallery to ensure you have the correct build for your platform.
- **Run Alongside Content Blockers:** Keep your existing ad blockers or DNS filtering active; uBO Scope works transparently alongside them.
- **Verify Badge Count Meaning:** Remember the toolbar badge reflects distinct third-party domains connected, not just blocked or allowed counts.


## Troubleshooting Common Integration Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Integration & Compatibility Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Shows No Data or Badge Count is Empty">
- Ensure the extension is correctly installed for your browser.
- Verify you are browsing sites over HTTP(S), as the extension depends on network requests accessible via the browser’s webRequest API.
- Check that your browser’s `webRequest` permissions for network URLs are enabled.
- Some browsers or private modes might limit network request visibility.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Inconsistent Data Between Browsers">
- Confirm you are using the official latest version for each browser.
- Understand Firefox uniquely tracks WebSocket connections; Chromium and Safari do not support WebSocket tracking fully.
- Differences in browser network APIs can cause minor variations in counts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compatibility with Other Content Blockers"
>
- uBO Scope is designed to be agnostic of content blockers and does not interfere with their operation.
- If other blockers or security extensions block extension APIs or scripts, uBO Scope’s data may be impacted.
- Review permissions and conflicts if anomalies arise.
