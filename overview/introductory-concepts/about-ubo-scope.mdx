# What is uBO Scope?

## Discovering the True Reach of Your Browser's Network Connections

Imagine browsing the web with full transparency into every network connection your browser attempts—no matter which content blocker or DNS filtering tool you use. uBO Scope makes this possible by serving as a vigilant companion that reveals all connections initiated by a browser tab to remote servers.

At its core, uBO Scope is a lightweight, open-source browser extension that leverages the browser's webRequest API to capture network request events in real time. Unlike traditional tools that might only count blocked or allowed requests, uBO Scope focuses on the **distinct third-party servers** your browser contacts, providing a clearer, more meaningful metric for privacy and security.

## Why Network Connections Matter

When you visit a website, your browser doesn’t just connect to one server—it communicates with many, including various third-party services like analytics, advertisers, content delivery networks, and more. Tracking these connections helps you understand your true exposure and evaluate the effectiveness of your content blockers.

However, not all connection counts carry the same weight. uBO Scope highlights the number of **unique third-party servers**, which is key because:

- A high number of distinct servers often implies broader tracking and greater privacy risks.
- A lower count means fewer external entities can observe your web activity.
- It provides a more accurate picture than raw block or allow counts, which can be misleading.

## How uBO Scope Works

Through intelligent use of webRequest event listeners, uBO Scope monitors every network request your browser attempts from each tab, regardless of whether your main content blocker or DNS solver blocks or allows it. This comprehensive tracking includes:

- **Allowed connections:** Resources successfully loaded from remote servers.
- **Blocked connections:** Attempts that were denied or failed.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Redirects or silently suppressed connections that do not reach the server.

By aggregating data per browser tab, uBO Scope provides a focused insight into your browsing session’s network footprint.

<Tip>
Because uBO Scope operates with the browser's webRequest API, it can report on connections independently of which content blocker is in use. This makes it a unique instrument for transparency and auditing.

## Key Features of uBO Scope

- **Distinct Third-Party Server Counting:** The badge icon shows the count of unique third-party domains connected by the active tab, offering a meaningful privacy metric.
- **Comprehensive Visibility:** Captures outcomes of network requests, whether allowed, blocked, or redirected.
- **Content Blocker Agnostic:** Functions irrespective of your primary content-blocking solution or DNS filtering.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Tracks ongoing connections and updates indicators promptly.

## Real-World User Scenario

Imagine you visit your favorite news website. Some content blockers show dozens of blocked requests, but how many different third-party servers did your browser actually reach?

Using uBO Scope, you instantly see that although many requests were blocked, your browser still connected to several third-party servers. This insight empowers you to adjust your blocking rules, improve privacy, or simply stay informed.

---

## Why Should You Care?

- **True Transparency:** Know precisely which remote servers your browser talks to, cutting through misleading block count statistics.
- **Privacy Insight:** Assess the privacy impact of your browsing by understanding distinct third-party exposures.
- **Myth-Busting:** Debunk common misconceptions about content blocker effectiveness by focusing on unique server connections rather than raw block counts.
- **Developer and Filter Maintainer Utility:** Reliable data to gauge real-world network behaviors and blocker performance.
