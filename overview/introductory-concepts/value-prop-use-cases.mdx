# Why Use uBO Scope? Key Value & Use Cases

## Empowering Privacy, Transparency, and Filter List Effectiveness

uBO Scope is more than a browser extension—it's a powerful lens into the network activity of your browsing sessions. Designed for users who care deeply about privacy and transparency, this tool exposes every third-party connection your browser tab attempts, regardless of what content blockers or DNS settings you have in place. 

By revealing what really happens behind the scenes, uBO Scope allows you to make informed decisions about your online safety, the effectiveness of your content filters, and the validity of popular claims about adblocking.

### Who Benefits Most from uBO Scope?

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Individuals seeking clear visibility into the myriad third-party servers contacted while browsing.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Developers and maintainers of content blocking lists who require precise data on what domains are truly allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- **Researchers and Analysts:** Those studying real-world web tracking, ad delivery mechanisms, or the efficacy of blockers can leverage detailed connection data.

## Core Values That Set uBO Scope Apart

### 1. Complete Network Transparency

Unlike simple blocker counters, uBO Scope detects *all* network connections initiated by your browser tab, including those that are stealth-blocked or bypass filters silently. This comprehensive view reveals:
- The full landscape of third-party domains your browser interacts with.
- How many connections are truly blocked versus those that sneak past unnoticed.

### 2. Real Impact Assessment of Content Blockers

uBO Scope empowers you to measure the actual effect of your content blockers. Instead of relying on filtered lists alone, you see:
- Whether connections that should be blocked are effectively stopped.
- If stealth-blocking tactics (blocking without visible signals) are working as intended.

### 3. Debunking Adblocker Myths with Concrete Data

There are many misconceptions about what ad blockers do and don't block. With uBO Scope, you can:
- Verify if specific third-party requests are truly blocked.
- Understand cases where certain ads or trackers might bypass filters.

### 4. Aid in Filter List Development and Quality Assurance

Filter list maintainers gain:
- Insights into domains that require blocking or allowlisting.
- Data-driven feedback on blocking discrepancies and stealth behaviors.

### 5. Support for Browsing Privacy Research

Researchers studying web privacy and tracking technologies can harness uBO Scope to:
- Observe third-party connection patterns in real environments.
- Track how browser tabs interact with complex ad ecosystems.

## Practical Use Cases

### Evaluating Real-World Content Blocking
Imagine you want to know if your ad blocker is truly preventing intrusive third-party ads. By using uBO Scope’s popup interface while browsing a news site, you can:
- See all domains contacted by that page.
- Identify which domains were blocked, allowed, or stealth-blocked.
- Easily spot any leaks or blind spots in your blockers' settings.

### Investigating Stealth Blocking
Many content blockers silently block requests without user-facing indicators, making it hard to measure their effectiveness. uBO Scope highlights stealth-blocked domains, giving you definitive evidence to:
- Confirm that stealth blocking functions as intended.
- Detect unexpectedly unblocked stealth domains.

### Assisting Filter List Maintainers and Researchers
Filter list developers and researchers monitor actual network connections to fine-tune rules and document common evasion tactics. Using uBO Scope enables:
- Verification of allowed versus blocked domains at a granular level.
- Collection of data to support or refute claims about filter list quality.

### Busting Myths About Adblocking
Curious if a so-called "ad network" is really blocked? With uBO Scope at your fingertips, you can:
- Load a website.
- Check the popup summary to see if those ad network domains appear in allowed or blocked lists.
- Share verifiable insights and evidence with communities.

## Before and After Using uBO Scope

| Without uBO Scope       | With uBO Scope                    |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Rely on assumptions about what your blocker catches. | Get precise, tab-specific lists of all network connections. |
| Miss stealth blocking or partial blocking.          | Reveal stealth-blocked connections explicitly.            |
| Struggle to validate filter list effects.            | See concrete results from filter lists and blocker behaviors. |
| Depend on vague claims or anecdotal reports.         | Base filtering and privacy decisions on real data.        |

## Return on Investment (ROI)

- **Time Savings:** Quickly identify problematic domains without manual inspection or guesswork.
- **Efficiency Gains:** Optimize content blocker settings based on accurate connection data.
- **Better Privacy Decisions:** Enhanced control over your web footprint by knowing exactly who is contacted.


## Getting Started Preview

Getting started with uBO Scope centers around interaction with its popup UI, which succinctly summarizes the domains contacted by the active browser tab. After installation:

- Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.
- Observe counts of connected domains, segmented by their block state (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked).
- Dive into domain lists to understand specific third-party connections.

<u>See [Install and Configure uBO Scope](/guides/getting_started/install-and-configure) for detailed setup instructions and [Your First Insights: Interpreting the Popup](/guides/getting_started/first-insights) to master the popup interface.</u>

## Tips for Maximizing Value

- Frequently check the popup on privacy-sensitive sites or those known to have aggressive tracking.
- Use stealth and blocked connection data to adjust filter lists or to report issues.
- Combine with other tools to correlate domain activity with content exposure or privacy concerns.

<Warning>
Although uBO Scope exposes all network connections attempted by the browser tab, it does not block traffic itself; it complements content blockers by reporting what is allowed or blocked.
</Warning>
