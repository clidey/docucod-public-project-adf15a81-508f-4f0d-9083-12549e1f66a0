# Quick Feature Overview of uBO Scope

uBO Scope delivers a rapid orientation into its core capabilities, providing you with a concise snapshot of how it captures and reports browser third-party connection behaviors. Designed for transparency and accuracy, this page distills the extension’s essential features so you can quickly understand the value it brings.

---

## Real-Time Reporting of Third-Party Server Connections

At its heart, uBO Scope offers live visibility into all remote server connections your browser attempts, regardless of whether they are allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked. This immediate reporting empowers you to see, as it happens, the distinct third-party domains your browsing activity touches — helping you gain an unfiltered understanding of external resources loaded by webpages.

### Why Does This Matter?
Consider scenarios where you want to audit which external services a website relies on, or validate if your content-blocking tools are truly effective in cutting off unwanted connections. uBO Scope offers:

- **Accurate counts of distinct remote servers contacted, not just block counts.**
- **Clear differentiation of connection outcomes:** Allowed, stealth-blocked (hidden), and blocked connections are presented separately for comprehensive insight.

---

## Cross-Browser Support

uBO Scope supports the major modern browsers: Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge), Firefox, and Safari. This ensures consistent behavior and reporting across your preferred environment.

- The extension uses native browser APIs such as the **webRequest API**, providing reliable data regardless of browser choice.
- Platform-specific manifest files enable the extension to integrate seamlessly, maintaining feature parity across browsers.

This cross-browser design enables users to maintain consistent privacy and monitoring practices across devices and environments.

## Use of Native Browser APIs for Accurate Data

uBO Scope leverages the browser’s native `webRequest` API as the foundational mechanism for tracking network requests:

- It listens to all network requests initiated by tabs, including HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and secure WebSocket protocols.
- Outcomes of these requests are categorized in real time into allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked states based on the browser's network event feedback.
- The extension stores and aggregates this data per browser tab, enabling precise reporting of each tab’s remote connections.

By using the `webRequest` API directly, uBO Scope attains data accuracy beyond what block count badges can reveal and maintains compatibility with other content blockers or network-level filtering.

## Summary of Core Features

- **Distinct Third-Party Domain Counting:** Counts unique remote servers contacted by each browser tab, highlighting third-party connections beyond simple request counts.
- **Outcome Categorization:** Differentiates connections into "allowed," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked," providing a nuanced understanding of network activity.
- **Toolbar Badge Indicator:** Displays the count of distinct third-party domains contacted by the active tab, offering an at-a-glance measure of external resource access.
- **Popup Interface:** Provides a detailed breakdown of connected domains drilled down into outcome categories.
- **Persistent Session Data:** Retains connection maps during browsing sessions for historical analysis.
- **Native API Utilization:** Uses the standard browser webRequest API for cross-browser compatibility and precise monitoring.

## Real-World Example: Audit Your Browsing

Imagine opening uBO Scope’s popup while browsing a popular news site. You instantly see:

- The total number of external server domains contacted by the page.
- Which domains were successfully connected to (e.g., CDN providers).
- Which ones were blocked or stealthily blocked by your content blocker.

This real-time insight helps you understand the external services a website uses and evaluate how well your privacy tools perform.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- For the most accurate data, ensure uBO Scope has the necessary browser permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).
- Use the popup regularly to monitor active tab connections; it refreshes on demand for up-to-the-moment snapshots.
- Remember that the badge count reflects distinct third-party domains with allowed connections — lower counts indicate fewer external exposures.
- Take advantage of the categorized outcomes to investigate unusual or stealth connections.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Do not rely solely on block counts from other extensions; instead, trust the distinct domain counts provided here for a more truthful privacy picture.
- Keep in mind that some network requests outside the `webRequest` API's scope cannot be monitored by uBO Scope.
- Stealth blocking may cause some domains to appear in the stealth category, requiring you to look deeper to fully understand their impact.
