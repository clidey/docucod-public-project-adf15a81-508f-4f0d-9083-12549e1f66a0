# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

## Empowering Privacy Advocates, Filter List Maintainers, and Tech Professionals

uBO Scope is designed to provide unparalleled transparency into every remote server connection that webpages attempt or succeed in making. Understanding who benefits most from this insight transforms how you approach online privacy, content blocking, and web behavior analysis.

## Key User Groups

### Privacy-Focused Users

Whether you're an everyday web user concerned about your digital privacy or a power user scrutinizing trackers and unwanted network connections, uBO Scope equips you with the knowledge to see what lurks beneath the surface of every webpage you visit.

- **Why You Care:** Understand exactly which third-party domains your browser is connecting to, beyond what typical blockers reveal.
- **Common Use:** Explore real-time connection reports to spot unexpected or unnecessary network requests.

### Filter List Maintainers

If you maintain or contribute to filter lists (such as adblock filter lists), uBO Scope becomes a crucial tool in your workflow, even on devices without traditional browser developer tools.

- **Why You Care:** Validate the effectiveness of your filter lists by observing what requests are allowed, stealth-blocked, or truly blocked.
- **Common Use:** Identify new third-party domains and connection patterns to update and optimize filter rules.

### Tech Professionals and Researchers

Developers, security analysts, and web researchers who investigate site behavior, network request patterns, or content blocker efficacy will find uBO Scope invaluable.

- **Why You Care:** Gain fine-grained insights into network connections made by webpages to assist debugging, security audits, or academic research.
- **Common Use:** Conduct empirical testing of web requests and evaluate how content blockers operate in real-world conditions.

## Scenarios Where uBO Scope Shines

### Evaluating Blocker Effectiveness

Many users mistakenly rely on block counts advertised by content blockers to judge their effectiveness. uBO Scope clarifies the reality by:

- Reporting the actual number of distinct third-party remote servers connected to.
- Revealing connections even when stealth blocking or DNS-level blocking is in effect.

This allows you to **accurately assess blocker performance based on real network activity**, not just what is reported by individual blockers.

### Debunking Common Myths

uBO Scope helps expose prevalent misconceptions such as:

- **Myth:** A higher block count always means better protection.

  _Reality:_ High block counts can coincide with more distinct remote servers being contacted, indicating poorer overall blocking.

- **Myth:** Ad blocker test webpages reliably evaluate blocker performance.

  _Reality:_ These tests use fabricated scenarios that do not represent real-world browsing and can't detect stealth blocking tricks.

Use uBO Scope to gain an **unbiased view free from misleading metrics or artificial test conditions**.

### Investigating Site Behavior

Gain insights into how websites behave behind the scenes by inspecting all network connections, including those that are allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked. This is particularly useful when:

- Diagnosing unexpected data leaks or privacy issues.
- Understanding how complex sites load resources from multiple domains.

## Real-World Example: Understanding Connections on a News Website

Imagine visiting a popular news site. With uBO Scope, you can:

- See that your browser connected to several legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs).
- Spot trackers or analytics providers trying to connect stealthily.
- Confirm which connections your content blocker is fully blocking.

This real-time visibility lets you make informed decisions about your privacy and blocker settings.

## Benefits Summary

- **Clarity:** Get a comprehensive, unfiltered view of all attempted and successful network connections.
- **Control:** Identify and respond to network connections that you might want to block or investigate.
- **Validation:** Assess the true effectiveness of your content blockers and filter lists.
- **Education:** Learn about the behavior of websites and how connections appear from the browser’s perspective.
