# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

## Unlocking the Power of Web Connection Transparency

uBO Scope is designed for anyone eager to understand the invisible network chatter behind the websites they visit.

## Who Benefits Most from uBO Scope?

### Privacy-Conscious Users

If you value control over your online footprint, uBO Scope is your ally. It shows the exact number of distinct third-party servers a webpage connects to, helping you gauge how much your browsing is exposed to external parties.

- **Validate your content blocker:** Confirm that your blocker is effectively limiting unwanted connections.
- **Debunk false assumptions:** See beyond badge counts and misleading stats to understand actual exposure.
- **Supplement browser tools:** Get deeper insight that your browser’s developer tools can't fully provide.

### Filter List Maintainers

Crafting and maintaining lists that power content blockers requires sharp insight into network connections.

- **Identify unblocked connections:** Discover servers that slip through current filter lists.
- **Improve blocker reliability:** Use uBO Scope to validate filter effectiveness across different devices, even with limited browser tools.
- **Streamline troubleshooting:** Diagnose why certain connections are allowed or blocked with concrete data.

### General Users & Web Enthusiasts

Curious about what really happens behind the scenes when you load a website?

- **Explore real network activity:** See connections made, blocked, or stealthily redirected in real time.
- **Understand connection outcomes:** Grasp the difference between blocked, allowed, and stealth-blocked requests.
- **Make educated decisions:** Use real data to choose content blockers or privacy settings wisely.

## Key Use Cases Where uBO Scope Excels

- **Validating Content Blockers:** Unlike simple block count badges, uBO Scope reveals the true count of distinct third-party connections. This helps you understand if your blocker is allowing unwanted servers or truly minimizing exposure.

- **Debunking Common Myths:** Avoid being misled by popular but inaccurate myths, such as “a blocker with a higher block count is always better” or trusting "ad blocker test" sites that use unrealistic scenarios.

- **Supplementing Limited Developer Tools:** On devices or browsers with constrained developer options, uBO Scope offers a simple, actionable view of webpage network behavior.

- **Filter List Development:** Detect gaps and overlaps in filter lists by monitoring which domains remain accessible or are blocked, facilitating the refinement of lists.

## How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Workflow

Imagine browsing a news site. Normally, you only see the page content, not the hidden network calls. With uBO Scope activated:

1. You click the extension icon to open the popup.
2. Instantly, you see a breakdown of connected domains categorized as:
   - **Allowed:** Servers your content blocker permitted.
   - **Blocked:** Servers actively blocked.
   - **Stealth-blocked:** Connections interrupted or redirected silently to avoid detection.
3. This information confirms whether your privacy tools are working as expected or if additional adjustments are needed.

Through this transparent report, you gain clarity and confidence without wading through complex browser tools or ambiguous indicators.

## Practical Tips for Effective Use

- **Regularly Review Domain Lists:** Keep an eye on new or unexpected domains appearing under allowed connections—these might represent privacy leaks.
- **Correlate with Your Content Blocker:** Use uBO Scope alongside your blocker’s dashboard to cross-verify results.
- **Beware of "Ad Blocker Test" Sites:** Use real-world web pages for inspection instead of contrived tests that may give misleading impressions.
- **Leverage for Filter Maintenance:** Export or note persistent unblocked domains to update or improve your filter lists.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Misinterpreting Block Counts:** Don’t judge content blockers solely by their badge or block count. A high block count might mean more network traffic, not less.
- **Trusting Synthetic Tests:** Some ad blocker test pages create unrealistic network connections that don’t occur in typical browsing.
- **Assuming Complete Coverage from Browser Dev Tools:** Many browser tools don’t detect stealth-blocked or DNS-blocked requests; uBO Scope fills this gap.
