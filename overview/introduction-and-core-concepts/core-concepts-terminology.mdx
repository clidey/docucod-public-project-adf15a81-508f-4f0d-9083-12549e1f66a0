# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the key terms and concepts used by uBO Scope is essential to interpreting its reports accurately and making informed decisions about browser network activity. This page defines the foundational terminology and explains what the badge count on the toolbar icon truly represents.

---

## What Is a Third-Party Remote Server?

At the heart of uBO Scope’s reporting is the concept of a **third-party remote server**. Simply put, this is any server that is *not* part of the website's primary domain you are visiting but is contacted during page load or interaction.

- **Example:** If you visit `example.com` and your browser loads resources from `cdn.example.com`, that is *first-party* because it is a subdomain of the main site.
- If, however, resources or requests are made to `adsnetwork.com` or `analyticsvendor.net`, these are **third-party** servers.

Third-party servers are important because they often track user behavior, serve ads, or provide ancillary services. uBO Scope reveals all such connections attempted or made, providing transparency.

## Understanding Request Outcomes: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth

uBO Scope categorizes observed network connections by how they were handled, using terms you’ll see in the popup UI and reports.

### Allowed Requests

- These are connections that your browser successfully made to third-party servers.
- It means these requests were *not blocked* by any content blocker or network filter.
- Typical allowed third parties include legitimate services such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).

### Blocked Requests

- Requests that the content blocker or network filters prevented from completing.
- These connections never reached the remote third-party server.
- Indicates active blocking on your device for these servers.

### Stealth Requests

- Refers to requests that were redirected or suppressed stealthily by the content blocker.
- The request might have initially appeared to start but was altered or quietly cancelled before completion.
- This is a subtle action by content blockers to avoid exposing blocking activity to the webpage.

<u>**Note:** Stealth-blocked requests are different from outright blocked requests; they are designed to be less detectable but still prevent loading unwanted content.</u>

## Badge Count: What Does It Measure?

The badge displayed on the toolbar icon of uBO Scope shows a *count* — but it is not a raw count of blocked or allowed requests.

**Badge Count Definition:**

> The number of **distinct** third-party remote servers to which there was a connection during the current browsing session *and that were allowed* in some form.

- A **lower badge count is more desirable**, indicating fewer third-party connections.
- This count *does not* reflect the total number of blocked requests or total requests made.
- It measures the *breadth of distinct servers* your browser communicated with, regardless of how many individual requests were issued.

**Why this matters:**

- A high block count (as shown in some blockers) can paradoxically mean more third-party server connections occurred.
- uBO Scope helps debunk misleading metrics by focusing on the distinct number of third-party servers actually reached.

## Additional Foundational Terms

### Domain vs. Hostname

- A **hostname** is the full domain name you see in a URL, e.g., `sub.example.com`.
- A **domain** is the registered base name, often referred to as the "public suffix plus one label", e.g., `example.com`.

uBO Scope internally maps hostnames to their domains using the Public Suffix List to ensure consistent grouping of third-party connections.

### Network Request Events

uBO Scope observes and records network requests through browser `webRequest` API events and labels them as:

- **Success:** Request completed successfully.
- **Redirect:** Request was redirected to another URL.
- **Error:** Request failed or was blocked.

By aggregating these, uBO Scope builds a clear picture of what third-party connections are allowed, blocked, or stealthy.

## Using This Knowledge to Interpret uBO Scope Outputs

With these terms clear, when you look at the popup:

- The "**not blocked**" section shows third-party domains your browser contacted successfully.
- The "**blocked**" section lists third-party domains your content blocker prevented connecting to.
- The "**stealth-blocked**" section lists domains where connections were quietly intercepted or redirected.
- The badge count always reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.

By understanding these concepts, you gain meaningful insight into your browsing privacy and the effectiveness of your content blockers.

<Tip>
For best results, use the badge count alongside detailed popup reports to get a clear, actionable view of third-party server activity per tab.
</Tip>

<Note>
Remember, not all third parties are harmful or unwanted; many content delivery or analytics services are essential for site functionality.
