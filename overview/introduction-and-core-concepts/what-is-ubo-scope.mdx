# What is uBO Scope?

## Introducing Transparency to Your Browsing Connections

When you visit a webpage, dozens—sometimes hundreds—of network requests quietly reach out to remote servers. Some are essential; others may track you without your knowledge. uBO Scope is a powerful yet straightforward browser extension designed to expose every connection a webpage makes, whether successful or attempted. It puts network activity into clear view, offering transparency and empowering you to understand and control how your browser communicates with the outside world.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Reveal all connections:** See every distinct third-party remote server your browser attempts to contact.
- **True insight beyond blockers:** Understand real network activity regardless of any content blocking tools in use.
- **Reduce unnecessary connections:** Fewer connections mean better privacy, reduced tracking, and enhanced control.
- **Dispel myths:** Bust misleading assumptions about block counts and ad blocker effectiveness.
- **Support filter list maintainers:** Get precise connection data useful for refining blocking strategies.

### Who Benefits Most?

uBO Scope is for privacy-conscious users, security researchers, filter list maintainers, and anyone curious about what happens behind the scenes on the web. It is the transparency companion to content blockers, not a replacement.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension that monitors and reports every connection—both successful and attempted—that web pages make to remote servers. Unlike traditional content blockers focused on blocking or filtering content, uBO Scope's mission is pure transparency. It uncovers all network requests, giving you a crystal-clear window into the true network traffic your browser generates.

### Solving the Hidden Connections Problem

Websites today load resources from multiple external third-party servers, including tracking, advertising, or analytics domains that collect user data. Many users rely on blockers but lack visibility into what connections actually occur—especially since blockers might stealthily allow some connections to avoid breakage or detection.

uBO Scope solves this problem by reporting the exact remote servers involved and how the browser's network requests to these servers conclude, whether they complete, redirect, or are blocked. This insight enables you to make informed decisions about your browsing privacy and security.

### How uBO Scope Differs from Content Blockers

- **Does not block:** It only observes and reports connections.
- **Reports all connection attempts:** Whether blocked by other extensions, your DNS, or allowed, uBO Scope captures it.
- **Focuses on distinct third-party servers:** Counts connections per unique remote domains rather than individual resource requests.

### Under the Hood (High Level)

uBO Scope listens to your browser's `webRequest` API events for outgoing network requests matching HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and Secure WebSocket protocols. It tracks request outcomes such as success, redirect, or error, associating these with the active tab and origin domain. Tab-specific summaries and badge counts on the toolbar provide real-time feedback.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### 1. Comprehensive Connection Reporting

Tracks every network request your browser initiates, reporting the exact third-party remote servers contacted, including:
- **Allowed connections:** Requests that complete successfully.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Redirected requests that may be blocked invisibly.
- **Blocked connections:** Requests that error or fail due to content blocking or network errors.

### 2. Real-Time Toolbar Badge

Displays a clear numeric badge on the extension icon representing the number of distinct third-party remote domains connected to on the current tab. A lower number means fewer third-party connections—and typically better privacy.

### 3. Tab-Specific Data Summary

Pop-up panels break down connections per tab, listing domains and counts by status:
- Not blocked (allowed)
- Stealth-blocked (redirected)
- Blocked (errored)

This empowers you to see exactly which domains contact your browser.

### 4. Compatibility Across Browsers

Supports Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari by employing standard web extension APIs and permissions ensuring broad applicability.

### 5. Mythbusting and Education

Helps users understand:
- Why block counts alone don't reflect content blocker effectiveness.
- Why popular "ad blocker test" websites provide misleading results.

This fosters realistic privacy expectations.

## Why Should You Care?

### Gain Full Visibility

Without uBO Scope, many network requests stay hidden, leaving you unsure who is tracking, loading, or redirecting your traffic. uBO Scope illuminates your browser’s network activity transparently.

### Enhance Your Privacy

By identifying all third-party domains contacted, you can reduce unnecessary connections, tighten content blocking rules, and prevent leakage of your browsing behavior.

### Make Informed Decisions

Understanding the difference between a website’s legitimate CDN connections and unwanted third-party trackers helps you tailor your privacy tools more effectively.

### Real Use Cases

- **Privacy advocates:** Monitor third-party connections to identify unnoticed trackers.
- **Security researchers:** Analyze page network behavior comprehensively.
- **Filter list maintainers:** Validate blocking efficiency and stealth blocking behavior on various devices.
- **Curious coders:** Explore how modern websites communicate with the network.

### Before and After uBO Scope

Before: Blind to third-party network requests beyond what content blockers reveal.
After: Detailed, tab-specific reporting of all remote server connections, empowering smarter privacy control.

## Getting Started Preview

### Quick Setup
1. Install uBO Scope from the official browser stores:
   - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
   - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

2. Open any webpage and click the toolbar icon to view connection details.

3. Observe the badge count indicating the number of distinct third-party domains connected.

### Prerequisites
Ensure your browser supports the `webRequest` API and permissions required by uBO Scope (standard in modern major browsers). No special configuration is needed beyond installation.

### Next Steps
Explore the detailed connection reports and learn to interpret badge counts via the related guides:

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **No badge shown:** Confirm that uBO Scope is enabled and granted necessary permissions.
- **Unexpectedly high connection counts:** Some legitimate services (e.g., CDNs) may increase domain counts; review detailed reports to distinguish.
- **Connections not logged:** Network requests outside `webRequest` API visibility are not captured (rare edge cases).

If you encounter issues, consult the Troubleshooting Common Issues page linked in the documentation.

## Summary

uBO Scope is your transparent lens into the unseen network connections initiated by webpages. By revealing every outgoing connection—successful or blocked—it empowers you with actionable data for privacy, security, and informed web navigation.

Turn the invisible visible and take control of your browsing connections with uBO Scope.
