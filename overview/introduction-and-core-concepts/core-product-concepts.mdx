# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the essential terms used in uBO Scope empowers you to accurately interpret the data presented and make informed decisions about your browsing privacy. This page unpacks the key vocabulary such as 'third-party remote server', connection outcomes like 'allowed', 'blocked', 'stealth', and explains the significance of badge counts and categories. By clarifying how badges, categories, and reports map to real web activity, you'll gain the confidence to analyze popup details with clarity.

## What Is a 'Third-Party Remote Server'?

A 'third-party remote server' refers to any external server that a webpage attempts to connect to which is different from the domain you are actively visiting. This includes content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics services, ad networks, and other resources loaded alongside the main website.

For example, if you visit `example.com` and the page requests scripts or images from `cdn.example.net` or `analytics.tracker.com`, these external domains are third parties.

> **Why This Matters:**
> Tracking the number of distinct third-party servers you connect to helps you understand your exposure to external services, which can impact privacy and security.


## Defining Connection Outcomes: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth

uBO Scope categorizes each network request based on how it was handled by your browser and any content blockers:

- **Allowed:** Connections that successfully completed without being impeded. These represent resources your browser fetched from third-party servers.

- **Blocked:** Attempts to connect that failed due to content blocking mechanisms, such as browser extensions, DNS blocking, or other privacy protections.

- **Stealth:** Connections that were blocked in a manner designed to conceal the blocking from the webpage, making it appear as if the resource loaded normally. This stealth blocking minimizes page breakage and avoids detection by anti-blocking scripts.


## Understanding Connection Counts and Toolbar Badges

The toolbar icon badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected during your browsing session on the current tab.

- **Badge Count:** Reflects unique third-party domains for which at least one connection was established or attempted and recorded as 'allowed'.

- A **lower count** on the badge is generally better, indicating fewer third-party connections, which often means improved privacy.

- Connections that are **blocked** or **stealth blocked** do not increase the badge count.


## How Badges, Categories, and Reports Relate to Web Activity

uBO Scope presents data grouped into three main categories matching the connection outcomes:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Shows domains where connections succeeded, reflecting the actual third-party servers your browser communicated with.

- **Stealth Blocked:** Lists domains where connections were stealthily blocked. These don’t increase your badge count but are monitored for transparency.

- **Blocked:** Contains domains where connections were outright blocked and failed.

Each category displays the domains along with counts indicating how many times connections were attempted or succeeded per domain.

### Example: Reading the Popup Data

When you open uBO Scope’s popup for an active tab, you will see:

- The **main hostname and domain** you are browsing.
- A summary number indicating the total distinct allowed domains (matches the badge).
- Lists of domains under each outcome (allowed, stealth, blocked), with counts showing connection frequency.

This information helps you quickly assess which third-party servers are interacting with the site and how effectively blocking is working.

## Practical Tips for Interpreting Core Concepts

- **Focus on domains, not individual URLs.** uBO Scope groups connections by domain, aggregating requests from multiple URLs under the same domain.

- **Recognize legitimate third parties.** Not all third parties are harmful; many websites rely on CDNs or trusted services.

- **Use badge counts as a privacy indicator.** A high count might mean more exposure; a low count generally means better control.

- **Understand stealth blocking as a privacy-friendly approach.** It balances blocking with usability, keeping sites functional while enhancing anonymity.


## Troubleshooting and Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions & Issues">
<Accordion title="Why might the badge count change unexpectedly?">
The badge updates based on the distinct allowed domains in a tab. Navigation in the tab resets counts, and background processes update the badge asynchronously. Keep in mind some domains may appear repeatedly if used by multiple requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can stealth blocking hide tracking from detection?">
Yes, stealth blocking aims to prevent web pages from detecting blocking by making blocked resources appear as if they loaded normally. This prevents anti-adblock scripts from triggering.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if a domain shows under both allowed and stealth?">
Domains can appear in multiple categories if some requests succeeded while others were stealth-blocked in the same browsing session.
