# Interpreting the Toolbar Badge Count

## Understand What the Badge Count Reveals About Your Privacy

When you first install uBO Scope, you will notice a numeric badge displayed on the extension’s toolbar icon. This number is much more than a simple count—it is your real-time indicator of how many distinct third-party domains your browser connected to while loading the current webpage.

### Why This Matters

This badge count reflects the **number of unique third-party remote servers** that your browser successfully connected to. A lower number is better for your privacy, as it means fewer external entities are involved in gathering data or delivering content on the page you are visiting.

Unlike many other content blockers, uBO Scope focuses on actual network traffic outcomes — not just blocks or filter hits — giving you a truthful metric for assessing third-party network activity.

## What the Badge Count Indicates

The toolbar badge count represents:

- **Distinct allowed third-party domains:** These are domains outside the main website's own domain from which your browser fetched resources or connected during page load and interaction.
- **Excludes blocked or stealth-blocked domains:** Domains where network requests were prevented or invisibly blocked do not count toward this number.

This makes the badge a powerful privacy metric, telling you how many external parties your browser genuinely communicated with.

### Important Clarifications

- The count **does not** mean the total of every request made but the count of unique third-party domains.
- A **high badge count signals more external connections**, which typically correlates to greater privacy exposure.
- The badge count shows the real network activity, regardless of which content blocker you may use, as long as the browser reports network requests via the WebRequest API.

If you see an unexpectedly high badge count on a familiar website, this is your chance to investigate further using uBO Scope’s popup interface to identify which third parties are involved.

## How to Use the Badge Count in Your Workflow

1. **Visit a website and observe the badge count** as the page loads and when interacting with it.
2. **Lower is better:** Use the count as a quick privacy health check.
3. **Click the toolbar icon to open the popup panel** for detailed domain lists categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
4. **Identify third parties you might want to block:** Repeatedly high badge counts on various sites often indicate third parties that commonly track or deliver ads.
5. **Evaluate content blocker effectiveness:** Instead of relying on block counts alone, monitor how your content blocker impacts the badge count.

This approach lets you make informed privacy choices based on concrete, real-world network connections.

## Common Misconceptions Debunked

<u>uBO Scope helps dispel myths often seen around badge counts and privacy monitoring tools.</u>

- ### 'Higher Block Count Means Better Protection'
  Many users assume that a content blocker showing more blocked requests is superior. However, a higher block count can mean your browser is connecting to more third-party domains in the first place, thereby negatively impacting privacy despite blockers.

- ### 'Ad blocker test pages are reliable metrics'
  Some websites claim to benchmark blockers by simulating ad calls. These tests are typically artificial and do not reflect actual network conditions or stealth techniques employed by modern content blockers.

By focusing on the actual allowed third-party domains — precisely what the badge count shows — you get a truthful picture of your browser’s exposure.

## Practical Tips for Making the Most of the Badge Count

- **Monitor badge changes as you navigate:** Notice spikes or drops to gauge when third-party connections increase.
- **Combine badge information with the popup details:** The popup breaks down which domains are allowed vs. stealth-blocked or blocked.
- **Remember that some third parties are necessary:** Content delivery networks (CDNs) or essential services may appear — context matters.
- **Use with other uBO Scope tools:** Cross-reference with the popup and analysis guides for deeper insights.

## Summary

The toolbar badge count in uBO Scope is your fastest, most reliable signal showing how many distinct third-party domains your browser connected to successfully on the active tab. Understanding and leveraging this count empowers you to make privacy-conscious decisions and evaluate the true impact of blockers beyond misleading block counts or test websites.

For detailed exploration, pair badge counts with the popup interface to see exactly which domains affect your privacy.

## Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Badge Count Questions">
<Accordion title="Why is the badge sometimes empty?">
If the badge shows no number, it means no third-party connections were recorded for the active tab. This can happen on very simple sites or if data hasn't yet loaded.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count fluctuate quickly?">
Network conditions and asynchronous loading cause the badge to update as new third-party connections are detected. This is expected behavior.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="If I block a domain, why might the badge count not decrease?">
Blocked domains are excluded from the badge count. However, other allowed third parties might still keep the number high. Also, caching or browser behavior might delay updates.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can some domains appear allowed even if my content blocker blocks them?">
uBO Scope relies on browser-reported network events via WebRequest API. Some block methods (like DNS blocking outside the browser) may not be detected. The badge count shows what the browser network stack actually connected to.

## Example Scenario: Using the Badge in Real Browsing

Imagine you're visiting your favorite news site, and the badge shows 15. You click the icon to see which third parties these are, and notice several advertising networks. After enabling stricter blocking rules or adding specific filters, the badge drops to 5, indicating fewer third-party connections.

This immediate feedback loop helps you gauge the effectiveness of your privacy efforts in real time.
