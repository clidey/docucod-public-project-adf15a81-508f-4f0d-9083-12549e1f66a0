# What Problems Does uBO Scope Solve?

Understanding the real impact of content blockers and achieving full transparency about network activity can be challenging in modern web browsing. The "What Problems Does uBO Scope Solve?" page focuses on addressing critical misconceptions and practical challenges inherent to content blockers, especially those operating as browser extensions.

## Demystifying Content Blocker Efficacy

Many users are misled by simplistic metrics of content blocking effectiveness, such as toolbar badge counts or results from deceptive test webpages. uBO Scope confronts these myths head-on:

- **Myth: Higher Block Count Means Better Blocking**  
  The badge showing the number of blocked requests can be counterintuitive. A content blocker with a higher block count might actually allow more third-party connections overall, creating false impressions of superiority.

- **Myth: Ad Blocker Test Pages Provide Accurate Reliability Measures**  
  Such test pages are often unrealistic, producing fabricated network requests that don't happen in real-world browsing. They can't account for stealth techniques used by many extensions, leading to misleading test results.

uBO Scope solves these problems by revealing the actual distinct third-party remote servers your browser connects to, regardless of what any other blocker claims or shows. This offers a reliable and transparent measurement for users to truly understand what content is allowed through.


## Reliable Network Visibility Across Blocking Layers

Content blocking might occur at various layers including extensions, DNS-level filtering, or browser native features. Traditional tools often fail to report blocked network activity accurately across all these layers.

uBO Scope operates using the browser's `webRequest` API, ensuring that it can:

- Detect and report network requests regardless of whether blocking happens via extension, DNS filtering, or stealthy redirection.
- Provide a comprehensive view of both allowed and blocked connections, including those hidden from other toolsets.

### Real Scenario
Imagine visiting a complex website with multiple third-party services, some blocked by DNS filters and others by content blockers. uBO Scope shows exactly which domains your browser attempted connections to, and categorizes them as allowed, stealth-blocked (redirected or silently blocked), or outright blocked, providing actionable insights.


## Enhanced Transparency on Limited-Access Devices

Some users operate in environments where browser developer tools are limited or inaccessibleâ€”for example, on locked-down devices or managed computers.

- uBO Scope empowers users and filter list maintainers in these situations by providing a lightweight, easily accessible extension interface.
- It allows inspection of network connect attempts without requiring deep technical tools or elevated permissions.

This ability to extract meaningful data in constrained environments is crucial for maintaining filter quality and understanding privacy exposure.


## Summary of Problems Addressed

| Problem                                         | How uBO Scope Solves It                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Misleading block count metrics                   | Shows the actual number of distinct remote servers connected to instead of raw block numbers |
| Unreliable 'ad blocker test' pages               | Provides real-world measurement based on actual network requests |
| Lack of visibility when multiple blockers or DNS filtering is in use | Combines all blocking effects through the browser's `webRequest` API |
| Difficulty in auditing on restricted devices     | Simple popup interface that reveals network activity without advanced tools |

## Practical Tips for Users

- **Focus on Allowed Domains:** Look closely at the "allowed" domains in the popup; fewer distinct allowed third parties generally means better privacy.

- **Understand Stealth Blocking:** Some content blockers silently redirect or block requests without raising visible errors; uBO Scope distinguishes these stealth-blocked domains.

- **Use uBO Scope Alongside Other Blockers:** Rather than replacing content blockers, use uBO Scope as a transparency companion to verify what they actually allow.

- **Check on Different Websites:** Test across various real-world sites rather than relying on artificial test pages for understanding your exposure.


## Troubleshooting Common Misunderstandings

If you notice a high block count on other blockers but still see many allowed domains in uBO Scope, it means many connections may be bypassing blocking through stealth or DNS layers. This is not a bug; it reflects real network behavior and highlights the value of uBO Scope's measurement approach.
