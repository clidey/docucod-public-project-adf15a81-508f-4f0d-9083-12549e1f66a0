# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Discover whether uBO Scope is the right fit for you. Whether you're a privacy-conscious user curious about the real connections your browser makes, a filter list maintainer needing reliable data, or someone keen to verify the effectiveness of other browser extensions, this page will clarify how uBO Scope serves your unique goals.

## Understanding Your Needs: The User Personas

### Privacy-Conscious Users
You value transparency and control over your web browsing experience. uBO Scope uncovers every distinct third-party connection your browser attempts — regardless of which content blockers you have enabled. This helps you:

- See exactly which remote servers your browser reaches out to,
- Assess the effectiveness of your current blockers based on actual connections rather than block counts,
- Identify potentially unnecessary or unwanted third parties slowing down your browsing or risking your privacy.

### Filter List Maintainers
If you maintain or audit filter lists for content blockers, uBO Scope provides invaluable insights by revealing real-world connection attempts:

- Monitor which third-party domains persist despite blocking efforts,
- Validate the impact of your filter rules on actual network requests,
- Work effectively even when browser-based developer tools are limited or unavailable,
- Plan targeted updates to filter lists using concrete data.

### Users Verifying Other Browser Extensions
Curious if your favored content blocker truly limits connections as promised? uBO Scope offers an independent way to:

- Confirm which third-party connections are genuinely blocked or allowed,
- Debunk misleading claims based on block counts or synthetic "ad blocker test" webpages,
- Compare multiple blockers by focusing on distinct remote servers contacted rather than raw counts of blocked URLs.

---

## Why uBO Scope Fits These Users Perfectly

Unlike typical content blockers or test pages, uBO Scope listens directly to network requests via the browser's `webRequest` API. This means:

- It reports **all** network requests—whether blocked or allowed—giving a true and unbiased picture,
- It remains relevant regardless of what other blockers or DNS-based protections you use,
- It helps you move beyond misleading heuristics like badge block counts to focus on what really matters: the variety of third-party connections.

This makes it a rare tool with straightforward transparency for anyone seeking clarity about third-party web connections.

## Real Scenarios Where uBO Scope Shines

### Scenario 1: You see a high block count but still feel like trackers load.
Use uBO Scope to reveal how many distinct third-party connections actually succeed despite blocking rules—in many cases, the number is higher than you expect.

### Scenario 2: You maintain filter lists but lack access to browser dev tools.
Deploy uBO Scope on your test devices to gather real data about connections, helping you refine and target your filters more effectively.

### Scenario 3: Comparing two extensions claiming better blocking.
Instead of relying on their block count badges, use uBO Scope to independently verify which one limits your third-party connections more.

## Best Practices: Maximizing Your Experience

- **Interpret badge counts correctly:** The tool's badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected to—not a block count. A lower number means fewer connections, which is better.
- **Avoid "ad blocker test" webpages as benchmarks:** These tests often generate unrealistic scenarios that don’t reflect actual web traffic.
- **Understand connection outcomes:** uBO Scope classifies connections as not blocked, stealth-blocked (redirected or otherwise made invisible), or blocked, so use this data to get the full picture.

## Summary
If your goal is to gain transparency about your web connections, validate blocking effectiveness with real data, or improve filter lists based on actual browsing behaviors, uBO Scope is designed for you.
