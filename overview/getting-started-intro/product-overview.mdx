# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Your Browser Makes

uBO Scope is a powerful companion extension to uBlock Origin that lifts the veil on your browser's network activity. Unlike traditional content blockers that merely block or allow content, uBO Scope reveals *every* remote server your browser attempts to connect to — whether those connections succeed, fail, or are stealthily blocked.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

Modern browsing involves countless invisible third-party servers sending and receiving data behind the scenes. uBO Scope helps you visualize and quantify all these interactions, giving you unprecedented transparency into your web traffic.

- **Visualize third-party connections:** See exactly which remote domains your browser contacts while browsing.
- **Quantify connection outcomes:** Know which requests were allowed, blocked stealthily, or outright denied.
- **Independent of content blockers:** uBO Scope tracks network requests regardless of what other content blockers or privacy tools you use.
- **Empowers privacy awareness:** Understand the real impact of third-party tracking and content on your browsing experience.
- **Helps debunk misconceptions:** Cut through myths about content blocker effectiveness with objective data.

### Who Benefits from uBO Scope?

Whether you are a privacy-conscious user, a filter list maintainer, or simply curious about your browser’s inner workings, uBO Scope offers clear, actionable insights. It helps you make informed decisions without relying on unreliable metrics or opaque block counts.

## What Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to monitor and report on all network requests your browser makes to third-party remote servers during web page loads.

At its core, it acts as an observatory that measures the connections initiated by your browser, classifying them based on their outcome:

- Requests **allowed** by content blockers or native browser policies.
- Requests **stealth-blocked** — those stopped invisibly to avoid page breakage or detection.
- Requests outright **blocked** by network-level or browser measures.

Unlike conventional content blockers that impose rules *before* requests occur, uBO Scope focuses on delivering *transparent, quantitative feedback* on the *actual* network activity, independent of blocking decisions.

## Why Does uBO Scope Exist?

Content blocking ecosystems often suffer from misconceptions and unreliable heuristics. uBO Scope exists to demystify these, providing:

- **Real transparency:** See the true reach of all web connections, not just what blockers report.
- **Objective measurement:** Identifies the distinct number of third-party domains contacted.
- **Myth-busting:** Challenges assumptions like “more blocks means better protection.”
- **Reliable data source:** Useful for users, filter list maintainers, and developers alike.

This approach equips users to better understand the complexity of web tracking and content delivery mechanisms.

## What Sets uBO Scope Apart?

While most content blockers focus on filtering and blocking, uBO Scope is unique because it:

- **Tracks all network requests, not just blocked ones:** You gain a complete picture, revealing stealthy behaviors other tools miss.
- **Works alongside any content blockers:** It reports connectivity regardless of blocker technology or DNS-level filters.
- **Presents data by distinct third-party domains contacted:** Reducing noise and emphasizing actionable insights.

Together, these capabilities create a transparency tool rather than a blocker, empowering you to understand your browsing environment deeply.

## How uBO Scope Works (High-Level)

uBO Scope integrates directly with your browser's underlying webRequest API to monitor every network request made within a browsing session. It then categorizes each third-party connection by outcome and associates those requests with the relevant browser tab.

1. **Listening to network events:** The extension intercepts network request events such as redirection, errors, and successful responses.
2. **Hostname and domain resolution:** Using an up-to-date public suffix list, uBO Scope extracts the meaningful domain from each hostname.
3. **Recording outcomes:** Every request is logged as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked based on request events.
4. **Tab association:** The extension tracks these requests per browser tab, keeping context aligned.
5. **User interface presentation:** The popup window displays detailed counts and domains contacted, grouped by their connection outcomes.

This seamless flow empowers users to audit and comprehend web connections on a per-tab basis.

## Real-World Example

Imagine visiting a news website. uBO Scope will reveal:

- The main website’s domain (first-party).
- Multiple third-party domains contacted — such as ad networks, analytics servers, or CDNs.
- Which of those connections succeeded and which were blocked or stealth-blocked by your other extensions or browser policies.

From this, you learn how many unique third-party servers truly touch your browsing data and can verify the effectiveness of your privacy setup.

## Tips for Using uBO Scope Effectively

- **Use alongside content blockers:** uBO Scope enhances your understanding but doesn't block; keep your blockers active.
- **Interpret badge count wisely:** The badge number signifies *distinct allowed third-party domains*—a *lower* number means more containment.
- **Beware of stealth blocking:** Just because a request isn’t visible doesn’t mean it’s allowed. uBO Scope transparently reveals stealth-blocking.
- **Use it to audit filter list changes:** Confirm how updates affect the actual network requests.
