# Feature Overview

## Understand the Key Features of uBO Scope

uBO Scope offers a precise window into the network activity of web pages, allowing you to see which remote servers your browser interacts with and how those connections are treated. This page introduces the primary features available in the extension's popup interface, designed to maximize transparency and control over your online footprint.

## What You Will See in the Popup Interface

When you click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup displays live connection details for the current active browser tab. The interface highlights domains categorized by their network request outcomes, giving you immediate insight into what is happening behind the scenes.

### Live Connection Reporting

- The interface continuously updates to show all domains contacted by the web page in real-time.
- Each domain entry includes a badge count reflecting the number of network requests for that domain, helping you identify which connections are most active.

### Domain Statuses Displayed

uBO Scope groups network connections into three distinct categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains with successful connections, letting you easily spot which third parties are actually reachable.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains for which connections were intercepted or stealthily blocked by your content blocker or other mechanisms without direct error reporting.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly blocked, typically indicated by network errors.

This granular categorization empowers you to understand not just outright blocks but subtler stealth blocking, which some content blockers deploy to avoid detection.

### Badge Count Updates

- The toolbar icon dynamically updates its badge to report the number of distinct **allowed third-party domains** the current page connects to.
- This count provides a quick privacy snapshot: fewer distinct allowed domains generally indicate fewer third-party exposures.

### Independence from Specific Content Blockers

uBO Scope operates independently of which content blocker you use. Regardless of whether you run uBlock Origin, another blocker, or none at all, uBO Scope listens to your browser’s network requests and reports outcomes accurately.

This means it reveals connections attempted or suppressed by any content blocker or DNS-level blocking, as long as the browser reports those network events via the `webRequest` API.

## How These Features Work Together: A User Story

Imagine visiting a news site and wanting to know which third-party domains it contacts. Opening uBO Scope’s popup instantly shows you three groups of domains:

- The content delivery networks allowing resources to load (`Not Blocked` section).
- Domains where requests were silently blocked to prevent trackers without raising alarms (`Stealth-Blocked` section).
- Domains clearly blocked because they appeared malicious or unwanted (`Blocked` section).

You glance at the badge count on the extension’s icon and see it reports only 3 allowed domains, reassuring you that despite complex network activity, exposure remains low. This real-time transparent reporting helps you assess privacy risks and blocker effectiveness clearly.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Use the badge count as a privacy indicator:** A lower count signals fewer third-party connections, typically meaning better privacy.
- **Check the stealth-blocked section:** Sometimes requests are blocked silently, and this section reveals those hidden defenses.
- **Refresh the popup after navigating to a new tab:** The interface updates live but always reflects the currently active tab’s connections.
- **Recognize that not all blocked domains are harmful:** Some domains are essential and allowed, others are stealth-blocked to avoid detection, and some are outright blocked because of clear risks.

## Planned Additions for Power Users

While the current interface focuses on clarity and simplicity, upcoming versions will expand insights with features tailored for filter list maintainers and advanced users:

- Detailed request-level data for deeper network diagnosis.
- Enhanced filtering and sorting options to manage large domain lists.
- Additional contextual information about each domain’s role or reputation.

Stay tuned for these updates to unlock more advanced capabilities.

## Summary

uBO Scope's popup features equip you with immediate, actionable visibility into all network connections a webpage attempts, showing not just simple block or allow results but the nuanced landscape including stealth blocking. Independent of your content blocker, it paints a truthful picture of your browsing privacy and network activity.
