title: "Who is uBO Scope For?"
description: "Explore the intended audience—privacy-focused users, filter list maintainers, and those without access to advanced browser developer tools. Real-world scenarios highlight how uBO Scope streamlines their workflows, whether for assessing content blocker effectiveness, validating filter lists, or simply understanding their exposure to third-party servers."

# Who is uBO Scope For?

uBO Scope is designed with a clear focus on users who need transparent and actionable insights into remote network connections from their browser, transcending the limitations of standard developer tools and ad blockers’ dashboards. Whether you are deeply invested in privacy, maintaining filter lists, or exploring network activity on devices where advanced tools are unavailable, uBO Scope streamlines your experience and empowers you with accurate, easy-to-understand data.

## Audience Profiles & Their Goals

### Privacy-Conscious Users
These users prioritize understanding exactly which third-party servers their browser connects to during web browsing. uBO Scope exposes all connections attempted or made, allowing these users to:

- Confirm the effectiveness of their content blockers beyond simple block counts.
- Visualize and quantify their exposure to third-party domains.
- Detect unexpected or stealthy network requests that typical browser tools may miss.

**Example Scenario:**
Alice uses multiple content blockers but notices discrepancies in block counts. With uBO Scope, she verifies which distinct remote servers are actually contacted, enabling her to evaluate real privacy risks rather than relying on misleading badge numbers.


### Filter List Maintainers
Maintaining effective filter lists requires accurate visibility into network requests browsers see, especially on devices or platforms where traditional dev tools are limited or unavailable.

uBO Scope acts as a lightweight but precise observer of:

- Allowed (not blocked) domains.
- Stealth connections (redirected or hidden requests).
- Blocked domains.

This granularity supports maintainers in refining filter rules with real-world data.

**Example Scenario:**
Bob manages multiple filter lists and frequently tests their efficacy on mobile devices that do not support robust developer consoles. uBO Scope runs silently in the background, providing him reliable logs and domain reports he can review to fine-tune his filters.


### Users Without Access to Advanced Browser Developer Tools
Whether due to platform restrictions, browser limitations, or device constraints, some users lack access to in-depth network monitoring.

uBO Scope fills this gap by using browser APIs to:

- Present the number of distinct third-party domains connected per tab directly in the toolbar badge.
- Offer an intuitive popup panel that categorizes domains by outcome (allowed, stealth, blocked).

**Example Scenario:**
Carol accesses a locked-down work device with restricted browser tooling. She uses uBO Scope to understand her browsing footprint, even without access to Chrome DevTools or Firefox’s Network Monitor.

## Real-World Workflows Made Simple by uBO Scope

| Use Case                         | How uBO Scope Helps                                                   |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Assessing Blocker Effectiveness | Shows distinct third-party domains connected vs. just block counts    |
| Validating Filter Lists          | Enables domain-level insights crucial for tuning and debugging      |
| Understanding Third-Party Exposure | Quickly presents clear metrics to understand data leakage points    |
| Working on Restricted Devices   | Provides detailed network request information where devtools are not |


## Why This Matters

Typical content blockers report the number of blocked requests, but this metric is insufficient and sometimes misleading. uBO Scope uncovers the actual number of unique third-party domains contacted, which directly impacts privacy exposure. It also exposes common myths prevalent among users evaluating content blockers by simple block counts or test webpages.

> **Important:** A lower count of distinct third-party domains connected indicates better privacy protection.

uBO Scope’s data-driven approach helps users base decisions on meaningful observations rather than marketing metrics or unreliable tests.


## Summary of Intended Users’ Benefits

- Gain factual insights on which and how many third-party servers the browser contacts.
- Avoid being misled by inflated block counts or contrived test scenarios.
- Obtain actionable information to improve privacy settings and filter lists.
- Access network activity information even where browsers offer limited diagnostic capabilities.


## Getting Started

To start exploring uBO Scope’s insights, install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/). Upon activation, simply click the toolbar icon to reveal the domains your browser connects to on the current tab.

<Tip>
For the most accurate experience, remember that uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API, so network requests bypassing this API are not reported.
</Tip>

<Note>
The extension's toolbar badge shows the count of distinct allowed third-party domains for the active tab, making it easy to track how many unique remote servers your browser accessed during your session.
</Note>

<Warning>
Do not rely on block counts from other content blockers alone to assess privacy. Always combine those with insights from tools like uBO Scope.
</Warning>
