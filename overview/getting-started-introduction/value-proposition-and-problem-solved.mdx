# Value Proposition & The Problems uBO Scope Solves

## See Beyond the Surface: Why uBO Scope Matters in Online Privacy

When you browse the web, countless connections happen behind the scenes — some necessary, some intrusive, many invisible to common tools. uBO Scope shines a light on *every* remote server your browser reaches out to, giving you an unvarnished view of your web traffic.

Unlike standard browser tools or content blocker dashboards that often mask or underreport connections, uBO Scope reveals the full picture — connections allowed by content blockers, stealth-blocked connections, and those genuinely blocked.

## Understanding uBO Scope’s Unique Role in the Privacy Ecosystem

### What Does uBO Scope Reveal?

- **Complete visibility** of *all* network connection attempts from a webpage, regardless of content blockers or DNS-level filters
- Real-time reporting of **distinct third-party remote servers** contacted — a critical privacy metric
- Clear categorization of connections as **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked**, illuminating what actually happens behind content blockers

### What Problems Does uBO Scope Solve?

**Debunking unreliable measures of content blocker effectiveness:**

- Toolbar badge counts on popular content blockers often show *block counts* instead of *allowed connections*. A higher block count doesn't necessarily mean better blocking; confusingly, it can correlate with more connections succeeding.
- uBO Scope focuses on the number of distinct **allowed connections** to highlight real privacy exposure, offering a more truthful metric.

**Exposing limitations of ad blocker test webpages:**

- Many ‘ad blocker test’ sites simulate unrealistic, fabricated network requests that do not appear in normal browsing, misleading users about blocker performance.
- uBO Scope bypasses these tests, reporting what your browser truly connects to during normal use.

**Filling gaps where browser tools fall short:**

- Some network requests occur in ways that typical developer tools cannot detect or categorize properly.
- uBO Scope’s use of browser `webRequest` API listeners ensures it captures requests even when content blocking happens at DNS or stealth levels, presenting a transparent view.

## Why Should You Care?

If you value privacy or manage content blocking strategies, uBO Scope empowers you to:

- **Verify the real impact** of your content blocker beyond superficial metrics
- **Detect unwanted or unknown third-party connections** that may compromise privacy
- **Avoid misleading conclusions** from popular block counts or test pages
- **Gain deep insights** that help make informed choices about privacy tools

### Real-World Scenario: The Myth of Higher Block Counts

Imagine two content blockers: Blocker A shows a badge with '100' blocked connections, Blocker B shows only '30'. It’s tempting to think Blocker A is more effective. But with uBO Scope, you discover Browser A is actually loading resources from *more* unique third-party servers, meaning it allowed more connections despite seemingly blocking more. This insight prevents false confidence and guides towards smarter blocker use.

## Best Practices When Using uBO Scope

- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to *verify and understand* what really loads
- Avoid relying on ad blocker test pages as benchmarks for real-world blocking
- Interpret badge counts as the number of **allowed domains contacted**—lower numbers indicate better third-party blocking
- For filter list maintainers, uBO Scope offers a trustworthy tool to assess real filter effectiveness across various devices and browsers

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Do not equate high block counts with better privacy
- Ignore misleading ad blocker test sites; focus on real browsing data
- Assume all third-party connections are harmful; many legitimate services like CDNs appear as third parties

---

## What uBO Scope Does Not Do

- It does not block or interfere with connections; it only reports
- It cannot detect requests made *outside* the browser’s `webRequest` API (e.g., native apps or some browser internals)
- It does not provide an in-depth classification of the purpose behind each connection (e.g., tracking vs content delivery) — it focuses on visibility, not filtering

# Glossary

| Term               | Meaning                                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Allowed Connections | Network requests that completed successfully and were not blocked by content blockers or network filters |
| Stealth-Blocked    | Connections that were blocked silently by content blockers to avoid page breakage or detection |
| Blocked Connections | Network requests explicitly blocked, typically resulting in errors or failures           |
| Toolbar Badge Count | The number indicating distinct third-party domains with allowed network connections      |
| Third-Party Domain  | A domain external to the site currently visited, often the source of trackers or ads      |

# Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions about uBO Scope Visibility">  
<Accordion title="Why does uBO Scope show more connections than my browser's developer tools?">  
Browsers’ built-in tools may not detect all connection attempts, especially those blocked stealthily or filtered outside browser APIs. uBO Scope listens to the webRequest API, capturing a broader set of events for all network connections the browser processes or tries to process.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Is a higher badge number better?">  
No — a higher badge count means *more* distinct third-party servers were contacted during the page load, indicating potentially less blocking and higher privacy risk.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope block connections?">  
No — uBO Scope is a reporting tool only. Use it alongside blockers like uBlock Origin for blocking.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Why should I avoid ad blocker test sites?">  
These sites use unrealistic network requests, often detecting blockers via superficial means, providing misleading results. Instead, use tools like uBO Scope that measure actual connections during real browsing.
