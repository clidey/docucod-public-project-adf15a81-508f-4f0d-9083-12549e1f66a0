# Feature Overview at a Glance

Discover the core capabilities of **uBO Scope**, an extension that brings transparency to your browsing by revealing detailed summaries of remote server connections for each browser tab. This page offers a quick, actionable overview of the essential features you’ll use to interpret and analyze network activity efficiently.

## Unlock Per-Tab Domain Summaries

As you browse, uBO Scope tracks the unique domains your active tab connects with. This per-tab approach enables you to see exactly which third-party services are involved per website, with the information presented clearly and concisely in the extension popup.

- **Dynamic tab-specific data:** Each tab displays its own domain summary to prevent confusion and provide relevant insights.
- **Domain breakdown:** Separate listings showcase domains that were allowed, stealth-blocked, or completely blocked.
- **Unicode domain support:** Domains are correctly shown whether in punycode or Unicode, ensuring clarity even with internationalized domain names.


## Comprehensive Outcomes for Every Network Request

uBO Scope doesn’t just stop at listing connected domains—it classifies network requests according to their outcomes, giving you fine-grained visibility into your browsing’s network activity:

- **Allowed:** Domains where connections succeeded and resources were served.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections that were redirected or silently blocked to prevent exposure, reflecting stealthy content blocking.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed due to blocking or errors, with explicit notification.

This classification reveals the true effectiveness of content blockers in place and highlights any active stealth techniques working behind the scenes.


## Cross-Content-Blocker Reporting

Unlike many tools, uBO Scope monitors network request outcomes regardless of which content blocker or DNS filtering you use. It listens directly to the browser's webRequest API, ensuring:

- **Transparency across blockers:** Network requests are reported no matter which content blocking extension or technique is active.
- **Complete visibility:** It captures both successful and blocked requests, including those blocked by DNS or external tools, as long as the browser reports them.
- **Reliable indicators:** Rather than relying on block counts alone, uBO Scope emphasizes actual third-party server connections, providing meaningful metrics.


## Badge Notifications Reflect Distinct Domain Counts

To keep you informed at a glance, uBO Scope updates the toolbar icon badge with a meaningful number:

- **What’s shown:** The badge number represents the count of unique third-party domains for which connections were made from the active tab.
- **Why this matters:** A lower number generally means fewer third-party contacts, signaling better privacy control.
- **Real-time updates:** The badge refreshes automatically as you move between tabs or as connections occur, keeping information current.


## Practical Example: Using the Popup to Monitor a Tab’s Connections

Imagine visiting a news website. With uBO Scope:

1. Open the extension popup.
2. View the domain summary for the active tab which lists domains connected.
3. See how many were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
4. Use this insight to decide if additional blocking rules are needed or to validate your current content blocker’s effectiveness.


## Tips for Getting the Most Out of uBO Scope

- Frequently check the popup when visiting privacy-sensitive or new websites to identify unexpected third-party connections.
- Use the classification of stealth and blocked domains to understand the modes of connection filtering in effect.
- Pay attention to the badge count as an immediate indicator but always follow up in the popup for details.
