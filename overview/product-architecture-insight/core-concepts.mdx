# Key Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the terms that shape your experience with uBO Scope is essential to interpreting its data accurately and effectively. This page clarifies the critical terminology exclusive to the extension, demystifying how network requests and domain categorizations inform the reporting and interface you interact with.

---

## What You Will Learn

- What constitutes an **Allowed Domain**
- Definition of a **Blocked Domain**
- What is meant by **Stealth Block**
- The significance of the **Badge Count**
- Explanation of **Third-Party Remote Server**

Each of these terms plays a pivotal role in how uBO Scope reports connections and helps you understand the behind-the-scenes network activity during browsing.

---

## Allowed Domain

**Allowed Domains** represent remote servers to which network requests have succeeded — meaning resources were permitted and fetched without obstruction by any content blocker or network filter.

### Why It Matters

When you see a domain listed as allowed, it means your browser successfully established a connection and retrieved content from that domain. This category is critical because it reflects the actual third-party servers your browsing session interacts with in practice.

### Real-World Example

If you're visiting an online news site, an allowed domain might be a well-known Content Delivery Network (CDN) from which images and scripts are loaded. Seeing these domains helps you identify legitimate third-party services essential for website functionality.

---

## Blocked Domain

Blocked Domains are remote servers for which connection attempts failed due to active content blocking measures.

### What Happens Here

These domains are detected by uBO Scope when network requests are rejected or errored out, indicating your filtering tools or the browser itself prevented access.

### User Benefit

By knowing which domains are blocked, you gain insight into what third-party connections your content blocker actively prevents, enabling you to assess the effectiveness and behavior of your privacy tools.

---

## Stealth Block

A **Stealth Block** occurs when a content blocker silently prevents a network request without the remote server becoming explicitly aware of it.

### Explanation

Unlike outright blockages, stealth blocking avoids triggering obvious error states. The request may be redirected or suppressed quietly, preventing webpage breakage or detection scripts from knowing that blocking happened.

### Impact on Reporting

uBO Scope separately tracks stealth blocked domains, allowing users to distinguish between blatant and subtle content blocking behaviors. This transparency informs better privacy control and troubleshooting.

---

## Badge Count

The **Badge Count** is the number displayed on the uBO Scope extension's toolbar icon representing the number of distinct third-party remote domains successfully connected to during a browsing session.

### Key Insight

A lower badge count is desirable, as it indicates fewer third-party connections — often implying enhanced privacy and minimal external resource loading.

### What the Badge Does NOT Indicate

The badge does NOT quantify block counts or network errors. Instead, it solely tallies distinct allowed third-party remote servers connected for the active tab.

### Tip

Use the badge count as a quick gauge to understand how many unique third-party servers your current webpage relies on, not as a measure of total blocked items or requests.

---

## Third-Party Remote Server

A **Third-Party Remote Server** is any domain that is different from the primary domain of the active webpage and with which the browser attempts to establish a network connection.

### Clarification

- If you are browsing `example.com`, and your browser connects to `cdn.example.com`, this is considered **first-party** because it shares the same base domain.
- However, if your browser connects to `tracker.com` or `ads.network.net`, these domains are considered third-party.

### Why It Matters

Third-party remote servers are often sources of advertisements, trackers, or additional resources. Understanding which third parties your browser communicates with allows you to evaluate your exposure to tracking and data sharing.

## How These Concepts Shape Your Experience

When you open the uBO Scope popup, domains appear categorized under **Not Blocked** (allowed), **Stealth-Blocked**, and **Blocked** sections. Each domain also includes a badge count representing the number of times connections were made to that domain.

<u>Example user flow:</u>

1. You load a webpage — say, a blog.
2. uBO Scope tracks network requests on that page.
3. It notes which domains successfully served content (allowed), which were silently suppressed (stealth), and which were explicitly blocked.
4. The badge count updates to display the number of unique allowed third-party domains.
5. You open the popup to review these domains, gaining clear visibility into your network interactions.


---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Interpret the Badge Count wisely:** A high badge count means more third-party connections were allowed. Carefully consider if these are necessary or privacy-invasive.
- **Review Stealth Blocks:** These can explain why certain scripts behave oddly despite not showing as completely blocked.
- **Use Domain Names as Leads:** Frequent allowed or blocked domains can be investigated through search engines or privacy tools to learn more about their purpose.
- **Remember Domain Parsing:** uBO Scope applies public suffix list parsing to group requests by effective second-level domain, improving clarity in cumulative reporting.

## Troubleshooting Common Misunderstandings

<AccordionGroup title="Common Misconceptions About Terms">
<Accordion title="Is a blocked domain always bad?">
Blocking domains is often good for privacy, but sometimes important third-party domains (like CDNs) get blocked unintentionally — this might break website functionality. Always confirm the role of blocked domains.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does the badge count include first-party domains?">
No. Only third-party remote domains distinct from the page's main domain are counted in the badge. This keeps the focus on external resources.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can stealth blocks be detected by websites?">
Stealth blocking aims to be invisible to webpages, so typically no. It's designed to avoid detection and minimize page breakage.
</Accordion>
