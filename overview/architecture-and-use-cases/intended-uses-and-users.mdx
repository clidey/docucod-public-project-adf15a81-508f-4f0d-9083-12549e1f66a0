# Intended Audience & Use Cases

uBO Scope stands out as a precision tool tailored for two primary groups—privacy-conscious browser users and filter list maintainers—empowering them with actionable insights into third-party network connections. This page clarifies who benefits most from uBO Scope and highlights critical scenarios where its unique capabilities shine.

## Who Should Use uBO Scope?

### 1. Privacy-Focused Browser Users

If you value transparency and control over your browsing experience, uBO Scope is designed explicitly for you. It reveals every remote server your browser attempts to communicate with, regardless of any active content blockers.

- **What you achieve:**
  - Understand your exposure to third-party domains.
  - Detect which connections are genuinely blocked, stealthily blocked, or allowed.
  - Gain an independent view unaffected by misleading badge counts from various content blockers.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers

For developers and curators behind content blocking lists, uBO Scope offers indispensable real-world data to refine and verify their filtering rules.

- **What you achieve:**
  - Accurately measure distinct third-party exposures on different websites.
  - Validate the effectiveness of blocking lists under multiple content blockers.
  - Identify stealth blocking techniques implemented by extensions or DNS-based solutions.

<Info>
Many networks requests, especially stealthy or DNS-level blockages, are invisible to most tools—uBO Scope fills this gap by reporting all requests the browser attempts, providing an exhaustive data set for analysis.

## Key Use Cases

### Measuring Third-Party Exposure

uBO Scope logs every unique third-party remote server your browser connects to, which is fundamentally more revealing than simply counting blocked elements. 

**Scenario:** You want to evaluate how many and which third-party domains your browser contacts during a browsing session to understand your privacy footprint better.

**Outcome:**
- The toolbar badge instantly shows the count of distinct third-party domains actually connected.
- The popup panel categorizes these connections into:
  - **Allowed:** Domains successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Requests blocked in a way that the webpage cannot detect.
  - **Blocked:** Failed requests due to blocking.

### Verifying Content Blocker Effectiveness

Many users mistakenly equate higher block counts with better content blocking. uBO Scope debunks this myth by showing the actual third-party domains contacted.

**Scenario:** You want to compare different content blockers to see which truly reduces third-party connections without being misled by block count badges.

**Outcome:**
- Accurate visibility into *which* third-party servers are contacted regardless of how blockers report blocking.
- Ability to detect cases where a content blocker has a high block count but allows connections to numerous distinct domains, implying less effective blocking.

### Evaluating Stealth Blocking Techniques

Stealth blocking tries to hide the presence of blocking from webpages by making requests silently fail or redirect.

**Scenario:** You want to analyze if stealth blocking is occurring and to what extent across various websites.

**Outcome:**
- uBO Scope reports stealth-blocked domains distinctly, uncovering blocking mechanisms invisible to normal web APIs.
- Provides a ground truth at the network request level beyond web page detection capabilities.

<Warning>
Because web requests originating outside the browser's webRequest API scope (such as those from service workers or non-standard protocols) are not tracked, uBO Scope's measurements reflect the subset of connections exposed through supported browser APIs.
</Warning>

## Benefits for the Intended Audiences

- **Complete transparency:** See all remote server contact attempts, not limited by content blocker APIs.
- **Myth busting:** Understand limitations and false assumptions in blocker effectiveness metrics.
- **Actionable insights:** Make informed decisions about improving privacy or filter list quality.
- **Cross-blocker compatibility:** Works independently of your content blocker choice or DNS-based blocking.

## Getting the Most Out of uBO Scope

1. **Install the extension:** Available for Chromium and Firefox browsers via their official addon stores.
2. **Observe badge counts:** Use the toolbar badge to get quick third-party exposure metrics.
3. **Explore popup panel:** Delve into allowed, stealth, and blocked connection details for each active tab.
4. **Cross-reference with content blockers:** Evaluate your current content blockers' real impact on network connections.

<Check>
Keep in mind that a lower badge count signifies better third-party domain exposure control.

### Example Scenario: Privacy-Conscious User

Imagine you regularly visit social media platforms and news websites. After installing uBO Scope, you notice your badge often shows a surprisingly high number of third-party domains connected. By opening the popup, you see many stealth-blocked domains, indicating your content blocker is silently preventing resource loads without alerting websites. This knowledge allows you to confidently maintain your privacy settings, avoiding deceptive blocker effectiveness claims.

### Example Scenario: Filter List Maintainer

You maintain a popular filter list and want to confirm your rules effectively block third-party trackers without harming legitimate resources. Running uBO Scope across multiple sites, you gather data on newly observed third-party domains and stealth blocking effects, enabling fine-tuning of your filters and ensuring your rules deliver real-world privacy improvements.
