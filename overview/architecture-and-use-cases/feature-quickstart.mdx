# Feature Highlights & Quickstart

## Introducing uBO Scope’s Essential Features

uBO Scope empowers you with effortless real-time visibility into your browser's network activity. It does so by providing distinct and immediate feedback on all connections to remote servers initiated by any webpage you visit. Within just moments of installation, the extension offers precise, transparent insights about which domains your browser contacts — categorized clearly by connection outcome.

### Key Benefits at a Glance

- **Instant Badge Count:** An at-a-glance badge on your toolbar icon shows the number of unique third-party domains your current page connects to.
- **Popup Domain Status Panel:** Click the icon to reveal a detailed popup showing per-domain connection statuses, split into “allowed,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked.”
- **Cross-Blocker Compatibility:** Works alongside any content blocker—including uBlock Origin—with independent, reliable reporting that reflects actual network activity.
- **Clear Outcome Classification:** Domains are grouped so you immediately understand if a connection succeeded, was silently hidden (stealth-blocked), or explicitly blocked.
- **User-Friendly Visualization:** The domain lists in the popup panel show counts of connections, enabling you to monitor and interpret network requests without digging through logs.

This page walks you through your first experience with uBO Scope—from installation to interpreting your very first badge count—enabling you to make informed decisions about your browsing privacy and security right away.

## Understanding Core Features

### Real-Time Badge Counts

Upon installing uBO Scope, notice the toolbar icon's badge number. This count represents the number of *distinct third-party domains* that your active tab has connected to successfully. A lower count signifies fewer external connections, which typically means fewer third-party trackers or content.

### Popup Domain Status Visualization

Clicking the toolbar icon opens a popup panel segmented into three clear sections:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which your browser successfully fetched resources.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains whose requests were covertly blocked—often by content blockers using stealth techniques.
- **Blocked:** Domains whose connection attempts were actively blocked.

Each section lists domains with badges showing how many connections were made or blocked, providing you instant detail.

### Seamless Compatibility Across Blockers

uBO Scope listens to all network requests through the browser’s webRequest API, making it uniquely capable of reporting network connections accurately regardless of which content blocker you use, including advanced DNS-based blocking or stealth blocking methods.

## Your First-Run Experience: Step-by-Step Quickstart

Follow this simple workflow to get up and running immediately:

<Steps>
<Step title="Install uBO Scope">
Visit the extension store for your browser (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Safari Extensions) and install uBO Scope.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe the Toolbar Badge">
Open any website. Notice the badge number on the toolbar icon – it represents distinct third-party domains contacted successfully by the web page.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the Popup Panel">
Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup. You’ll see a breakdown of domains by status: Allowed, Stealth-blocked, and Blocked.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Domain Lists">
Use these lists to understand which domains your page relies on most, which are blocked outright, and which are stealthily blocked. The badge counts next to each domain help you see volume.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Information to Improve Browsing Privacy">
Based on domain status insights, adjust your content blockers or browsing habits as you see fit.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Refresh Your Page:** Badge counts and popup data update dynamically as you browse. Refreshing the page reloads data to reflect current connections.

- **Focus on Third-Party Domains:** The badge tracks unique *third-party* domains, helping you spotlight external trackers or services beyond the site you are visiting.

- **Watch for Stealth Blocking:** Some connections are stealthily blocked and do not show typical block cues. uBO Scope makes these visible so you know about hidden blockers in your stack.

- **Use in Tandem With Your Content Blocker:** uBO Scope does not block anything itself. Instead, it brings transparency to your existing blockers’ actions, letting you validate effectiveness.

- **Understand Badge Count Meaning:** A high badge count may indicate numerous third-party resource connections. Lower counts reflect fewer external connections – typically desirable for privacy.

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting Items">
<Accordion title="The Badge Shows No Number">
Confirm you have active tabs with network connections. The badge is empty if the active tab has no or untracked connections.

Refresh the page or switch tabs to trigger data updates.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA'">
This indicates uBO Scope has not yet received data from the active tab.

Try refreshing the page or waiting a few seconds for network requests to be processed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I Don’t See Certain Domains Expected in The Popup">
uBO Scope reports only domains with recorded network events. Some connections, such as those bypassing browser webRequest API (e.g., native apps or certain WebSocket protocols), may not be captured.

Ensure your browser version supports the needed webRequest API capabilities.
