# Integration & Compatibility

Discover how uBO Scope functions independently of any specific content blocking technology, leveraging browser-native capabilities to transparently report network connections your browser makes. This page details its operational independence, its low-level use of browser APIs, and its role as a complementary tool in the privacy ecosystem.

## Why uBO Scope Works Across Content Blockers

uBO Scope does not rely on any particular content blocker or filtering engine to detect network activity. Instead, it taps directly into the browser's native `webRequest` API to monitor **all network requests** initiated by webpages, regardless of the blocker in use — whether uBlock Origin, another extension, or wild DNS-based blocking.

This means:

- **Visibility beyond filtering scope:** uBO Scope sees outcomes even when requests are blocked by DNS resolvers or external services.
- **Consistency across browsers and blockers:** Because it depends on browser APIs, your data is reliable and unaffected by blocker implementation differences.
- **Accurate third-party connection counts:** It reports the count of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to or attempted to connect to, providing a true picture of your exposure.

This core design enables you to:

- Validate whether your content blocker actually blocks connections or if some requests are quietly succeeding.
- Identify stealth-blocked or otherwise suppressed connections made invisible by sophisticated blocker stealth modes.
- Audit the effectiveness of multiple privacy tools working simultaneously.

## Leveraging Browser-Native APIs

uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` listeners to detect network request details including the URL, request type, response status, and errors. This direct access provides:

- Real-time monitoring of network traffic relevant to each tab.
- A classification of outcomes (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked) based on network events.
- Aggregated domain-level analytics reflecting third-party network activity.

It uses **manifest v3** capabilities (for Chromium, Firefox, Safari, etc.), including:

- Service workers or background scripts that maintain state independently of UI.
- Permissions for broad host access (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`) to monitor all network domains.

This gives uBO Scope a foundational layer of compatibility and robustness unmatched by extensions relying solely on overlay-blocking or content script heuristics.

## Utility on Platforms with Restricted Browser Tools

On devices or browsers where advanced developer tools or network inspectors may be limited or unavailable (e.g., mobile browsers, locked-down environments), uBO Scope:

- Provides a visible, extension-based reporting interface.
- Surfaces network connection data transparently to users and auditors.
- Serves as a standalone monitor complementing built-in privacy settings.

Its popup UI succinctly summarizes per-tab network results, making it an invaluable diagnostic aid when other tools are inaccessible.

## How uBO Scope Complements Existing Privacy Solutions

uBO Scope does **not replace** your content blocker but complements it by providing insight into what connections happen beneath the hood.

Use it to:

- Measure the actual number of third-party domains connected to despite blocking.
- Detect stealth-blocked requests that your blocker may hide from the webpage.
- Better understand the network behavior of webpages beyond block counts or filter hits.

Together, this makes uBO Scope an essential tool for power users, filter list maintainers, auditors, and privacy-conscious individuals aiming for transparency.

## Practical Example: Workflow with uBO Scope

1. **Install and activate your preferred content blocker.**
2. **Open a webpage.**
3. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon; the popup appears.
4. The extension shows a badge with the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
5. Review the popup's categorized lists:
   - **Not blocked:** connections allowed to third parties.
   - **Stealth-blocked:** requests suppressed quietly by blockers.
   - **Blocked:** requests failed or explicitly blocked.
6. Use this data to decide whether your content blocker is effectively limiting third-party connections or if additional filters or tools are warranted.

This workflow illustrates uBO Scope’s role as a factual, non-intrusive observability tool.

## Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope supports multiple browsers with tailored manifests:

| Browser  | Minimum Version       | Permissions                                   |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Chromium | 122.0 and above      | `webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab`          |
| Firefox  | 128.0 and above      | `webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab`          |
| Safari   | 18.5 and above       | `webRequest`, `storage`, `activeTab`          |

Manifest details specify required host permissions covering HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS protocols to capture the full scope of network requests.

---

## Troubleshooting and Considerations

- **`webRequest` API limitations:** Some network requests initiated outside the browser's documented API scope (e.g., certain native apps or browser internal mechanisms) cannot be observed.
- **Delayed updates:** Network events are processed in batches; badge count and popup details update shortly after navigation or network activity.
- **Permissions:** Ensure proper permissions are granted to the extension for comprehensive monitoring.

For troubleshooting setup or permissions issues, consult the [Setup Troubleshooting](../getting-started/configuration-and-validation/setup-troubleshooting) page.
