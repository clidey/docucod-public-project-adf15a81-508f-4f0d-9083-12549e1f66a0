# Core Features & Capabilities of uBO Scope

## See All Remote Connections at a Glance

uBO Scope puts you in control by revealing every network connection that a web page attempts or successfully makes—no matter what content blockers are running. This page gives you a fast, clear overview of what uBO Scope offers, so you can quickly understand its core capabilities and the value it brings during everyday browsing.

---

## Real-Time Reporting of Connections

From the moment a page loads, uBO Scope listens transparently to every network request using the browser's `webRequest` API. It tracks connections:

- **Allowed:** Resources that loaded successfully from third-party remote servers.
- **Blocked:** Requests blocked or failed to connect.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Redirects caught and hidden by content blockers.

This live insight reveals the true story behind all connection attempts—including those bypassing traditional content blockers or DNS-level filtering.

**Benefit:** Know exactly which external servers your browser talks to on any page, empowering privacy understanding and control.


## Toolbar Badge for Third-Party Connection Count

The toolbar icon serves as your instant indicator, showing the **number of distinct third-party domains** connected to on the current page.

- A **lower badge count** signals fewer third-party connections, often indicating a cleaner browsing experience.
- The badge updates dynamically as you navigate or reload tabs.

<u>Why this matters:</u> Not all third-party connections are bad—legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs) and services appear here. Seeing the true count helps discern real privacy risks from expected connections.


## Compatibility with All Content Blockers

uBO Scope operates independently and transparently alongside any content blocker or DNS-based filter you use. It reports **network requests regardless of how they were handled or blocked,** provided the browser exposes them to the `webRequest` API.

- Works with blockers like uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus, or system-level DNS filtering.
- Reveals connections that your content blocker may allow or stealthily block.


## Detailed Connection Outcomes Categorization

uBO Scope classifies connections into three clear categories within its popup interface:

- **Allowed:** Connections that succeeded without interference.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections redirected or hidden by blockers to remain undetected.
- **Blocked:** Connections that failed due to blocking or errors.

This classification helps you understand exactly what happens behind the scenes in your network traffic.


## Supporting Filter List Maintainers and Advanced Users

Though simple and transparent, uBO Scope is a powerful tool for filter list creators and advanced privacy enthusiasts. It:

- Provides real usage data on remote server connections.
- Helps debunk myths about blocker efficacy based on block counts.
- Enables data-driven filter list improvements by showing actual connections observed in the wild.

## How These Features Work Together

Visualize your browsing session as a flow of network requests, each classified and tallied in real time. The browser toolbar badge gives an at-a-glance snapshot of third-party reach, while the detailed popup lets you deep-dive into each connection’s fate.

This combination delivers clarity on "who is connecting to what," enabling you to make informed decisions about privacy and content blocking.


## Practical Examples

- When visiting a news website, see which advertising or tracking domains are allowed despite your content blocker.
- On social media platforms, view the number of third-party domains your browser contacts and identify stealth-blocked trackers hidden from page scripts.
- While developing or testing filter lists, monitor how changes affect the actual third-party connections during browsing.


---

## Tips for Maximizing uBO Scope's Benefits

- **Regularly check the badge count:** A sudden spike in third-party connections may indicate new trackers or unwanted scripts.
- **Inspect the popup list:** Review domains in the allowed and stealth-blocked sections to identify suspicious or unexpected servers.
- **Combine with content blockers:** Use uBO Scope as an independent verification tool to validate your blocker’s effectiveness.
- **Don’t rely on blocked counts alone:** A high block count does not guarantee better blocking; focus on the actual connections allowed.


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Expecting the extension to block connections itself—it only reports them.
- Interpreting the badge count as a full security assessment without context.
- Using "ad blocker test" webpages as reliable benchmarks—these tests produce unrealistic requests that do not reflect real browsing.
