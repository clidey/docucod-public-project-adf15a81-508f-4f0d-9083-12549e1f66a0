# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Your Browser Attempts

uBO Scope is a straightforward, transparent browser extension designed to reveal every attempted and successful connection your browser makes to remote servers on any web page — no matter which content blocker you use or how many other layers of filtering are in place.

- **Complete Visibility:** See every remote server your browser contacts, even connections hidden or blocked by other tools.
- **Content Blocker Independent:** Works alongside any content blocker or even none, capturing network requests at the browser level.
- **Real-Time Insights:** The toolbar badge shows the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected, helping you quickly assess network activity.
- **Transparency & Trust:** Designed to expose what’s really happening behind the scenes, helping you verify or debunk content blocker claims.

### Who Benefits from uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users wanting to monitor third-party connections
- Filter list maintainers seeking reliable network request data
- Developers and power users analyzing web request outcomes
- Anyone looking to understand what their browser is really doing on the web

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension that reports all remote network connections initiated by the web pages you visit. It listens to browser network requests at a low level to capture every attempt to contact remote servers, categorizing them as allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.

### Why Does uBO Scope Exist?

The core motivation behind uBO Scope is to provide an independent, accurate way to see which remote servers your browser tries to communicate with. This clarity helps users understand:

- Which third-party domains are contacted, regardless of what their content blocker reports
- The actual outcome of network requests — whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked
- Real usage as opposed to artificial scenarios created by "ad blocker test" pages or misleading block counts

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

Unlike other tools, uBO Scope does not rely on the block lists or filter rules of any content blocker. Instead, it uses the browser's `webRequest` API to surface every network request outcome in a simple popup interface. This approach guarantees complete transparency, unaffected by stealthy blocking techniques or DNS-level filters.

## How uBO Scope Works (At a High Level)

- Upon visiting a webpage, uBO Scope observes all network requests from that page.
- It categorizes each request outcome into one of three buckets:
  - **Allowed:** Requests that successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Requests blocked in a way that is hidden from the page.
  - **Blocked:** Requests that were explicitly blocked.
- The extension maintains data about which domains and hostnames were involved.
- The toolbar badge updates with the number of distinct third-party domains successfully contacted.
- The popup tab shows detailed lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains along with counts.

## Key Features of uBO Scope

- **Universal Connection Reporting:** Captures all HTTP(s) and WebSocket network requests regardless of content blockers or DNS techniques.
- **Categorized Outcomes:** Differentiates between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections for precise insight.
- **Popup Visualization:** Provides a clean, easy-to-read interface showing domains contacted grouped by outcome along with request counts.
- **Accurate Badge Count:** Toolbar icon shows the number of distinct third-party domains contacted, giving you a quick snapshot.
- **Lightweight & Transparent:** Minimal UI, no complicated settings — just straight data you can trust.

### Real-World Example

Imagine opening a news website. Many embedded ads and third-party scripts initiate network requests. uBO Scope’s popup lets you instantly see:

- Which third-party domains actually loaded content on the page (Allowed)
- Which attempts were stealthily blocked, often to prevent content blocking detection (Stealth-blocked)
- Which were completely blocked by your content blocker or browser policies (Blocked)

This direct evidence equips you to judge the effectiveness of your privacy tools or investigate suspicious connections.

## Why Should You Care?

### Outcomes You Can Expect

- Gain a clear picture of every network connection and its fate on every webpage.
- Avoid misleading assumptions from toolbar block counts or "ad blocker test" webpages.
- Verify that your content blocker is functioning as you expect.
- Save time troubleshooting third-party network issues by identifying stealth-blocked or blocked domains.
- Empower yourself to make informed decisions about privacy and filtering tools.

### Common Use Cases

- **Privacy Verification:** Confirm which third-party trackers or servers your browser connects to.
- **Filter List Maintenance:** Obtain unbiased network data to improve content blocking rules.
- **Web Security Research:** Analyze how websites load resources and manage third-party connections.
- **User Education:** Understand often invisible connections and the nuance of stealth blocking.

### Before and After uBO Scope

| Scenario               | Without uBO Scope                       | With uBO Scope                      |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Checking network calls  | Guesswork or reliance on block counts | Clear, factual insight on domains contacted|
| Validating blockers    | Possible mistaken assumptions          | Ability to detect stealth or DNS blocks |
| Debugging connections  | Lacking context or tools               | Precise categorization of requests |

## Getting Started Preview

Starting with uBO Scope is as simple as installing the extension in a supported browser and opening its popup:

- **Installation:** Available for Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari.
- **Permissions:** Requires network monitoring permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).
- **Usage:** Click the toolbar icon to open the popup and see connection data for the current tab.

<u>Next Steps:</u> Proceed to the [Core Features & Capabilities](../intro-basics/core-features) page to dive deeper into how to use and interpret uBO Scope data.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Remember that a lower badge count indicates fewer distinct third-party servers contacted, which typically implies better privacy.
- Don't rely on ad-block test pages; use uBO Scope’s data for accurate measurement.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to gain a fuller picture of network activity.
- Keep in mind that some third-party domains, such as CDNs, are legitimate and expected.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **No data shown:** Ensure the extension has active permissions and that the browser supports the `webRequest` API.
- **Badge not updating:** Refresh the page or switch tabs to trigger a data update.
- **Confusing domain names:** Domain names are shown in Unicode via punycode decoding for clarity.
