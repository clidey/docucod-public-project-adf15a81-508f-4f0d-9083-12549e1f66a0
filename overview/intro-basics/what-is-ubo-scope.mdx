# What Is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Behind the Scenes

uBO Scope is a powerful yet straightforward browser extension designed to reveal every attempted or successful connection your web pages make to remote servers. Unlike typical content blockers that focus primarily on blocking ads or trackers, uBO Scope shines a light on the actual network activity occurring behind the scenes, offering users unmatched visibility into third-party connections.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

In the modern web landscape, understanding which external servers your browser communicates with is invaluable for privacy-conscious users, digital security professionals, and filter list maintainers. uBO Scope answers the fundamental question: *Where is my browser really talking?*

#### At a Glance:

- **Complete network visibility**: Reports all remote server connection attempts regardless of blocking status.
- **Independence from content blockers**: Monitors network requests irrespective of filters, DNS blocking, or other extensions.
- **Precise connection outcomes**: Differentiates between successful, stealth-blocked, and error-failed connections.
- **Supports privacy and security**: Empowers users to identify third-party domains interacting with their browsing sessions.

## Origins and Core Functionality

Created by Raymond Hill, the mind behind uBlock Origin, uBO Scope was born out of the need to independently verify and understand network connections beyond what conventional blockers report. It serves as a companion tool that measures and reports each third-party connection, rather than filtering or blocking content itself.

### What Problem Does It Solve?

Many users and even filter list maintainers face challenges interpreting how content blockers are truly performing. Standard blockers often provide block counts that might be misleading or do not expose connections stealthily allowed. uBO Scope solves this by showing every connection attempt tried by the browser, reported in clear categories.

This transparency enables:

- üìä Accurate assessments of network activity.
- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Debugging and analysis of tracker and server connections.
- üõ†Ô∏è Filter list optimization by maintainers.

### How Is uBO Scope Different?

Where traditional content blockers focus on filtering, and many network tools capture raw traffic, uBO Scope offers a unique middle ground by integrating directly with the browser's webRequest API to specifically track and categorize remote server connections.

Its distinctive advantages include:

- Tracking connections regardless of the blocking mechanism involved (e.g., DNS blocking, stealth filters).
- Providing a badge count reflecting the number of **distinct** third-party servers connected, encouraging minimal third-party exposure.
- Avoiding misleading metrics that conflate blocking with connection counts.

### Who Benefits Most?

- **End users curious about data privacy:** See exactly what third-parties your browser interacts with.
- **Privacy advocates and researchers:** Gain detailed insights into network relationships.
- **Filter list maintainers:** Validate and refine lists based on real-world connection data.

## Understanding uBO Scope‚Äôs Core Function

At its heart, uBO Scope is a reporter‚Äînot a blocker. It listens to the browser's network requests for HTTP(S) and WebSocket connections and records every remote server contacted, classifying outcomes into:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Connections that succeed without interference.
- **Stealth Blocked:** Connections that failed silently or via stealth mechanisms.
- **Blocked:** Connections that encountered explicit errors or were blocked.

This granular categorization empowers users to differentiate between network events and understand the browsing session's true connectivity footprint.

## Real-World Example

Imagine visiting a news website. While the page loads, your browser might connect to multiple CDN providers, analytics services, advertising networks, or social widgets. uBO Scope captures each of these connection attempts, showing:

- Which domains loaded resources successfully.
- Which domains were blocked, either overtly or stealthily.
- The total number of unique third-party domains contacted.

This information is presented transparently in the extension's popup, directly accessible via the browser toolbar icon.

<Tip>
The badge on uBO Scope‚Äôs toolbar icon shows the count of distinct remote servers from which your browser fetched resources. A lower number means fewer third-party connections, often reflecting tighter privacy.

## How uBO Scope Fits in Your Toolset

While it does not block content, uBO Scope complements existing privacy tools by offering trustworthy network visibility. This makes it an essential aid in workflows involving:

- Verifying the effectiveness of content blockers.
- Validating filter lists without guessing.
- Auditing browsing sessions for third-party connections.

## Next Steps

To start using uBO Scope:

- Install the extension from your browser's official store.
- Observe the badge count as you browse.
- Click the icon to open the popup and see detailed connection reports.
