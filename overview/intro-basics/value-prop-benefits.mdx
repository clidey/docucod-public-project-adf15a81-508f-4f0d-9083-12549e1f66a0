# Key Benefits & Value Proposition

Discover how uBO Scope transforms your web browsing experience by providing unparalleled transparency into third-party network connections. This page explains the real-time reporting capabilities of uBO Scope, its seamless compatibility with all content blockers, and its unique position as your go-to tool for understanding and managing network exposure.

## Understand Your Network Exposure at a Glance

Every time you browse the web, your browser may connect to multiple remote servers, many of which belong to third parties. These connections can impact your privacy and security. uBO Scope gives you clear, actionable insight by displaying the number of distinct third-party servers your browser talks to, reflected as a badge count on the extension's toolbar icon.

### What the Badge Count Means

- **Real-time Reporting:** The badge shows the count of distinct third-party domains for which your browser made connections during the current session.
- **Privacy Indicator:** A lower badge number signals fewer third-party exposures, helping you gauge the privacy level of the website you're visiting.
- **Actionable Data:** Use the badge count to understand and fine-tune your content blocking setup, knowing exactly how many external parties your browsing is contacting.

---

## Compatibility and Reliability

uBO Scope is designed to complement any content blocker or DNS-level blocking method. It operates independently, monitoring network requests at the browser level through the `webRequest` API, therefore accurately reporting network activity regardless of how blocking is configured.

- **Works with Any Content Blocker:** Whether you use uBlock Origin, other ad blockers, or DNS-based filters, uBO Scope reliably reports all connection attempts reported by the browser.
- **Captures All Outcomes:** It identifies whether requests were allowed, stealth-blocked (hidden redirect or blocking), or outright blocked.
- **No False Positives from Block Counts:** Unlike blockers' own counters, uBO Scope reports direct connection counts to domains, bypassing misleading block tallies.

## Debunking Common Misconceptions

uBO Scope educates users to avoid common traps in assessing privacy and blocking effectiveness:

<AccordionGroup title="Myth Busting with uBO Scope">
<Accordion title="1. High Block Count Means Better Protection">
Many users mistakenly equate a high block count shown by an ad blocker with better privacy protection. uBO Scope clarifies that what truly matters is the count of distinct third-party servers actually connected to, not just how many requests were blocked. A blocker with a high block count can still allow more distinct third-party connections, meaning less privacy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="2. Ad Blocker Test Websites Are Trustworthy Benchmarks">
Common 'ad blocker test' pages often use unrealistic scenarios and artificial network requests. They do not accurately reflect real-world blocking capabilities or extensions’ stealth techniques to avoid detection. uBO Scope bypasses these tricks, providing real-time, factual network connection data based on real browsing sessions.
</Accordion>

## How uBO Scope Adds Tangible Value

- **Clarity for Privacy Advocates:** Understand exposure to third-party servers effortlessly with clear counts and categorized lists of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.
- **Supports Filter List Maintainers:** Provides reliable network visibility even on devices with limited tools, making filter list tuning more efficient and data-driven.
- **Empowers Better Decisions:** Enables users to fine-tune their content blockers with realistic insight, enhancing privacy without confusion over block statistics.

## How to Interpret the Toolbar Badge and Popup

When you visit a website, watch the toolbar badge on uBO Scope’s icon:

- **Badge Count = Number of Distinct Third-Party Domains Connected:** This tells you the extent of your network exposure.
- **Popup Details:** Clicking the icon reveals categorized connection lists:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains with successful connections.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were redirected or stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked by content blockers or DNS filtering.

This granular info helps you dig deeper and understand the source of network activity.

---

## Practical Tips for Using uBO Scope

- **Check the Badge Frequently:** Use it as a quick privacy snapshot when browsing.
- **Combine with Your Content Blocker:** Use uBO Scope alongside your blocker to spot unexpected or stealthy third-party connections.
- **Remember the Context:** Not all third-party connections are bad — CDNs and essential external services can legitimately appear and usually represent low risk.

---

## Summary

uBO Scope brings unmatched transparency to third-party network connections, bridging gaps left by content blockers' own counts and unreliable test pages. It empowers you to understand, measure, and act upon your browser’s network activity, enhancing privacy and control.

### Example: Real-Time Badge Understanding

Imagine visiting an online news website. The uBO Scope badge shows “5” on the toolbar icon. This means your browser connected to five distinct third-party servers during this visit. You click the icon to open the popup and see:

- 3 domains under "not blocked" — indicating allowed connections, possibly for ads or analytics.
- 1 domain under "blocked" — a tracker you’ve blocked successfully.
- 1 domain under "stealth-blocked" — a redirect or stealth-blocked call.

This immediate feedback lets you assess your exposure and adjust your blockers if necessary.

## Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Network Exposure Insights">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Does Not Match Blocker’s Block Counts">
uBO Scope counts distinct third-party domains connected, not the number of blocked requests. Hence a blocker with more blocked requests may show a higher count but actually allow connections to more domains.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Some Network Requests Not Reported">
uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API. Requests made outside this API's reach, such as certain internal or extension-side calls, will not appear.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Misinterpreting Third-Party Connections as Bad">
Not all third-party connections are malicious or tracking. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and essential external services typically show low count domains. Use contextual judgment.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Definitions to Know

- **Third-Party Domain:** Any domain that is different from the main website's domain you're visiting.
- **Allowed Connection:** Network requests that successfully fetched resources from a domain.
- **Blocked Connection:** Requests that were explicitly stopped, either by your content blocker or DNS filtering.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests that were redirected or filtered in a non-obvious way to the website, possibly hidden or stealthy blocking.
