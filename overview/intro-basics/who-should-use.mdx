# Target Audience & Use Cases for uBO Scope

## Introduction

Understanding who benefits most from uBO Scope and how to apply it effectively is key to unlocking the full potential of this powerful tool. Whether you are a privacy-conscious individual, a filter list maintainer, or someone aiming to analyze content blockers or webpage server connections, this guide helps you discover the value uBO Scope brings to your specific needs.

## Who Should Use uBO Scope?

### Privacy-Conscious Users

If protecting your online privacy is your priority, uBO Scope offers unparalleled transparency. It reveals every connection your browser attempts or successfully establishes with remote servers when you visit a webpage. This enables you to:

- See which third-party servers your browser is talking to in real time
- Validate that your content blockers effectively reduce unwanted data leaks
- Identify unexpected or suspicious network activity that might compromise your privacy

### Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining up-to-date and accurate content blocking filter lists requires real-world data. uBO Scope serves as a practical, lightweight companion to aids lists efforts by:

- Providing detailed insights into all domain connections initiated by webpages
- Highlighting which domains are stealth-blocked, blocked, or allowed
- Offering an overview of network request outcomes even in environments with limited access to browser developer tools

This empowers filter list maintainers to refine rules based on tested connection data rather than assumptions.

### Researchers and Analysts Concerned with Content Blocker Effectiveness

Content blocking capabilities are sometimes misjudged by simple block counts or by relying on "ad blocker test" webpages that don’t reflect genuine web behavior. uBO Scope helps debunk these myths by:

- Reporting the number of distinct third-party remote servers actually connected to, rather than only the number of blocked requests
- Revealing stealth-blocked connections that other tools miss
- Providing a trustworthy benchmark to compare the real-world effectiveness of various content blockers

### Web Developers and Security Auditors

Developers and auditors interested in how their sites interact with external services gain clarity with uBO Scope. It facilitates:

- Monitoring all outgoing network connections initiated by web content
- Inspecting which domains are blocked or allowed under current content blocking settings
- Understanding third-party dependencies that may affect site performance, privacy, and security

## Typical Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Evaluating Privacy Risks on Popular Websites

Anna is cautious about her online footprint. After installing uBO Scope, she visits her favorite news site and opens the uBO Scope popup to see a concise list of all domains the page connected to. She notices several unexpected third-party domains and realizes some may track her activity. Using this insight, Anna adjusts her content blocker settings for better protection.

### Scenario 2: Filter List Maintenance on Limited Devices

James manages filter lists but often works on devices without full developer tools access. With uBO Scope, he quickly identifies which third-party servers are consistently contacted but not blocked. This targeted information helps him update the filter lists to better address real-world scenarios.

### Scenario 3: Comparing Content Blocker Effectiveness

Maria tests two popular blockers. She uses uBO Scope to record remote server connections on her browser with each blocker enabled. She finds that although one blocker shows a higher block count, the actual number of distinct connected servers is greater, revealing its lower effectiveness despite appearances.

### Scenario 4: Debugging Third-Party Service Usage

David, a developer, suspects his webpage loads resources from unexpected external hosts. By reading connection data from uBO Scope’s popup, he identifies all external domains contacted during page load, enabling him to optimize dependencies.

## Benefits to Users

- **Complete visibility** into attempted and successful server connections regardless of content blockers used
- **Actionable insights** with clear classification into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories
- **Trusted measurement**, unaffected by artificial testing tools or misleading block counts
- **Low barrier to entry** with a simple popup interface and toolbar badge summarizing third-party domains

## What uBO Scope Does and Does Not Cover

- Uses browser’s `webRequest` APIs to report network request outcomes accurately
- Tracks main frame and subresource requests to provide domain and hostname level reporting
- Cannot report network requests made outside the browser’s webRequest API scope (e.g., some service workers or internal browser traffic)

## Making Sense of uBO Scope Outputs

The key visual elements you encounter when using uBO Scope include:

- **Toolbar Badge Count**: Displays the number of distinct third-party domains allowed through
- **Popup Interface Sections**:
  - *Not blocked*: List of domains from which resources were loaded
  - *Stealth-blocked*: Domains blocked in a way that remains hidden to the webpage
  - *Blocked*: Domains explicitly blocked by content blockers

These insights help users correlate network activity with privacy and performance goals seamlessly.

## Troubleshooting Common Concerns

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Network Connection Monitoring">
<Accordion title="Why do I see connections I didn't expect?">
Often, websites load resources from multiple third-party domains for functionality or advertising. uBO Scope exposes every such connection, giving you clear insight. Check your content blocker settings if you want to reduce these.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if the badge count is zero or missing?">
Badge count reflects distinct third-party connections that occurred. A zero count indicates either no third-party connections on the page or a page served from a local domain. Ensure uBO Scope permissions are correctly granted in your browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do stealth-blocked domains differ from blocked ones?">
Stealth-blocked connections are blocked in a way that doesn't alert the webpage, preserving functionality while preventing resource loading. Regular blocked domains are explicitly prevented, often causing request errors.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
