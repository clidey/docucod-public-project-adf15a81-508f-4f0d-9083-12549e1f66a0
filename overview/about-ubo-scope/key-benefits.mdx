# Key Benefits & Value Proposition of uBO Scope

## Unbiased Measurement of Remote Connections
uBO Scope delivers an authoritative and transparent view of all network connections initiated by your browser to remote servers. Unlike typical content blockers that report only blocked requests, uBO Scope reveals every attempted or successful connection, giving you an honest measurement unfiltered by any other blocker. This unbiased perspective enables you to truly understand the landscape of third-party connections a webpage is making.

### Why Does This Matter?
- **Complete visibility** into connection attempts, regardless of blocking settings or DNS-level filtering.
- Accurately **counts unique third-party domains**, helping you assess your true exposure.
- Helps distinguish between genuinely blocked connections and those allowed stealthily.

## Myth-Busting Around Block Counts
Many users and filter list maintainers mistakenly believe that the number of blocked requests alone is a reliable indicator of content blocker effectiveness. uBO Scope challenges this misconception by clarifying what really counts:

- The **badge number** on uBO Scope’s icon represents the count of distinct third-party remote servers that were connected to.
- A **lower badge number is better**, as it indicates fewer unique third-party connections passed through.
- A blocker showing a high block count but a high number of distinct third parties may actually be less effective.
- This **debunks popular myths** such as trusting ad blocker test pages or assuming simple block counts correlate with quality.

This insight arms you with the knowledge to make informed choices about your content blockers, focusing on true network exposure rather than misleading metrics.

## Clear Outcomes for Privacy and Filter List Maintainers
uBO Scope's design caters to two critical audiences:

### 1. Privacy-Conscious Users
- Monitor in real-time how many and which third-party servers your browser connects to while browsing.
- Understand the **scope of your privacy exposure** on any given webpage.
- React by adjusting your blockers, settings, or browsing habits based on actual data.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers
- Leverage uBO Scope to verify the **effectiveness of filter lists** beyond block counts.
- Identify stealthy connections that evade common blocking mechanisms.
- Use accurate domain-level tracking to improve list quality and precision.

## Why a Lower Badge Count is Preferable
The uBO Scope badge quantifies the **number of unique third-party remote domains** contacted during web browsing. A lower count means:

- Fewer external entities receiving your data requests.
- Reduced tracking surface for advertisers and analytics companies.
- Enhanced page load times and reduced bandwidth usage in many cases.

Keeping this number low is a direct indicator of improved privacy and performance.

## Visibility Regardless of Content Blockers in Use
One of uBO Scope’s fundamental advantages is that it tracks network requests at a level that is independent of the existing content blocker:

- It leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to get a complete picture.
- Counts connections even if they are blocked by DNS or stealth blocking techniques.
- Helps you understand the real network activity behind the scenes.

This approach ensures your analysis and monitoring is accurate, no matter which blockers or configurations you or your users employ.

## Practical Example: Evaluating a Webpage’s Connection Profile
Imagine you visit a news website. Traditional blockers may show:

- 100 blocked requests (which may include multiple pings to the same server).
- 150 allowed requests.

uBO Scope, instead, will report:

- 25 unique third-party domains connected to.
- Highlights domains that were allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.

This reduces noise and helps focus on important entities rather than raw request counts.

<Accordion title="Common Pitfall: Interpreting Badge Counts Without Context">
Understanding and interpreting badge counts is critical. Many users mistake a higher milestone number as an indicator of better blocking. uBO Scope reveals that only unique third-party domains matter for privacy.

**Best Practice:** Use uBO Scope to check the unique domain count rather than raw block numbers.

## Summary of Key Benefits
- **Unfiltered and reliable network connection data across all browsers and sites.**
- **Clear, privacy-focused indicator: unique third-party domains contacted.**
- **Insightful myth debunking helping users and maintainers avoid misleading metrics.**
- **Actionable transparency enabling smarter privacy decisions and filter list improvements.**

## Getting the Most from uBO Scope
To maximize the value from uBO Scope:

- Regularly check the badge to monitor how many distinct third parties are contacted.
- Use the popup interface (“popup.html”) to see lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains with counts.
- Combine with filter list tuning to reduce third-party connections effectively.
- Refer to detailed guides on understanding connection outcomes and advanced usage.

For detailed instructions on how to use the popup interface and interpret reported data, see the [First Run & Interpreting the Interface](https://www.example.com/getting-started/first-steps-and-usage/first-run-and-interface) documentation page.
