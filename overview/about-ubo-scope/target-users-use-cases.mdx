## Understanding uBO Scope's Audience

uBO Scope is designed to empower users who want clear, objective visibility into remote server connections that their browsers make. Here are the main user groups who benefit most from uBO Scope:

### 1. Privacy-Conscious Web Users

If you care deeply about online privacy and want to know exactly what third-party domains your browser is connecting to—whether allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked—uBO Scope serves as your transparency tool. Instead of relying on superficial block counts or opaque content blockers, you get a clear, unfiltered view into network activity:

- See all distinct third-party domains your browser contacts when loading a webpage.
- Understand which connections are successfully established versus blocked or stealthily prevented.
- Make informed privacy decisions based on comprehensive, reliable network data.

### 2. Content Blocker Evaluators

For those who test or compare content blockers and wish to assess their true effectiveness, uBO Scope is indispensable. Common misconceptions abound concerning block counts and blocking reliability, but with uBO Scope, you get clarity:

- Validate which remote servers are actually blocked or allowed.
- Debunk misleading ad blocker test webpages and block count myths.
- Make data-driven judgments about content blocking tools' privacy impact.

### 3. Filter List Maintainers and Developers

Maintaining filter lists requires insight into real-world connection patterns and blocker interactions. uBO Scope provides the raw measurement data necessary to refine, test, and improve filter definitions:

- Observe connections beyond the reach of browser developer tools, especially on devices with limited access.
- Identify connections that may require filtering or deserve an exception.
- Plan and prioritize list maintenance tasks with accurate connection logs.

### 4. Curious Users and Technical Enthusiasts

Not everyone using uBO Scope falls neatly into the categories above. Anyone curious about what their browser connects to, whether for personal education or troubleshooting, will find value in uBO Scope’s transparent reporting:

- Explore which third-party servers are contacted during everyday browsing.
- Understand the distinction between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked network requests.
- Gain greater control over your digital footprint by knowing what your browser “talks” to.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Scenario: You suspect a website loads third-party trackers despite your blocker
**How uBO Scope helps:** You open uBO Scope while visiting the site and immediately see the full list of third-party domains contacted, including those allowed through or stealth-blocked, revealing hidden tracker attempts.

### Scenario: You maintain a filter list and want to validate block coverage
**How uBO Scope helps:** Run uBO Scope alongside your blocker to verify which third-party domains are blocked or slipping through, identifying areas for filter refinement.

### Scenario: You want to compare two content blockers
**How uBO Scope helps:** Use uBO Scope with each blocker enabled independently to assess the actual number of distinct third-party connections allowed, rather than relying on misleading block count badges.

### Scenario: You're a casual user curious about tracking
**How uBO Scope helps:** See a simple and clear overview of all remote domains your browser contacts when loading pages, making privacy more tangible.

## Tips for Maximizing uBO Scope’s Value

- **Look beyond counts:** Pay attention to what the counts represent—fewer distinct third-party connections generally mean better privacy.
- **Combine with blockers:** Use uBO Scope alongside blockers like uBlock Origin to verify and monitor their effectiveness.
- **Use on sensitive sites:** Run uBO Scope on key sites to understand their network footprint.
- **Regular checks:** Periodically reviewing network connections can catch unexpected behavior after software updates or policy changes.

<Note>
Not all third-party connections are harmful. Content delivery networks (CDNs) and necessary service domains may show up and often should not be a concern.
</Note>
