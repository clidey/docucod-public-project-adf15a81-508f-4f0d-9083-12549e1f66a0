# Who is uBO Scope For?

uBO Scope serves a unique array of users who need clear, actionable insights into their browser’s network behavior and the precise nature of third-party connections. Understanding the primary user groups and how they can utilize uBO Scope will help you get the most value from this extension.

## Primary User Groups

### 1. Privacy-Savvy End-Users
These are users deeply concerned about online privacy and eager to see an accurate picture of which third-party servers their browser is communicating with.

- **What They Want:** Transparency and control over their browser’s network footprint.
- **How uBO Scope Helps:** It exposes all remote server connections—both allowed and blocked—showing where network requests go regardless of other content blockers.
- **Real Benefit:** Users gain clarity on the actual third-party domains their browser contacts, enabling informed decisions about privacy settings or content blockers.

### 2. Technical Users Managing Filter Lists
Filter list maintainers, developers, and other technical users who work on content blocking benefit from the comprehensive network visibility uBO Scope offers.

- **What They Want:** Detailed reporting on network outcomes to refine filter rules and validate blocking behavior.
- **How uBO Scope Helps:** It categorizes connections into not blocked, stealth-blocked (redirected), and blocked, allowing maintainers to analyze the effectiveness and behavior of filters.
- **Real Benefit:** Enables effective tuning of filter lists, especially on platforms or devices where traditional developer tools are limited or unavailable.

### 3. Anyone Interested in Transparent Browser Behavior
This extends to researchers, testers, and curious users who want to verify what their browser is actually doing behind the scenes.

- **What They Want:** Reliable verification of network activity without relying on potentially misleading test websites or content blocker block counts.
- **How uBO Scope Helps:** By counting distinct third-party remote server connections and showing outcomes, it offers an honest representation untouched by false positives.
- **Real Benefit:** Debunks myths about content blocking and ad blockers, providing an empirical basis for understanding browser network activity.

## Typical Use Cases

uBO Scope's utility becomes clear in these real-world scenarios:

- **Debunking Ad Blocker Myths:** When users want to understand that a higher block count doesn't always mean better blocking, as uBO Scope reveals the number of allowed third-party connections rather than blocked requests.

- **Evaluating Network Activity When Developer Tools Are Unavailable:** On devices or browsers with limited or no access to network debugging tools, uBO Scope becomes the go-to extension for network visibility.

- **Monitoring Connections in Privacy Audits:** Users or auditors can validate which domains their browser contacts, independent of DNS-based or extension-level blockers.

- **Supporting Filter List Development and Maintenance:** Filter list developers can test and refine rules by analyzing which domains are still connected to and which are stealth-blocked or blocked outright.

## Why This Matters To You

Many users rely on indirect metrics like block counts in other blockers or ad blocker test pages to gauge privacy or blocking effectiveness.
uBO Scope cuts through these misconceptions by offering direct, verifiable details on the network connections your browser attempts and allows.

Whether you're protecting your privacy, developing more effective filters, or simply curious about your browser’s behavior, uBO Scope gives you actionable, trustworthy visibility — no guesswork, no misleading signals.
