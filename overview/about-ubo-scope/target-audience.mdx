  - Users who want to verify what external servers they are connecting to during their browsing sessions.

- **Filter List Maintainers and Developers**
  - Professionals who create and maintain content blocking filter lists.
  - Those who require empirical evidence about which remote domains are accessed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
  - People who need to analyze the impact of filters on real-world network requests.

- **Security Analysts and Researchers**
  - Experts who investigate network behaviors of websites and extensions.
  - Users who need to detect stealth-blocking behavior and verify blocking outcomes.

- **Power Users and Developers**
  - Users who want precise, domain-level visibility into network requests.
  - Developers interested in diagnosing how content blockers interact with web resources.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Verifying Connection Transparency

A privacy-aware user installs uBO Scope to observe all third-party remote server connections made when browsing popular websites. By monitoring the **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** domains reported in the popup panel, the user gains a clear understanding of the actual external network footprint, beyond what typical block counts reveal.

> _Example:_ While visiting a news site, the user notices only a handful of third-party domains are contacted despite numerous connections reported elsewhere, highlighting the effectiveness of their content blocking setup.

### 2. Debunking Misleading Block Counts

Filter list maintainers use uBO Scope to avoid relying on block count metrics that can be misrepresentative. The extension's focus on distinct third-party domains provides a more stable measure of exposure.

> _Scenario:_ A maintainer compares two filter lists. Although List A shows more blocks, uBO Scope reveals that List B results in fewer distinct remote servers contacted, proving List B offers stronger privacy protection.

### 3. Identifying Stealth-Blocked Connections

Security analysts leverage uBO Scope to detect stealth-blocking — connections silently redirected or blocked without user-visible intervention — helping to understand subtle filtering behaviors that can impact browsing or privacy.

> _Use case:_ A researcher investigates why certain ads or trackers sometimes still load despite active blocklists. uBO Scope helps reveal stealth-block events that explain these inconsistencies.

### 4. Supporting Filter List Quality and Maintenance

Filter list creators rely on real connection data from uBO Scope to refine and optimize rules, ensuring fewer false positives or negatives.

> _Example:_ By examining domains flagged as allowed, stealth, or blocked, maintainers can spot unexpected third-party domains needing filter adjustments.

### 5. Enhancing User Awareness of Web Network Activity

Many users are unaware of the complexity behind modern web page resource loading. uBO Scope brings that transparency to the forefront, equipping users with granular visibility on which external domains their browser interacts with.

> _Scenario:_ A user curious about which advertising or analytics servers are contacted during web navigation finds uBO Scope an enlightening companion.

## Before and After: How uBO Scope Changes Your Perspective

| Aspect                  | Before uBO Scope                        | After uBO Scope                                    |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Visibility of Connections | Block counts shown in generic terms | Exact domains listed under allowed, stealth, or blocked outcomes |
| Filtering Confidence     | Based on block counts or site claims  | Based on concrete third-party domain data        |
| Debugging Blocking Issues| Limited or guesswork                   | Clear insight into what exactly was blocked or allowed by domain |

## Practical Tips for Getting the Most from uBO Scope

- Pay close attention to the **distinct domains** count rather than raw block numbers to better gauge real exposure.
- Use the popup’s domain lists to identify unexpected third parties that might merit filtering.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with other browser developer tools for a comprehensive analysis.
- Remember that some third parties, such as trusted CDNs, are common and often safe—focus on unusual or suspicious domains.

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- **No data shown in popup:** Ensure you have visited some websites with network activity since installing the extension.
- **Badge count zero despite browsing:** This can occur if webRequest API hooks are prevented by browser restrictions or the extension’s permissions.
- **Unexpected domains showing as allowed:** Review your content blocker settings or additional browser extensions that might be permitting these connections.
