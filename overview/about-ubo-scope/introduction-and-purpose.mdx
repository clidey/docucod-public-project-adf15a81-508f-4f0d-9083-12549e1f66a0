# uBO Scope: Product Introduction & Purpose

## See Every Remote Connection Your Browser Makes

uBO Scope is a lightweight, no-frills browser extension that reveals every connection your browser attempts or successfully makes to remote servers. Unlike traditional content blockers that silently filter and block requests, uBO Scope shines a light on what exactly happens behind the scenes — offering unparalleled transparency into your web traffic.

### What uBO Scope Does

Built as a companion to the popular uBlock Origin content blocker, uBO Scope tracks network requests initiated by webpages across all your browser tabs. It provides detailed, real-time insights into whether connections are allowed, stealthily blocked, or outright denied — and counts the number of distinct third-party servers contacted.

### Why Transparency Matters

Knowing who your browser talks to is critical in understanding your privacy exposure and assessing the effectiveness of your content blockers. uBO Scope helps by:

- Reporting the precise number of unique third-party remote servers connected during your browsing session.
- Distinguishing between requests that successfully connected, those stealthily blocked (hidden from the webpage), and those outright blocked.
- Capturing connection outcomes regardless of content blocker type, including DNS-based blocking, as long as the browser interfaces with the webRequest API.

This insight enables users to better grasp their actual exposure to third-party services rather than relying on indirect metrics like block counts.

## How uBO Scope Works

Using the browser's `webRequest` API, uBO Scope listens to network events for each browser tab. It categorizes each network request outcome as follows:

- **Allowed:** Connection succeeded.
- **Stealth:** Connection blocked without the webpage detecting it.
- **Blocked:** Connection failed or prevented.

These outcomes are tallied and associated with domains and hostnames, providing a structured overview per tab. The toolbar icon dynamically shows the count of distinct third-party domains connected, giving users a quick summary at a glance.

## Key Differentiators

- **Transparency Over Blocking:** uBO Scope does not block or interfere with connections itself; it reports on what other blockers or the system is doing.
- **Accurate Third-Party Counting:** The badge number reflects the unique count of connected third-party domains — an essential distinction for measuring exposure.
- **Independence from Blocking Mechanism:** Works with all kinds of content blockers and network protections that the browser recognizes, including DNS filtering.
- **Designed to Debunk Misconceptions:** It clarifies common myths about block counts and ad blocker effectiveness by showing real connection data.

## Real-World Scenarios

Imagine you have multiple content blockers active. While one reports a high number of blocked requests, your browser might still be connecting to more third-party domains. uBO Scope exposes this by showing the actual connections allowed or stealthily blocked, letting you choose the most effective tool for your privacy needs.

Alternatively, filter list maintainers can analyze network connection patterns across tabs and domains for refining their blocking strategies.

## What You See in the Interface

From the toolbar, uBO Scope’s popup panel summarizes:

- The current active tab’s hostname and domain.
- A total of distinct connected third-party domains.
- Lists of domains under each connection outcome: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.

This gives a clear picture of the network connections relevant to any page you visit.

## Starting with uBO Scope

Getting started is straightforward:

1. **Install the Extension:** Available on Chrome, Firefox, Safari browsers via official extension stores.
2. **Use While Browsing:** Monitor toolbar badge counts as you navigate.
3. **Open Popup:** Click the icon to see detailed third-party connection breakdowns.

<u>Keep in mind:</u>

- The badge number is a **count of distinct third-party domains** connected, not a block count.
- Not all third-party connections are undesirable; many legitimate sites rely on CDNs or APIs.
- Some network requests outside the browser's `webRequest` API scope cannot be reported.

## Troubleshooting & Common Questions

**Q:** Why does a lower badge count mean better privacy?

**A:** Because the badge shows how many unique third-party domains were connected. Fewer connections typically indicate less exposure.

**Q:** Can uBO Scope block any requests?

**A:** No. uBO Scope only observes and reports on network activity. Blocking is handled by your content blockers or browser settings.

**Q:** What about connections not reported?

**A:** If a network request does not pass through the browser’s `webRequest` API (e.g., via some native system DNS or proxy), uBO Scope cannot detect it.

## Summary

uBO Scope puts the power of transparency in your hands, enabling you to see the complete picture of your browser’s network activity. By emphasizing **truthful connection reporting over blocking**, it helps you make informed decisions about web privacy and content blocking strategies. This extension is a vital tool in maintaining browser privacy awareness and debunking misleading blocker metrics.
