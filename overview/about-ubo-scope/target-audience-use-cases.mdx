# Who is uBO Scope for?

uBO Scope is designed for users who care deeply about understanding and controlling the remote connections their browsers make. This page outlines the ideal audiences, highlighting their motivations and the specific scenarios where uBO Scope becomes an invaluable tool.

---

## Empowering Privacy-Conscious Users

If you are vigilant about online privacy and want concrete data on what third-party servers your browser talks to, uBO Scope puts this power into your hands. Instead of guessing or relying solely on content blockers, you gain transparent insights:

- **Audit all remote connections**: Instantly see which domains your browser connected to on any webpage.
- **Understand what truly gets blocked**: Monitor allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked server connections side-by-side.
- **Validate your content blocker’s effectiveness**: Confirm that blocking rules actually reduce third-party contact.

**Example:** While shopping online, instead of worrying about hidden trackers, you check uBO Scope’s popup to see all third-party domains contacted on the page — compare how many servers are contacted with and without your blocker enabled.

## Supporting Content Blocker Evaluators

For testers and reviewers who analyze the reliability and impact of various content blockers, uBO Scope provides factual data beyond typical tests and misconceptions:

- **Debunk blocker myths:** Avoid misleading metrics like sheer block counts which can be deceiving.
- **Reveal stealth blocking:** Detect network requests silently redirected or blocked without obvious indicators.
- **Compare blocker performance:** See the actual number of distinct third-party remote servers allowed.

**Scenario:** When you review an ad blocker claiming to be superior because it blocks more connections, use uBO Scope to verify whether more servers are genuinely blocked or if the blocker simply triggers false positives.

## Assisting Filter List Maintainers

Filter list maintainers and privacy advocates working with blocking rules gain unique advantages, especially when browser developer tools are limited or unavailable:

- **Assess blocker outcomes without deep browser tools:** Use uBO Scope as a lightweight companion to evaluate network request outcomes.
- **Target real-world domains:** Identify domains making connections that should be considered for blocking or safelisting.
- **Prepare cleaner filter lists:** Confirm the network effects of filter list changes.

**Use Case:** On devices or browsers where developer consoles are restricted or complex, filter maintainers can rely on uBO Scope to audit real network behaviors efficiently.

## Practical Tips for uBO Scope Users

- **Open the popup while browsing** to get immediate feedback about network connections on the current tab.
- **Focus on the badge count** on the toolbar icon as it represents distinct third-party domains contacted; aim for lower counts to minimize exposure.
- **Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker** to validate blocking efficacy rather than relying on block counts alone.

---

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

- Don't mistake higher block counts as proof of superior blocking — what matters is reducing *distinct* third-party connections.
- Avoid relying on ad blocker test webpages, which often generate unrealistic network requests and fail to detect stealth blocking.
- Remember that uBO Scope reports connections visible to the browser's `webRequest` API; connections outside this scope are not reported.

<Check>
Before using uBO Scope to assess blocker performance, ensure you understand the difference between block counts and distinct allowed server connections. Focus on what matters: the number of third-party connections successfully prevented, not the number of events blocked.

<Note>
If your browser or environment restricts developer tools, uBO Scope provides a simple visual way to inspect network requests without complex setup or knowledge.
