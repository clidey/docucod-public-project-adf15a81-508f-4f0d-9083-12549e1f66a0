# What is uBO Scope?

Discover the true landscape of your browser’s network activity with uBO Scope — a robust browser extension specifically designed to illuminate both attempted and successful connections to remote servers. Whether you use any content blocker or none at all, uBO Scope provides unparalleled transparency into the third-party network interactions initiated by webpages, helping you understand your actual exposure to external resources.

## Understanding uBO Scope

At its core, uBO Scope is a transparent lens on your browser’s network footprint. It listens in on all network requests your browser issues — including those blocked by other content blockers or by DNS-level filtering — and reveals exactly which remote servers your browser is connecting to.

This insight is crucial because the total count of network connections and which servers are involved directly impacts your privacy, security, and browsing experience.

Unlike traditional content blockers that show only block counts, uBO Scope focuses on the **number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser communicates with**, making the displayed badge count a reliable indicator of true network exposure.

## Why uBO Scope Matters

Imagine browsing your favorite website. It loads perfectly, but behind the scenes, dozens of third-party servers are contacted — some necessary, others potentially invasive. Without a tool like uBO Scope, you might be unaware of the multitude of remote connections.

uBO Scope helps you:

- **Identify every remote server your browser talks to, distinguishing blocked versus allowed connections.**
- **Debunk misconceptions about content blockers, by showing true network outcomes rather than block counts.**
- **Analyze your browsing sessions at a domain and hostname level, to understand third-party reach.**

This empowers you to confidently evaluate your content blocking solutions and overall privacy posture.

## How uBO Scope Works in Brief

uBO Scope leverages your browser's native `webRequest` API to track network requests initiated by webpages. It logs the outcomes of these requests (success, redirects, errors) and classifies servers into three categories:

- **Allowed:** Servers from which connections succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Servers that redirects attempted but did not result in successful connections (related to stealth blocking).
- **Blocked:** Servers that failed network requests or were explicitly blocked.

The extension maintains session-specific tracking for browser tabs, correlating these outcomes to their respective tabs, and provides a badge count representing the number of distinct allowed remote domains per active tab.

The extension’s popup interface clearly presents these server categories by domain, along with their frequency of occurrence, using Unicode-aware display for internationalized domains.

## Real-World Scenario

Consider you are a filter list maintainer or privacy-conscious user:

1. You open a webpage.
2. uBO Scope instantly starts monitoring network requests for that tab.
3. The extension collects real-time data on third-party hostnames requested, categorizes them by allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, and updates the toolbar badge accordingly.
4. In the extension popup, you can explore which domains are actually contacted, helping you identify unexpected or unwanted remote connections.

This direct visibility lets you audit content blockers and filter lists under realistic conditions, beyond synthetic block counts or unreliable webpage tests.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Interpret badge counts cautiously:** A lower badge number means fewer distinct third-party connections, which usually translates to better privacy.
- **Beware of Block Count Misinterpretations:** A high block count does not mean better blocking if it coincides with a higher number of allowed third-party connections.
- **Use uBO Scope alongside other tools:** It's complementary; it reveals actual network activity rather than just block rules effectiveness.

## Summary

uBO Scope provides a precise, no-nonsense view into your browser's third-party network connections, enabling you to understand the real impact of content blockers and your browsing privacy. It is a vital tool for users seeking to demystify their browser’s interactions and for filter list maintainers aiming to refine blocking strategies.
