# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlocking the True Picture of Web Connections

When you browse the web, your browser often talks to many remote servers behind the scenes—some necessary, some less so, and some you might want to block for privacy or security reasons. But how can you see all those connections clearly, especially when content blockers, DNS filtering, or network-level firewalls obscure the details?

This is exactly the problem uBO Scope solves. It is a lightweight browser extension designed to comprehensively reveal every attempted or successful network connection a web page makes to remote servers. Importantly, it surfaces these connections regardless of any content blocker or network filtering that might be in place, showing the *real* footprint of your web activity.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a companion browser extension to uBlock Origin, created by Raymond Hill, with the primary purpose of monitoring and reporting remote server connections initiated by web pages. It leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to track network requests and classifies each connection attempt by its outcome:

- **Allowed:** Requests that successfully connected.
- **Blocked:** Requests prevented from connecting.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that were redirected or otherwise blocked in a stealthy manner.

As an open-source tool under the GNU General Public License, uBO Scope focuses on transparency and empowers users to see the precise network behavior of web pages.

## Why Does uBO Scope Matter?

Most content blockers show you only what they block, and browser network tools may not always surface the full picture of where your data is going. uBO Scope fills the gaps by capturing *all* network requests, including those blocked by content filters or DNS-level methods. This gives you unmatched visibility into third-party connections that browsers ordinarily hide. 

Knowing these connections helps you:

- **Understand your exposure:** See exactly how many and which third-party servers a page contacts.
- **Verify blockers' effectiveness:** Assess whether your content blocker truly reduces unwanted connections.
- **Debunk myths around block counts:** Not all block counts reflect better privacy; uBO Scope helps clarify this.
- **Support filter maintainers:** By providing a clear connection map, it assists in refining blocklists.

## What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

uBO Scope stands apart because it:

- **Reports all connections without exceptions:** Regardless of content blockers or network filtering, if a request reaches the browser's `webRequest` API, uBO Scope captures and reports it.
- **Counts distinct third-party domains:** Its badge count reflects unique remote servers contacted, which is a more meaningful privacy indicator than raw blocked request numbers.
- **Doesn't interfere with blocking:** It is a pure monitoring tool that complements your existing content blockers without changing their behavior.
- **Debunks common testing fallacies:** It shows why "ad blocker tests" and block count comparisons can be misleading.

## How Does uBO Scope Work (High-Level)?

At its core, uBO Scope listens to the browser's network request events using the `webRequest` API. For each network request made by a web page, it records the request URL, the request's outcome (success, blocked, or redirected), and classifies the domains contacted:

- Maps hostnames to their registered domains using the Public Suffix List.
- Aggregates connection attempts into three outcome categories.
- Updates a per-tab summary of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked remote servers.
- Displays these details in a popup accessible from the browser toolbar icon.

This transparent flow exposes the real-world connections beyond what conventional blockers report.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine visiting a news website. While it appears clean, dozens of hidden third-party trackers and ad servers might be contacted. With uBO Scope, clicking its toolbar icon after loading the page reveals:

- How many distinct domains your browser contacted.
- How many were blocked by your content blocker.
- How many tried to load resources stealthily or were redirected.

This immediate insight helps you gauge privacy risks on any site and tune your blockers accordingly.

## Practical Tips for Using uBO Scope

- **Look at the unique domains count:** A lower number means fewer third-party connections and typically better privacy.
- **Interpret stealth-blocked carefully:** These are requests that were redirected or prevented subtly, often indicating advanced blocker stealth.
- **Don’t rely solely on block counts:** uBO Scope proves that higher block counts don’t always mean better blocking.
- **Use the popup for a quick audit:** The extension’s UI categorizes connections clearly, making it easy to identify potentially unwanted connections.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- **No data shown on the popup:** Ensure the web page is fully loaded and the active tab is selected. Reloading the page often refreshes connection data.
- **Unexpectedly high domain count:** Some websites legitimately load resources from many CDNs or third parties; verify before concluding it's an issue.
- **Mismatch between uBO Scope and other blockers:** Because uBO Scope counts domains *allowed* to connect, differences indicate whether other blockers truly prevent connections or simply filter content.
