# Why Use uBO Scope?

## See the True Picture of Your Browser’s Network Connections

In today’s web environment, understanding which remote servers your browser communicates with is crucial for privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers alike. uBO Scope unravels this complexity by showing the *actual count* of distinct third-party servers contacted by each browser tab, empowering you to assess your browsing privacy with clarity and confidence.

### Why This Matters

Many users rely on ad blockers and content blockers to protect their privacy, but these tools often provide misleading metrics about what they block or allow. uBO Scope cuts through the confusion by reporting *the real network footprint* of your browser, independent of any content blocker in use.

### What You Gain by Using uBO Scope

- **Transparent insight into network activity:** Know every server your browser tries to reach, blocked or allowed.
- **Debunk misleading blocker statistics:** Understand that higher block counts do not necessarily mean better privacy.
- **Evaluate true third-party exposure:** See a clear, verifiable count of distinct third-party domains your browser interacts with.
- **Useful for filter list maintainers:** Get accurate data to refine blocking rules, particularly on devices lacking advanced browser tools.
- **Real-world context:** Avoid fake scenarios from ad block tests that don’t reflect actual browsing behavior.

## The Problem with Conventional Metrics

Users often believe that the block count badges shown by content blockers provide a good measure of how effective the blocker is. This is a misconception:

- A high block count might mean the blocker reports more blocked requests but still lets through connections to *more* distinct third-party servers.
- Conversely, a lower block count can correspond to fewer third parties being contacted, implying better privacy.

Similarly, popular ‘ad blocker test’ websites are unreliable benchmarks because they use unrealistic network requests designed to detect blockers rather than reflect genuine, real-world connections.

uBO Scope addresses these pain points by offering precise, unbiased data about actual network connections, regardless of the blocker’s stealth or the test page’s accuracy.

## Real-World Scenarios Where uBO Scope Excels

Consider these everyday situations:

- **While browsing a news site,** see exactly how many third-party servers the browser contacts beyond the site you trust.
- **During online shopping,** understand the extent of tracking or analytics domains your browser touches.
- **When debugging or maintaining filter lists,** easily identify domains that consistently evade current block rules.

The empowerment of seeing beyond surface-level metrics helps users and maintainers make informed decisions.

## How uBO Scope Provides Unique Value

The extension monitors network requests made by the browser and categorizes each third-party connection based on outcomes:

- **Allowed connections**: Servers contacted successfully.
- **Blocked connections**: Requests that failed or were stopped.
- **Stealth-blocked connections**: Redirects or silent blocks that some blockers apply to avoid detection.

This division translates into transparency, clarifying which network activities truly happen in your browsing session.

Additionally, the toolbar badge on uBO Scope always reflects the *number of distinct third-party servers actually contacted*, giving you a straightforward privacy metric.

## Best Practices for Using uBO Scope

- Use uBO Scope alongside your regular content blockers to validate the effectiveness of blocking rules.
- Check the badge count during browsing to spot unexpectedly high third-party activity.
- Utilize uBO Scope’s detailed popup to inspect which domains are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Filter list maintainers should incorporate uBO Scope findings in their debugging workflows to improve list quality.
