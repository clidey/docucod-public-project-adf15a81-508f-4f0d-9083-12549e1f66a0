# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the key terms and concepts behind uBO Scope empowers you to make the most of its insights. This page provides a concise glossary that aligns your interpretation with how uBO Scope reports and categorizes network connections while you browse.

---

## Third-Party Connections

When you visit a website, your browser often interacts not only with the site’s own servers but also with other external servers providing images, scripts, analytics, advertising, or CDN services. These external servers are called **third parties**.

uBO Scope tracks and reports these third-party connections because they typically influence your privacy and browsing footprint. The count of distinct third-party servers connected to is shown prominently on the toolbar badge.

> **Why it matters:** Third-party connections can lead to tracking, data collection, or increased network overhead. Keeping this number low generally reflects a smaller privacy and performance footprint.

---

## Badge Count

The number displayed on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon badge represents **the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser has connected to** during the active tab session.

- Each unique third-party domain is counted once, regardless of how many requests are made.
- A lower badge count signals fewer third-party connections and usually indicates a cleaner, more privacy-conscious browsing experience.

> **Important:** The badge count focuses on allowed connections — those that successfully proceed — not the total blocked or stealth-blocked.

---

## WebRequest API

uBO Scope relies on the browser’s native **WebRequest API** to monitor network requests and their outcomes. This API allows the extension to intercept, observe, and classify each network request made by webpages.

- It captures requests made over HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket protocols.
- It tracks the status of requests, including allowed, redirected, blocked, or failed.

> **Limitation:** Requests not visible through this API, such as certain DNS-level blocks or browser-internal network operations, cannot be tracked by uBO Scope.

---

## Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth-Blocked Domains

uBO Scope categorizes every observed remote connection into three mutually exclusive groups:

- **Allowed Domains:** Connections that were allowed to proceed successfully. These often include essential resources or third-party services your browser fetched.
- **Blocked Domains:** Connections explicitly blocked, usually by your content blocker or by network errors indicating blocked attempts.
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains:** Connections that were intercepted or redirected silently, typical of stealth blocking methods that mask blocking from detection by webpages.

These categories appear within the extension popup, giving a clear snapshot of what your browser actually connected to or prevented.

> **Use Case:** Quickly identify which third parties are actively engaged on a page and which ones your setup prevented from loading.

---

## Domain and Hostname

Understanding the difference between domain and hostname is key:

- **Hostname:** The full identifier in a URL pointing to a server, e.g., `sub.example.com`.
- **Domain:** The base registered domain name part, e.g., `example.com`, extracted using the Public Suffix List.

uBO Scope aggregates counts by domain, which helps you see connections grouped by the entity owning the domain rather than individual subdomains.

> This grouping helps reduce noise and focuses on the real third-party entities.

---

## How These Terms Come Together

When browsing, uBO Scope:

1. Listens to every network request reported by the WebRequest API.
2. Extracts the hostname and derives the domain.
3. Determines the outcome category: allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
4. Aggregates counts for both hostnames and their domains.
5. Updates the badge showing how many distinct third-party domains have been connected to.

This model ensures you get a realistic, independent view of your network footprint filtered by what was actually fetched or blocked.

---

## Practical Tips

- **Monitoring Badge:** Keep an eye on the badge number. Unexpected increases when browsing may indicate new or suspicious third-party tracking.
- **Popup Review:** Open the popup for a detailed breakdown categorized by allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains. This helps you understand which remote servers are most active.
- **Interpret Counts Carefully:** A high block count but also a high allowed count means many connections happened besides blocks — what really matters is how many third parties you actually connect with.
- **Limitations of WebRequest:** Some browsers or future versions might restrict WebRequest visibility, limiting uBO Scope’s accuracy.

## Summary

This terminology foundation prepares you to interpret uBO Scope’s reports confidently. Knowing what third-party connections mean, the significance of badge counts, the role of the WebRequest API, and the classification of domains empowers you to assess your browsing privacy and network behavior effectively.
