# Quick Feature Overview

uBO Scope delivers a powerful yet streamlined experience for users committed to transparency and control over network connections in their web browsers. This page offers a crisp, bullet-point summary of the essential features uBO Scope provides, enabling new users to quickly grasp the benefits and core capabilities of the extension.

## Why This Matters

Every website you visit makes numerous network requests behind the scenes, often to third-party servers that track, serve ads, or load essential resources. uBO Scope empowers you to see exactly which remote servers your browser connects to, regardless of any active content blocking tools you use. Understanding these connections helps you maintain a high level of privacy awareness, verify content blockers' effectiveness, and troubleshoot unexpected behaviors.

## Essential Features

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on major browsers
  - Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)
  - Firefox
  - Safari
  This ensures consistent insight into network connections across your preferred browsing environments.

- **Real-Time Third-Party Server Counting**
  - Instantly reports the distinct number of third-party remote servers your active tab is connected to.
  - The toolbar badge updates live, providing immediate feedback as you browse.

- **Independence from Content Blockers**
  - Accurately reports network requests regardless of which content blockers you have enabled.
  - Includes visibility into requests that are allowed, stealth-blocked (silently blocked), or outright blocked, so you get a comprehensive picture.

- **Session-Based Analytics Per Tab**
  - Tracks network request outcomes per browser tab during the browsing session.
  - Maintains details for each tab independently, reflecting unique behaviors of different webpages.

- **Lightweight and Privacy-Respecting**
  - Does not modify or block content itself.
  - Solely observes and reports network activity without transmitting your data elsewhere.

- **Clear Categorization of Network Outcomes**
  - Displays groups of domains under “Allowed,” “Stealth-blocked,” and “Blocked” with counts, making it easy to understand the results.

- **Unicode Support for Domain Names**
  - Properly decodes and displays internationalized domain names for clear, human-readable reports.

## What You See in Practice

When you click the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar, a popup appears showing:

- The count of distinct third-party domains connected by the current tab (also visible on the badge).
- Lists of domains grouped by connection outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked), each with the number of requests.

This simple yet effective UI helps you assess third-party activity quickly without overwhelming technical detail.

---

## Tips for New Users

- Consider uBO Scope a transparency tool that complements your existing content blockers.
- Watch the badge number as you browse; a sudden rise may indicate unexpected third-party connections.
- Use the popup lists to investigate which domains your tabs connect to.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- uBO Scope does not block or alter any requests; it only reports.
- Some network requests may be stealth-blocked by other tools and still appear here.
- Very rare network activity might not show if the browser's webRequest API does not capture it.

---

## Getting Started

To start using these features, install uBO Scope on your browser, then browse websites as usual. The toolbar badge reflects third-party connection counts in real-time per tab. Click the icon anytime to open the popup view and explore detailed connection summaries.
