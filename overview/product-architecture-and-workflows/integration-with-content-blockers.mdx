# Integration & Compatibility

## Seamless Operation Alongside Other Content Blockers

uBO Scope is uniquely designed to operate independently while coexisting peacefully with popular content blockers such as uBlock Origin, browser-level blockers, and DNS-based protection services. It provides a transparent and unbiased view of all network connections initiated by webpages, regardless of which content blocking mechanisms are active.

### Why Coexistence Matters

Users often run multiple layers of privacy and content control tools to secure their browsing experience. While these tools block or filter content in different ways, understanding exactly which third-party remote servers a webpage connects to—or attempts to connect to—remains essential for privacy awareness and troubleshooting. uBO Scope fills this role without interfering.

## What uBO Scope Does and How It Works With Other Blockers

- **Independent Network Request Reporting:** uBO Scope uses the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor all network requests a tab issues, capturing **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth-blocked** connection attempts.

- **Unbiased Visibility:** Unlike content blockers that actively block or modify network requests, uBO Scope only measures and reports. It never blocks or prevents connections.

- **Comprehensive Capture Despite Blocking:** Even if content blockers like uBlock Origin or browser features block network requests, uBO Scope can still observe and categorize these events through the `webRequest` event lifecycle, labeling them as **blocked** or **stealth-blocked** based on the outcome.

- **No Conflict or Interference:** uBO Scope is designed so that its operation does not conflict with or degrade the performance or blocking efficacy of other content blockers.


## Supported Blocker Types and Their Interaction with uBO Scope

| Blocker Type                  | Integration Behavior                                             | What uBO Scope Reports                             |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Extension-based Content Blockers** (e.g., uBlock Origin) | Operate by intercepting, filtering, or blocking requests before or during network transmission. | Reports every network request outcome including those blocked by these extensions.
| **Browser Native Blockers**   | Utilize built-in browser features (e.g., tracking prevention in Firefox, Enhanced Tracking Protection). | Requests blocked at this level are visible via the API and reported appropriately.
| **DNS-based Blocking**        | Block or redirect domain requests at the DNS level before connection attempts.                | Requests blocked before reaching the network layer are typically reported as blocked or stealth-blocked if observable by the browser's API.

## Integration Boundaries and Limitations

While uBO Scope aims to provide a complete picture, some limitations inherent to how browsers expose network request information affect what can be observed:

- **Dependent on `webRequest` API Exposure:** uBO Scope relies on the browser's API to capture network events. Any request or blocking that happens outside this API’s visibility, such as certain network-layer interceptions or sandboxed contexts that do not emit these events, will not be reported.

- **Blocked Early by DNS or OS:** If DNS filtering or external system firewalls block a connection before the browser attempts it, uBO Scope may not see or report these events.

- **Service Workers and Other Background Scripts:** Requests initiated by service workers or background tasks that do not propagate through the monitored tab session might not be fully captured.

## What uBO Scope Specifically Reports

- **Allowed Connections:** Network requests that complete successfully or are allowed through content blockers.

- **Blocked Connections:** Requests that fail due to content blocker intervention, browser tracking protection, or network errors detected by the browser.

- **Stealth-Blocked Connections:** More covert blocking actions where requests are redirected or replaced silently by blockers, often to protect against detection.

- **Distinct Third-Party Domains:** The badge count and popup summarize the number of unique third-party remote servers contacted or attempted, providing a clear measure of external connections independent of blocking layers.

## Practical Examples

### Scenario 1: Using uBO Scope with uBlock Origin

- You browse a website with uBlock Origin actively blocking ads.
- uBO Scope captures all network requests the page initiates.
- Requests blocked by uBlock Origin appear in uBO Scope’s popup as **blocked** or **stealth-blocked**, while allowed requests show as **allowed**.
- This helps validate if uBlock Origin is effectively blocking expected domains.

### Scenario 2: Browsing with Browser Tracking Protection Enabled

- Your browser (e.g., Firefox) blocks trackers natively.
- uBO Scope still reports blocked and allowed network connections.
- You gain insight into which third-party requests the built-in protections are blocking versus allowing.

### Scenario 3: DNS-Level Blocking (e.g., Pi-hole)

- You use a DNS filter that blocks domains before connection.
- Requests filtered out by DNS may appear as blocked if the browser's `webRequest` API reports an error or failure.
- uBO Scope reports these as blocked but cannot trace DNS-level behavior in detail.

## Tips for Effective Use

- Use uBO Scope alongside content blockers to gain a more holistic view of third-party connections.

- Remember that a lower distinct third-party server count in uBO Scope indicates fewer external connections, which correlates more directly with privacy than raw block counts.

- Combine insights from uBO Scope with your blocker’s dashboard for troubleshooting allowed or unexpectedly blocked resources.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Assuming uBO Scope Blocks Requests:** uBO Scope only reports; it does not block. If you want to block, use dedicated content blockers.

- **Expecting Coverage of All Network Layers:** Network requests outside the browser’s visibility (e.g., DNS-level blocks or opaque service worker requests) may not be captured.

- **Using “Ad Blocker Test” Sites for Validation:** These sites often generate unrealistic network requests and do not reflect real-world blocking effectiveness. Trust uBO Scope’s measured data instead.

## Getting Started with Integration

To effectively use uBO Scope in combination with other blockers:

1. Ensure uBO Scope is installed and active in your browser.
2. Use your preferred content blockers as usual.
3. Open the uBO Scope popup to view live network request summaries for the active tab.
4. Compare allowed and blocked domains with those expected from your content blocker.
5. Consult diagnostic documentation such as "Understanding the Badge & Popup" and "How uBO Scope Works" for deeper insights.

## Troubleshooting Integration Issues

<Tip>
If you notice missing or unexpected entries in uBO Scope’s reports, verify that:
- Your browser supports the `webRequest` API fully.
- The extension has correct permissions (see installation guides).
- DNS or system-level blockers are not hiding blocked connections before they reach the browser.
</Tip>

<Warning>
uBO Scope cannot detect connections made outside the browser’s `webRequest` API scope. Therefore, highly sandboxed requests or native DNS blocking may not appear in reports.
</Warning>

By understanding uBO Scope’s integration boundaries and its relationship with other content blockers, you gain unmatched clarity into your web traffic and the true effectiveness of your privacy tools.
