# Feature Quick Tour

Discover how uBO Scope empowers you to visualize and understand every remote connection your browser makes. This guide walks you through the essential features of the extension’s popup interface, explains the meaning behind the toolbar badge counts, and shows you how to interpret the blocking and allowing of domains at a glance.

---

## Overview: The Popup Interface

uBO Scope’s primary user interface is a compact popup window accessed via the browser toolbar icon. This panel offers a clear, categorized view of all remote domains your active tab is connecting to — grouped by whether network requests were allowed, stealth-blocked, or explicitly blocked.

### At a Glance: What You See

- **Tab Hostname Header**: Displays the currently active tab’s main hostname and domain, providing context for the data shown.
- **Domains Connected Summary**: Shows the total number of distinct third-party domains your tab has connected to that were not blocked.
- **Outcome Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains where requests successfully completed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains whose requests were silently redirected or blocked without obvious failure.
  - **Blocked**: Domains with requests that failed due to active blocking.

Each section lists domains alongside a count of how many requests were made to each, helping you quickly identify the most contacted servers.

## Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count

The number displayed on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon badge represents **the number of distinct third-party domains that your current tab connected to and were allowed by the browser**. 

> **Why It Matters:** A lower badge count equates to fewer third-party connections, offering you a quick privacy indicator without diving into details. This metric helps you assess your browser’s exposure to external resources.

## Navigating Connection Categories

uBO Scope classifies connections into three actionable categories to help you understand the network behavior of each tab:

### 1. Not Blocked
- These are remote domains your browser connected to and successfully retrieved resources from.
- Examples:
  - Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) hosting JavaScript or CSS files.
  - APIs used legitimately by the webpage.

### 2. Stealth-Blocked
- Requests that were silently intercepted or redirected without explicit failure notification.
- Often represents subtle blocking by content blockers or DNS filtering that doesn’t trigger typical errors.
- Useful to detect hidden filtering that might affect website behavior.

### 3. Blocked
- Domains where network requests failed to complete due to explicit blocking mechanisms.
- Clearly indicates which third-party servers have been prevented from communicating.

## Real-World User Flow

Imagine you open a news website. uBO Scope tracks all network requests as they happen:

1. The extension records the main frame's domain and resets any previously stored data.
2. It notes every third-party connection attempt — successful, stealth-blocked, or blocked — updating counts accordingly.
3. The toolbar badge updates dynamically to show how many distinct third-party domains are being loaded.
4. Opening the popup reveals the categorized list, enabling you to:
   - See if essential CDNs are loading as expected.
   - Identify suspicious connections that might infringe on privacy.
   - Verify whether your content blocker is effectively blocking known trackers.

## Practical Tips for Using the Feature Quick Tour

- **Refresh the Popup Regularly:** The popup reflects data only for the currently active tab and updates as new requests occur.
- **Don’t Rely Solely on Block Counts:** The badge represents domains allowed, not the number of blocked requests — a critical distinction for privacy assessment.
- **Use The Domain Counts:** Larger counts in the list indicate frequent contact, signaling domains that are core to the page or potentially bulky trackers.

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Popup Interface Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Why is the domains count very high?">
A higher count often indicates multiple third-party resources are loaded, which is normal for modern websites but could also signal extensive tracking or ad networks.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I see no data or 'NO DATA' in the popup.">
This usually means the tab has no recent network activity or uBO Scope hasn’t yet recorded requests for that tab. Try refreshing the page or switching tabs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count doesn’t match the number of domains shown in the popup.">
The badge shows distinct allowed domains only. Some blocked or stealth-blocked domains might not be included in the badge count but still appear in the popup categorized sections.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

The Feature Quick Tour introduces you to the core user experience of uBO Scope’s popup interface. Through intuitive categorization and insightful counts, you can easily visualize all third-party remote domains your browser interacts with — crucial for privacy monitoring and content blocker evaluation.
