# Key Value & Differentiators

Discover why uBO Scope stands apart in the realm of network connection monitoring tools. This page highlights its unparalleled accuracy, independence from third-party content blockers, and unwavering reliability in debunking misleading metrics—empowering users with transparent, trustworthy insights into their browser's remote server connections.

---

## Instant Clarity on Your Browser’s Network Activity

Imagine being able to see every remote server your browser attempts to connect with—without exceptions or blind spots. uBO Scope makes this a reality, delivering a trustworthy window into your browser’s network requests regardless of what other blockers or privacy tools you use.

- **Complete Accuracy:** Logs every network connection reported by the browser, including HTTPS and WebSocket connections.
- **Blocker Agnostic:** Operates independently of any content blockers, ensuring visibility even when others mask or hide connection attempts.
- **Trustworthy Metrics:** Exposes misleading 'block counts' and ad blocker test results with precision.

Whether you are privacy-conscious, a developer troubleshooting network calls, or a filter list maintainer refining blocklists, uBO Scope equips you with an unmatched data source.

## What Sets uBO Scope Apart?

### Industry-Leading Accuracy
uBO Scope harnesses the exact network activity the browser itself reports. Unlike tools that infer network behavior or rely on heuristics, uBO Scope records **every** attempted and successful remote server connection. This means no connection escapes notice — offering a reliable audit trail of your browser’s network interactions.

### Unlinked from Content Blockers
Content blockers frequently obscure or alter network visibility, either by silently blocking requests or by modifying how connections appear. uBO Scope deliberately sits outside these ecosystems—it neither blocks nor filters content. Instead, it presents network data transparently, regardless of the content blockers installed, making it an **independent network truth teller.**

### Reliable Source For Debunking Misleading Metrics
Common "block count" numbers or anti-ad blocker test results can be misrepresented by many tools or lists. By showing what the browser actually reports, uBO Scope enables accurate analysis to:

- Debunk exaggerated block statistics.
- Validate the effectiveness of privacy tools.
- Assess third-party connections honestly.

### Lightweight Yet Powerful
Despite its comprehensive tracking, uBO Scope remains a lightweight browser extension. It operates seamlessly without degrading browser performance or requiring complex configuration.

## Core Benefits for Users and Filter List Maintainers

- **Visibility Into Hidden Connections:** See connections stealthily allowed by other blockers or obscured by anti-ad blocker scripts.
- **Developer Diagnostics:** Analyze all network endpoints your web page interacts with, supporting debugging and performance tuning.
- **Filter List Research:** Maintain and improve blocklists with accurate, unfiltered network data.
- **Enhanced Privacy Awareness:** Understand and control remote connections your browsing activity generates.

### Real-World Scenario
*You suspect a certain site triggers hidden connections to suspicious domains, undetected by your content blocker. With uBO Scope's transparent logs, you confirm these stealthy connections, identify domains, and make informed decisions about your privacy tools.*

## Key Features at a Glance

- **Comprehensive Network Logging:** Records all HTTP/S and WebSocket remote server connections.
- **Independent Operation:** No interference from or dependency on content blockers.
- **Clear Categorization:** Distinguishes connections as allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked for easy interpretation.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Quick insights via badge counts and popup panels (covered in other docs).

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Install uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blockers to gain independent network visibility without conflicts.**
- **Use the information from uBO Scope to validate or question claims made by other tools about blocked/allowed network activity.**
- **Leverage uBO Scope for investigative workflows when troubleshooting page loading delays or unexpected network requests.**
- **Avoid relying solely on "block counts" reported by content blockers—use uBO Scope's unbiased data for accurate assessment.**

---

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

- **No Data Visible?** Ensure uBO Scope is installed correctly and permissions are granted in your browser.
- **Unexpectedly Low Connection Counts?** Remember uBO Scope shows what the browser reports; some connections may be internal or non-remote.
- **Confusing Badge Numbers?** Consult the [Understanding Badge Counts and Reports](/getting-started/introduction-overview/understanding-badge-and-reports) page for detailed interpretation.
