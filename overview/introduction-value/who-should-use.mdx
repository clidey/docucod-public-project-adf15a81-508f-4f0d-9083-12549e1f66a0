# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

uBO Scope caters to a distinct set of users who seek clear, unbiased insights into network connections initiated during web browsing. This page breaks down who benefits the most from uBO Scope and how it fits into different workflows—from everyday privacy awareness to technical auditing in restrictive environments.

## Understanding uBO Scope's Audience

uBO Scope is designed primarily for users who want to uncover the true network activity behind every webpage they visit. It shines in scenarios where knowing _who_ a browser connects to—and whether those connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked—is crucial.

### Core Audiences

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Individuals vigilant about their online footprint and interested in verifying that trackers or hidden third-party connections are truly blocked.

- **Filter List Maintainers:** Developers and maintainers of content blocker filter lists can leverage uBO Scope to monitor how well filters perform, especially on browsers or devices with limited developer tools.

- **Technical Evaluators & Researchers:** Those assessing the effectiveness of content blockers or browser privacy settings, particularly in controlled or restricted browsing environments, where typical inspection tools may be unavailable.

## Use Case Scenarios

### 1. Daily Privacy Checks for End Users

Imagine a user browsing the web with heightened privacy concerns. While they rely on content blockers, how can they be sure which third-party domains they actually connect to?

uBO Scope provides a transparent, accurate count and categorization of remote connections per website. By simply clicking the extension popup, users see a breakdown of:
- Domains that were allowed
- Domains stealth-blocked (redirected or silently blocked)
- Domains outright blocked

This empowers users to spot unexpected or suspicious connections, helping them tune their privacy tools or make informed decisions about the websites they visit.

### 2. Support for Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining filter lists demands testing against real-world network activity. Filter lists evolve as trackers and domains change, so maintainers often need a reliable way to observe browser network behavior.

For maintainers working on devices or environments with limited browser dev tools (e.g., mobile browsers with restricted debugging capabilities), uBO Scope offers an invaluable, standalone view into network requests. It delivers:
- Accurate per-tab connection data
- Categorization independent of other content blockers

This allows maintainers to verify filter efficacy quickly, identify overlooked or new domains, and refine rules more efficiently.

### 3. Technical Analysis in Limited Tool Environments

Certain browsers or platforms restrict access to network details or block extensions from providing network inspection natively. In these cases, traditional developer tools fall short.

uBO Scope assists technical users by exposing network requests via the browser's `webRequest` API, regardless of other blockers or DNS-level filtering. This means:
- Network activity can be audited transparently
- Connection outcomes (allowed, stealth, blocked) are clearly indicated
- Helps validate the network footprint even when usual inspection tools are missing or insufficient

This can be crucial for security analysts, privacy researchers, or browser developers evaluating blocking strategies.

## Why You Should Care

Many users, from casual browser users to advanced filter list maintainers, struggle to verify what actually happens behind the scenes during web navigation. uBO Scope bridges this gap by offering a _factual_, _independent_ report of all network connections tied to a tab.

Unlike ad blocker tests or extension block counts, uBO Scope focuses on the _number and nature of distinct third-party remote servers_ contacted. This helps dispel common misconceptions and provides:

- **Transparency:** Understand the real network footprint beyond surface-level block counts.
- **Confidence:** Verify that your content blocker or privacy setup effectively reduces exposure.
- **Insight:** Identify stealthy connections that silently bypass traditional detection.

## Practical Tips for Getting Started

- **Try uBO Scope alongside your main content blocker.** Observe how the allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked lists reflect your browsing habits.
- **Use uBO Scope to audit new filter rules.** Quickly check if new filters reduce allowed connections without breaking sites.
- **Combine data with other diagnostic tools** when available, but rely on uBO Scope as your ground truth for connection visibility.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t judge content blockers by their block counts alone; focus on third-party distinct domains allowed.
- Avoid relying on 'ad blocker test' sites for evaluating blocking effectiveness—uBO Scope offers more factual insights.
- Understand that some legitimate third-party connections (e.g., CDNs) are normal and often necessary.
