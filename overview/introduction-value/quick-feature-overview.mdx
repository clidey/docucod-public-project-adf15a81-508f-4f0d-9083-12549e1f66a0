# Feature Highlights of uBO Scope

## Real-Time Third-Party Connection Counts

One of uBO Scope's defining features is its ability to instantly report the number of distinct third-party remote servers that a webpage connects to. This count is continuously updated and visible as a badge on the extension's toolbar icon, providing an at-a-glance indicator of the extent of external connections occurring within your browser tab.

Unlike traditional ad blockers or content blockers that merely track blocked requests, uBO Scope focuses on the **distinctiveness and variety** of third-party domains contacted. This clarity helps users understand the true reach of a webpage’s network activity.

**Example:**
- When you visit a webpage, uBO Scope aggregates the count of unique third-party domains contacted, reflecting in the badge number. A lower number suggests fewer external connections, often implying enhanced privacy or less tracking.

## Popup Reporting Interface

uBO Scope offers a clean and intuitive popup that summarizes connection outcomes for the active browser tab. The popup categorizes domains into three clear groups:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains where requests have successfully connected.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains affected by stealth blocking techniques (such as silently redirected or inhibited requests).
- **Blocked:** Domains for which network requests failed or were actively blocked.

This structured breakdown arms users with detailed insights to audit and understand their browsing activity in real time. The popup also displays the main tab hostname prominently, showing visitors exactly which site’s connections are being analyzed.

### How it works:
- When the popup opens, it queries the background service for the current tab’s collected data.
- The interface then dynamically renders a list of domains and counts within each outcome category.


## Independence from Specific Blocking Solutions

uBO Scope maintains functional independence from any particular content blocker or filtering solution, including uBlock Origin itself. Its core relies solely on data collected via the browser's `webRequest` API, ensuring:

- Accurate visibility into all network requests regardless of which content blocker is active.
- No reliance on browser-internal or external blocking heuristics or filters.
- Consistent results even in environments where DNS-level blocking or stealth blocking occurs.

This independence makes uBO Scope a trusted tool for auditing connections without bias or interference, providing an objective picture of network activity.

## Robust Per-Tab Statistics

Each browser tab tracked by uBO Scope maintains its own detailed record of network request outcomes, categorized by domain and hostname. This per-tab granularity enables:

- Precise monitoring of third-party connections throughout your browsing session.
- Separate counts of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Real-time badge updates reflecting changes as new network requests occur and responses resolve.

Under the hood, the background script listens to page-level network events such as redirects, errors, and successful responses, incrementally updating the domain maps for the active tab. This design ensures that users always see the freshest, most relevant data for the tab they're focused on.

## Practical Benefits & User Workflow

Imagine visiting a news website known for heavy third-party integration. With uBO Scope enabled:

1. **Immediate Awareness:** You instantly see a badge number indicating how many distinct third-party domains are contacted.
2. **Deep Dive in Popup:** Clicking the badge opens the popup showing which domains are blocked or allowed, helping you assess if your content blocker is effective.
3. **Investigate Stealth Blocking:** You identify stealth-blocked domains that might otherwise go unnoticed, revealing requests silently redirected or inhibited.
4. **Audit & Compare:** You can repeat this process across sites or content blockers to understand real-world connection patterns.

## Tips for Success

- Pay attention to the badge count as a privacy indicator — fewer distinct third-party connections typically equals reduced tracking surface.
- Use the popup categories to troubleshoot unexpected blocked or stealth-blocked domains that could affect page behavior.
- Remember that not all third-party domains are harmful; many reflect legitimate content delivery networks.
- Refresh the popup for the latest data after actions like page reloads or changes in your content-blocking setup.

## Getting Started Preview

Upon installation, uBO Scope immediately activates and begins collecting data unobtrusively. Opening the popup on any tab reveals detailed stats without needing configuration.

## Technical Overview (for context)

- The badge count reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains seen on the active tab.
- Network requests are tracked via browser webRequest event listeners.
- All observed domains are parsed and aggregated using the Public Suffix List to distinguish domain vs hostname details.
- The popup communicates with the background script to fetch serialized data for the active tab.

### Visual Snapshot of Popup Sections:

- **Header:** Shows the current tab hostname split into subdomain and domain parts.
- **Summary:** Displays the total count of distinct connected domains.
- **Allowed Section:** Lists domains with successful requests.
- **Stealth-Blocked Section:** Lists domains affected by stealth redirects or silent blocking.
- **Blocked Section:** Lists domains with failed or blocked requests.

This layout prioritizes clarity and actionable insights.
