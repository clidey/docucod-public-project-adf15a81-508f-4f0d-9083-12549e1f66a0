# Who is uBO Scope for?

Discover who benefits most from uBO Scope, a specialized browser extension designed to reveal third-party remote server connections made by webpages. This page outlines the primary audiences and showcases typical, real-world use cases that demonstrate the extension's practical value.

---

## Understanding the Target Audience

uBO Scope serves a focused group of users who value transparency and precision in understanding network connections behind the scenes of the web:

- **Privacy-Conscious Users**: Individuals who prioritize online privacy and want clear visibility into every external connection a website initiates.
- **Filter List Maintainers**: Professionals who maintain and curate content blocking filter lists and need an objective tool to audit real third-party connections.
- **Content Blocker Auditors and Analysts**: Users who seek to verify content blocker performance, especially those who want to compare different blockers or debunk misleading metrics.

By catering to these groups, uBO Scope empowers them with precise insights otherwise unavailable through traditional tools.

## Typical Use Cases

### 1. Auditing Actual Connections on a Webpage

A privacy-aware user visits a webpage and wants to see exactly which third-party domains the page tries to connect to, including those allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked by their content blocker. uBO Scope lists these domains with counts, giving clear, concrete data to identify potential privacy risks or unwanted connections.

### 2. Comparing Content Blockers Effectiveness

Filter list maintainers or auditors test different content blockers by observing which third-party connections succeed or are blocked. Unlike vague block count badges, uBO Scope reports the actual distinct third-party domains connected, providing a reliable basis for comparison.

### 3. Demystifying Badge Counts

Users often misinterpret the badge counts from content blockers. uBO Scope explains what these counts mean by enumerating the distinct third-party domains actually connected or blocked, revealing why a lower count is preferable and why block counts alone are misleading.

## Why You Should Care

If you belong to any of the audiences outlined, uBO Scope offers a direct window into understanding web requests in a way that is accurate, unbiased, and practical. It helps you:

- **Gain confidence** in your privacy setup by clearly viewing which remote servers your browser contacts.
- **Improve filter lists** by auditing real connection data rather than relying on synthetic tests.
- **Make informed decisions** in choosing or tuning content blockers based on actual third-party communications, not just raw block counts or test results.

By targeting the key needs of these users, uBO Scope makes web privacy analysis and content blocker validation accessible and trustworthy.

## Practical Tips for Using uBO Scope

- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blockers to see not only what is blocked but also what is allowed or stealth-blocked.
- Focus on the **distinct third-party domains count** reported in the badge — a lower number indicates fewer third-party connections and generally better privacy.
- Leverage uBO Scope in auditing sessions where you need to verify content blocking policies or filter list integrity.
