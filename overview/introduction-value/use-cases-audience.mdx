# Target Audience & Use Cases for uBO Scope

## See Clearly Who Benefits Most from uBO Scope

uBO Scope is designed for anyone who wants crystal-clear visibility into the network connections initiated by the websites they visit. This powerful tool unlocks insights for a range of users—from everyday web surfers curious about tracking to professionals tasked with security and filter list accuracy.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- **General Users:** If you want to understand exactly which third-party domains your browser connects to while browsing, uBO Scope shows every remote server that a webpage attempts to contact—whether blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed. It empowers you to visualize and assess your privacy footprint in real-time.

- **Privacy and Security-Minded Analysts:** Investigate hidden or silent background connections often missed by other tools. Validate the effectiveness of your browser’s blocking mechanisms and spot suspicious or stealthy network activities that may compromise privacy or security.

- **Filter List Maintainers and Blocker Developers:** Gain trustworthy, unbiased metrics of network requests independent of any content blocker. Accurately verify if filters are working as intended across different browsers and environments, even where standard developer tools are inaccessible or unreliable.

## Practical Use Cases: How uBO Scope Supports Your Goals

### 1. Verify Real Blocking Effectiveness

One of the top concerns among users of content blockers is whether their configuration is truly effective. While block counts reported by blockers can be misleading, uBO Scope shows the full story by revealing all remote connections and their outcomes:

- **Blocked:** Requests that your blocker explicitly prevented.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that never reached the network due to stealth techniques.
- **Allowed:** Requests that succeeded and delivered resources.

By comparing these three categories, you can confidently gauge what your filter or blocker allows, exposing any unexpected leaks.

### 2. Validate and Tune Filter Lists

Filter list maintainers can use uBO Scope as an objective monitoring companion:

- Confirm which remote servers are still contacted despite filter settings.
- Identify domains that need better blocking or deserve whitelist consideration.
- Observe cross-browser behavior to ensure filter rules work uniformly.

This helps maintainers refine their rulesets using real-world, browser-agnostic connection data.

### 3. Detect Silent Background Connections and Tracking Attempts

Webpages often establish hidden connections that bypass common detection or blocking strategies. uBO Scope alerts users and analysts to these “silent” or stealth connections, which sometimes evade other tools or blockers.

This transparency supports deeper investigation into tracking networks, fingerprinting attempts, and privacy threats.

### 4. Debunk Common Myths About Block Counts and Testing

Traditional metrics such as toolbar block counts or so-called "ad blocker test" sites often mislead:

- A high block count does not guarantee better privacy; it may indicate more third-party domains contacted overall.
- "Ad blocker test" pages simulate unrealistic network requests, producing unreliable results.

uBO Scope provides raw, unfiltered data that can clarify these misunderstandings by visualizing the real connections your browser attempts.

## Before and After uBO Scope

| Scenario                            | Without uBO Scope                      | With uBO Scope                           |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Understanding your privacy status | Guesswork and incomplete domain lists| Clear, precise list of third-party domains contacted |
| Assessing blocker performance     | Misleading block counts and test sites | Transparent breakdown of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections |
| Detecting stealthy network calls  | Silent, undetected background requests | Visibility into all network attempts, including hidden ones |
| Filter list tuning                | Difficult trial and error             | Informed, data-driven filter adjustments |

## Getting Started with Your Use Cases

Begin exploring uBO Scope by simply installing the extension and visiting your favorite sites. Watch the badge icon’s count update and open the popup interface to see categorized connection results.

Depending on your persona:

- General users: Learn which third-party domains are contacted during everyday browsing.
- Analysts: Investigate any suspicious or stealthy connections using the detailed network request breakdown.
- Filter maintainers: Cross-reference connection counts and domain lists to improve blocking rules.

## Tips for Maximizing uBO Scope

- **Regularly check the popup interface:** It refreshes with each tab, showing real-time data on connections.

- **Interpret badge counts wisely:** A lower badge count indicates fewer distinct third-party servers contacted, which is usually better for privacy.

- **Use alongside your blocker:** uBO Scope does not block connections but reports them. Use the insight to adjust your blockers or filters.

- **Be cautious with "ad blocker test" pages:** Trust uBO Scope’s raw connection data over synthetic tests.

- **For maintainers:** Use uBO Scope in environments where devtools are unavailable or restricted, such as mobile browsers.


## Summary

By making the invisible visible, uBO Scope empowers users, analysts, and filter maintainers alike to understand and control their web connectivity landscape. It provides clarity, trustworthiness, and actionable insight into network requests across all browsers in a lightweight, user-friendly extension.
