# Who is uBO Scope For?

Discover if uBO Scope fits your needs by understanding the three main user personas who gain the most from this extension—and why. Whether you care deeply about online privacy, power-user insights, or filter list maintenance, uBO Scope provides clear, factual network visibility to empower your decisions.

## Understanding the Core Audiences

### 1. Privacy-Conscious Individuals

If you prioritize control over your online footprint, uBO Scope serves as an indispensable tool. It reveals every third-party remote server your browser tries to connect to—whether these connections are blocked, allowed, or stealth-blocked by content blockers or other network mechanisms.

- **What You Achieve:** Complete transparency on your browsing activity related to remote connections.
- **Why It Matters:** Often, privacy-focused users want to verify that their content blockers or DNS filters are doing their job effectively.
- **Real Scenario:** Before visiting an online news site, you can quickly see if any unwanted third-party trackers are being contacted, allowing you to adjust your privacy tools accordingly.

### 2. Power Users and Developers

For users who demand a deeper understanding of browser network activity, including web developers and security researchers, uBO Scope offers objective insight.

- **What You Achieve:** A precise view of network request outcomes independent of blocking tools.
- **Why It Matters:** Block counts or test pages can be misleading; seeing the actual connections grouped by domain and status (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked) gives you factual context.
- **Real Scenario:** When testing a site’s resource loads, you can differentiate between successful connections and those silently redirected or blocked, improving debugging and analysis.

### 3. Filter List Maintainers

If you maintain or contribute to filter lists for content blockers, uBO Scope is a practical tool, especially on devices or setups with limited access to browser developer tools.

- **What You Achieve:** Access to raw network connection data associated with each tab, helping you validate filter rules.
- **Why It Matters:** It brings network-level insight that supports research, validation, and maintenance efforts without interfering with ongoing content blocking logic.
- **Real Scenario:** When assessing the impact of a new filter rule, you observe the outcome on actual third-party connections live in the browser, facilitating precise adjustments.

## Top Use Cases

### Network Transparency

- Users gain an accurate count and list of all third-party hosts contacted by a webpage, demystifying what content blockers allow or block.
- Enables confirmation that blocking tools are not missing obscure or stealthy connections.

### Filter Validation

- Filter list maintainers can inspect live connection outcomes to verify if their filters are effective, without relying solely on log files or browser dev tools.
- Facilitates targeted research into domains responsible for unwanted content.

### Debunking Misleading Metrics

- Disputes common myths such as “higher block count means better blocking” by focusing on distinct remote server connections, which is a more meaningful measure.
- Challenges unreliable “ad blocker test” pages by providing grounded, browser-reported connection data.

## Practical Tips for Users

- **Check your badge count frequently:** The badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains with successful connections, helping you quickly assess a page’s network reach.
- **Use the popup panel to explore connections:** See domains grouped by allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked outcomes.
- **Pair with content blockers:** uBO Scope complements rather than replaces content blockers—it shines by showing what happens behind the scenes regardless of blocker settings.

## Getting Started

If you identify with any of the above personas or use cases, installing uBO Scope from your browser’s extension store is the first step. After installation:

1. Observe the badge icon as you browse to monitor third-party domain connections at a glance.
2. Click the icon to open the popup panel for detailed connection reporting per open tab.
3. Explore related documentation sections to deepen your understanding:

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Don’t rely solely on block counts:** A high block count badge might mean more connections were made overall, not less — uBO Scope shows you the actual distinct domains contacted.
- **Avoid using “ad blocker test” pages as benchmarks:** These do not reflect real-world network behavior and can misrepresent an extension’s effectiveness.
- **Remember uBO Scope depends on browser network APIs:** Some requests made outside those APIs cannot be detected, so understand your browser’s limitations.
