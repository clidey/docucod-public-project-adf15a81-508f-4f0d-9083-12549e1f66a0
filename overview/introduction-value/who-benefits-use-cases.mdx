# Who is uBO Scope for?

uBO Scope is designed with a focused and discerning audience in mind — those who demand transparency, control, and insight into the web's underlying network connections. This page explains who benefits most from uBO Scope, outlines practical scenarios where it becomes indispensable, and clarifies why this extension is a vital tool for privacy, verification, and auditing.

## Privacy-Conscious Users

If you care deeply about your online privacy, you want to know exactly which third-party servers your browser communicates with when you visit a website. uBO Scope provides a straightforward, no-nonsense way to see every remote connection attempted or made — regardless of what content blockers or DNS filters you use.

- **Experience full transparency:** Instead of relying on opaque block counts or promises, you get a clear count and list of unique third-party domains contacted.
- **Validate your setup:** Confirm that your blockers are actually reducing exposure to third-party tracking networks by watching the badge count and the detailed domain list.
- **Understand real exposure:** Identify the legitimate third-party domains (like CDN providers) versus the unexpected ones.


## Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining or curating filter lists requires detailed knowledge of real-world network traffic and how it interacts with various blocking rules.

- **Audit filter efficacy:** Use uBO Scope to observe which domains actually get loaded or blocked, and how stealth blocking occurs.
- **Verify stealth blocking:** The extension highlights connections that were stealthily blocked (hidden to avoid web page breakage or detection), a key insight for evaluating nuanced filter lists.
- **Operate with limited access:** On devices that lack direct access to browser developer tools, uBO Scope offers an invaluable alternative for monitoring third-party requests.


## Users Seeking Transparency on Web Resource Fetching

Not all users are privacy experts, filter list maintainers, or network analysts, but many want to regain control and understanding about what their browser does behind the scenes.

- **Debunk myths about content blockers:** Don’t be misled by block counts or unreliable ad-block “test” pages. uBO Scope helps you see the reality of third-party network connections, cutting through misleading metrics.
- **Educate yourself:** Learn which external resources your favorite websites load, and how different blockers or DNS filters affect these connections.
- **Stay informed:** Gain confidence in your browsing environment by continuously monitoring network interactions per tab.

## Common Scenarios Where uBO Scope Becomes Invaluable

1. **Evaluating a new content blocker** by comparing the number of third-party servers contacted with and without it.
2. **Auditing stealth blocking techniques** used by advanced filter lists to confirm they hide certain block actions without visible blocking counts.
3. **Verifying the accuracy of privacy-focused DNS filtering** by ensuring uBO Scope reports all network requests observable by the browser.
4. **Comparing user experiences** across devices, especially where developer tools are unavailable, by exporting third-party connection data.
5. **Following the third-party footprint** of complex web applications that routinely load content from numerous providers, identifying potentially unwanted or harmful domains.

## Why This Audience Cares

Every user intent behind uBO Scope comes down to a clear goal: **uncover, understand, and control** the reach of third-party content on the web.

- A privacy user minimizes their digital footprint.
- A filter list maintainer improves blocking precision and stealth.
- A curious user gains confidence and avoids misinformation.

By reporting on the actual domains contacted — not just blocked counts or fabricated tests — uBO Scope fills a crucial transparency gap.

## Example Use Case

Imagine Sarah, a privacy-conscious user, installs various content blockers and DNS filters. She notices confusing reports about how effective each blocker is because of their block count badges and ad blocker test pages. Using uBO Scope, Sarah checks the actual number of distinct third-party domains loaded per website. She quickly understands which blockers genuinely reduce exposure and which might show inflated block counts but allow more third-party connections, empowering her to choose the right tools.

Similarly, Alex, who maintains a filter list, uses uBO Scope to test new rules on stealth blocking. He verifies that certain connections are silently blocked without altering typical block counts, ensuring a balance between protection and website functionality.

## Summary

uBO Scope is crafted for:

- Privacy enthusiasts eager to see exact network connections
- Filter list developers auditing blocking behavior
- Users seeking real transparency beyond misleading block metrics

It excels in real-world verification scenarios, debunking myths and providing trustworthy insights into third-party web resource fetching.
