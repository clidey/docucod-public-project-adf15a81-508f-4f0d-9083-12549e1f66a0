# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Unmatched Visibility Into Webpage Network Connections

uBO Scope is a specialized browser extension designed to give you unparalleled insight into every attempted and successful connection your browser makes to remote servers when you visit any web page. Unlike typical content blockers that primarily focus on blocked requests, uBO Scope tracks distinct third-party remote servers, giving you a clearer, more accurate count of external network activity.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You

Web browsing today involves connections to many external servers, some essential, some tracking or advertising related, and others potentially malicious. Understanding exactly which third-party servers your browser talks to helps you take control of your privacy and security.

uBO Scope’s badge count—the number displayed on the extension icon—shows the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** connected to by the active webpage. This approach emphasizes real exposure over just blocked requests, helping you grasp your true network footprint.

### Key Value Propositions

- **Complete Network Request Visibility:** See all remote server connections attempted or made by any web page, regardless of what blockers you may have enabled.
- **Distinct Third-Party Server Counting:** The badge count tracks unique third-party domains, not merely the number of blocked items, offering a clearer snapshot of external connections.
- **Extends Beyond Content Blockers:** Works independently of blocking extensions or DNS-level filtering, reporting what the browser truly attempts or completes.
- **Myth-Busting Capability:** Helps dispel common misconceptions about content blockers’ effectiveness by focusing on actual network activity.
- **Useful for Power Users and Maintainers:** Offers valuable insights for users aiming to minimize third-party exposure and for filter list maintainers seeking real-world validation.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- **Privacy-Conscious Internet Users:** Gain transparency on external servers your browser is connecting to.
- **Security-Aware Individuals:** Quickly identify unexpected or suspicious third-party connections.
- **Content Blocker Users & Evaluators:** Understand the real impact of your content blockers beyond block counts.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Validate and enhance blocking lists with concrete data on network requests.

## Understanding uBO Scope

### What uBO Scope Is

uBO Scope is a browser extension that listens to your browser’s network activity—specifically through the `webRequest` API—and records details about every remote server it attempts to connect to or successfully connects with during webpage loading. It then organizes this data and presents it to you through a clear, simple interface.

### What Problem Does It Solve?

Typical content blockers often report how many requests they block, but this doesn’t reliably reflect how many distinct external servers your browser is actually talking to. This metric can be misleading: blocking many requests might coexist with connecting to a large variety of servers.

uBO Scope solves this by focusing on **unique third-party domains contacted** rather than just blocked request counts. Its goal is to provide an honest, transparent measurement of exposure to external domains, helping you better assess privacy and security risks.

### How It Works (At a High Level)

- It uses the browser’s `webRequest` API to listen to network events including redirects, successful responses, and connection errors.
- It categorizes each third-party connection attempt by outcome: allowed (successful), stealth (redirected), or blocked (failed).
- The extension maintains a session-per-tab record of these connections to track distinct remote servers involved.
- The toolbar badge updates dynamically to show the number of distinct allowed third-party domains per tab.
- Clicking the extension icon reveals detailed lists of connected domains along with counts, grouped by the outcome of those connection attempts.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

- **Independence from Content Blockers:** It reports network attempts regardless of what content blocker is used, including blockers acting at the DNS level or via stealth techniques.
- **Focus on Third-Party Domains, Not Just Requests:** This domain-level view means you see a more meaningful measurement of external exposure.
- **Transparency & Truthfulness:** It debunks common but inaccurate beliefs about blockers and test pages by showing what really happens.
- **Simple & Lightweight:** Provides crucial insight without complexity or heavy features.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine you visit a news website. Your browser might fetch the main content, images, and scripts from the site itself (first-party), but there may be dozens of third-party servers contacted—ad networks, analytics providers, content delivery networks, social media widgets, etc.

Without uBO Scope, you might rely on content blockers’ block counts or misleading test pages to judge your exposure. With uBO Scope, you see exactly how many distinct third-party domains your browser truly communicates with—both those blocked and those loaded successfully.

This information helps you decide whether you need stricter blocking or verified allowlists for sites you trust.

## Practical Usage Tips

- **Check the Badge Count Frequently:** A lower number means fewer distinct third-party servers are contacted, which often correlates with better privacy.
- **Use uBO Scope With Your Content Blocker:** Complement your blocker with uBO Scope to get a truthful view of network activity.
- **Review Domain Lists in the Popup:** By clicking the extension icon, inspect which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- **Understand That Not All Third-Parties Are Bad:** Some domains like CDNs are essential and typically have low counts; focus on unusual spikes.
- **Use As a Diagnostic Tool:** If you notice unexpected network activity, consider tightening your blocking rules or investigating further.

## Troubleshooting & Limitations

- **The Extension Relies on `webRequest` API:** Network requests outside this API’s scope, such as those made by certain browser internals or proxies, will not be visible.
- **Depends on Browser Permissions:** Proper permissions must be granted for full URL access.
- **Badge May Not Update Immediately:** The extension batches network events with a slight delay (about 1 second) to optimize performance.
- **Count Reflects Distinct Domains, Not Number of Requests:** Multiple requests to the same domain count once.
