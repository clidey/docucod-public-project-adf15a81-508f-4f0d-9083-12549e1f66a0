## Ideal Users

uBO Scope is crafted with distinct user groups in mind, who benefit most from its detailed network connection insights:

- **Privacy-Conscious Individuals:**
  Users who prioritize understanding and controlling what information leaves their browser will find uBO Scope invaluable. By revealing every connection attempt to third-party servers, it empowers these users to maintain greater transparency and confidence in their browsing environment.

- **Filter List Maintainers:**
  Those who develop or maintain content blocking filter lists can leverage uBO Scope to observe network behavior under realistic conditions. It provides a practical, real-world tool to verify the efficacy of rules, identify stealthy connections, and optimize lists for better blocking performance.

- **Tech-Savvy Users and Researchers:**
  Enthusiasts, developers, and security researchers who want a granular view of the web's network activity will appreciate uBO Scope’s transparency. It offers direct insights into which third-party servers are contacted, regardless of which content blockers are active.

- **Anyone Interested in Accurate Transparency for Browser Network Requests:**
  This includes users troubleshooting website behavior, security analysts assessing third-party reach, or curious individuals verifying their content blockers’ impact beyond superficial metrics.

## Common Use Cases

uBO Scope excels in real-world scenarios that focus on clarity, trust, and validation:

- **Verifying the Effectiveness of Blockers:**
  Use uBO Scope to see which third-party connections your content blocker actually allows or blocks. The extension cuts through misleading block counts and shows the true picture — the number of distinct remote third-party servers contacted.

  > For example, after installing a content blocker, open uBO Scope to compare whether the count of allowed connections aligns with your expectations. This direct feedback is essential since high block counts don’t always indicate better blocking.

- **Debunking Ad Blocker Myths:**
  Many content blockers deliberately work stealthily to avoid detection or breaking sites. uBO Scope exposes the reality behind misleading metrics like exaggerated block counts or fake test pages that misrepresent blocker effectiveness.

  > When encountering claims like “Blocker A reports higher blocks than Blocker B, so it’s better,” uBO Scope clarifies this misconception by showing the real distinct third-party servers from which content was fetched.

- **Supporting Research and Troubleshooting Efforts:**
  Whether you’re developing browser extensions, contributing to filter lists, or diagnosing unexpected network calls on a website, uBO Scope provides immediate visibility into network requests and their outcomes (allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked).

  > For instance, filter list maintainers on devices with limited browser tooling access can rely on uBO Scope to audit network connections and improve their filter rules.

- It distinguishes between allowed, stealth-blocked, and fully blocked connections, giving a clear picture of network activity.
- It helps you reason beyond simple numbers, grounding decisions in concrete data.

By understanding who should use uBO Scope and why, you position yourself to get the most out of this extension’s power to reveal, verify, and debunk assumptions about your browser’s network activity.
