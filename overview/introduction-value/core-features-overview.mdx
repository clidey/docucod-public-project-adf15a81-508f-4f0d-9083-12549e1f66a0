# Core Features at a Glance

uBO Scope elevates your understanding of web page network activity by providing clear, actionable insights into every remote server connection attempt during your browsing sessions. Unlike generic network monitors, uBO Scope distills complex network traffic into meaningful categories and visual cues, designed for privacy-aware users, content blocker users, and filter list maintainers.

## What You See at a Glance

### Badge Counts Reflect Real Third-Party Exposure

The toolbar icon badge dynamically displays the count of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connects to on the active tab. This immediate visual feedback helps you gauge the extent of third-party network exposure without diving into technical logs.

> **Why badge counts matter:**
> A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, often reflecting tighter privacy. This contrasts with mere block counts seen in other blockers, which can be misleading.

### Tab-Specific Network Measurements

Each browser tab is tracked independently, recognizing that network requests vary per web page. uBO Scope isolates these requests by domain and hostname into three clear categories:

- **Allowed:** Third-party servers from which connections successfully completed.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections that were redirected or blocked by stealth techniques, invisible to the web page.
- **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked network requests.

This per-tab granularity allows you to understand not just if third-party connections exist, but also their nature and outcome.

### Cross-Browser Support

uBO Scope is designed to work seamlessly across major browsers, including Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari. It leverages each browser’s `webRequest` API to operate independently of content blocker implementations or DNS filtering. This ensures consistent access to raw network activity regardless of your browser choice.

## How uBO Scope Stands Out

- **Unfiltered network transparency:** Unlike some blockers that mask certain requests or rely on content filtering alone, uBO Scope reports _every_ network connection attempt visible to the browser.
- **Accurate measurement vs myth-busting:** It debunks misleading metrics like block counts or fake "ad blocker test" pages by focusing on concrete third-party domain connections.
- **User-centered design:** Information is presented in an intuitive panel with domain names and counts rather than raw technical data, making insights accessible.

## Real-World User Scenario

Imagine opening a news website. The badge on uBO Scope’s toolbar instantly updates to show the number of distinct third-party servers involved. In the popup panel, you see some domains under “not blocked” (allowed), which typically represent essential CDNs, while others might be stealth-blocked or fully blocked. This immediate insight lets you understand the actual network footprint of the site and validate your content blocker’s effectiveness beyond superficial block counts.

## Key Features Summary

| Feature                     | Description                                                                         | User Benefit                                  |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Badge Count**             | Displays the number of unique third-party domains connected to on the active tab.    | Quick at-a-glance privacy gauge                |
| **Per-Tab Details**         | Tracks allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains separately in each tab’s context.| Precise understanding of network activity     |
| **Domain Grouping**         | Aggregates network requests by domain and hostname for clarity.                      | Easier interpretation of complex data         |
| **Stealth Blocking Detection**| Identifies redirect or stealth-block network request outcomes distinctly.          | Exposes hidden filtering not visible to pages |
| **Cross-Browser Compatibility**| Supports Chromium, Firefox, Safari using standardized APIs.                      | Consistent experience regardless of browser   |

## Practical Tips

- **Monitor badge counts while browsing:** Use the badge as your privacy health indicator—sudden spikes may indicate unwanted third-party scripts.
- **Explore per-tab popup details:** Click the toolbar icon to view categorized domains, helping identify legitimate third parties vs. trackers.
- **Compare with your content blocker:** Validate actual blocking results independently to avoid misleading statistics found elsewhere.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Badge counts **do not** directly represent all blocked requests or total network calls—only distinct third-party domains connected.
- Some browser network activity not exposed through `webRequest` API (e.g., service worker fetches) cannot be tracked.
- Stealth-blocking detection depends on interpreting redirects and errors reported by the browser; not all stealth may be identifiable if browser APIs limit visibility.
