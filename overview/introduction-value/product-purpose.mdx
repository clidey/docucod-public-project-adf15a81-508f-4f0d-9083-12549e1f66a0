# What is uBO Scope?

## See Every Remote Server Your Browser Contacts

uBO Scope is a straightforward browser extension designed to give you complete visibility into all network connections your browser attempts or completes when loading webpages. Unlike typical content blockers that focus on filtering content, uBO Scope empowers you to **understand exactly which third-party servers are contacted**, independently of content blockers or DNS configurations.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You

- **Transparency:** Instantly reveal the full scope of third-party connections made by the sites you visit, providing insight into data flow beyond what typical blockers show.
- **Independence:** Works alongside any content blocker or DNS filtering setup because it listens directly to the browser’s network request events.
- **Control:** Helps you make informed decisions about your online privacy by exposing the actual remote servers behind embedded content.
- **Verification:** Useful for filter list maintainers, privacy advocates, and curious users who want to validate what is actually happening in-browser.

### Who Benefits from uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users monitoring third-party requests
- Filter list creators needing detailed connection data
- Security professionals analyzing web traffic patterns
- Anyone curious about the unseen interactions happening when browsing

## What Exactly is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight extension that passively observes all network requests made via your browser's `webRequest` API. It tracks each attempted and successful connection to remote servers and categorizes the outcomes, allowing you to see which third-party domains are:

- **Allowed:** Successfully connected without blocking
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections that were redirected or hidden by other blockers
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed due to blocking events

This holistic reporting works regardless of what content blockers or DNS filters you use because it relies solely on the browser’s internal web request monitoring, making it a universal transparency tool.

### How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Browsing Experience

Rather than interfering or modifying content, uBO Scope simply records and exposes information about network activity. It reacts to browser events about network requests to build a map of the domains contacted by every webpage in real time.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique

- **Browser Agnostic Detection:** Compatible with Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers (with minimum version requirements), it uses native network monitoring to reveal connections.
- **Third-Party Focus:** Highlights domains outside the first-party website, helping identify external content and trackers.
- **Minimal Configuration:** No complicated setup needed; install and immediately start observing connections.
- **Comprehensive Results:** Counts distinct third-party server domains contacted, not just requests or blocked count, offering a clear metric of network exposure.

|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Network Observation** | Continuously listens to and records requests made by webpages via the browser’s `webRequest` API.            |
| **Outcome Categorization** | Sorts connections into Allowed, Stealth-blocked (redirected), and Blocked, based on request events.          |
| **Domain Aggregation**  | Maps hostnames to higher-level domains to count unique third-party servers involved in a browsing session.    |
| **Session Persistence** | Stores browsing session data locally to maintain connection state across tabs and reloads.                    |
| **User Interface Display** | Presents data in an easy-to-read popup listing contacted domains and their connection status.                  |

## How It Works Under the Hood (At a User Level)

When you browse the web with uBO Scope installed:

1. As each webpage loads and makes network requests, uBO Scope listens to the browser’s internal notifications about those requests.
2. It extracts the hostname of each requested resource and determines the domain.
3. Each request’s outcome—whether it succeeded, was redirected, or blocked—is recorded.
4. The extension builds an evolving list of distinct third-party domains contacted during your browsing session.
5. The toolbar icon displays a badge number reflecting the count of these unique allowed servers.
6. Clicking the extension icon reveals a popup that breaks down the connections into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories.

This process happens transparently without interfering with your browsing or requiring additional permissions beyond network monitoring.

## Real-World Scenarios: Why You Should Care

Imagine you visit a news website. Although it appears normal, under the hood your browser contacts a dozen third-party domains—advertisers, trackers, content delivery networks, analytics servers. Without visibility, you remain unaware of this data sharing.

With uBO Scope:

- You instantly see all those connections broken down by type.
- You verify the effectiveness of content blockers or DNS filters you use by checking if those third parties are truly blocked or still allowed.
- You avoid misleading metrics from simplistic "block count" badges by focusing on the number of distinct domains contacted.

Before uBO Scope, your browser was a black box. Now, it’s a glass box.

## Getting Started Preview

Starting with uBO Scope is quick and intuitive:

- **Install the extension** from your browser’s official add-on store.
- **Browse websites as usual.** The extension does the rest, offering live insight.
- **Click the toolbar icon** to open the popup and explore the list of contacted domains.
- **Monitor the badge count** to track distinct third-party connections at a glance.

## Practical Tips

- A **lower badge count means fewer distinct third-party servers accessed**, generally indicating tighter privacy.
- Use uBO Scope to **verify your content blocker’s performance**, focusing on allowed connections rather than just blocked requests.
- If you see unexpected third-party domains, consider tightening your filters or investigating further.
- Remember that not all third parties are harmful; some, like CDNs, are essential for performance.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

- **Why might some network requests not appear in uBO Scope?** 
  uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API. Some browser features or extensions might initiate network requests outside this scope, which will not be tracked.

- **Does uBO Scope block anything?**
  No. It is an observational tool only and does not alter network traffic.

- **Can I use uBO Scope alongside other content blockers?**
  Absolutely. It is designed to work independently and coexist with any blocking solutions.

## Summary

uBO Scope provides unmatched transparency into the hidden network activity of webpages by reporting all remote server connections your browser makes, regardless of existing content blockers or DNS setups. It shifts your control from guesswork to clear, factual insight, letting you monitor and understand third-party data flows effortlessly.
