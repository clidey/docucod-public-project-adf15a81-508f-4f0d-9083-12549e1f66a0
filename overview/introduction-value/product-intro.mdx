# What is uBO Scope?

## Empowering Users with Full Visibility of Remote Connections

uBO Scope is a lightweight, browser extension designed to bring unparalleled transparency to your web browsing experience. It provides real-time visibility into every remote server connection initiated by your active browser tab — including those allowed, stealth-blocked, and outright blocked.

By focusing exclusively on network connections, uBO Scope empowers you to better understand the web’s infrastructure beneath the surface, helping you identify third-party resources and server interactions that affect your privacy, security, and browsing performance.

## At a Glance: Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Comprehensive Connection Insight**: See every remote endpoint your browser communicates with on a per-tab basis, regardless of whether it was blocked or allowed.
- **User-Focused Transparency**: Gain the knowledge needed to make informed decisions about your browser’s network behavior and third-party exposure.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Runs seamlessly in the background without slowing down your browsing experience.
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Compatible with Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari (with specific platform adjustments).
- **Complementary to Content Blockers**: Works alongside uBlock Origin and other blockers to provide visibility rather than control.

## What Exactly Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension that tracks and reports all outbound network connections initiated by your browser tabs. Unlike conventional content blockers that focus on blocking or filtering requests, uBO Scope’s mission is to illuminate every attempted connection to external servers — whether those requests are allowed, stealthily blocked without notifying the page, or outright blocked.

It is ideal for users who want to peek behind the curtain of web page operation, detect tracking or unwanted third-party connections, and verify their content blocking configurations.

## The Problem uBO Scope Solves

Webpages today routinely load resources from multiple external domains, often imposing hidden tracking and privacy risks. While content blockers reduce unwanted connections, users lack tools that clearly report what connections occur or are blocked in real time. This leaves a critical gap in browser-based network transparency.

uBO Scope fills this gap by:

- Amplifying user awareness about the exact network connections related to each open tab.
- Differentiating connections by their outcome: allowed, stealth-blocked (invisible to the page), and blocked.
- Offering insight crucial for privacy-conscious users to audit third-party resource exposure.

## How uBO Scope Works

When installed, uBO Scope runs quietly as a browser extension that monitors the active browser tab’s network requests. It collects data on all remote connections, categorizing them by their outcome. This data is then presented in an intuitive popup interface that runs within the browser, showing domains and count of interactions.

The extension leverages native browser APIs for web requests, storage, and tab management to retrieve, process, and display data efficiently and securely, without interfering with normal browsing.

## Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- **Privacy Advocates**: Discover and audit third-party trackers and data collectors linked to every webpage.
- **Security-Conscious Users**: Identify suspicious or unexpected remote connections.
- **Developers and Testers**: Evaluate network behavior of their websites or apps in detail.
- **Content Blocker Users**: Gain clarity on how their blockers affect network connections with a real-time report.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine browsing an e-commerce website. While you focus on the product details, the site silently loads ads, analytics trackers, and other third-party resources from numerous domains. With uBO Scope, you instantly see a list of every domain contacted, along with whether requests were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, giving you the power to understand and control your exposure.
