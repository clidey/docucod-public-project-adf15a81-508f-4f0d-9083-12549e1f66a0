# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Server Connection Made by Webpages

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to transparently reveal all connections—whether attempted, successful, or blocked—that a web page makes to remote servers. Unlike typical content blockers that focus primarily on blocking, uBO Scope focuses on providing a clear and factual report of network request outcomes, enabling you to understand the complete network footprint of any webpage.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

Web users often have little visibility into what external servers their browser contacts while browsing a website. This lack of transparency can obscure tracking, advertising, or other third-party interactions. uBO Scope shines a light on these connections, offering clarity about which servers are reached, how many distinct third-party domains are involved, and exactly what happened to each network request.

### Key Benefits of uBO Scope
- **Complete Network Visibility:** See every remote server connection that your browser attempts or successfully makes while loading a given web page.
- **Outcome Categorization:** Understand which connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or completely blocked.
- **Independent of Content Blockers:** Reports all network request outcomes regardless of your active content blocking settings or DNS-based blocking.
- **Factual and Objective:** Provides truthful, unbiased data on network activity without speculative interpretation.
- **Easy-to-Use Popup UI:** Quickly access a summary and detailed breakdown of connected domains per active browser tab.

### Intended Audience
This extension is ideal for privacy-conscious web users, security researchers, filter list maintainers, and anyone curious about the third-party network activity triggered by the websites they visit.

## What Exactly is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension that listens to your browser's network requests in real-time and provides a clear, categorized report of all connections made to remote servers from any open web page. It bridges the gap between what typical content blockers show you and what your browser actually does under the hood.

### What Problem Does uBO Scope Solve?

While traditional content blockers focus on preventing unwanted network requests, they often leave you guessing about what connections are happening, which ones are blocked, and what impact that has on your browsing experience. uBO Scope answers these questions by revealing all network interaction attempts with an emphasis on factual data rather than filters or subjective assessments.

### How Does it Work (At a Glance)?

- uBO Scope uses the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor outgoing network requests.
- Every request is recorded with information such as the hostname contacted and the request outcome.
- Outcomes are grouped into three intuitive categories: allowed (not blocked), stealth-blocked (blocked but without a visible trace), and blocked.
- An icon badge displays the count of distinct third-party domains contacted per tab, offering an immediate privacy snapshot.
- A popup user interface uses this data to provide a detailed, domain-level view for the active tab.

This mechanism ensures that you gain comprehensive insight into network activity without needing to dig deep into browser tools or logs.

## Key Features & How They Empower You

### 1. Real-Time Network Connection Reporting
uBO Scope continuously monitors network activity, capturing every remote server contact attempt. You instantly see:
- The number of unique domains connected.
- Which connections succeeded, failed, or were stealthily blocked.

*Example:* While visiting a news website, you can verify if the number of third-party trackers is higher than expected.

### 2. Clear Categorization of Outcomes
Connections are grouped into:
- **Not Blocked:** Requests that succeeded and resources loaded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests blocked in a manner invisible to the web page but detected by uBO Scope.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked.

This classification exposes the true behavior of your content blockers and helps debunk myths around blocking statistics.

### 3. Toolbar Badge with Domain Counts
The toolbar icon displays the count of distinct connected third-party domains for the active tab, providing a privacy quick check — a lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections.

### 4. Intuitive Popup Interface
The popup UI breaks down connections by domain, showing counts of individual requests per domain for each outcome category.

### 5. Compatibility Across Browsers
Supported on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers, uBO Scope integrates seamlessly using platform-specific APIs with minimal user setup.

## Why You Should Care

### Reveal Hidden Connections and Enhance Privacy Awareness
Many websites interact with multiple third-party services invisibly. uBO Scope makes these visible, empowering you to:
- Detect unexpected tracking or resource loading.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of your content blocker or privacy setup.

### Debunk Common Misconceptions
- A higher block count doesn't mean better blocking. uBO Scope helps you see if more domains are contacted despite higher block numbers.
- 'Ad-blocker test' websites can be misleading; uBO Scope provides real, practical network outcomes on actual web usage.

### Support Filter List Maintainers
uBO Scope’s transparent reporting aids filter list creators in understanding what is actually contacted on different sites, especially on devices or browsers with limited tooling.

### Save Time and Increase Confidence
With a straightforward UI and objective data, you can quickly identify issues or validate privacy setups without deep technical knowledge.

<Accordion title="Common User Scenario: Understanding a Site's Network Connections">
For example, you visit example.com wanting to understand which third-party domains it contacts. By clicking the uBO Scope icon, you see the total number of connected domains in the badge. Opening the popup, you see exactly which domains were contacted, which ones were blocked or stealth-blocked, alongside counts of requests per domain. This insight can reveal unwanted trackers or validate your existing content blockers' effectiveness.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Best Practices & Tips">
- Check the badge count regularly to monitor your browsing privacy.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to verify actual network behavior.
- Remember that not all third parties are harmful; pay attention to legitimate domains such as content delivery networks (CDNs).
- Avoid relying on block count icons alone to assess blocker quality.
- If you have custom filter lists, use uBO Scope's insights to adjust and improve them.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
- If you see 'NO DATA' in the popup, ensure you have navigated to a fully loaded page.
- Verify that the extension has permissions to access webRequest (reinstall if necessary).
- Some network requests outside browser reach won’t be visible; uBO Scope relies on the browser's webRequest API.
- High domain counts may be due to real trackers; cross-reference with your blocker settings.
