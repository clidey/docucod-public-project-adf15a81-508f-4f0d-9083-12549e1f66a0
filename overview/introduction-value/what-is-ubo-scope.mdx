# What is uBO Scope?

## Illuminating Every Remote Connection Your Browser Makes

Webpages communicate with servers behind the scenes all the time—loading images, data, scripts, ads, analytics, and more. But how often do you get a clear view of every remote connection a webpage tries to make? uBO Scope exists to change this.

This browser extension shines a bright, unwavering light on every remote server connection initiated by the webpages you visit. Whether those connections succeed, fail, are redirected, or even stealthily blocked by other filters, uBO Scope reports them.

## Transparency Without Complexity

While many tools attempt to monitor network requests, uBO Scope stands apart in its simplicity and transparency. It works harmoniously alongside any content blocker or DNS-based filtering solution, complementing your existing privacy and security setup—no conflicts, no hidden behaviors.

Just install uBO Scope on supported browsers, and instantly gain a reliable window into your browser's network activity on a per-tab basis.

## Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Complete Visibility:** Gain clear insights into every attempted connection to remote servers, uncovering both allowed and blocked third-party communications.
- **Independence from Blockers:** It accurately reports network requests regardless of which content blocker or DNS solution you use, because it listens to the browser's own network request API.
- **Better Understanding of Privacy Impact:** Instead of fixating on block counts, understand the real measure of privacy: the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connects to.
- **Myth Busting:** Dispel common misconceptions about content blockers and ad blocker test pages with real-world network data.

## How uBO Scope Works at a Glance

uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor all network requests issued by webpages. It records the fate of each request—whether it was allowed, stealth-blocked, redirected, or denied—and aggregates this information per tab.

This data is then surfaced through the extension's toolbar icon badge and popup UI, giving you at-a-glance metrics and detailed domain-level breakdowns.

Because it taps directly into the browser's request lifecycle, uBO Scope can reliably report on network activity regardless of any in-browser or external DNS filtering, ensuring trustworthiness.

<Tip>
Remember, a lower badge count in uBO Scope indicates fewer distinct third-party connections, which often means better privacy.

## Scenario: Understanding Third-Party Connections on a News Website

Imagine visiting a popular news site. Many third-party resources—from ad networks, content delivery networks (CDNs), and analytics providers—might load silently. With uBO Scope, you see exactly how many unique remote servers the page connects to, even when some requests are blocked or redirected by other content blockers. This clarity helps you assess your real privacy exposure beyond simple block counts.

## Supported Browsers and Integration

uBO Scope integrates seamlessly with Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari, each supported by manifest files specifying necessary permissions such as `webRequest`, `storage`, and active tab access.

No matter your preferred content blocker, uBO Scope works alongside to give you network transparency.
