# What is uBO Scope?

Discover the power of uBO Scope — a focused browser extension designed to give you complete clarity on all the remote server connections initiated by the webpages you visit. Whether you're a privacy-conscious user, a security professional, or a filter list maintainer, this tool surfaces every attempted and successful connection, empowering you to understand exactly what happens behind the scenes.

## Understanding the Challenge: Why Visibility Matters

Modern websites rarely stand alone; they interact with numerous third-party servers to load ads, analytics, social media widgets, content delivery networks (CDNs), and more. This complexity often leaves users in the dark about which external servers are contacted, how frequently, and how effective their content blocking tools really are.

Many users rely on content blockers but struggle to interpret common indicators like block counts or rely on misleading ad blocker test pages. uBO Scope addresses this by reporting *distinct third-party remote servers* involved, exposing the true connections — not just which resources were blocked.

## Introducing uBO Scope: Your Window Into Remote Connections

At its core, uBO Scope serves as an extension that monitors and reports the outcome of all network requests triggered by webpages. It counts and lists the distinct third-party domains for which connections were attempted or successfully established, breaking them down into clear categories:

- **Not Blocked:** Connections allowed through by content blockers or direct loads.
- **Stealth Blocked:** Connections that were silently intercepted or redirected.
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked or failed.

This detail helps you truly understand the landscape of third-party network activity on a per-tab basis.

### What uBO Scope Does

- Reports all attempted or successful remote connections, including those that are redirected or blocked.
- Counts the number of *unique third-party domains* connected to, providing a low-level metric of third-party involvement.
- Works alongside any content blocker or DNS blocking method, as long as the browser exposes requests through the `webRequest` API.
- Surfaces critical data in an easy-to-read popup interface accessible from the browser toolbar.

## Why uBO Scope is Different

Unlike traditional content blockers or network monitors, uBO Scope focuses on the *distinct third-party connections* across your browsing session, avoiding misleading metrics like total request counts or block numbers. Key differentiators include:

- **True Exposure of Connections:** Tracks all network request outcomes including redirects, errors, and successes.
- **Independence from Content Blocker Counts:** Shows actual server contact endpoints instead of just block hits.
- **Supports Diverse Browsers and Blocking Methods:** Works wherever the browser exposes requests via `webRequest`.
- **Simple and Actionable UI:** Provides immediate visibility with a summary and categorized lists of domains linked to the current tab.

## Real-World Scenarios

Imagine you are browsing a news site known for extensive third-party tracking. With uBO Scope, you can:

- **Immediately see how many unique third-party domains the page tries to contact.**
- **Identify stealthily blocked connections that don’t appear in typical block lists.**
- **Understand if your content blocker is allowing undesired remote connections despite high block counts.**
- **Validate filter list performance by examining actual distinct server connections rather than claims.**

This clarity enables smarter browsing, better privacy decisions, and more effective filter list maintenance.

## How uBO Scope Works At a Glance

uBO Scope utilizes the browser's `webRequest` API listeners to monitor every network request triggered within browser tabs. Each request is logged with its outcome:

- **Success:** The connection completed successfully.
- **Redirect:** The connection was rerouted transparently.
- **Error:** The connection was blocked or failed.

For each tab, uBO Scope tracks domains and hostnames, calculating the total number of distinct third-party endpoints contacted. This count updates the browser toolbar badge, providing a real-time, intuitive metric.

The extension also leverages the Public Suffix List (`public_suffix_list.dat`) to accurately derive base domain names from hostnames, avoiding false distinctions between subdomains and parents.

## Practical Tip

<u>**Remember:**</u> A *lower* badge count on uBO Scope means fewer distinct third-party servers contacted, which generally indicates a cleaner and potentially safer browsing experience.

With uBO Scope, you hold a transparent lens to your browser’s network activity. Gain insight. Take control.

# Quick Example: What You'll See

Right after installation, when you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, you get a popup showing:

- The primary hostname of the active tab.
- The total number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- Lists divided into **Not Blocked**, **Stealth Blocked**, and **Blocked** domains with counts.

This immediate information helps quickly determine the extent and nature of third-party connections on any site you visit.
