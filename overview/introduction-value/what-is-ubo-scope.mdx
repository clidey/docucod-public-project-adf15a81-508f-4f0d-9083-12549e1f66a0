# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Network Connection with Transparency and Clarity

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to provide unparalleled insight into the network activity of your web browsing sessions. Unlike typical ad blockers or content filters that operate silently in the background, uBO Scope exposes every network connection—whether attempted or successful—to third-party servers. This openness empowers you to understand exactly how web pages interact with remote servers beyond the usual ad or content blocking lens.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You

- **Complete Network Visibility**: See all connections made by your browser tab, including allowed, stealth-blocked, and outright blocked domains.
- **Beyond Ad Blockers**: Understand the full scope of your browsing’s network footprint—not just what is blocked but what still connects.
- **Enhanced Privacy Awareness**: Identify third-party servers your browser communicates with, aiding privacy-conscious users in making informed choices.
- **Simplified and Lightweight**: Runs as a compact extension that does not interfere with site functionality but provides powerful, transparent reporting.

### Who Benefits Most from uBO Scope?

- Users seeking to audit and understand network interactions of web pages beyond what content blockers reveal.
- Privacy advocates interested in third-party domain tracking.
- Filter list maintainers and testers requiring objective network data.
- Anyone curious about the real network behavior of websites they visit.

## What is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a browser extension that monitors all network requests initiated while you browse and classifies these by their outcome: whether connections were _allowed_, _stealth-blocked_, or _blocked_. It aggregates this information per browser tab and presents clear summaries that show which third-party domains are involved.

The extension leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to listen to every network request event, collecting detailed data on the connection's status. It then stitches together this data into a concise overview, accessible instantly via the extension’s popup interface.

### How uBO Scope Helps

- **Expose Hidden Connections**: Some content blockers stealthily allow or redirect connections without clear indication. uBO Scope reveals these stealth-blocked connections separately, providing clarity.
- **Debunk Misconceptions**: It challenges common myths about content blockers—for example, that a higher block count means better blocking—by focusing on the number of distinct third-party servers actually connected to.
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works alongside any content blocker and reflects network requests regardless of DNS-level or extension blocking, as long as the browser reports them.

### What Makes uBO Scope Different?

Most ad-blocking or privacy extensions show what they block or allow, but rarely present a comprehensive report on *all* remote server connection attempts. uBO Scope fills this gap with an independent, transparent view.

It is:
- **Transparent**: Shows allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections distinctly.
- **Accurate**: Reports actual network events detected by your browser.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal footprint without invasive filtering.

## Core Components at a Glance

The primary interface users interact with is the extension’s popup panel, launched by clicking its toolbar icon. This popup shows a structured summary of network connections for the active tab:

- **Domains Connected**: The total count of distinct third-party domains the tab connected to.
- **Not Blocked**: Domains to which network connections were allowed.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains with connections stealthily intercepted or redirected.
- **Blocked**: Domains where network requests were explicitly blocked.

From this view, the user can quickly assess the network landscape of the current tab with immediately actionable information.

### Real-World Example

Imagine visiting a news site. The popup instantly tells you:

- Exactly how many and which third-party domains your browser connected with.
- Which connections were outright blocked by your content blocker.
- Whether any requests were redirected or stealth-blocked, which might otherwise go unnoticed.

This empowers savvy users to identify unexpected or suspicious network activity that might require further investigation or filtering.

## How to Interpret the uBO Scope Report

- **Lower Domain Count is Better**: The extension's badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains reached. A lower count typically translates to better privacy and fewer tracker connections.
- **Allowed vs Blocked**: Seeing connections under 'not blocked' shows what your browser fetched from third parties. Comparing this to the 'blocked' list helps you understand your current content blocking effectiveness.
- **Stealth-Blocked Is Insightful**: The 'stealth-blocked' category highlights network requests that content blockers hide behind the scenes (such as redirects), which most other tools do not show.

Keep in mind not all third-party connections are malicious or unwanted; legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs) often appear here.
