# What is uBO Scope?

## Discovering the Mission Behind uBO Scope

Imagine you are browsing the web, and every website you visit silently connects to multiple external servers behind the scenes. How can you know which remote servers your browser is communicating with, whether these connections are allowed, stealthily blocked, or outright blocked? This is exactly the fundamental mission of **uBO Scope** — a lightweight, transparent browser extension that reveals every remote connection attempt initiated by sites you visit.

## A Clear Look Into Remote Connections

uBO Scope provides an unfiltered, factual view of all network requests made by your active browser tab, regardless of which content blocking extension you use or even how the network requests are blocked. It counts and categorizes each connection attempt to third-party servers, offering you insight into the true footprint of the websites you visit.

**Why does this matter?** Because a lower count of distinct remote servers connected to your browser tab means fewer third parties tracking, advertising, or otherwise interacting with you — key to improving your privacy and browsing experience.

## What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

- **Transparent Connection Monitoring:** uBO Scope shows all network requests and their outcomes — whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked — directly from the browser's networking APIs.
- **Independent of Content Blocker Logic:** It reports connections regardless of which content blocker is active, or even if DNS-based blocking is used.
- **Focus on Distinct Domains, Not Just Request Counts:** It measures how many unique third-party domains were contacted, not just the raw number of requests.
- **Debunks Common Myths About Content Blocking:** By showing you real connection data, it reveals why block count badges on extensions are misleading.

The extension accomplishes this by listening to the browser's network request lifecycle through the `webRequest` API and builds a detailed map of connections for each active tab.

## Real-World Scenario: Why a Lower Badge Count is Desirable

When you install uBO Scope, its toolbar icon badge displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted during your current browsing session on a given tab. 

- A **low badge count** usually means the website loads most resources directly or from a limited and trustworthy set of third parties, such as content delivery networks (CDNs).
- A **high badge count** reveals that the page contacted many different third-party servers, raising privacy concerns and potential performance issues.

This immediate visibility helps you understand the true network impact of each website beyond what traditional blockers show.

## Challenging Content Blocking Myths

uBO Scope is not just a monitoring tool, but a critical lens to rethink common beliefs around content blocking:

### Myth 1: "A higher block count means a better blocker"

- **Reality:** uBO Scope proves that the reliability of a content blocker is about how many unique third parties are prevented from connecting — not just the number of requests blocked.
- A blocker with a high block count may allow connections to more distinct third-party servers, which means it might actually be less effective in reducing your digital footprint.

### Myth 2: "Ad-blocker test webpages provide reliable results"

- **Reality:** These test pages simulate unrealistic scenarios and cannot detect stealthy blocking techniques.
- uBO Scope reveals that real-world network behavior is far more complex than synthetic benchmarks, so users should trust actual connection data over these tests.

---

## Why Should You Care?

- **Gain full transparency on third-party connections** made by websites you visit.
- **Understand the true impact of your content blocking setup** without misleading block counts.
- **Improve your digital privacy awareness** by identifying excessive third-party connections.
- **Assist filter list maintainers and advanced users** in evaluating the effectiveness of blocking rules.

In practice, uBO Scope becomes your window into what your browser really does on the network level, empowering informed decisions about privacy and security.

## How uBO Scope Fits in Your Workflow

When you install and enable uBO Scope:

- Every network request in your active tabs is monitored and categorized.
- The toolbar icon badge displays a succinct count of unique third-party domains allowed.
- On opening the extension popup, you see a detailed list grouping connections as:
  - **Allowed:** Third parties to which connections successfully made.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Connections blocked in a stealthy manner (not disclosed to the website).
  - **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked connections.

This immediate feedback enables you to evaluate privacy impact at a glance or drill down to domain-specific details when needed.

## Getting Started with uBO Scope

To begin exploring third-party connections you can:

1. **Install uBO Scope** from your browser's extension store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari).
2. Browse a website of interest.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to inspect the precise list of remote domains contacted.
4. Observe lowering badge counts when content blockers or filters effectively reduce third-party connections.

This simple yet profound visibility tool helps elevate your understanding of network activity and complements other privacy tools.
