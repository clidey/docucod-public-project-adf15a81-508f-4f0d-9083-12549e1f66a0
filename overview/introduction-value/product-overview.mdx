# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlock Transparent Network Visibility

### See Every Connection Your Browser Makes — No Matter What

uBO Scope is a lightweight, browser-neutral extension designed with a clear mission: to reveal every remote server connection your browser attempts or establishes. This transparent visibility is provided regardless of any content blocker you may have installed, empowering you with an accurate understanding of your browser’s network activity.

### Why This Matters

- **Total clarity:** Know exactly which third-party remote servers your browser contacts.
- **Unbiased reporting:** Track network requests no matter what filtering or DNS blocking happens behind the scenes.
- **Privacy insights:** Monitor potential privacy-impacting connections with unmatched accuracy.
- **Diagnostic tool:** Quickly troubleshoot and analyze network behaviors impossible to see through the browser alone.
- **Filter list research:** Ideal for filter list maintainers to validate the real-world effectiveness of blocking rules.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users wanting deep insight into third-party connections.
- Developers and researchers investigating web tracking and network behaviors.
- Filter list maintainers and content blocker authors seeking reliable measurement.
- Users skeptical about block counts or “ad blocker test” pages and looking for factual connection data.

## What Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension companion to content blockers, designed specifically to monitor and report network request outcomes at a granular level. It listens passively to web requests, recording which remote servers were contacted, which were allowed, stealth-blocked (hidden from the page), or blocked outright.

Its core purpose is to provide a true, unfiltered picture of your browser's network activities in real time, cutting through the noise of superficial block counts that do not capture the distinct number of third-party connections.

### How uBO Scope Works at a Glance

- Uses browser `webRequest` API to receive detailed updates on every network request.
- Processes requests to determine if they were successfully allowed, blocked by a content-blocker stealthily, or blocked explicitly.
- Aggregates and displays the distinct number of domains connected to, updating the toolbar badge accordingly.
- Presents categorized reports through an easy-to-understand popup panel.

<u><i>Note:</i></u> Some network requests outside the reach of the browser's `webRequest` API—for example, those managed by DNS servers without browser visibility—cannot be monitored.

## Core Features & User Workflows

### Dashboard Badge
The badge over the extension icon displays the count of **unique third-party domains** your browser connected to during the active tab session. A **lower number signifies fewer external connections**, which often means better privacy.

### Popup Panel
Click the extension icon to open a detailed report panel showing:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains successfully connected.
- **Stealth Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were blocked invisibly to the site.
- **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked.

Each section lists connected domains along with the count of connection attempts.

### Cross-Content Blocker Transparency
uBO Scope reports connections regardless of:

- Which content blocker you have enabled, if any.
- Whether the blocking is done openly or stealthily.
- DNS-based blocking mechanisms, as long as the browser’s network API reports the event.

This makes it the go-to extension for unbiased network visibility.

## Why Choose uBO Scope? Practical Benefits

- **Accurate Privacy Assessment:** Understand the true breadth of third-party trackers and servers your browser touches.
- **Reliable Content Blocker Evaluation:** Go beyond misleading block counts and fake ad-blocker test pages to grasp true blocking efficiency.
- **Network Request Investigation:** Debug and investigate sites' web requests in real time, aiding developers and privacy researchers.
- **Minimal Impact & Simple Setup:** A lightweight tool that integrates smoothly without affecting your usual browsing experience.

### Common Use Cases

1. **Privacy-Conscious Browsing:** Spot unexpected or suspicious third-party requests to assess and improve privacy practices.
2. **Content Blocker Validation:** Confirm how many and which third parties are allowed or blocked, revealing gaps or over-blocking.
3. **Filter List Maintenance:** Analyze real user data to refine blocklists based on actual network exposure.
4. **Debunking Myths:** Visualize why block count numbers are an unreliable metric and dismiss poor ad-blocker test sites.

## Getting Started with uBO Scope

### Quick Overview
1. Install uBO Scope from your browser's add-ons store.
2. Navigate to any website and click the uBO Scope icon.
3. Observe the badge count — representing unique third-party servers connected.
4. Open the popup to view detailed classified lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

### Prerequisites
- Compatible with Chromium-based browsers (Chrome 122+), Firefox 128+, and Safari 18.5+.
- The browser must provide the `webRequest` API for network event reporting.

### Next Steps
- Explore the **Understanding Badge and Popup Panel** guide to interpret connection data.
- Dive into **Filter List Research** to use uBO Scope effectively for privacy enhancement.
- Consult **Troubleshooting Installation Issues** if encountering problems.

## Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

- Remember: a zero or low count is good; many third-party connections usually indicate higher tracking risk.
- Don’t rely solely on block counts from other blockers or fake ad-blocker test pages - use uBO Scope’s real network data.
- Ensure you keep the extension up to date to benefit from ongoing improvements.
