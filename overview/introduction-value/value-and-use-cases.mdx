# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Understanding your browser's network connections is essential for anyone focused on privacy, security, or the optimization of content blocking. uBO Scope caters specifically to users who want transparent, independent insight into the connections their browsers establish with remote servers.

## Target Audiences

### Privacy-Minded Users
If you are concerned about which third-party servers your browser communicates with — beyond what typical content blockers reveal — uBO Scope offers a definitive, unbiased view. It helps you:

- Identify every third-party remote connection, whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.
- Monitor the diversity and frequency of these connections to assess your exposure.
- Gain control over your digital footprint by understanding what happens behind the scenes while browsing.

### Filter List Maintainers
Maintaining effective filter lists requires precise knowledge of actual third-party requests and their outcomes. uBO Scope becomes an indispensable tool by:

- Providing detailed data on network requests and their statuses (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked).
- Enabling assessment of how filters perform in real-world browsing.
- Helping debug and refine lists where access to developer tools is limited or unavailable.

### Content Blocker Evaluators
Choosing the right content blocker can be confusing, especially when relying on block counts or various test websites. uBO Scope aids in:

- Seeing the true efficiency of content blockers by counting distinct third-party remote servers connected to.
- Debunking myths around block counts and ad-blocker test websites.
- Making data-driven decisions based on actual network connections, not on misleading superficial metrics.

### Developers and Security Analysts
Professionals interested in network behavior and security can use uBO Scope for:

- Auditing third-party profiles of websites and applications.
- Investigating stealth or silently blocked connections that could affect privacy or performance.
- Quickly understanding the connections landscape during development or security assessments.

## Why uBO Scope Fits Your Needs

Many users struggle with opaque or misleading content blocker metrics. uBO Scope offers clear, actionable data:

- **Independent of content blocker implementation:** It reports on network requests regardless of current blocking software.
- **Visual and count-based insights:** The toolbar badge indicates the number of distinct third-party domains contacted, simplifying your monitoring.
- **Minimalist and focused:** uBO Scope doesn’t overwhelm with unnecessary features, it provides what you need about your network connections.

## Real-World Scenarios

- You install multiple ad blockers and want to verify which one truly reduces third-party connections.
- You are a filter list author refining your rules based on actual network events observed by uBO Scope.
- You work on a locked-down device with restricted access to developer tools but need precise connection data.
- You want to educate yourself or others on the nature of third-party connections in daily browsing.

## Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blockers to understand what networks your browsing triggers and which are handled.
- Regularly check the badge count; a lower count often means better privacy, but consider the context of legitimate third parties.
- Avoid basing content blocker reliability purely on block counts — instead, focus on the distinct domains connected to (the core data uBO Scope provides).

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Don’t rely on block count alone:** High block numbers can sometimes mean more third-party contacts allowed, not fewer.
- **Avoid ad-blocker test webpages for validation:** They produce artificial network traffic that isn’t representative.
- **Remember coverage limitations:** uBO Scope works only within the browser’s webRequest API scope — requests outside this aren't reported.
