## Unlock Transparency for Privacy-Aware Users

If you care deeply about your online privacy, uBO Scope puts the control back in your hands by revealing every remote server connection a website attempts to make — whether these connections are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked by your existing content blocker.

- **See Every Third-Party Connection:** Unlike traditional blockers, uBO Scope shows all connections, regardless of blocker status or DNS filtering.
- **Understand Your Exposure:** The toolbar badge reflects the count of distinct third-party domains contacted, helping you quickly assess your web session’s true privacy profile.
- **Avoid False Assumptions:** Learn which external domains genuinely load resources, detecting misleading block counts or stealth behaviors.

### Real-World Scenario
Imagine visiting a news article with several embedded social media buttons and trackers hidden behind the scenes. uBO Scope will list these third-party hosts clearly, letting you see what’s connecting silently in the background, even if your adblocker claims to be blocking certain domains.

## Empower Content Blocker Users

uBO Scope enhances the effectiveness of your preferred content blocker by providing an independent, transparent window into network requests:

- **Validate Blocking Effectiveness:** Rather than trusting a block count shown by your content blocker, confirm the actual number of distinct third-party servers your browser accesses.
- **Debunk Myths About Block Counts:** A higher block count often indicates more allowed connections under the surface; uBO Scope clarifies this misconception.
- **Spot Stealth Behaviors:** It identifies requests blocked silently (stealth-blocked), which traditional indicators may miss.

### Practical Use
Suppose you are trying to choose between two different ad blockers. With uBO Scope, you can objectively compare which one truly minimizes third-party connections rather than relying on extension-reported block counts or suspect "ad blocker test" pages, which are often unreliable.

## Support Filter List Maintainers

For maintainers of filter lists who need trustworthy feedback on which servers are contacted, uBO Scope can be a vital diagnostic tool — especially on devices without access to sophisticated browser developer tools.

- **Monitor Real-World Connections:** See precise data on domains contacted and how requests are treated.
- **Spot Updates Needed:** Identify domains that bypass or evade current filters.
- **Assess Filter Impact on Different Devices:** Particularly useful where advanced browser debugging is unavailable.

### Example Use Case
A filter maintainer testing a new blocking rule can use uBO Scope to verify if the associated third-party domain is blocked or allowed, ensuring the filter’s impact directly from observed connection attempts.
