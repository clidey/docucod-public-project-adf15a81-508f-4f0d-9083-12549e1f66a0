# Why Use uBO Scope?

Discover the unique power of uBO Scope, the essential tool that shines a light on the complex world of third-party remote connections made by your browser. Unlike traditional content blockers, uBO Scope goes beyond simple blocking metrics to provide full, unbiased transparency into all network requests initiated by your active browser tab.

## The Challenge with Traditional Content Blocking Metrics

Many users and filter list maintainers rely on toolbar badge counts or "block count" metrics offered by content blockers to gauge their effectiveness. However, these figures can be misleading:

- **High Block Count ≠ Better Blocking**: A content blocker showing a high block count might still be allowing connections to a larger number of unique third-party remote servers. This paradox means the blocker isn't necessarily more effective — it may simply block many requests from a narrower range of servers while allowing many from others.

- **'Ad Blocker Test' Webpages Are Unreliable**: Popular "ad blocker test" sites often simulate artificial network requests that do not reflect real-world browsing. They fail to detect advanced stealth mechanisms used by blockers, resulting in unrealistic assessments.

These factors create confusion, preventing users from truly understanding their exposure to third-party domains or from effectively comparing content blockers.

## What uBO Scope Brings to the Table

uBO Scope addresses these challenges head-on by delivering:

- **Transparent Analytics on Third-Party Remote Servers**
  - See every remote server your active tab connects to — allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked — regardless of the content blocker in use.

- **Unbiased, Accurate Visibility Beyond Content Blocker Limitations**
  - Works independently of the content blocker’s internal reporting or stealth tactics, relying on browser-reported network events via the `webRequest` API.

- **Myth Debunking for Clear Understanding**
  - Helps you understand why block counts can be deceptive.
  - Demonstrates the unreliability of synthetic ad blocker test results.

- **Filtering Aid for Filter List Maintainers**
  - Supports list maintainers by revealing network requests even on devices where browser developer tools are limited or unavailable.

## Real-World Impact: Empowering Your Web Experience

Imagine browsing your favorite websites knowing exactly which third-party servers your browser talks to, irrespective of the content blocking tools applied. With uBO Scope, you can:

- **Control Exposure**: Identify and understand legitimate versus potentially unwanted third-party connections affecting your privacy and security.

- **Evaluate Content Blockers Effectively**: Make informed decisions beyond simplistic badge counts, focusing on what really matters — minimizing distinct third-party exposures.

- **Improve Filter Lists with Confidence**: Verify how your filters behave in real-world scenarios, ensuring they effectively reduce unnecessary third-party connections.

## How uBO Scope Fits Within Your Workflow

1. **Install and Activate uBO Scope** alongside your preferred content blocker.
2. **Browse as usual**, then click on the uBO Scope icon to reveal a categorized audit of third-party requests:
   - Not Blocked (allowed) connections
   - Stealth-blocked connections (those suppressed without overt blocking)
   - Fully Blocked connections (requests that failed)
3. **Gain insights** into network patterns, spotting unusual or excessive third-party calls.
4. **Adjust your content blockers or filter lists** for optimized performance and privacy based on your findings.

## Practical Tips for Using uBO Scope

- **Focus on distinct domains, not just raw counts**: The extension reports unique third-party domains contacted, giving a clearer picture of exposure.
- **Watch for stealth-blocked connections**: These are network calls blocked covertly by blockers to avoid webpage breakage or detection.
- **Use session data**: uBO Scope stores network outcomes per tab session, allowing you to review and analyze ongoing browsing activity.

## Common Misunderstandings and Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Myths and uBO Scope Clarifications">
<Accordion title="High Block Count Means Better Blocking">
Many believe that more blocks equal better protection. uBO Scope reveals that a high block count could coexist with connections to many distinct third-party servers — meaning less effective blocking in practice.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Ad Blocker Test Websites are Accurate Benchmarks">
These websites simulate artificial network requests and cannot detect the stealth blocking techniques used by extensions. Trusting their results leads to false confidence in blocker efficacy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="All Third-Party Connections are Bad">
Not all third-party domains are harmful; many are legitimate, such as content delivery networks (CDNs). uBO Scope helps you distinguish between the two by displaying comprehensive connection data transparently.

### Getting Started with uBO Scope
To experience the full power of visibility uBO Scope offers, start with the installation and first-launch guides. These pages will help you set it up properly and understand the user interface.

---

### Example Scenario: Evaluating Content Blocker Effectiveness
Suppose you use two different content blockers at different times and notice one shows a higher block count. With uBO Scope, you open its popup to see the actual number of distinct third-party domains connected to during browsing sessions. If the blocker with the higher count also shows more allowed domains, you realize it’s less effective, despite the raw block count.

This insight helps you choose or tune blockers for the best protection.

---

### Troubleshooting Insight
If uBO Scope shows an unexpectedly low count or no data:

- Verify the extension’s permissions and that the browser allows `webRequest` API data.
- Ensure you are viewing the active tab for which network events are logged.
- Remember that some network requests outside the browser’s `webRequest` API scope cannot be captured.

Use the troubleshooting and quick validation guides to resolve such issues.
