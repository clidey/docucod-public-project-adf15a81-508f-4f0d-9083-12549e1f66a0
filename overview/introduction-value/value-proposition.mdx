# Why Use uBO Scope?

Discover the distinctive advantages that make uBO Scope an essential tool for privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers. This page explores how uBO Scope offers unbiased, independent monitoring of remote connections initiated by websites, clarifies common misconceptions about ad-blocking statistics, and illustrates practical benefits with real-life scenarios.

## What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

uBO Scope stands apart with its dedicated focus on transparency and accuracy in reporting all remote server connections attempted or made by webpages. Unlike typical content blockers or analytics tools, it:

- Operates independently of other blockers, providing an unbiased view.
- Measures not only allowed but also stealth-blocked and blocked network requests.
- Counts distinct third-party domains rather than raw block counts, addressing a key misunderstanding in blocker evaluation.

This independence is crucial because it reveals connections regardless of filtering, enabling better-informed privacy decisions.

## Core Benefits for Users and Maintainers

### 1. Unbiased Remote Connection Monitoring

Users see a transparent, factual report of how many and which third-party domains a page tries to contact. This goes beyond surface metrics such as block counts that can be misleading.

<u>Imagine browsing a news site:</u> uBO Scope shows all domains where content is fetched from — including ads, trackers, CDNs, or analytics platforms. This tangible insight helps users assess site trustworthiness and privacy implications.

### 2. Independence from External Blockers

uBO Scope does not rely on another content blocker’s reporting. Instead, it taps directly into the browser’s `webRequest` API to track network requests, capturing all outcomes whether content is blocked by uBO, DNS filters, or other means.

This approach guarantees accuracy in environments where blockers might handle requests differently or use stealth methods to avoid detection.

### 3. Myth-Busting Regarding Ad-Block Statistics

Many users mistakenly equate a higher block count with better privacy protection. uBO Scope clarifies this misconception by emphasizing that the key metric is how many distinct third-party servers present on a page actually get accessed.

A high block count can ironically indicate more third parties are contacted because many trivial requests are blocked individually. uBO Scope's domain-based count offers a more meaningful representation of actual exposure.

Additionally, uBO Scope highlights the limited value of "ad blocker test" pages, often used as benchmarks but unrealistic and unable to detect stealth blocking techniques.

## Real-Life Use Cases

- **Privacy-Conscious Browsers:** Quickly identify how many different third-party services are contacted by any site.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Evaluate filter effectiveness and uncover overlooked requests without dependency on browser UI.
- **Debugging:** Detect unexpected or stealthy third-party access points that may impact user privacy or affect network load.

Through concrete data, users can make better blocking choices or even report potential privacy issues with websites.

## Before and After: Understanding the Impact

- *Without uBO Scope:* Users only see a generic block count badge on their content blocker, leaving them guessing about what happens behind the scenes.
- *With uBO Scope:* Users gain granular, domain-focused insights into all third-party connections, regardless of blocking technique. This empowers better evaluation and decision-making.
