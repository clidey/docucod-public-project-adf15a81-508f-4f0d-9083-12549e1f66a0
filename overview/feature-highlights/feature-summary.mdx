# Quick Feature Overview of uBO Scope

Discover the essential features that make uBO Scope a powerful companion for revealing and analyzing your browser's network connections. This page summarizes the core capabilities which give you transparent, real-time insights into the remote servers your browser interacts with — whether connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked.

---

## Immediate Network Request Monitoring

uBO Scope works silently in the background by intercepting network requests through the browser's `webRequest` API. It captures every connection your browser attempts across all tabs in real time. This means you'll see not just what your browser loads, but also what it tries to load but is stealthily or explicitly blocked — offering unprecedented visibility into your browsing activity.

### What You Get:
- Real-time updates on every network request outcome.
- Automatic classification of each request as **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked**.
- Comprehensive coverage across supported browsers including Chromium, Firefox, and Safari.

## Badge Count Visualization

Located on the browser toolbar, the uBO Scope badge provides a quick-glance count representing the **number of distinct domains (third-party remote servers) that your browser connected to successfully**.

### Why It Matters:
- The badge emphasizes the **distinct count of allowed connections** — a lower number indicates fewer third-party domains loaded, supporting better privacy and reduced tracking.
- Unlike block count badges from some content blockers, uBO Scope’s badge shows a more meaningful metric focused on distinct connections rather than raw block numbers.

## Popup Panel: Real-Time Tab Insights

Clicking the uBO Scope icon opens a dynamic popup that categorizes connected domains by their request outcomes for the currently active browser tab.

### Key Features in the Popup:
- **Domain Categorization**
  - Domains are grouped under **`not blocked`**, **`stealth-blocked`**, and **`blocked`** sections.
  - Each domain entry shows the count of requests made, allowing you to understand which domains are most active.
- **Summary Section**
  - Displays the total count of unique domains connected in the current tab.
- **Visual Feedback**
  - Color-coded sections highlight the status clearly — green for allowed, red for stealth and blocked — enhancing readability.

### User Experience Flow:
1. Open any webpage/tab in your browser.
2. Click the uBO Scope extension icon.
3. Instantly view which third-party domains are connecting and how those requests are treated.
4. Use this insight to detect unusual or unwanted network activity, aiding privacy awareness.

## Supported Browsers & Compatibility

uBO Scope supports major desktop browsers with robust implementation for Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari. It leverages each browser's `webRequest` API capabilities to maintain accurate and comprehensive request monitoring.

### Benefits:
- Seamless integration across environments without requiring additional setup.
- Accurate reporting despite other content blockers or DNS-level filtering operating in the background.

## Practical Example

Imagine browsing your favorite news site. The popup reveals:
- `news.example.com` under **not blocked** with 12 requests.
- A third-party analytics provider under **stealth-blocked** with 5 requests.
- A known ad server under **blocked** with 8 requests.

At a glance, you understand which domains serve content, which are being quietly bocked without full visibility, and which are outright prevented.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Check the badge count frequently** to gauge how many third party domains you connect to.
- **Use the popup for deep dives** per tab to understand domain behaviors in context.
- **Look out for unexpected domains** especially in stealth or blocked categories, which may help identify tracking or malicious networks.
- If the popup shows 'NO DATA,' reload your tab or ensure you have granted required permissions.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Limited browser support**: Monitoring relies on browser compatibility with the `webRequest` API.
- **Network requests outside `webRequest` scope** (e.g., some WebSockets in certain browsers) may not report correctly.
- Badge counts reflect distinct domains, not total requests, which is an intentional privacy-centric metric.
