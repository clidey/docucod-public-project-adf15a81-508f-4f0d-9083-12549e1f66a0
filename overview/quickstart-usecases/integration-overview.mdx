# Works With Your Tools: Integrations

Discover how uBO Scope fits seamlessly into your existing privacy and network monitoring toolkit. This page explains the practical ways uBO Scope complements popular content blockers like uBlock Origin and DNS-based filters by providing transparent insights into your browser's actual network connections, regardless of what other tools are blocking or allowing.

## Instant Visibility Beyond Traditional Content Blockers

While content blockers such as uBlock Origin and DNS-based filters control and limit resource loading to protect your privacy and block unwanted content, they often do not give you a clear picture of which connections are actually made or blocked under the hood. uBO Scope fills this gap by:

- Reporting **all network connection attempts** your browser makes, including **allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked** connections.
- Providing an unbiased count of distinct third-party servers your browser contacted during a browsing session.
- Operating independently of blocking logic, so it monitors what *actually* happens regardless of what content blockers permit or deny.

This unbiased outlook is crucial because:

- Some requests might be blocked silently by stealth mechanisms invisible to webpages and typical testing tools.
- The count of blocked requests alone via content blockers can be misleading when assessing privacy or blocking effectiveness.

## How uBO Scope Integrates into Your Workflow

You don’t need to change your current content blocker or filtering setup to use uBO Scope. Instead, it acts as a **transparent observer** of network activity:

1. **Run your usual content blocker** such as uBlock Origin or any DNS-based filter.
2. **Open uBO Scope’s popup** to see a detailed report of network requests outcomes—showing what was allowed, what was blocked, and what was stealth-blocked.
3. **Analyze the domains contacted** and understand your browser’s exposure to third-party servers.
4. **Use this insight to validate** your blocking configurations, discover unexpected connections, and troubleshoot privacy leaks.

This makes uBO Scope an ideal companion tool for:

- Privacy-conscious individuals who want to verify their content blockers actually prevent unwanted network requests.
- Filter list maintainers who need accurate data on which domains are contacted by browsers irrespective of filter rules.
- Security researchers and network analysts seeking to audit browser behavior under different blocking scenarios.

## Limitations Imposed by Browser APIs

uBO Scope depends on the browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor network activity. Understanding what this means for integrations helps set realistic expectations:

- uBO Scope can only report on network requests visible to the `webRequest` API.
- Requests made outside the reach of this API (for example, certain low-level browser internal calls or extensions not using standard request APIs) will not be visible.
- Despite these limitations, in supported browsers (`Chrome`, `Firefox`, `Safari`), this covers the vast majority of web page network activity.

<u>**Tip:**</u> For the most accurate picture, ensure your browser and uBO Scope are up to date, as improvements to browser APIs can enhance visibility.

## Examples of Integration Benefits

### Scenario 1: Confirming Effectiveness of uBlock Origin
Using uBO Scope alongside uBlock Origin:

- You navigate to a site.
- uBlock Origin blocks many requests — but uBO Scope exposes additional stealth-blocked domains.
- This difference signals that uBlock Origin’s stealth blocking is masking connections that normal tools can't track.

### Scenario 2: Validating DNS-based Filtering Setup
DNS-based filters block connections before reaching the browser:

- uBO Scope shows the count of blocked and allowed domains at the browser level.
- If DNS blocking is effective, the number of allowed connections will be lower compared to a setup without DNS filtering.
- Unexpected allowed connections may indicate DNS leaks or configuration gaps.

### Scenario 3: Filter List Maintenance and Improvement
Filter list maintainers can use uBO Scope as a real-time monitoring tool to:

- Identify domains contacted by browsers under typical user conditions.
- Test how filter list updates affect network traffic.
- Verify that filters reduce third-party connections without breaking critical site functionality.

## Getting Started with Integrations

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Your Preferred Content Blocker">
Ensure you have your selected content blocker active, such as uBlock Origin or a setup leveraging DNS filtering.
</Step>
<Step title="Install uBO Scope">
Add uBO Scope to your browser from official stores to enable network request monitoring. See the installation guide for details.
</Step>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to view network connection reports for your current tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Connection Results">
Use the categorized allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domain lists in the popup to assess your connection landscape.
</Step>
<Step title="Iterate and Optimize">
Adjust your blocker settings or filter lists based on insights and re-validate with uBO Scope.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices for Effective Use

- Regularly monitor the badge count on uBO Scope’s icon; a lower count indicates fewer third-party connections.
- Investigate unexpected allowed or stealth-blocked domains to discover potentially privacy-invasive connections.
- Combine uBO Scope with network debugging tools (e.g., browser DevTools) for deeper analysis.
- Keep your content blockers and uBO Scope updated to leverage improvements and API enhancements.

<Warning>
Remember that no tool can block all unwanted connections perfectly. uBO Scope provides transparency but does not interfere with connections itself.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Common Integration Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Tips">
<Accordion title="uBO Scope Shows No Data or NO DATA">
Ensure you have navigated to a web page and the browser tab is active. uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API which only reports network requests for active tabs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Discrepancy Between Content Blocker and uBO Scope Counts">
This often occurs due to stealth blocking or DNS filtering layers. Use uBO Scope’s categorized outcomes to clarify the source of discrepancies.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Browser Compatibility and Permissions Issues">
Verify that uBO Scope has necessary permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`) granted during installation. Some security settings may block extension APIs.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

uBO Scope enhances your existing privacy and content blocking toolkit by giving you real, transparent insights into what connections your browser actually makes. It enables you to verify, validate, and troubleshoot third-party network requests beyond what content blockers reveal at face value.

By integrating uBO Scope with existing tools like uBlock Origin or DNS-based filters, you achieve an unmatched level of clarity and control over your browsing privacy and security.
