## Understanding Who Benefits Most from uBO Scope

### Privacy-Conscious Individuals

You care deeply about what happens behind the scenes when you browse the web. With countless third-party trackers, ads, and services potentially communicating with your browser, you want clear visibility into exactly which remote servers your browser attempts to connect to — and whether these connections are allowed, stealthily blocked, or outright blocked.

**Why uBO Scope?**
- It reveals all network connections your browser makes — not just what your ad blocker shows.
- It counts distinct third-party servers, helping you understand the true landscape of tracking and data leaks.
- It helps you identify unexpected or suspicious connections that might go unnoticed otherwise.

### Filter List Maintainers and Content Blocker Developers

You build or maintain content blocking filter lists or browser extensions. Accurate, unbiased information on network requests is essential to improve your filters and validate blocking effectiveness.

**Why uBO Scope?**
- It reports connection outcomes transparently regardless of which content blocker or DNS filtering is used.
- It helps detect stealth blocking, an important subtlety when filter behavior is obfuscated.
- It offers consistent data that can be used as a reliable baseline to test your filters' real-world impact.

### Developers and Technical Users Troubleshooting Web Resource Loading

When troubleshooting why a website’s content fails to load or behaves unexpectedly, knowing which network requests succeed, fail, or are silently blocked makes all the difference.

**Why uBO Scope?**
- See a clear breakdown of remote server connections under each tab.
- Distinguish between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Use this precise data as diagnostic evidence for debugging resource load issues.

## Typical Use Cases for uBO Scope

### 1. Troubleshooting Website Resource Loading

You notice parts of a site are not displaying correctly or assets are missing. Open uBO Scope’s popup to directly inspect the domains your browser tried to contact in that tab. Quickly see which third-party servers are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

**Success Criteria:** You identify an unexpected block preventing a critical third-party server from loading, giving you a clear lead to update your filters or whitelist as needed.

### 2. Validating the Performance of Your Content Blocker

You want to understand how effective your ad blocker or privacy tools truly are, beyond block counts or misleading test pages.

Use uBO Scope to get an accurate count of **distinct third-party remote servers contacted** by your browser when loading regular websites.

**Success Criteria:** You confirm that a lower badge count means fewer third-party connections, validating stronger privacy protection.

### 3. Discovering Unexpected Third-Party Communications

Browsers often connect to servers that users do not expect, such as web trackers, CDNs, analytics, or unauthorized background services.

uBO Scope reveals these connections explicitly, helping you uncover hidden communications and make informed decisions about privacy.

**Success Criteria:** You detect surprising or unwanted remote servers, prompting a review of extensions, DNS filters, or privacy settings.
