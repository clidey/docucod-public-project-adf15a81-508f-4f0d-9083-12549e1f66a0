# Feature Highlights at a Glance

## Instant Visibility into Remote Server Connections

From the moment you install uBO Scope and open the extension popup, you gain immediate insight into the network activity of your active browser tab. The interface breaks down all remote server connections initiated by the page, grouped clearly by their outcome:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains and hosts your browser successfully connected to.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections blocked in a way that is transparent to the webpage.
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked by your content blocker or browser.

This real-time view empowers you to understand exactly what third-party connections your browsing triggers.

## Meaningful Badge Counts

The toolbar icon badge number shows the count of distinct third-party domains with which your current tab successfully connected — a crucial metric for privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers alike. A lower number represents fewer external communications, generally signaling better privacy and less tracking exposure.

This count excludes first-party or same-site connections to keep the focus on third-party third-party interactions, helping you quickly assess the external network footprint of webpages without diving into technical details.

## Seamless Cross-Platform Support

uBO Scope is designed to work consistently across major browsers, including Firefox, Chromium-based browsers (such as Google Chrome and Edge), and Safari. Regardless of your platform, you get the same trusted visibility with similar feature sets and user experience.

This uniform support makes it easy to maintain your workflow and privacy monitoring habits across different devices and browser environments.

## Content-Agnostic Reporting

Unlike content blockers tied closely to filtering rules, uBO Scope reports network connections regardless of what caused a request to succeed or fail. Whether the request was blocked by your extension, a DNS-level filter, or succeeded due to the absence of blocking, uBO Scope transparently captures and reports it.

This approach shines a light on the *actual* network activity of your browser — revealing all attempted or completed connections to remote servers. This impartial reporting enables you to:

- Evaluate the real impact of your content blocker or filter list.
- Detect stealth blocking strategies.
- Make informed decisions about privacy and security configurations.

## What Can You Do Right Away?

As a new user, your first steps are simple:

1. **Open the browser action popup** (clicked toolbar icon) while browsing any website.
2. **See the badge count on the toolbar icon**, instantly reflecting the number of distinct third-party domains your current tab connected to.
3. **Explore the categorized lists of domains** inside the popup, grouped by their connection status.

These features require no complex setup or configuration. You immediately gain actionable visibility into all network connections — information that other content blockers and privacy tools can obscure or misrepresent.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Keep an eye on the badge count as you visit different sites to quickly judge their external network footprint.
- Use the detailed popup lists to identify unexpected or suspicious third-party connections.
- Remember that a lower badge count generally indicates better privacy; however, some legitimate sites may require multiple third-party domains for functionality.
- Install uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blocker for complementary insights into what connections are actually allowed.

## Common Pain Points & How uBO Scope Helps

- **Confusing block counts:** Many tools report block counts without context, leading to misconceptions about protection levels. uBO Scope focuses on allowed connections, a more meaningful privacy indicator.
- **Limited cross-browser consistency:** uBO Scope provides uniform behavior across browsers, reducing surprises as you switch environments.
- **Inability to see stealth blocking:** uBO Scope reveals stealth blocks and redirects transparently, aiding in accurate diagnosis of content blocker behavior.
