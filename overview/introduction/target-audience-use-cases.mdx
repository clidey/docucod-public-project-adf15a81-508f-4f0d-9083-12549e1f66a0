## Understanding Who Benefits from uBO Scope

uBO Scope is not a generic network tool; it is specialized for those who demand transparency and clarity about which remote servers their browsing sessions connect to. Its unique insight into connections allowed voluntarily, blocked actively, or stealthily blocked by content blockers makes it indispensable for privacy-conscious browsing and content blocking evaluation.

### Target Users

- **Privacy-Conscious Individuals**: Users who want to grasp the actual extent of third-party network activity occurring behind the scenes of everyday web browsing. This group values complete visibility into what servers their data touches and uses this insight to make informed choices about their privacy settings and tools.

- **Filter List Maintainers and Privacy Advocates**: Content blocker list creators and maintainers benefit from uBO Scope as it reveals network requests that bypass or interact with blocking rules. With detailed reports on attempted and actual connections, maintainers can refine filter lists more effectively even on devices where developer tools are limited.

- **Technical Users Evaluating Content Blockers**: Developers, security researchers, and tech-savvy users who want an objective and factual measure of content blocker reliability. uBO Scope helps dispel common misconceptions about block counts and misleading test pages by focusing on actual network outcomes.

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. Real-Time Monitoring of Third-Party Connections

**Scenario:** You’re browsing your favorite news site and want to know exactly how many and which third-party servers it’s connecting to, including those your current content blocker allows.

**How uBO Scope Helps:**
- Seen through uBO Scope’s badge count and popup, you get a transparent list of each distinct third-party domain contacted, broken down into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories.
- This direct feedback empowers you to judge whether your blocking solution meets your privacy expectations.

### 2. Improving Content Filtering Rules

**Scenario:** You maintain or contribute to filter lists that block trackers and ads but are unsure if your rules catch all connections, especially stealthy or indirect ones.

**How uBO Scope Helps:**
- By revealing stealth-blocked domains, the extension exposes connections that normal logs might miss.
- This lets maintainers identify gaps and adjust filters accordingly, optimizing block efficacy.

### 3. Verifying Content Blocker Effectiveness Beyond Simple Metrics

**Scenario:** You often see block counts advertised as proof of content blocker strength but want a more accurate, realistic evaluation.

**How uBO Scope Helps:**
- uBO Scope shows the actual number of unique third-party servers connected to, rather than just counting blocked requests.
- This approach corrects misunderstandings caused by inflated block numbers or misleading 'ad blocker test' websites.

## Best Practices for Target Users

- Make uBO Scope your first line of investigation when troubleshooting unexpected resource loads or privacy concerns.
- Use the popup to see domain counts and details while browsing, helping to instantly identify suspicious or excessive connections.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with your existing content blocking strategy for improved control and understanding.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Do not judge content blocker efficacy solely by high block counts; instead, consider distinct third-party connection counts as reported by uBO Scope.
- Avoid relying on ad blocker test websites; these give unrealistic impressions of network activity.
- Remember that the extension depends on browser support for the `webRequest` API and cannot track network requests that bypass it.
