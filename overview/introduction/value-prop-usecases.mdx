# Why Use uBO Scope? Key Value & Use Cases

## Unlock Complete Insight into Third-Party Connections

Modern websites often load resources not just from their own domains but from a myriad of third-party servers. While content blockers can limit unwanted content, many users have questions: How many third-party servers are actually contacted? Which connections truly succeed or get blocked? uBO Scope provides the definitive answer by exposing all remote connections attempted or completed by websites, independent of content blockers or DNS-level filtering.

### Key Benefits of Using uBO Scope

- **Reveal True Network Activity:** See every distinct third-party remote server your browser contacts while browsing, rather than relying on inferred or incomplete blocking statistics.
- **Validate Blocker Effectiveness:** Understand if your content blocker truly minimizes exposure to third parties by measuring actual distinct remote hosts reached.
- **Debunk Common Myths:** Expose misleading block counts and unreliable "ad blocker test" sites that can distort your privacy assumptions.
- **Empower Filter List Maintainers:** Access transparent data about network requests especially on devices with limited developer tools.
- **Simplify Browsing Privacy Analysis:** Gain confidence by quantifying connections beyond surface-level counts or superficial tests.

### Who Benefits Most?

- **Privacy-Conscious Users** who want clear evidence of third-party connections despite content blockers.
- **Security Enthusiasts** seeking to validate and compare the true impact of various blockers.
- **Filter List Maintainers** needing reliable data to refine and improve filter accuracy.
- **Developers & Researchers** looking for granular network data unfiltered by stealthy blocking techniques.

## Understanding uBO Scope’s Value

### Comprehensive Visibility into Network Connections
Unlike traditional content blockers that count blocked requests or stealthily suppress requests, uBO Scope gathers raw data about all network requests passing through the browser's webRequest API. This includes:

- Requests that were allowed and succeeded.
- Requests that were blocked or resulted in errors.
- Requests that were stealth-blocked or redirected.

This holistic snapshot ensures you see the full picture, revealing all connections *actually* made or attempted.

### Clarifying What Really Matters: Distinct Remote Servers
The toolbar badge in uBO Scope reports the count of *distinct third-party remote servers* accessed by the active tab—not just number of requests or filtered hits. This focus on unique remote hosts provides a more meaningful measure of privacy exposure or tracker reach, since connecting to many separate domains often increases tracking risk.

### Busting Popular Misconceptions

<u>Myth #1:</u> "A blocker with more blocked requests is better."

Reality: A blocker that shows more blocked attempts might ironically allow connections to *more* distinct third parties overall, which reduces privacy. uBO Scope highlights this by reporting distinct third-party domains rather than block counts.

<u>Myth #2:</u> "Ad blocker test pages give accurate blocker reliability results."

Reality: These pages often generate artificial or fabricated network requests not representative of real-world sites. Additionally, content blockers may stealthily block requests to prevent webpage breakage or detection, which these test pages cannot detect. uBO Scope reveals real network activity in practical browsing scenarios.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. For Privacy-Focused Individuals
Monitor how many third-party domains your browser communicates with on any given page. Use uBO Scope to identify unexpected or excessive connections that might erode privacy even if content blockers claim high blocking rates.

### 2. For Comparing Content Blockers
Rather than trusting toolbar block counts, use uBO Scope to benchmark content blockers by the actual exposure to third-party servers. This empowers informed choices based on what really impacts privacy.

### 3. For Filter List Maintainers
Gain valuable telemetry especially on platforms where developer tools or network inspectors are limited or unavailable. Use the data to tune filter rules by understanding which remote servers persist despite blocking.

### 4. For Developers and Security Researchers
uBO Scope provides raw network request outcomes without interference from stealth blocking, enabling clear audits and investigations into web request flows and privacy implications.

### 5. For Network Security Myth Busting
Respond authoritatively to false claims about blocking efficiency or stubborn ad-test sites. uBO Scope provides unbiased data to support factual discussions.

## Before and After uBO Scope

| Without uBO Scope                                  | With uBO Scope                                            |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Rely on blocker badges and potentially misleading block counts. | See the real number of distinct third-party servers contacted. |
| Trust ad-block test websites that may use false positives.      | Observe actual network behavior in real-world scenarios.        |
| Uncertainty about whether connections are truly blocked.        | Clear confirmation of blocked, allowed, and stealth-blocked endpoints. |
| Filter list maintainers work with incomplete data.              | Easily access transparent data to improve filter quality.        |

## Measuring Your Privacy Impact

Remember, a low number on the uBO Scope badge means fewer remote third-party servers are connected to, thereby minimizing tracking surface and enhancing privacy.

## Practical Tips for Using uBO Scope

- Always interpret the badge as the count of unique third-party remote servers — a lower count is better.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to validate actual blocking effectiveness.
- Avoid relying on "block counts" or unreliable blocker test sites for privacy assurance.
- If you're a filter list maintainer, look out for upcoming features providing deeper details on network requests.

<Tip>
When analyzing network activity, focus on distinct third-party domains reachable rather than just raw counts of blocked requests — uBO Scope visualizes this critical metric directly.
</Tip>

<Warning>
uBO Scope cannot track requests made outside the browser's webRequest API scope, such as those by external applications or new browser APIs not covered by webRequest.
</Warning>
