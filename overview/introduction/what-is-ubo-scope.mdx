# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlock Transparency into Third-Party Web Connections

When you browse the web, each page you visit often reaches out to multiple external servers, some necessary, others potentially intrusive. Understanding which external domains your browser connects to – regardless of any content blocker you use – is crucial for privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers.

**uBO Scope** is a lightweight browser extension designed precisely for this purpose: to reveal and categorize every third-party connection a webpage makes, shedding light on connections attempted, allowed, or blocked.

## Introducing uBO Scope

At its core, uBO Scope listens to all network requests initiated by the webpages you visit and tracks their outcomes. Whether a connection is successful, stealth-blocked (blocked before the browser handles it), or outright blocked by your content blockers or DNS filtering, uBO Scope collects this data and presents it clearly.

This clarity helps you see beyond the usual block counts shown by traditional blockers, focusing instead on the unique remote servers actually contacted by the page.

### The Challenge It Addresses

Many users assume that a higher block count in a content blocker means better protection. However, these numbers can be misleading:

- A content blocker with a high block count might still allow connections to numerous distinct third-party servers, increasing your exposure.
- Popular “ad blocker test” pages often produce unreliable results because they use fabricated requests that don't reflect real-world browsing.

uBO Scope busts these myths by providing accurate, concrete data on third-party connections, independent of other blockers’ metrics.

## How uBO Scope Works at a Glance

1. **Network Monitoring:** Using the browser's `webRequest` API, uBO Scope intercepts network requests as they occur.
2. **Connection Classification:** Each request is classified into one of three categories based on outcome:
   - **Allowed:** Requests successfully connected.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests blocked stealthily (e.g., via redirects).
   - **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked through errors or denials.
3. **Domain Aggregation:** Connections are aggregated by domain to present a concise count.
4. **User Interface:** The extension badge shows the count of distinct remote domains allowed.
5. **Data Presentation:** The popup panel groups third-party connections by category, helping you quickly identify unwanted connections.

Importantly, uBO Scope reports every third-party connection attempt regardless of which content blocker you use, or even if DNS-based blocking is in effect—accessing the network requests before they are fully resolved.

Note: uBO Scope cannot report network requests made outside the `webRequest` API scope (such as those from some service workers or native client apps).

## Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Privacy Awareness:** Become aware of all third-party domains contacted by the pages you visit. Many sites load resources from trackers, advertisers, or CDNs, and understanding this landscape empowers informed decisions.

- **Accurate Metrics:** Avoid relying on misleading ad blocker block counts or unreliable 'ad blocker test' websites. uBO Scope gives you the true distinct count of contacted third-party domains.

- **Independent Insight:** Works alongside any content blocker without interference, giving you a neutral, reliable source of information about network activity.

- **Filter List Development:** For filter list maintainers, uBO Scope is invaluable for validating the effectiveness of blocking lists and diagnosing stealth blocking or anomalies.

- **Efficiency Indicator:** A lower distinct third-party domain count (shown on the extension badge) indicates a leaner, more privacy-conscious browsing experience.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine you visit your favorite news website. Without uBO Scope, you see your content blocker’s badge: "100 blocks." Is that good or bad? Maybe the site actually contacts 50 unique tracking domains — some allowed, some blocked — but your blocker’s block count doesn't tell you how many different trackers actually got through.

With uBO Scope active, you open its popup panel and see:

- 10 allowed third-party domains (mostly CDNs and essential resources)
- 35 stealth-blocked domains
- 5 explicitly blocked domains

Now you know precisely which domains the page connected with and how your blockers intervened, helping you fine-tune your privacy tools or decide whether to switch blockers.

## Key Terms Explained

- **Third-Party Connections:** Network requests that involve domains other than the one of the website you are visiting.
- **Distinct Domains Count:** Number of unique third-party domains successfully contacted, tracked by uBO Scope’s badge.
- **Stealth Blocking:** Blocking methods that prevent requests without standard indications, often invisible to websites.

---

## Summary

uBO Scope provides straightforward, actionable transparency into your web browsing's third-party network landscape. It arms you with the facts needed to assess the true privacy exposure and evaluate content blockers effectively.

Explore and understand every connection your browser attempts on each page load, unlocking deeper control and knowledge.
