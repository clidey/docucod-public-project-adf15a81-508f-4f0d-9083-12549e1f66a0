# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlock Transparency in Your Web Browsing

In today’s complex web ecosystem, countless invisible connections link your browser tabs to remote servers worldwide. uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed expressly to reveal these connections with crystal-clear transparency. Unlike typical blockers or privacy tools, uBO Scope focuses on *disclosing* the network activity underneath, showing you exactly which servers your browser contacts — whether those connections were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked by your content blocker or other techniques.

## Understanding uBO Scope

At its core, uBO Scope is a monitoring companion to the popular uBlock Origin content blocker, but it works independently of which content blocker you use. The extension listens to your browser’s network events, capturing every attempted or successful connection between browser tabs and third-party servers. With this insight, it centers your privacy awareness on the *real* network traffic, cutting through obfuscation and guesswork.

### What Does uBO Scope Do?

- **Reveals All Network Connections:** See every remote server your open tabs are reaching out to, regardless of your blocking setup.
- **Captured Regardless of Blocking:** Whether connections are allowed, blocked by a content blocker, or stealth-blocked (hidden from the webpage), uBO Scope reports them transparently.
- **Presents Data in a User-Friendly Popup:** Instantly access connection summaries by clicking the extension icon, showing categorized lists of domains.
- **Reliable and Lightweight:** Built on browser-native APIs and a minimal interface, it introduces no performance overhead or intrusive features.

### Why is This Important?

The default appearance of the web hides many network activities, making it difficult to determine what external domains your browser truly interacts with. This lack of clarity can undermine your ability to audit privacy, security, or the effectiveness of content blockers.

uBO Scope empowers both everyday users and technical professionals by shining a light on:

- The *actual* third-party domains servers your browser communicates with.
- Differences between what content blockers block and allow.
- Insights into stealth-blocking techniques that browsers or extensions employ invisibly.


## How uBO Scope Works — At a High Level

uBO Scope hooks into your browser’s `webRequest` API to track each network request from the moment a tab initiates it. It meticulously records outcomes of these requests — whether successful, redirected, or blocked — mapping them to their origin tab and domain.

To ensure meaningful insights, uBO Scope leverages the Public Suffix List (PSL), a standard resource for understanding domain structures. This allows categorization of hostnames into higher-level domains, simplifying the overview.

Each tab’s summary distinguishes:

- **Allowed connections:** Requests that successfully reached their destination server.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Requests that were redirected or invisibly blocked, often as part of privacy-preserving techniques.
- **Blocked connections:** Requests that a content blocker or network error prevented.

From this, a clear and comprehensive landscape of a tab’s network footprint emerges.

## Distinctive Value of uBO Scope

- **Content Blocker Agnostic:** It works transparently atop any content blocker or privacy tool, reflecting real network behavior, not just what the blocker reports.
- **Emphasis on Everyday Privacy:** Gives users ongoing visibility instead of a one-time scan, helping maintain awareness over time.
- **Technical and Non-Technical Friendly:** While insightful for technical professionals auditing web traffic, its concise UI and summaries help anyone understand network connections.
- **Myth-Busting Tool:** Helps debunk common misconceptions about ad blockers and privacy metrics by showing the *actual* number of distinct servers contacted.


## Practical Example — What You See in the Popup

When you click the uBO Scope icon, the popup displays:

- The active tab's hostname and domain.
- A summary count of distinct connected domains.
- Three categorized lists:
  - Domains *not blocked* — connections allowed.
  - Domains *stealth-blocked* — connections redirected or hidden.
  - Domains *blocked* — connections prevented.

This hierarchical and count-based view lets users quickly grasp the scope of network activity tied to their browsing session.

```markdown
# Example popup layout

Tab: example.com (active tab hostname)

Domains connected: 12

Not Blocked:
- cdn.example-cdn.com (30 requests)
- analytics.partner.com (5 requests)

Stealth-Blocked:
- stealthtracker.com (3 requests)

Blocked:
- ads.tracker.com (10 requests)
```


## Benefits at a Glance

- **Enhanced Transparency:** No more guessing which domains your browser interacts with; get the facts.
- **Accurate Privacy Insight:** See how effective your blockers really are by understanding what connections they leave open.
- **Supports Privacy Research:** Useful for filter list maintainers, privacy advocates, and developers.

## Troubleshooting and Tips

- **If no data appears in the popup:** Ensure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions and that your browser’s webRequest API is active.
- **Why might domain counts seem low or high?** Remember that uBO Scope counts distinct domains contacted, not total requests — a lower count means fewer third-party connections.
- **Compatibility:** uBO Scope supports recent versions of major browsers including Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari.
