# Product Purpose & Value Proposition

## Unlock Transparency with uBO Scope

Discover the hidden network activity behind every webpage visit with uBO Scope, a lightweight browser extension designed to reveal all attempted or successful connections to remote third-party servers.

Simply put, uBO Scope empowers you to **see exactly who your browser is talking to** — uncovering every third-party server contacted during your browsing sessions.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **True Visibility Over Third-Party Requests:** Unlike traditional ad or content blockers that focus on blocking content, uBO Scope provides raw insight into all outgoing network connections, revealing the real scope of third-party interactions.
- **Badge Count Reflects Distinct Connected Domains:** The toolbar badge shows the exact number of unique third-party domains your browser connected to—not just blocked requests.
- **Independent of Blocking Methods:** Whether a request is blocked by DNS-based filters, stealth techniques, or other content blockers, uBO Scope reports on all network attempts as long as the browser exposes the request via its WebRequest API.
- **Ideal for Privacy-Conscious Users:** Understand exactly which external domains your browsing touches, enabling better privacy awareness.
- **Essential Tool for Filter List Maintainers:** On platforms where developer tools are inaccessible, uBO Scope acts as a reliable audit tool for monitoring network activity.

### Who Should Use This?

- Privacy-focused users who want to track and audit all third-party connections.
- Filter list maintainers seeking detailed, real-world data on network requests.
- Developers and security researchers aiming to verify content blocker effectiveness beyond simple block counts.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension that **reports on every network connection attempt to remote servers, whether allowed, blocked, or stealthily intercepted**. Its mission is to provide transparent insight into the network activity triggered by browsing, enabling users to understand their exposure to third-party servers.

### The Problem It Solves

Most content blockers show block counts or filtered resources, but these numbers can be misleading. A high block count may mask a larger, unblocked footprint of domains accessed, making it difficult to truly gauge privacy exposure.

uBO Scope cuts through this by showing:

- Every distinct third-party domain your browser contacts.
- Which connections were allowed, blocked, or stealthily redirected.

### Key Differentiators

- Transparency is its core: there’s no filtering or blocking, only reporting.
- Shows network activity independent of blocking strategy or method.
- Designed for accuracy and trustworthiness over flashy metrics.

### How It Works (At a High Level)

The extension hooks into the browser's WebRequest API to listen to all network requests (HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket). It uses a curated list of public suffixes to extract domains from request hostnames to count unique third-party connections.

It categorizes requests into three outcomes:

- **Allowed:** Successfully fetched domains.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed or were explicitly blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Redirected requests that evade typical blocking detection.

The extension then updates the toolbar badge count to reflect how many distinct third-party domains were contacted.

## Core Benefits of uBO Scope

### 1. Accurate Privacy Assessment
By showing distinct connected domains, you get a realistic snapshot of your web exposure rather than just block counts.

### 2. Mythbusting Common Misconceptions

- **Block Count ≠ Effectiveness:** uBO Scope clarifies that a high number of blocked requests does not mean fewer third-party connections.
- **Ad Blocker Test Pages Mislead:** Many test pages simulate unrealistic conditions; uBO Scope provides insights based on real browsing activity.

### 3. Broad Compatibility
Works alongside any content blocker or DNS filtering method as long as the browser reports network requests.

### 4. Support for Power Users and Maintainers
Provides a valuable tool for filter list authors and researchers to verify real network behavior on devices that might not support conventional developer tools.

## Real-World Example

Imagine visiting a news website. While the page loads, dozens of third-party servers may be contacted—for ads, analytics, content delivery, or social widgets.

With uBO Scope:

- You instantly see a badge showing how many unique third-party domains were contacted.
- Clicking the toolbar icon opens a detailed popup showing which domains were fetched successfully, which were blocked, and which were stealthily redirected.

This clear, comprehensive footprint allows you to make informed decisions about your privacy and the effectiveness of your blockers.

## Looking Ahead

This initial release focuses on accurate reporting with a simple UI showing connected domains. Future updates will add features tailored for filter list maintainers, including more granular details of each network request.

The extension is designed not to interfere with browsing but to complement your existing content blockers with transparency.

## Getting Started

To start understanding your browsing network footprint now:

1. Install uBO Scope from your browser's official add-on store:
   - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
   - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
2. Browse normally and watch the badge update with the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
3. Click the extension icon to explore detailed connection breakdowns.

For detailed setup and usage instructions, see the [Getting Started guide](/getting-started/introduction-and-setup/product-overview).

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- Remember, not all third-party connections are malicious or problematic; CDNs and essential services often count towards the total.
- If the badge count feels high, consider reviewing the domains list to identify unexpected third parties.
- uBO Scope relies on browser WebRequest APIs; some network activity outside this scope (e.g., TLS 1.3 encrypted DNS or OS-level network requests) will not be reported.
