# Who is uBO Scope for?

Discover if uBO Scope aligns with your needs by learning about its ideal users and how it empowers different audiences to gain real-time, transparent insights into third-party network connections while browsing.

## Unlocking Visibility into Network Connections

When you browse the web, countless network requests happen behind the scenes, often involving third-party servers beyond the website you visit. uBO Scope shines a bright light on these hidden connections, revealing which requests succeed, fail, or are stealthily blocked.

Understanding who benefits most from this transparency helps you decide how uBO Scope fits your privacy and analysis workflow.

## Ideal Users of uBO Scope

### 1. Privacy Enthusiasts and Informed Browsers

If you care deeply about privacy and tracking, uBO Scope offers you the power to see exactly which remote servers your browser contacts as you navigate the web. Unlike generic content blocker statistics or unreliable "ad blocker test" websites, uBO Scope delivers accurate, real-time data on the actual network interactions your browser performs.

- **What you achieve:** Know exactly how many and which distinct third-party servers successfully load content on your active webpage.
- **Why it matters:** A lower count of remote servers often means fewer trackers and less exposure to invasive advertising or data collection.

Example: While some ad blockers claim to block many requests, uBO Scope lets you verify whether the reported blocks truly reduce third-party server connections.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers and Content Blocker Developers

For maintainers responsible for curating filter lists that block ads and trackers, uBO Scope becomes an indispensable analytical companion.

- **What you achieve:** Monitor stealth blocking effectiveness and spot which requests evade filters or fail silently.
- **Why it matters:** Testing how filters work in real-world browsing environments enhances the quality and reliability of filter lists.

Use Case: On browsers or platforms where developer tools are limited or unavailable, uBO Scope grants access to granular network request outcomes, facilitating filter troubleshooting and improvement.

### 3. Skeptics of Ad Blocker Metrics and Test Pages

Many users encounter misleading claims about content blocker performance based on incomplete or artificial metrics. uBO Scope helps expose these myths by providing factual insights.

- **What you achieve:** Avoid being misled by toolbar block count badges or sketchy "ad blocker test" webpages that perform unrealistic network calls.
- **Why it matters:** Decisions about which blocker to trust or how well a site is protected should be based on real network activity—not inflated or fabricated statistics.

For instance, sites branded as "ad blocker test" pages often use fake requests that no legitimate website uses, skewing measurement results. uBO Scope shows you the real picture based on actual traffic.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Privacy Audit

Imagine you're visiting your favorite website and you suspect some trackers are still slipping through. Clicking uBO Scope’s icon immediately shows how many third-party domains connected successfully, which were blocked outright, and which were stealth-blocked.

With this information, you can decide if your content blocker or privacy settings need adjustment.

### Example 2: Filter List Debugging

A filter list maintainer notices a new tracker not being caught by current filters. With uBO Scope, they can watch real-time requests, see if these are stealthily allowed, and update rules accordingly without needing complex browser dev tools.

### Example 3: Debunking Common Assumptions

A user reads a forum claiming that an ad blocker with a higher block count is more effective. Using uBO Scope, they observe that a higher block count might accompany more connections overall, indicating the blocker might actually allow more third-party content.
