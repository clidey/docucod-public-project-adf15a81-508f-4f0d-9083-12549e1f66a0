# Why Use uBO Scope?

Discover the real story behind your browser's connections. uBO Scope sheds light on all remote server interactions your browser engages in — including those allowed, blocked, or hidden from typical browser tools. It empowers you to validate your content blocking setup objectively, debunk common misconceptions in the privacy space, and gain control over third-party network activity without needing advanced browser debugging tools.

## Understand Real-World Third-Party Network Activity

Web browsing today involves a complex web of network connections to servers beyond the site you intend to visit. Many of these are third-party domains related to advertising, analytics, content delivery, or other services. However, not all third-party connections are visible or transparent, especially when content blockers, stealth blocking techniques, or DNS-level filtering are involved.

uBO Scope provides a clear, trustworthy snapshot of:

- Third-party servers your browser **successfully connected** to.
- Third-party servers whose connection attempts were **blocked** either by extensions like uBlock Origin or other blockers.
- Third-party servers that are **stealth-blocked** — meaning the connection attempt was hidden or redirected, which common tools often cannot detect.

This level of insight is critical to grasp the full extent of what happens under the hood during your browsing sessions.

## Validate Effectiveness of Content Blockers Objectively

Many users equate content blocker quality with the number of blocked requests shown in badges or reports. This is misleading and can actually mask poor protection.

<u>Example:</u> An extension showing a high block count may still allow connections to a wider variety of third-party domains, leaving more privacy exposure than an extension with fewer but more precise blocks.

uBO Scope encourages a smarter approach by focusing on **the count of distinct third-party servers that are allowed connections**. A lower number here means you are indeed reducing exposure to these outside entities — the primary goal of most blockers.

Ensure that your blocker is not just noisy with blocking events, but genuinely effective in minimizing external connections.

## Debunk Myths About Content Blocker Reliability

### Myth 1: "Higher Block Count Means Better Blocking"

- Reality: The number of blocked requests alone is not a reliable quality metric.
- uBO Scope reveals if high block counts result in fewer or more distinct third-party connections.

### Myth 2: "Ad Block Test Pages Accurately Reflect Blocker Effectiveness"

- Reality: These test pages often use artificial scenarios and network requests that don't reflect real-world browsing.
- Many blockers use stealth techniques to prevent detection that test pages can't see.

By using uBO Scope, you can see the real-world impact — not just simulated or superficial test results.

## Empower Users Without Advanced Browser Tools

Not every user has access to or feels comfortable using complex browser developer tools or third-party monitoring software.

uBO Scope offers an accessible, straightforward interface right in your browser toolbar, listing all relevant third-party network activity in real time.

Whether you're a privacy-conscious user, an auditor, or a filter list maintainer, uBO Scope bridges the gap:

- Visualize allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains clearly.
- Understand the network environment of visited webpages at a glance.
- Filter lists and blockers can be tuned based on empirical evidence rather than guesswork.

## How It Fits Into Your Workflow

Imagine browsing your favorite news site. Without uBO Scope, you might only see that content loads quickly and ads are absent. But are there hidden connections to trackers or ad servers occurring in the background?

With uBO Scope:

1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon during or after page load.
2. Instantly view a categorized list of domains contacted:
   - Allowed (loaded content)
   - Stealth-blocked (hidden or redirected blocks)
   - Blocked (explicitly prevented connections)
3. Use this data to assess if your blockers effectively minimize exposure.

Start trusting the numbers and results that truly matter to your privacy.

## Practical Tips

- Use uBO Scope in conjunction with uBlock Origin or other content blockers to get a comprehensive picture.
- If you see a high number of allowed third-party connections on sites where you expect strong blocking, investigate and adjust your filters.
- Beware of over-relying on ad block test pages – use real browsing sessions with uBO Scope as your quality gauge.

## Common Pitfalls

- Assuming toolbar badge counts fully represent blocker strength — uBO Scope clarifies that they do not.
- Mistaking stealth-blocked domains as allowed or missed in reports — uBO Scope exposes these hidden attempts.
- Overlooking legitimate third-party domains (like major CDNs) that are usually benign — not all third-party connections are threats.

## Summary

uBO Scope is your definitive tool for transparency and control over third-party network activity from your browser tabs. It grounds your privacy efforts in real-world data, dispels misleading myths, and makes network monitoring accessible without advanced expertise.
