# Feature Highlights at a Glance

Discover the core strengths of uBO Scope — a browser extension designed to bring you clear, real-time insight into web page network activity. This guide highlights the key features that help you understand the domains your browser connects to, how these connections are categorized, and its seamless compatibility across major browsers.

---

## Real-Time Domain Connection Visualization

uBO Scope offers an immediate snapshot of network connections initiated by the active tab. Instantly see which domains your current page communicates with, categorized by how the extension perceives these connections:

- **Allowed**: Domains the browser successfully accessed.
- **Blocked**: Domains where requests were explicitly blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains with connections that were redirected or hidden, indicating stealthy blocking.

This classification empowers you to assess online activity transparently as it happens, enhancing privacy awareness and troubleshooting.


## Distinct Badge Counting

uBO Scope doesn’t simply tally connections; it counts **distinct domains**, providing a meaningful metric rather than inflated request counts. This ensures:

- **Accuracy**: Badge represents unique third-party domains connected, not repeated requests.
- **Insightful Indicators**: Get a quick understanding right on the browser toolbar without needing to open the popup.

This distinct counting helps you gauge the actual exposure your browsing session has to external domains efficiently.

## Clear Classification of Connection Outcomes

Understanding network outcomes is critical. uBO Scope uses three precise categories to classify domains:

- **Allowed** – Domains with successful connections, showing where your browser interacts without restrictions.
- **Blocked** – Domains whose requests were denied, often by content blockers or network policies.
- **Stealth-Blocked** – Domains where connections were covertly redirected or suppressed to avoid detection.

This classification gives you a layered understanding of your network context, revealing more nuanced behaviors than simple allowed/blocked binaries.


## Cross-Browser Compatibility

Designed with flexibility in mind, uBO Scope supports major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. This means:

- **Consistent Experience**: Access the same insights regardless of your choice of browser.
- **Unified Interface**: A familiar popup and badge experience across platforms.
- **Smooth Integration**: Uses webRequest and storage APIs compatible with all supported browsers.

No matter your environment, uBO Scope delivers reliable, up-to-date network connection data.

## Where to Find These Features in the UI

- **Popup Interface**: Displays lists of third-party domains connected by the current tab, separated by categories (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked).
- **Browser Action Badge**: Shows the numeric count of **distinct allowed domains** connected.
- **Popup Header**: Highlights the main site domain and any subdomains involved in the current tab session.

This intuitive UI mapping ensures effortless interpretation of complex network data.

## Practical Examples

Imagine browsing a popular news site and wondering how many third-party domains it contacts. uBO Scope’s badge count immediately signals your exposure level. Opening the popup quickly reveals not only those domains successfully contacted but also which were blocked — and if any stealth-blocking is occurring, alerting you to potential hidden activity.

For filter list maintainers, this granular, categorized reporting enables validation of blocking rules and detection of evasive networking habits.

---

## Tips for Users

- Check the badge count regularly to stay aware of third-party activity.
- Use the popup categories to distinguish trusted domains versus suspicious or blocked ones.
- Recognize stealth-blocked listings as potential signs of covert blocking or redirection.
