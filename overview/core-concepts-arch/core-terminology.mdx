# Key Terms & Concepts

Understanding key terminology is essential to effectively interpret the data provided by uBO Scope. This page clarifies fundamental concepts such as third-party remote servers, allowed versus blocked requests, stealth connections, and the significance of the toolbar badge count. By mastering these concepts, you will better comprehend the network activities of webpages and make informed decisions about privacy and security.

## What Are Third-Party Remote Servers?

Third-party remote servers are external domains contacted by a webpage that are different from the domain you are visiting. These connections often include content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics services, advertisement networks, or other external resources embedded or requested by the main site.

For example, when visiting `example.com`, any network requests made to domains like `cdn.example.net` or `analytics.example.org` are considered third-party.

**Why This Matters:**

- Each third-party connection broadens the surface for potential privacy exposure.
- Fewer distinct third-party remote servers typically mean less tracking and better privacy.

<u>Important:</u> Not all third parties are harmful; many provide essential functionality such as loading fonts or images.

## Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Requests

### Allowed Requests
These are network connections that succeeded and were not blocked by any content blocker or browser restriction.

- They represent resources the browser loaded successfully.
- The domains appear under the **"not blocked"** category in the toolbar popup.

### Blocked Requests
These requests were explicitly prevented from completing, either by your content blocker, DNS-based blocking, or other security mechanisms.

- The domain names appear under the **"blocked"** category.
- Blocked requests never successfully fetch data from the remote server.

### Stealth Connections
Stealth connections represent network requests that were either redirected or blocked in ways that are not immediately visible to webpages.

- These are shown under the **"stealth-blocked"** category.
- They help reveal when content blockers are operating silently to mitigate connectivity without exposing obvious blocking behavior to the webpage.

**Example Scenario:**

A third-party cookie request might be redirected or hidden by a content blocker, and while the user sees the content loading normally, stealth mode shows these suppressed connections for transparency.

## Toolbar Badge Explained

The toolbar icon badge displays a **count of distinct third-party allowed domains** contacted by the active tab’s webpage.

- **Lower count is better:** A smaller number indicates fewer third-party connections, implying better privacy and possibly fewer trackers.
- The badge does not count blocked or stealth connections.
- This measure reflects *actual* remote servers contacted, not just network requests initiated.

**What You See vs. What It Means:**

- Sometimes users misinterpret high block counts as better blocking; uBO Scope clarifies that a *lower number of allowed third parties* is the true indicator of privacy efficiency.
- This badge helps you evaluate the real impact of your content blocker or network environment.

## Why Understanding These Concepts Improves Your Experience

By grasping these terms, you can:

- Accurately interpret the data shown in the extension popup.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of content blockers beyond misleading block counts.
- Identify potentially risky third-party domains your browser contacts.
- Understand silent operations (stealth mode) that protect your browsing.

---

## Practical Tips for Using uBO Scope Data

- Use the popup to see separated lists of allowed, blocked, and stealth domains.
- Focus on reducing allowed third-party remote servers when aiming to improve privacy.
- Recognize that stealth-blocked domains often indicate advanced or silent blocking techniques protecting your browsing.
- Remember the badge count corresponds exactly to unique allowed third-party domains for each tab.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Misunderstandings About Key Terms">
<Accordion title="Misreading the Toolbar Badge">
Users sometimes see a low badge count but still suspect tracking. The badge *only* counts unique allowed third-party domains, not the total number of requests. If you see a low count, this means fewer third-party domains are contacted, not necessarily the absence of all tracking attempts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Assuming Block Count Indicates Blocking Strength">
A high number of blocked requests does not guarantee better privacy. It may mean more network requests are made but fewer are blocked. uBO Scope focuses on the number of *allowed* third-party domains for accurate insight.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Confusing Stealth Blocked with Allowed">
Stealth-blocked connections may still involve redirections or hidden blocks. These are not allowed requests but represent a quieter blocking method. They are best understood as privacy protection measures working in the background.
