# Core Terminology and Concepts

Understanding the key terminology and concepts used by uBO Scope is crucial for interpreting its data accurately and making the most out of the extension’s insights. This page defines essential terms like 'third-party connection,' and explains states such as 'allowed,' 'blocked,' and 'stealth,' while clarifying how the badge count reflects these network activities.

## What is a Third-Party Connection?

A third-party connection is any network request initiated by the browser that targets a domain different from the one of the website being visited. For example, if you visit `example.com` and your browser fetches resources from `analytics.service.com`, this is a third-party connection because it involves a different domain.

uBO Scope focuses explicitly on these connections because they reveal which remote servers your browser contacts beyond the primary site you are visiting. These connections often include trackers, ad networks, analytics services, or content delivery networks.

## Key Terms Defined

### Allowed Connections

- **Definition**: Network requests that were allowed by the content blocker or the browser and successfully completed.
- **Significance**: These represent third-party servers that the browser reached and exchanged data with.
- **Impact**: Allowed connections contribute to the badge count shown by uBO Scope and appear in the popup panel under the 'Allowed' section.

### Blocked Connections

- **Definition**: Requests that the content blocker or browser prevented from completing due to blocking rules or errors.
- **Significance**: These are third-party contacts that did not succeed and are typically unwanted.
- **Visibility**: Blocked connections are reported by uBO Scope and shown under the 'Blocked' section but do not contribute to the badge count.

### Stealth Connections

- **Definition**: A special category of third-party connections, including requests that were redirected or otherwise do not appear plainly in the page but are still network-level contacts.
- **Examples**: Redirects to third-party domains or invisible requests that might otherwise evade typical monitoring.
- **Visibility**: These connections appear separately in uBO Scope’s interface under 'Stealth'.

### Badge Count Explained

The badge shown on the browser toolbar by uBO Scope reports the count of distinct third-party domains with **allowed** connections during a browsing session on the active tab. Key points:

- It counts unique *domains*, not individual requests or hostnames.
- Blocked and stealth connections do not increase the badge count.
- This provides a clear and actionable indicator of how many distinct third-party domains your browser contacted successfully.

Understanding this distinction clarifies common misconceptions about blocker badge counts and test pages, offering users honest visibility into their actual network exposure.

## How Domains and Hostnames Are Determined

uBO Scope uses the [Public Suffix List (PSL)](https://publicsuffix.org/) to accurately compute the registrable domain portion of a hostname. This allows it to properly group network requests even when subdomains or complex domain structures are involved.

### Example

- Hostname: `tracker.analytics.example.co.uk`
- Registered domain (using PSL): `example.co.uk`

This ensures that all subdomain requests from the same base domain count as one distinct entity for badge calculations and reporting.

## Practical Implications for Users

Knowing these definitions helps you:

- Understand why some third-party connections appear in the popup but the badge count remains stable.
- Distinguish which domains your browser truly communicates with, aiding privacy and security assessments.
- Analyze stealth connections that may indicate hidden redirects or obscure network activity.

## Common Scenarios and User Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Asked Questions about Core Terminology">
<Accordion title="Why do some domains show up in the popup but not in the badge count?">
The badge count includes only **allowed** third-party domains. Blocked or stealth domains are listed in the popup panel but do not increment the badge count, as they represent blocked requests or redirects.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is the difference between a domain and a hostname in uBO Scope?">
A hostname is the full address of a server (e.g., `cdn.example.com`). A domain is the base registered name derived using the Public Suffix List (e.g., `example.com`). uBO Scope tracks both but organizes badge counting and reporting primarily by domain to avoid inflated counts from multiple subdomains.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does 'stealth' mean in the context of network requests?">
Stealth refers to network requests related to redirects or behind-the-scenes contacts that may not be visible in the page content but represent genuine third-party connections at the network level.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for Accurate Interpretation

- Always consider the badge count as an indicator of successful third-party contacts, not total requests made.
- Use the popup panel to explore detailed categories: allowed, blocked, and stealth.
- Remember that some trustworthy third-party domains (like content delivery networks) will appear as allowed connections.
- For privacy-critical browsing, focus on reducing allowed third-party counts.

For detailed reference, uBO Scope integrates [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) processing to precisely determine domains, ensuring reliability in third-party connection classification.

# Appendix: Example of Domain Extraction from Hostname

```javascript
// Example: Extracting domain from hostname
const hostname = 'tracker.ads.example.co.uk';
const domain = psl.getDomain(hostname) || psl.getPublicSuffix(hostname);
console.log(domain); // Outputs: 'example.co.uk'
```

This snippet mirrors how uBO Scope computes the domains to maintain consistent badge and popup statistics.
