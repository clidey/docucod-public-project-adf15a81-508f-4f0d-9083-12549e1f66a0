# Key Features at a Glance

Discover the essential capabilities of uBO Scope, a lightweight browser extension designed to provide clear, real-time insights into the network connections initiated by web pages. This page presents a concise overview of its core functionalities and how they empower you to understand and monitor third-party connections effectively.

## Network Request Monitoring Using the `webRequest` API

At the heart of uBO Scope lies its ability to monitor network traffic transparently through the browser's native `webRequest` API. This capability enables the extension to:

- Detect every network request initiated by the active browser tab, including those over HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and secure WebSocket protocols.
- Track the request lifecycle events such as redirects, successes, and errors, capturing a complete picture of network activity.
- Aggregate connection outcomes, allowing users to see which requests were allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.

**Benefit:** This granular monitoring helps you uncover all third-party servers contacted by the webpage, providing a more accurate view of your exposure than traditional block counters.

## Real-Time Badge Reporting on Browser Toolbar

uBO Scope integrates an intuitive badge on the browser toolbar icon, displaying the **number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted** by the current web page.

- The badge updates dynamically with every new network request.
- Only distinct third-party servers count towards the badge, emphasizing meaningful privacy metrics beyond raw block counts.
- A low number on this badge indicates fewer third-party connections, signaling tighter privacy control.

**Scenario:** When browsing sensitive sites, the badge immediately reveals if any unexpected third-party servers are contacted, alerting you to potential privacy risks.

## Detailed Domain Visibility in the Popup Interface

Clicking the toolbar icon opens a detailed popup UI that presents:

- The **total count of connected domains**, reinforcing the badge number with expanded context.
- Separate sections listing domains based on request outcomes:
  - **Allowed:** Domains successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains that were redirected or stealthily blocked behind the scenes.
  - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked.
- Each domain includes a count showing how many requests were made or blocked.

This transparent categorization allows you to investigate exactly which third-party servers interact with each webpage.

**Example:** You visit an online newspaper; the popup reveals allowed domains like content delivery networks (CDNs), stealth-blocked ad trackers, and blocked malware servers, enabling informed decisions or further blocking.

## Broad Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope supports all modern browsers exposing network event APIs including:

- Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge)
- Mozilla Firefox
- Apple Safari

This robust compatibility ensures consistent user experience and privacy insights across platforms where network event monitoring is feasible.

**Benefit:** Users maintain privacy visibility in their browser of choice without compromise.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Interpreting the Badge:** Focus on the badge number rather than block counts — fewer distinct third-party servers connected typically means better privacy.
- **Using the Popup:** Regularly check the popup details after visiting unknown websites to detect hidden or stealthy connections.
- **Understanding Outcomes:** Allowed domains are those genuinely letting content through; stealth-blocked domains may be silently redirected by content blockers and blocked domains are explicitly prevented — all essential to grasp your actual network exposure.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't rely solely on block count metrics from other extensions or test pages to gauge privacy; uBO Scope's server-centric approach gives a truer picture.
- Some browsers or browsing modes may limit the visibility of network events. Make sure your environment supports the `webRequest` API for full functionality.
