# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the core terms and concepts behind uBO Scope is essential for accurately interpreting its reports about web activity. This page introduces the foundational vocabulary used throughout the extension’s interface and documentation, focusing on how it classifies and tracks network connections from web pages.

---

## What Is a Third-Party Remote Server?

At the heart of uBO Scope’s monitoring is the notion of a 'third-party remote server.' This concept is critical to understanding how the extension counts connections and assigns them to domains:

- **First-party domain:** This is the domain of the website you are visiting, typically the main frame domain of the browser tab.
- **Third-party domain:** Any domain different from the first-party from where the webpage causes network requests.
- **Remote server:** The network server corresponding to a particular domain that hosts content or resources requested by the web page.

uBO Scope identifies and counts distinct third-party remote servers contacted during page loading, giving insight into privacy risks and tracking exposures.

---

## Badge Count Explained

The **badge count** is the number displayed on the browser toolbar icon for uBO Scope. Unlike traditional blockers that show block counts, uBO Scope's badge shows:

- The **number of distinct third-party domains** for which there was a network connection from the page.

This count reflects servers that were successfully connected to, offering a more meaningful metric about resource fetching and potential tracking than blocks alone.

> **Tip:** A lower badge count signals fewer remote third-party connections, typically indicating better privacy.

---

## Domain and Hostname Differentiation

uBO Scope tracks connections by **hostnames** and aggregates these into **domains**:

- A **hostname** is the fully qualified domain or subdomain of a network request URL (for example, `ads.tracker.example.com`).
- A **domain** is the base or registrable domain name extracted from the hostname, using the Public Suffix List to correctly identify domain boundaries (e.g., `example.com`).

By grouping hostnames into domains, uBO Scope simplifies network connection reports and highlights distinct third-party entities.

---

## Outcome Categories of Connections

uBO Scope classifies each third-party connection into one of three distinct outcomes:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** Network requests that succeeded and resources were fetched from the third-party server.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed due to blocking by content blockers or other mechanisms, preventing resource loading.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were redirected or altered in ways that hide or mask the blocking, such as redirects that evade detection.

Each outcome is reported separately in the extension popup with counts per domain, helping users understand not just what was blocked, but how blocking behavior manifests.

---

## How Distinct Connections Are Tracked

Each network request initiated by the web page is analyzed with respect to:

- The **initiating tab and frame**
- The **hostname and domain** of the remote server
- The **request outcome** (allowed, blocked, stealth)

uBO Scope maintains maps of domains and hostnames for each outcome category, incrementing counts accordingly. For example, repeated requests to the same domain increase its count but only count once towards distinct domain tally.

This granular tracking allows uBO Scope to present an accurate picture of third-party connections per page load.

## Glossary of Key Terms

| Term                     | Definition                                                                                         |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Third-Party Remote Server | Any remote server contacted by the web page that is not part of the first-party domain.          |
| Badge Count              | Number displayed on the extension toolbar icon representing distinct third-party domains contacted. |
| Allowed Domain           | A third-party domain for which at least one network request succeeded (not blocked).             |
| Blocked Domain           | A third-party domain whose network requests were blocked by the content blocker or other means.  |
| Stealth Domain           | A third-party domain affected by redirect or obfuscation methods that mask blocking.             |
| Domain                   | The registrable base domain extracted from hostnames for aggregation (e.g., example.com).       |
| Hostname                 | The full domain or subdomain of a network request URL (e.g., ads.example.com).                    |
| Public Suffix List       | A list used to extract the base registrable domain from hostnames by identifying domain suffixes.|

## Practical Example: Interpreting a Report

Imagine visiting `example.com`, and the popup shows:

- Allowed: `trackingcdn.net (5)`
- Stealth-blocked: `ads.tracker.org (2)`
- Blocked: `analytics.service.com (1)`

This means the page connected successfully to five different hostnames under `trackingcdn.net`. Two connections to `ads.tracker.org` were stealth-blocked — they were redirected or hidden. One connection to `analytics.service.com` was explicitly blocked.

The badge count would display `3` since three distinct third-party domains have recorded connections (counting allowed but not blocked or stealth separately).

---

## Best Practices for Users

- Use the badge count to assess the **extent of third-party connections** instead of relying on block counts.
- Pay attention to stealth-blocked domains which may indicate subtle tracking evasion techniques.
- Familiarize yourself with the domain versus hostname distinction to understand reports clearly.
- Remember that not all third-party connections are malicious; some, like CDNs, are essential and expected.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Terminology Questions">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count sometimes change unexpectedly?">
Connections can fluctuate as webpages load and scripts initiate additional requests dynamically. The badge updates in near real-time to reflect these changes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is the difference between stealth-blocked and blocked?">
Stealth-blocked connections are those blocked indirectly or via redirection tricks that conceal the blocking from normal detection, while blocked connections are explicitly prevented.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does uBO Scope identify the domain from a hostname?">
It uses the Public Suffix List (PSL) to determine the base registrable domain ensuring accuracy even with complex domain suffixes (e.g., `co.uk`).
