# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the key concepts and terminology behind uBO Scope is essential for interpreting its insights and using it effectively. This page defines foundational terms such as 'third-party remote server', the different connection outcome categories (allowed, blocked, stealth), the badge count indicator, and the crucial role played by the browser's `webRequest` API in tracking network requests.

---

## What Is a Third-Party Remote Server?

In the context of uBO Scope, a *third-party remote server* is any server hosting a resource or service requested by a webpage where the server's domain differs from the main site domain you are visiting.

- **Example Scenario:**
  - You're visiting `example.com`.
  - The webpage loads images or scripts from `cdn.example.net` or `analytics.trackerservice.com`.
  - These external domains are third-party remote servers relative to the site `example.com`.

uBO Scope tracks all these third-party connections to give you complete visibility into which external servers your browser attempts to communicate with.

---

## Connection Outcomes: Allowed vs. Blocked vs. Stealth

uBO Scope categorizes network requests by their fate to highlight the effectiveness of any content blocking and help you understand your web traffic:

- **Allowed Connection:** The request to a third-party server was completed successfully (resource loaded).
- **Blocked Connection:** The request was explicitly blocked by your content blocker or by any extension or mechanism that results in failure.
- **Stealth Connection:** A connection that was blocked in a stealthy manner, meaning it was suppressed without obvious failure signals to the webpage. This helps reveal connections that content blockers hide to avoid detection or webpage breakage.

These categories allow users to understand both visible network activity and hidden, stealth-blocked requests that can otherwise go unnoticed.

---

## Badge Count: What Does It Represent?

The numeric badge displayed on the browser toolbar icon shows the **number of distinct third-party domains from which a connection was allowed** during the current active tab session.

- A **lower count** is better because it means fewer third-party servers successfully connected, implying better privacy or content control.
- The badge **excludes blocked and stealth-blocked connections** from its count.

This count helps users quickly grasp the extent of third-party content exposure while browsing.

---

## The Role of the Browser's `webRequest` API

uBO Scope relies heavily on the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network requests made by webpages. Here's how it supports the extension’s core functionality:

- The `webRequest` API reports every network request event, including:
  - Requests starting,
  - Redirects,
  - Responses received,
  - And any errors or failures.
- Using this API, uBO Scope passively records the origin, target domain, and result of each network request, classifying it as allowed, blocked, or stealth.
- Importantly, this API is the backbone of uBO Scope’s ability to provide detailed, real-time insights into third-party connections regardless of which content blocking methods are active.

### Important Note

Network requests that occur outside the reach of the `webRequest` API (for example, some internal browser processes or network-level DNS blocking) **cannot** be reported by uBO Scope. However, for most common browsing scenarios, this API provides comprehensive coverage.

## How uBO Scope Tracks and Categorizes Requests

Here’s a simplified flow illustrating how uBO Scope processes network requests to update your active tab’s data:

1. **Tracking New Requests:**
   - When the browser initiates a network request related to a tab, uBO Scope captures it via `webRequest` listeners.

2. **Determining Domain and Hostname:**
   - It extracts the request’s hostname and identifies the effective registrable domain using the Mozilla Public Suffix List.

3. **Classifying the Outcome:**
   - Based on event (`success`, `redirect`, or `error`) and response status, uBO Scope classifies the request outcome.

4. **Categorizing the Connection:**
   - Adds the domain/hostname counts to the corresponding category: allowed, stealth, or blocked.

5. **Updating the Browser’s UI:**
   - Adjusts badge counts and popup content dynamically to reflect the current third-party connection landscape.

This model provides users a clear, continuously updated view of third-party servers linked to their active browsing session.

## Key Terms at a Glance

| Term                 | Definition                                                                                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Third-Party Server**| Any domain different from the main site that hosts requested content or services                 |
| **Allowed Connection**| Network request completed successfully to a third-party server                                  |
| **Blocked Connection**| Network request explicitly blocked by content blockers or extensions                            |
| **Stealth Connection**| Network request blocked without visible indication, meant to avoid webpage detection           |
| **Badge Count**       | Number of distinct third-party domains from which connections were allowed in the current tab |
| **webRequest API**    | Browser API used to monitor and intercept network requests                                    |

## Practical Example

Imagine browsing `news.example.com`, which pulls content from:

- `cdn.example.com` (allowed connection)
- `tracker.adsservice.net` (blocked connection)
- `analytics.stealthblocker.com` (stealth-blocked connection)

uBO Scope will:

- Show a badge count of "1" highlighting only the allowed third-party `cdn.example.com`.
- List these domains in the popup interface under their respective outcome sections — "not blocked", "blocked", and "stealth-blocked" — giving you immediate insight into real-time network traffic.

---

## Tips for Users

- **Interpreting Badge Counts:** Lower is better — fewer distinct third-party connections improve privacy.
- **Review the Popup:** Use the popup interface to see specific domains categorized by outcome.
- **Stealth Connections Matter:** Identify stealth-blocked requests to understand hidden third-party activities.
- **Understand Limitations:** Some network requests may not be visible if they bypass the browser's `webRequest` API.

# Glossary

### Public Suffix List (PSL)
The list used by uBO Scope to determine the registrable domain from a hostname. This ensures domains like `example.co.uk` are correctly identified as a whole.

### Hostname
The full domain portion of a URL (e.g., `subdomain.example.com`).

### Effective Registrable Domain
The domain obtained by trimming subdomains, using the PSL rules (e.g., `example.com` or `example.co.uk`). This is critical to correctly group requests for badge counts and display.

---

For technical details of the PSL usage and implementation inside uBO Scope, see the [publicsuffixlist.js](../js/lib/publicsuffixlist.js) source and [assets/thirdparties/publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat](../assets/thirdparties/publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat).
