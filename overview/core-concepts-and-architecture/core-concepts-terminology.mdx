# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the key terms and concepts behind uBO Scope is essential to effectively interpret the data it presents and to make informed decisions about your browser’s network connections. This page defines the main terminology you will encounter throughout the extension and clarifies what each represents in terms of privacy, connection monitoring, and content blocking.

## What You Will Learn Here

- The nature of network requests as observed by uBO Scope
- How domains and hostnames are understood and processed
- The meaning of different request outcomes: allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked
- The significance of third-party connections and public suffixes
- How these concepts interrelate to facilitate meaningful analysis

## Network Requests: The Building Blocks of Analysis

Every network request your browser initiates to load a webpage or resource is tracked by uBO Scope. These requests are monitored regardless of whether they succeed, fail, or are blocked by content blockers or DNS-level filtering.

- **Request:** A single HTTP or WebSocket connection attempt made by the browser.
- **Outcome:** The final status of a request, categorized as one of the following:
  - **Allowed:** The request successfully connected and fetched resources.
  - **Blocked:** The request was prevented from completing, typically by a content blocker.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** The request was silently blocked such that the webpage is unaware of the blocking (i.e., stealth blocking).

<u>_Example scenario:_</u> When you visit a website, your browser may contact multiple remote servers. uBO Scope shows you which of these connection attempts were allowed through, which were blocked explicitly, and which ones were stealth-blocked by the extension or other means.

## Hostnames and Domains: Organizing Connections

- **Hostname:** The full network address of the server queried, for example, `img.cdn.example.com`.
- **Domain:** The higher-level grouping of related hostnames based on the Public Suffix List, such as `example.com`.

uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List (PSL) to accurately determine the domain from a hostname, which is critical to grouping requests properly. The PSL helps differentiate between registrable domains and public suffixes (like `.com`, `.co.uk`, or more complex rules).

- The extension supports internationalized domain names (IDNs), translating punycode-encoded hostnames into readable Unicode where possible.

<u>_Real-world relevance:_</u> By grouping connections under domains rather than raw hostnames, uBO Scope provides clarity on how many distinct third-party entities your browser connects to, helping you spot and minimize unnecessary and potentially privacy-invasive connections.

## Outcome Status Explained

Understanding the outcome status is key to interpreting connection data.

### Allowed
These requests were permitted and successfully completed. They represent third-party domains or the main site domain that contributed resources to the page.

### Blocked
Requests that were explicitly prevented from loading by content blockers or because the network request failed. These are visible to both you and the webpage.

### Stealth-blocked
Requests that were silently discarded without informing the webpage, typically to maintain site functionality or avoid detection by anti-blocking scripts. This provides a more effective blocking layer without alerting trackers or the site.

## Third-Party Connections: What They Mean

uBO Scope differentiates first-party from third-party connections using domain relationships:

- **First-party:** Requests to hostnames within the domain of the website you are visiting.
- **Third-party:** Requests to domains outside the visited site's domain.

Third parties often include ad networks, analytics providers, CDNs, and trackers. Monitoring these connections helps users understand their exposure and control unwanted data sharing.

By focusing on distinct third-party servers, uBO Scope surfaces the quantity and nature of external entities involved in loading a page.

---

## Public Suffix: Why It Matters

The Public Suffix List maintained by authorities like Mozilla defines suffixes under which internet users can directly register domain names. Examples include `.com`, `.co.uk`, and even more granular ones like `.kawasaki.jp`.

uBO Scope leverages this list to:

- Correctly identify the registrable domain portion of hostnames.
- Group requests by these domains, providing a meaningful count of distinct entities.

This prevents overcounting subdomains and better reflects the true scope of remote connections.

---

## How uBO Scope Measures and Displays Data

uBO Scope collects and organizes connection data per browser tab, displaying it in the popup panel as:

- The current tab's hostname and domain
- Counts of distinct domains and hostnames connected
- Separate sections for each outcome category (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked)

This categorization empowers you to quickly assess network activity related to any tab and spot potential privacy risks or unwanted third-party connections.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Lower Count Is Better:** The toolbar badge counts distinct third-party domains with allowed connections. A lower number typically means fewer entities tracking or serving content.
- **Interpret Stealth Blocking:** A noticeable amount of stealth-blocked connections means the extension is working silently to protect your privacy without disrupting browsing.
- **Use Domain Grouping Wisely:** Understand that multiple subdomains under a known domain count as one entity—this helps prioritize which third parties are most involved.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Misinterpreting Counts:** A high number of blocked connections does not necessarily mean better blocking; focus on allowed third-party counts for true effectiveness.
- **Ignoring Public Suffix Effects:** Without the public suffix list, domains would be misgrouped, leading to skewed counts.
- **Expecting All Blocked Requests Visible:** Some requests are stealth-blocked and won’t appear as blocked in other tools but are crucial to de-obfuscate with uBO Scope.

## Summary

Knowing these core concepts and terminology equips you to make the most of uBO Scope’s insights. With this foundation, you can confidently analyze the remote network activity your browser performs and better understand the privacy implications.
