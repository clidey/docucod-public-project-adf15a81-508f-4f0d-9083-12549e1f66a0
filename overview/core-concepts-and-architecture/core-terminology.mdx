# Core Terminology

Understanding the key terms used within uBO Scope’s reports and interface is essential to effectively interpreting the extension's insights on network activity. This page introduces and explains crucial vocabulary such as 'third-party server', 'allowed', 'blocked', 'stealth', and 'badge count', ensuring you become fluent in the language that drives uBO Scope’s functionality.

## Third-Party Server

A 'third-party server' refers to any remote server that is different from the domain of the website you are currently visiting. For example, if you visit `example.com` and a connection is made to `cdn.someservice.com`, this remote server is a third party.

uBO Scope specifically tracks these third-party connections because they often represent external content providers such as advertising networks, analytics platforms, or content delivery networks (CDNs).

Understanding which third parties your browser is connecting to is critical for privacy monitoring and evaluating content blocker effectiveness.


## Allowed

The term **allowed** denotes network requests that successfully reach their destination third-party servers without being blocked by any content blocker or security policy.

- These requests result in resources being fetched and loaded on the page.
- The **allowed** category indicates that connections to these domains were permitted to complete.

In uBO Scope, allowed domains and hostnames are organized and counted to reveal which remote servers your browser actively communicates with.


## Blocked

A **blocked** network request is one that was deliberately prevented from completing, typically by a content blocker such as uBlock Origin or other filtering rules.

- These requests fail to connect or are cancelled before loading any resource.
- Blocked connections usually represent unwanted or potentially harmful third-party servers, such as trackers or ads.

Tracking blocked outcomes helps you understand which servers have been kept out by your filtering configurations and measures the extent of your content blocking.


## Stealth

The **stealth** category is unique to uBO Scope’s reporting:

- It represents network requests where redirection events occurred.
- These redirections happen in a way that can bypass detection by the webpage’s original scripts, effectively "stealth blocking" the request.

Stealth blocking is a sophisticated mechanism some content blockers use to avoid webpage breakage or detection of blocking behavior.

This category helps users and filter list maintainers understand which third-party requests are intercepted without obvious blocking signals, providing more transparent insight than typical block counts.


## Badge Count

The **badge count** is the number displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon in your browser.

- It represents the **number of distinct third-party domains for which connections were attempted or successful** during browsing.
- A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party remote servers are being contacted, which generally implies a cleaner and more private browsing experience.

It is important to note this count is not merely a tally of blocked requests but instead counts unique domains contacted, helping you cut through misleading metrics used by some content blockers.


## Domain vs. Hostname

- A **hostname** is the full name for a specific location on the internet (e.g., `a.b.c.example.com`).
- A **domain** is a higher-level grouping, usually representing the registered entity (e.g., `example.com`).

uBO Scope extracts the effective domain using the Public Suffix List to aggregate connection data meaningfully across subdomains.

## Putting It All Together: How These Terms Work in uBO Scope

Imagine you open a website, and uBO Scope monitors all network requests made. Each connection attempt is classified into one of the three outcomes:

- **Allowed:** The connection succeeded and fetched resources.
- **Blocked:** The connection was prevented or failed.
- **Stealth:** The connection was silently redirected, masked from detection by the webpage.

The extension then counts unique third-party domains involved in these outcomes to:  
- Update the badge count for quick at-a-glance insight.
- Populate the popup UI with detailed lists of allowed, blocked, and stealth domains.

This classification and reporting empower you to identify which remote servers are interacting with your browser and whether they are being allowed, blocked, or stealthily intercepted.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Focus on distinct third-party domains** instead of block counts for a clear picture of your privacy exposure.

- Regularly check the **allowed** list to identify legitimate third-party services, like CDNs, which are necessary for site functionality.

- Use the **stealth** list to detect and understand subtle blocking behaviors that may not be visible in traditional block metrics.

- Remember, a **lower badge count is better** as it means fewer unique third parties are connected.

- Understanding these terms helps debunk common myths about content blockers that use misleading counts to appear more effective.

## Troubleshooting Common Terminology Confusion

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions">
<Accordion title="Why do some third parties show in stealth rather than blocked or allowed?">
Stealth indicates the network request was redirected in a manner that avoids detection by the webpage’s scripts, often a strategy content blockers use to prevent breakage. This is different from outright blocking or allowing, representing a middle ground where the request is intercepted silently.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does a high block count mean better protection?">
No. High block counts can mean your content blocker allows more connections overall, including to more varied third parties. uBO Scope shows the number of unique third-party domains connected to, which is a more accurate privacy metric.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What exactly counts as a 'third-party'?">
Any remote server whose domain differs from the domain of the page you are visiting. For example, if you're on example.com, a server at cdn.anotherdomain.com is considered third-party.
