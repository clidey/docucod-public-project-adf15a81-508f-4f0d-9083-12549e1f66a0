# Feature Overview

uBO Scope offers powerful, real-time insight into your browser's network connections, enabling you to understand and analyze which remote servers your tabs interact with. This page summarizes the core features that make uBO Scope an essential tool for privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers alike.

---

## Key Features at a Glance

- **Domain-Level Connection Tracking:**
  The extension efficiently monitors connections per domain and hostname, recording every allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked request associated with each browser tab.

- **Visual Outcome Categorization:**
  Connection outcomes are categorized into **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth**, allowing you to quickly identify which third-party servers your browser successfully connected to, which were blocked outright, and which were stealth-blocked by extensions or filters.

- **Toolbar Badge with Real-Time Counts:**
  The extension icon displays a badge showing the count of distinct third-party domains successfully connected to in the active tab. This immediate visual feedback helps you gauge the extent of third-party communication on any website.

- **Cross-Blocker & DNS-Agnostic Reporting:**
  uBO Scope reports network request outcomes regardless of the content blocker or external DNS filtering in use. This ensures you get an accurate and holistic view of what your browser attempts and succeeds in loading.

- **Persistent Session Data:**
  All connection data per tab is maintained during your session, giving you consistent and reliable historical context as you browse.

- **Detailed Popup Panel:**
  The popup interface visualizes connections grouped by outcome, showing domain names with counts that help you quickly assess network activity.

## How These Features Work Together

When you navigate a webpage, uBO Scope activates webRequest listeners to observe every network request originating from the browser. It notes the hostname and domain of each connection and determines the outcome: was the request allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked?

This data is kept organized per browser tab, ensuring clarity around which third parties interact with each page you visit. For example, an active tab may show 5 allowed third-party domains, 2 stealth-blocked domains, and 1 blocked domain. This concise yet comprehensive breakdown allows fast analysis without the noise of raw network traffic.

The toolbar badge provides a quick glance visibility into your exposure level — fewer allowed third-party domains typically mean fewer potential privacy risks.

The extension’s session persistence ensures you can rely on stable data across your browsing session, without losing connection details as tabs reload or change.

## Real-World Use Case

Imagine auditing a popular news site on your browser. With uBO Scope, you open the popup panel and instantly see:

- **Allowed Domains:** Content delivery networks and essential third-party services that the site relies on.
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains:** Third-party trackers or ad services silently blocked by your filters, invisible to typical web tools.
- **Blocked Domains:** Hosts you explicitly filter out.

This granular visibility empowers you to: 
- Verify your content blocker’s effectiveness
- Identify suspicious or extra connections
- Understand the nature of third-party resources in use

---

## Practical Tips

- Prefer monitoring the badge count alongside the popup panel for fast and deep insights.
- Use uBO Scope in tandem with your preferred content blockers to verify actual connection outcomes beyond just block counts.
- Remember that stealth-blocked connections are not always visible in browser devtools, so uBO Scope fills that blind spot.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Don't assume a higher badge count means your blocker is failing; legitimate sites use several essential third parties.
- Stealth-block outcomes indicate connections prevented in subtle ways and should not be confused with outright allowed or blocked.
- uBO Scope relies on the browser's webRequest API; some network requests made outside this scope cannot be tracked.
