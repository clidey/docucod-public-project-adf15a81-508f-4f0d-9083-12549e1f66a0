# Quick Feature Overview

Discover the powerful capabilities of uBO Scope at a glance. This page highlights the key features that make uBO Scope an indispensable companion extension, providing real-time, actionable insights into your browser's network connections.

---

## Live Tracking of Domain Connections per Tab

uBO Scope continuously monitors and records the domains your browser communicates with on a per-tab basis. Whether a connection is successfully made, stealthily redirected, or blocked, uBO Scope captures it all in real time.

- **Real-Time Updates:** Network requests are tracked as they happen, allowing you to see live data on domains connected
- **Granular Tab Tracking:** Insights are organized by browser tab, helping you assess the connections relevant to your current browsing context

This live tracking ensures you always know which remote servers your browser contacts, enhancing your visibility and control.

## Dynamic Toolbar Badge Reflecting Allowed Domains

The extension icon badge dynamically updates to show the number of *distinct* third-party domains successfully connected in the active tab.

- **Intuitive Badge Count:** The badge displays how many unique third-party domains are allowed (not blocked)
- **At-a-Glance Transparency:** Quickly gauge the network footprint of a tab without opening the popup

> Note: Lower badge counts indicate fewer third-party connections, which generally translates to stronger privacy controls.

## Powerful Popup Panel with Categorized Insights

Clicking the uBO Scope icon opens a detailed popup panel that breaks down connection outcomes into clear categories:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains from which connections succeeded
- **Stealth Blocked:** Domains that were redirected or blocked stealthily, often by subtle content blockers
- **Blocked:** Domains for which connection attempts failed or were explicitly blocked

Each category lists connected domains with their respective connection counts, allowing detailed investigation directly from the popup.

## Cross-Browser Compatibility & Seamless Integration

uBO Scope is designed to work reliably across major modern browsers including Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari.

- **Consistent Behavior:** Identical functionality and UI regardless of your browser choice
- **Standard Permissions:** Utilizes the browser's WebRequest API and storage capabilities without requiring elevated privileges

This wide compatibility ensures that uBO Scope fits cleanly into your existing browser setup.

## Outcome Categorization Backed by Robust Network Event Processing

Behind the scenes, uBO Scope listens to browser webRequest events such as redirects, errors, and successes to assign each domain connection to its appropriate outcome category.

- **Allowed:** Successful network connections
- **Stealth:** Redirected or altered connections indicating stealth-blocking behavior
- **Blocked:** Failed or explicitly blocked network requests

This precise categorization empowers accurate assessment of web activity.

## Practical Example: Interpreting Popup Data

Imagine you open a news site. uBO Scope’s popup shows:

- **Not Blocked:** 5 domains including the main site and a CDN
- **Stealth Blocked:** 2 domains related to tracking services that were silently redirected
- **Blocked:** 3 domains for which requests were explicitly blocked

You instantly understand which connections are allowed, which tried to be hidden or redirected, and which were prevented — giving you actionable privacy intelligence.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Use Badge as Quick Indicator:** Trust the badge count on the toolbar icon to quickly assess third-party connection volume
- **Explore the Popup for Details:** Click the icon for detailed connection outcomes whenever you need to investigate
- **Consider Stealth Blocked Domains Carefully:** Stealth blocking can indicate nuanced filtering that impacts page behavior
- **Remember Cross-Tab Tracking:** Each browser tab's connections are tracked separately, so switch tabs to review relevant data

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting Tips">
<Accordion title="Badge Not Updating">
Ensure that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions enabled and that you are viewing the active tab. Refreshing the tab or disabling conflicting extensions may help.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows No Data">
This can happen if the extension has not yet recorded any network requests in the current tab. Try reloading the page or navigating to a new site.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Count Seems Too High or Low">
Remember the badge counts unique domains, not individual requests. Third-party trackers often generate many requests but originate from few domains.
