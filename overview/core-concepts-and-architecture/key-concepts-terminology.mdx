# Key Concepts & Terminology

Understanding uBO Scope starts with familiarizing yourself with some fundamental terms and concepts. This page breaks down the essential terminology to ensure every user, whether new or experienced, can fully grasp the network connection data uBO Scope presents.

---

## Remote Server

A **remote server** is any server located outside of your local machine from which web content or resources are requested. When you visit a webpage, your browser communicates with various remote servers to load all necessary elements, such as images, scripts, and stylesheets.


## Third-Party Connections

A **third-party** connection refers to interactions your browser makes with servers other than the one of the site you are currently visiting. For example, if you visit example.com but your browser loads ads or analytics scripts from adnetwork.com, that connection to adnetwork.com is third-party.

Tracking and controlling third-party connections is critical for privacy and security since they often relate to advertising, tracking, or data collection.


## Connection Outcomes: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth

uBO Scope classifies network connections into three outcome types based on what happened to the network requests:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** These are connections that were successfully established, meaning resources from those servers were retrieved and used by the visited site.

- **Blocked:** These are connections that were explicitly prevented from completing, typically by content blockers or browser security features.

- **Stealth-Blocked:** This refers to connections that were silently redirected or suppressed by stealth methods used by some content blockers, making the block less detectable to websites. These connections often leave no visible trace on the page but are reported by uBO Scope.


## Session Tracking

A **session** in uBO Scope refers to your current browser session for a given tab. It keeps track of all network connection attempts and their outcomes specifically for that tab's active webpage. Session tracking enables uBO Scope to present cumulative data, like counts of connected domains, during your browsing without losing context.


## WebRequest API

The **webRequest API** is a browser interface used by uBO Scope to monitor all outgoing network requests made by webpages. This API provides real-time information on network request events such as redirects, successes, and errors — no matter which content blocker is in use. Because of the webRequest API’s reach, uBO Scope can accurately report and analyze the fate of every network request your browser generates.


## Badge Count

The **badge count** displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon is a key metric:

> It reports the **number of distinct third-party domains** from which a connection was allowed or successfully established in the active tab.

A lower badge count indicates fewer external third parties were contacted, which usually means fewer trackers and potentially better privacy.


## Additional Details: Hostname vs Domain

- **Hostname:** The full network host part of a URL, including subdomains (e.g., `ads.tracker.example.com`).
- **Domain:** The base registered domain determined via the public suffix list, excluding subdomains (e.g., `example.com`).

uBO Scope groups and reports network connections primarily by domain, as this provides a clearer picture of the number of distinct organizations or entities your browser interacts with.

## Practical Example: What You See in uBO Scope

Imagine visiting an online news article. The page may load:

- Main site content from `news.example.com` (first-party).
- Ads served from `ads.adnetwork.net` (third-party).
- Tracking pixels from `tracker.analytics.org` (third-party).
- Content delivery from `cdn.examplecdn.com` (can be first or third-party depending on ownership).

uBO Scope monitors all requests:

- If your content blocker allowed connections to ads and trackers, these show up in the **allowed** section.
- If the blocker prevented them, they show in the **blocked** section.
- If the blocker silently suppresses requests, these appear under **stealth-blocked**.

The toolbar badge count updates to reflect only the unique third-party domains successfully connected.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Focus on domains, not individual requests:** uBO Scope aggregates counts by domains to help you understand the real scope of connections.
- **Beware of stealth blocking myths:** Sometimes content blockers prevent connections discreetly. uBO Scope reveals these to avoid confusion.
- **Use the badge count as a privacy indicator:** A high count often means more third-party exposure.
- **Understand that not all third parties are bad:** Some, like CDNs or essential analytics, might be necessary for site functionality.


---

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

- **Why do I see domains in both allowed and stealth?**
  This happens when some requests to a domain load successfully while others are stealth-blocked.

- **Why is the badge count sometimes empty on a tab?**
  This means no third-party connections were observed or allowed in that tab session.

- **Does this account for all network traffic?**
  No. uBO Scope can only track requests visible to the browser’s webRequest API. Requests made outside this scope, such as certain browser extensions or native processes, are not tracked.
