## Core Features Detailed

### Cross-Browser Compatibility

Whether you use Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, uBO Scope integrates smoothly, harnessing each browser’s extension APIs to maintain consistent domain monitoring and reporting.

### Real-Time Domain Tracking

As you browse, uBO Scope actively listens to network requests and updates its domain lists on the fly. This live tracking lets you instantly see what servers your browser is communicating with.

### Connection Outcome Visibility

Domains are categorized distinctly:

- **Allowed Domains:** Third-party servers successfully contacted.
- **Blocked Domains:** Requests explicitly blocked by content blocking.
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains:** Those that are silently stealth-blocked to minimize detection.

This triage gives a panoramic view beyond traditional blocker statistics.

### Extensibility for Filter List Maintainers

Built with maintainers in mind, uBO Scope exposes data and insights useful for crafting and testing filter lists, particularly on platforms or devices without full browser developer tools.

---

## Visualizing the Experience

Once installed, uBO Scope places an interactive toolbar icon that displays a badge count representing the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted (lower counts signal fewer external connections).

Clicking the icon opens a popup summarizing domains connected, segmented by outcome categories. This interface provides immediate, user-friendly feedback on connection activity.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Update Your Browser:** Ensure you are using at least the minimum version specified above to avoid compatibility issues.
- **Understand Badge Counts:** A lower badge count indicates fewer distinct third-party connections, generally indicating better privacy.
- **Review Domains Regularly:** Use uBO Scope’s popup to identify unexpected domains and refine privacy settings accordingly.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Badge counts reflect distinct domains contacted; do not confuse count with number of blocked requests.
- Some network requests outside the browser’s `webRequest` API scope cannot be captured.
