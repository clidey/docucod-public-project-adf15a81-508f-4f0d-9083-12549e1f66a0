# Who is uBO Scope for?

uBO Scope is designed for users who demand clear, accurate insight into the network connections their browser attempts on every website they visit. By focusing on user needs—privacy, transparency, and informed decision-making—this page outlines the key audiences who benefit most from uBO Scope and explores the practical scenarios where it delivers unique value.

## Understanding the Primary Users

### Privacy Advocates and Security-Conscious Individuals
If you deeply care about your online privacy, uBO Scope empowers you with a revealing view of all third-party connections your browsing activity engages with. It breaks down the mystery behind network requests — showing not only which connections are allowed but also those blocked or silently stealth-blocked by your content blocker. This transparency helps you understand the true extent of your exposure and control unwanted tracking.

### Filter List Maintainers
For professionals managing content blocking filter lists, uBO Scope is an essential tool. It provides objective data about network request outcomes across different browsers and contexts. With uBO Scope, you can validate your filter lists by seeing which domains and hostnames are actually allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked, enabling you to fine-tune your blocking rules with greater confidence and real-world accuracy.

### Browser Power Users and Developers
If you are a technically savvy user or developer who wants an authoritative companion to understand browser network behaviors, uBO Scope delivers detailed visibility. It tracks every network request made by pages you visit, no matter which content blocker is active. This empowers you to diagnose issues, identify stealthy connections, and verify browser or extension behavior that just isn’t visible through normal developer tools.

### Users Questioning Content Blocking Efficacy
Sometimes, numbers and indicators shown by content blockers can be misleading or misunderstood. uBO Scope helps clarify such confusion by exposing the reality behind extension block counts and connections. It debunks common myths by showing the distinct third-party remote servers actually reached, regardless of block counts or ads shown, giving you a clearer picture of your blocker’s effectiveness.

## Real-World Scenarios Where uBO Scope Adds Unique Value

### Verifying Third-Party Connections
When browsing complex modern websites, many third-party domains often load silently in the background—sometimes as legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs), and other times as trackers or ads. uBO Scope helps you differentiate these by categorizing connections as allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.

*Example:* Alice suspects a website is loading unexpected trackers despite her content blocker. Opening uBO Scope, she immediately sees all third-party domains connected to the page and can verify which are silently bypassing her blocker (stealth-blocked).

### Evaluating Content Blockers Across Browsers
Content blocker performance and behavior can vary widely across browsers and versions. Comparing toolbar badge numbers alone is insufficient to measure true blocking effectiveness. uBO Scope’s data-driven approach reveals the actual number of distinct third-party servers allowed through, giving you an apples-to-apples comparison insight.

*Example:* Bob uses two different content blockers across Chrome and Firefox. With uBO Scope, he sees which extension truly reduces third-party exposure by tracking network requests directly instead of relying on block count badges.

### Supporting Filter List Quality Improvement
Filter list maintainers benefit from real usage data that uBO Scope collects and displays. By reviewing concrete domain-level outcomes, maintainers can identify overly permissive or overly aggressive rules and better balance blocking versus website functionality.

*Example:* Carol, a filter list maintainer, uses uBO Scope to observe which domains frequently appear in stealth-blocked outcomes and fine-tunes filters to catch these without breaking content.

### Educating Users on Network Request Outcomes
uBO Scope helps dispel widespread misconceptions about content blocker reliability and ad-block testing sites by showing real network activities rather than test page simulations.

*Example:* Dan was confused by test sites that showed higher block rates for less effective blockers. After using uBO Scope, he understood that a higher block count doesn’t always mean better blocking — it could mean more network requests are actually being allowed.
