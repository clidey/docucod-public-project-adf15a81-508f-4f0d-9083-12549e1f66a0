# What is uBO Scope?

## Unveiling Every Connection Your Browser Makes

uBO Scope is a powerful browser extension designed with a simple but important mission: to reveal every network connection attempt your browser makes to remote servers. Unlike typical content blockers that focus on blocking unwanted content, uBO Scope shines a spotlight on *all* connection attempts—whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked—giving you an unfiltered view of your browser's communications.

By providing clear visibility into these connections regardless of which content blocker you use, uBO Scope empowers users, privacy advocates, and filter list maintainers with greater transparency and insight.

### Why This Matters

- **Transparency over your web traffic:** Know exactly which third-party domains your browser talks to on every page.
- **Understand content blocker effectiveness:** See beyond mere block counts to assess which third parties are actually contacted.
- **Privacy and security assurance:** Track stealthy or hidden requests that might otherwise slip under the radar.
- **Filter list maintenance:** Help curators understand real-world network activity to improve filtering rules.

### Who Should Care?

- Privacy-conscious users seeking full visibility into third-party network connections.
- Security professionals analyzing browser behavior and network exposure.
- Developers and filter list maintainers needing precise insight into remote connection attempts.

## What is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a companion extension built to *observe* network requests initiated by your browser. It records every attempt your browser makes to reach out to remote servers, including those that are successfully allowed, stealthily redirected or blocked by content blockers, or wholly denied.

uBO Scope leverages browser APIs—specifically the `webRequest` API—to tap directly into the request visibility layer, ensuring it reports real outcomes regardless of whether content blockers or DNS-level filters intervene.

## The Problem It Solves

Modern web browsing involves numerous third-party resources loading invisibly in the background—ads, trackers, CDNs, analytics, and more. Traditional content blockers focus on *blocking* undesired requests but leave users guessing about what actually happens behind the scenes. Are trackers truly blocked? Are some requests silently allowed? Which domains receive connections?

uBO Scope answers these questions by providing a *transparent, detailed report* of all network connection attempts your browser initiates. The resulting clarity helps users make informed decisions about privacy and security and aids filter list maintainers in fine-tuning their rules.

## What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

- **Independent of Content Blockers:** uBO Scope tracks all requests regardless of which content blockers are active, offering an unbiased view.
- **Badge Count Reflects Unique Third-Party Connections:** The extension’s toolbar badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected to, shifting focus from block counts to actual exposure.
- **Handles All Outcomes:** Differentiates between allowed, stealth-blocked (redirected), and blocked connections, revealing stealthy behaviors often hidden from users.
- **Privacy Focused:** Avoids tracking user data; its mission is observation without interference.

## How It Works (At a High Level)

1. **Monitoring Requests:** It listens to browser network events (`onBeforeRedirect`, `onErrorOccurred`, `onResponseStarted`) to capture all outgoing requests.
2. **Classifying Outcomes:** Each connection attempt is categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked (redirected requests that don’t load), or blocked (errors or refusals).
3. **Aggregating Data Per Tab:** Results for each domain are collected and maintained per browser tab.
4. **Displaying Results:** The extension’s popup displays detailed counts and domains per outcome. The icon badge shows the count of unique allowed third-party domains.

This functionality works seamlessly across major browsers supporting the required APIs.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Comprehensive Request Logging:** Records every network request initiated by the browser, whether visible to the user or not.
- **Distinct Outcome Tracking:** Separates requests into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked groups for clear analysis.
- **Domain and Hostname Aggregation:** Groups network connections by domain and hostname to reveal the scope of remote contacts.
- **Real-Time Badge Count:** Toolbar icon dynamically updates to show the count of unique allowed third-party domains.
- **User-Friendly Popup Interface:** Easy-to-interpret panel showing domain counts categorized by outcome.
- **Persistence Across Sessions:** Saved session data tracks network requests per tab, refreshing as tabs open and close.
- **Designed for Privacy and Transparency:** Does not interfere with requests or user data; strictly observes.

### Real-World Example

Imagine visiting a popular news website. uBO Scope will list:

- The main domain you’re visiting as well as third-party domains like ad servers, analytics platforms, or CDNs.
- Which of those connections were successfully established.
- Which were blocked—perhaps by your active content blocker.
- Which connections were stealthily handled by redirection or other indirect means.

This insight allows you to validate if your content blockers are working as intended or to discover unexpected third parties.

## Why Should You Care About uBO Scope?

### Greater Privacy Control
Knowing precisely which third-party domains your browser connects to lets you assess privacy risks with confidence. You won’t be left guessing whether trackers or ads are truly blocked or slipping through silently.

### Security Oversight
Stealthy network connections can expose vulnerabilities or data leaks. uBO Scope exposes these attempts so you can stay ahead of potential threats.

### Smarter Content Blocker Evaluation
Instead of relying on misleading block counts from ad blockers, you use uBO Scope’s third-party domain counts to understand actual exposure and blocker effectiveness.

### Support for Filter List Maintenance
Filter list creators can leverage the detailed real-time data to discover new domains to block or whitelist, improving the blocking accuracy for everyone.

### Before & After Comparison
Before using uBO Scope, you rely on guesswork or incomplete information about network connections. After integration, you gain transparent, trustworthy data empowering smarter browsing and privacy decisions.

## Getting Started Preview

To begin harnessing uBO Scope's insights:

1. **Install the extension:** Available for Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari.
2. **Open any webpage:** Click the extension icon to see the popup revealing connected domains.
3. **Interpret the badge:** The number on the toolbar icon tells how many distinct third-party remote servers the page connected to.

See more in the [Getting Started Guide](#) to install and begin using uBO Scope effectively.

<Tip>
Remember, a lower badge count means fewer third-party connections and usually better privacy. Use uBO Scope to identify unexpected connections and refine your content blocker settings.
</Tip>

<Note>
uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API. Some network requests outside this API’s visibility won't appear in the reports.
