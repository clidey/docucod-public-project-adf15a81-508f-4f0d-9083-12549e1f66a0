# Feature Overview

Unlock a clear view of your browser's network activity with uBO Scope. This page summarizes the essential features that power uBO Scope’s effectiveness, giving you detailed insights into every connection your browser makes to remote servers. Whether you’re managing privacy concerns or analyzing content blocker performance, understanding these features lays the groundwork for mastering the extension.

---

## Core Features & Capabilities

### 1. Comprehensive Network Request Visibility
uBO Scope uses browser `webRequest` APIs to capture every network request attempt initiated by web pages you visit. This feature enables you to see all outbound server connections including those allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked — regardless of your content blocker’s state or browser configurations.

*What this means for you:* You get a transparent, real-time window into where your browser is connecting, helping you identify trackers, third parties, or suspicious servers at a glance.

---

### 2. Categorization of Connection Outcomes
uBO Scope clearly organizes network requests into three distinct categories:

- **Allowed**: Connections that successfully reached remote servers.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections blocked stealthily by content blockers, often bypassing normal detection.
- **Blocked**: Connections outright blocked, as reported by the browser’s network APIs.

These outcomes are shown in separate sections within the extension’s popup, helping you differentiate the types of network activity effortlessly.

*Why it matters:* By separating outcomes, you can distinguish true blocking effectiveness versus stealth blocking or allowed connections, offering an honest snapshot of your web traffic.

---

### 3. Intuitive Toolbar Badge Counts
The toolbar icon’s badge dynamically reflects the **number of distinct third-party remote servers with allowed connections**. A lower badge count generally indicates fewer third-party trackers or resources loaded, aligning with better privacy.

*Key details:* 
- The badge only counts distinct third-party domains that your browser actually connected to.
- It does not count blocked or stealth-blocked domains, focusing purely on successful connections.

*Practical use:* Quickly gauge how many third-party services are active on any webpage without opening the popup interface.

---

### 4. Cross-Browser Compatibility & Integration
uBO Scope supports all major browser ecosystems — Chromium, Firefox, and Safari — leveraging their respective extension APIs efficiently:

- Uses manifest v3 standards for best performance and security.
- Integrates cleanly with browser content blockers, speaking the same `webRequest` language.
- Persists data and session information using browser storage mechanisms.

*Benefit:* You enjoy consistent, reliable network monitoring across browsers without losing data or features due to platform differences.

## Real-World Scenario: Using Features to Analyze a Webpage
Imagine you visit a news website. Without uBO Scope, you are unaware of the various external domains your browser contacts. With uBO Scope:

1. Your toolbar icon badge shows a “5” — you know there are 5 distinct third-party servers contacted.
2. Opening the popup, you see the allowed section listing these 5 domains, the stealth-blocked section listing domains blocked stealthily by your content blocker, and the blocked section showing those outright blocked.
3. Reviewing counts next to each domain lets you understand connection frequency.
4. Use this data to adjust your firewall rules, filter lists, or just stay informed about potential privacy exposures.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Focus on third-party domains:** When analyzing badge counts or popup details, pay particular attention to third-party domains as these often relate to trackers.
- **Combine with other content blockers:** Use uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blocker to verify actual blocking outcomes rather than relying solely on block counts.
- **Check stealth-blocked domains:** Stealth blocking helps prevent detection or web breakage but might still allow some data leaks; monitoring this helps refine your setup.
- **Regularly inspect badge counts:** A sudden spike in allowed connections may indicate new tracking activity or misconfigured blocking.
