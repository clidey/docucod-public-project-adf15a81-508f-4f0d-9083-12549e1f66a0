# When and How to Use uBO Scope

## Discover When uBO Scope Delivers Unique, Actionable Insights

Navigating the complex landscape of third-party connections on the web is daunting. uBO Scope empowers you to lift the veil on all remote server connections initiated by web pages you visit — not just those blocked or reported by other tools. This page guides you through **key scenarios** where uBO Scope’s visibility transforms your understanding and control of network activity, from verifying blocker effectiveness to fine-tuning filter lists.

## Why Use uBO Scope in These Situations?

uBO Scope is not just another blocker; it is a **transparent window** into all network connections your browser attempts, successful or otherwise. Knowing exactly when and how to leverage this insight ensures you get maximum value with clear, actionable outcomes.

### 1. Verifying the Effectiveness of Your Content Blocker

- **Purpose:** Confirm that your blocker truly prevents unwanted third-party connections.
- **How uBO Scope Helps:**
  - Shows the exact number of distinct third-party servers your browser connects to, unaffected by blocker-specific counting methods.
  - Displays a clear breakdown of connections allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked by your content blocker.
- **Result:** You gain confidence that your privacy tool keeps trackers and undesired content at bay beyond just block counts reported by extensions.

### 2. Identifying Unexpected or Undocumented Third-Party Activity

- **Purpose:** Detect hidden or unusual connections that might indicate privacy risks or website misbehavior.
- **How uBO Scope Helps:**
  - Reveals third-party servers even if stealth-blocked or blocked elsewhere — giving you a full picture.
  - Helps spot domains and services not covered by your current filter lists or blocker rules.
- **Result:** Early detection of potential privacy leaks or new tracking infrastructure, empowering proactive filtering.

### 3. Assisting Filter List Development and Maintenance

- **Purpose:** For filter list maintainers and privacy researchers, gather accurate data to optimize blocking rules.
- **How uBO Scope Helps:**
  - Provides per-tab, real-time monitoring of all remote connections initiated by web pages.
  - Allows categorization between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains, supporting nuanced list tuning.
  - Works independently of any particular content blocker, ensuring unbiased data collection.
- **Result:** More precise and effective filter lists that improve privacy without breaking site functionality.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Interpret Badge Counts Wisely:** Lower badge counts typically mean fewer active third-party connections, which is generally preferable for privacy.
- **Use Real Websites, Not Test Pages:** Avoid specialized ad blocker test sites, as they create synthetic, unrealistic network scenarios that distort results.
- **Refresh and Revisit Sites:** Monitor changes in third-party connections as you navigate or reload pages to spot dynamic behaviors.
- **Combine uBO Scope with Your Content Blocker:** Use uBO Scope alongside blockers like uBlock Origin for comprehensive network visibility and control.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Relying Solely on Block Counts From Other Extensions:** These can be misleading. uBO Scope shows the actual distinct remote hosts reached, a more reliable privacy indicator.
- **Ignoring Stealth-Blocked Connections:** These may be silently redirected or suppressed network calls that could still impact privacy.
- **Assuming All Third Parties are Malicious:** Legitimate services like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) may appear in the list. Focus on unfamiliar or suspicious domains.

## Conclusion

When you need **clarity about your internet connections and privacy**, uBO Scope gives you unprecedented visibility into every third-party network request — allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked. Use it to verify blocker effectiveness, uncover unexpected connections, or enhance your filter lists with precise data.

Explore the power of uBO Scope and transform how you understand and manage your web privacy.

## Example Scenario

You suspect a website is loading unwanted third-party trackers even when your blocker is enabled. With uBO Scope:

1. Load the site and observe the badge's count showing distinct third-party connections.
