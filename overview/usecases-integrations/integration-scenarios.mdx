# Works with Your Browser and Blocker

uBO Scope is designed to seamlessly integrate with your browsing environment, providing a powerful and independent view into all remote server connections your browser makes. This page explains how uBO Scope operates within Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers, emphasizing its independence from your choice of content blockers or DNS configurations.

---

## Native Browser Support and Installation

uBO Scope is compatible with leading modern browsers, including:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Google Chrome, Edge)
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Apple Safari (version 18.5 and later)**

You can install the extension directly from your browser's official add-on stores:

- **Chromium Web Store:** [Install uBO Scope for Chromium](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- **Firefox Add-ons:** [Install uBO Scope for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

Once installed, the extension places a toolbar icon that dynamically shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the active tab.

## How uBO Scope Works Independently

At its core, uBO Scope listens to network activity notifications reported by your browser via the native `webRequest` API. Critically, it operates without relying on or interfering with your content blocker or DNS settings. Here’s why this matters:

- **Content Blocker Agnostic:** Whether you use uBlock Origin, another ad blocker, or none at all, uBO Scope tracks all remote connections your browser attempts or successfully completes.

- **DNS Agnostic:** Blocking or redirecting DNS at the system or router level does not prevent uBO Scope from detecting outgoing requests that your browser initiates and reports through its APIs.

- **Browser API Reliant:** The extension depends on your browser's `webRequest` API to gather data. As long as the browser exposes this API for network requests, uBO Scope can provide accurate and comprehensive reports.

This independence ensures a transparent and reliable insight into what servers your browser talks to, cutting through the noise created by different blocking layers.

## Supported Permissions and Capabilities

To effectively monitor connections, uBO Scope requires the following permissions, declared in its manifest files:

- `webRequest` – to listen to HTTP and WebSocket traffic events.
- `storage` – to save session and configuration data.
- `activeTab` – to query information about the current tab.

It also declares broad host permissions for all typical HTTP and WebSocket URLs, including `http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, and `wss://*/*`.

These permissions enable uBO Scope’s background script to receive detailed lifecycle events of network requests, including successes, errors, and redirects.

---

## Browser-Specific Notes

- **Chromium:** Uses Manifest V3 with a background service worker handling webRequest listeners. Supports the full range of URL schemes including secure WebSocket connections.

- **Firefox:** Employs Manifest V3 with a background script. Has similar host permissions and APIs as Chromium for comprehensive network event tracking.

- **Safari:** Requires Safari 18.5 or later for full compatibility. Background scripts and permissions are analogous to those in Firefox and Chromium, but host permissions exclude WebSocket schemes due to current platform limitations.

## User Experience Flow

1. **Installation:** Users add uBO Scope to their preferred browser from the official stores.
2. **Browsing:** As users navigate websites, the extension listens silently to all network requests.
3. **Data Collection:** For each active tab, uBO Scope aggregates allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connection attempts by domain.
4. **Badge Update:** The toolbar icon badge displays the count of distinct third-party domains successfully contacted.
5. **Popup Details:** Clicking the icon opens a detailed breakdown categorizing domains into “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked,” enabling users to understand what connections originated from the page.

This seamless workflow requires no manual configuration, allowing users to gain transparent insight instantly as browsing continues.

## Practical Benefits of This Independence

- **Accurate Insights:** By remaining independent, uBO Scope paints an authentic picture of your third-party connection landscape.

- **Universal Compatibility:** Works alongside any content blocker or network configuration without conflicts or loss of data.

- **Useful for Filter List Maintainers:** Provides raw connection data that helps in refining blocking rules irrespective of browser or other addons.

- **Mythbusting:** Empowers users to verify claims about the effectiveness of blockers by showing real connection data, not just block counts.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your browser is updated to the minimum supported version (e.g., Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Allow the extension the requested permissions during installation.
- If the badge or popup shows no data, confirm that your browser supports the `webRequest` API and it’s not restricted by other security settings.
- Restart the browser if the extension seems unresponsive, as service workers or background scripts may need to reload.
