# Quick Feature Overview

## Real-Time Connection Monitoring

uBO Scope provides an immediate, live view of all network connections a web page attempts or successfully makes to remote servers during its lifecycle. This real-time visibility empowers you to understand exactly which third-party domains your browser contacts, regardless of any content blockers you use.

By monitoring network requests as they happen, uBO Scope delivers precise outcomes for each request—categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked, or explicitly blocked. This granular insight aids in uncovering the true exposure of a web page to third-party tracking or resource servers.


## Third-Party Domain Reporting

The extension focuses on identifying distinct third-party remote servers. It aggregates connection data by domain and hostname, presenting clear counts for each category of outcome:

- **Allowed** connections: Requests that completed successfully.
- **Stealth-blocked** connections: Requests blocked silently by filters that make blocking less detectable.
- **Blocked** connections: Requests explicitly blocked by content blockers.

This domain-centric reporting helps you assess your browsing privacy by showing the breadth of external domains involved in loading a site. It also clarifies how stealth blocking and explicit blocking differ in practice.


## Browser Badge Visualization

A key feature of uBO Scope is the dynamic badge displayed on the browser toolbar icon:

- The badge shows the **number of unique third-party domains successfully connected during the active tab's page load**.
- A smaller badge count signals fewer third-party connections, which generally aligns with enhanced privacy and less third-party exposure.

This at-a-glance visualization allows you to quickly gauge the third-party network footprint per tab without opening the full extension UI.


## Confirmation of Network Request Outcomes

uBO Scope listens to your browser's network request events and intelligently confirms the fate of each request:

- **Success**: The request connected and fetched data.
- **Redirect**: The request was internally rerouted, tracked under stealth-blocked.
- **Error**: The request failed or was blocked explicitly.

This comprehensive confirmation provides high confidence that the extension reports the full story, even when content blockers or DNS filtering modify normal network behavior.


## Cross-Browser Support

uBO Scope is designed to work across multiple modern browsers with consistent behavior:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (Chrome, Edge, etc.)
- **Firefox** and **Firefox for Android**
- **Safari** (version 18.5 and above)

The extension leverages each browser's `webRequest` API for capturing network activity, ensuring functionality is as reliable and accurate as possible within each platform's constraints.

## Practical User Workflow

When you install and activate uBO Scope, the toolbar badge immediately starts reflecting the count of unique third-party domains your active web page contacts. Clicking the extension icon opens a detailed popup showing categorized lists of connected domains and counts, helping you understand the nuances of allowed vs. blocked connections.

For example, visiting an advertisement-heavy news site might show a high number on the badge indicating multiple third-party advertisers. With uBO Scope, you can see exactly which domains are involved and how your content blocker handles each.

This insight enables you to tailor your privacy filters or simply stay informed about your browsing exposure.


## Best Practices & Tips

- **Interpret the badge count as a primary privacy metric:** A lower third-party connection count typically means reduced external tracking risk.
- **Distinguish stealth-blocked from explicitly blocked:** Stealth blocking aims to be invisible to sites, so seeing domains here helps debunk false assumptions about blocking efficacy.
- **Use domain counts in connection with full domain listings:** Review domain-level details in the extension popup to understand exactly which parties are active.
- **Note browser platform differences:** Some browsers might restrict certain network events, so results can vary slightly.


## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- If the badge count does not update, ensure the extension has the necessary permissions and that your browser supports full `webRequest` event tracking.
- Unexpected low counts may result from browsing in private or restrictive modes where network monitoring APIs are limited.
- For consistent results, avoid simultaneous content blockers that may interfere with request reporting.


## Getting Started with uBO Scope

To begin leveraging these features:

1. Install uBO Scope from your browser’s official extension store.
2. Confirm permissions and ensure `webRequest` API access is granted.
3. Start browsing and watch the toolbar badge for third-party connection counts.
4. Click the extension icon to open the detailed domain report popup.
5. Consult related guides for advanced monitoring and interpretation techniques.
