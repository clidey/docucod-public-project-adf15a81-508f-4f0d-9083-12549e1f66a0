# Key Terms in uBO Scope

Understanding the language used within uBO Scope is critical for interpreting its data accurately and making informed decisions about privacy and network security. This page defines essential terminology such as 'third-party', 'remote server', 'webRequest API', 'stealth', and 'blocked'. Gaining clarity on these terms will empower you to navigate uBO Scope’s UI and data with confidence.

## What You Need to Know: Definitions that Matter

### Third-Party
In the context of uBO Scope, a **third-party** refers to any remote server domain that is different from the domain of the webpage you are visiting (the first-party). For example, if you visit `example.com` and the page connects to `cdn.analytics.com`, then `cdn.analytics.com` is a third-party.

Third-party connections often involve services like ads, analytics, content delivery networks (CDNs), or social media integrations. uBO Scope tracks these connections to expose how many distinct third-party servers you’re communicating with during a page load.

### Remote Server
A **remote server** is any server outside of your local machine that a web page attempts to connect to fetch resources or exchange data. uBO Scope monitors all such remote server connections initiated by the page or its components.

This includes servers accessed via HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket (`ws://`/`wss://`), or other network protocols supported by the browser's `webRequest` API.

### webRequest API
The **webRequest API** is a browser-provided interface that allows extensions like uBO Scope to observe, analyze, and respond to network requests initiated by web pages.

uBO Scope relies on this API to monitor each network request, detect its outcome, and categorize it as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked. This API forms the backbone for collecting accurate and comprehensive network connection details.

### Stealth
**Stealth** connections are network requests that were intentionally **blocked in a way that is transparent to the webpage and its scripts**. In other words, the connection attempt was suppressed silently without the page being able to detect the block.

This stealth blocking helps prevent webpages from identifying that certain resources or trackers were blocked, thereby avoiding behavioral changes or blocking-blocker detection scripts.

### Blocked
When uBO Scope marks a connection as **blocked**, it means a network request was prevented from completing due to a content blocker, security policy, or network error that was visible or detectable.

These blocked connections are explicitly failed or canceled and can often be readily observed by webpages, potentially affecting page functionality or triggering anti-blocking measures.

## How These Terms Fit Together in uBO Scope

When you load a webpage:

- uBO Scope monitors all network requests through the **webRequest API**.
- It determines the domain of each request and classifies it as **first-party** or **third-party** relative to the main page hostname.
- Each connection is then recorded and categorized based on its actual outcome as **allowed** (successful connection), **stealth-blocked** (silently suppressed), or **blocked** (explicitly cancelled).

This allows you to see not just which third-party domains were contacted, but how each connection was treated by your privacy tools and browser.

## Practical Tips to Understand uBO Scope Data

- The badge count on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct **allowed third-party remote servers** connected during the current page load.
- Seeing a high number of **stealth-blocked** domains means your content blockers are actively hiding their blocking from the webpage.
- Reviewing the **blocked** domains helps you identify resources the page tried to load but were visibly prevented, which might impact page behavior.

## Common User Scenario

Imagine visiting `news.example.com`. uBO Scope shows:

- 5 domains under **not blocked** (allowed): including legitimate CDNs and service providers.
- 3 domains under **stealth-blocked**: trackers and ads hidden from the webpage.
- 2 domains under **blocked**: scripts or images visibly prevented from loading.

Knowing the meaning of these terms helps you understand exactly what kind of network exposures your browsing session has.
