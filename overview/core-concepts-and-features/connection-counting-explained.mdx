# Understanding Connection Counting

### What Does the Badge Count Mean?

The badge count displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon is a key metric designed to provide meaningful insight into your browser's network activity. Specifically, it shows **the number of distinct third-party remote servers** your browser connected to while loading a web page.

Unlike simple counts of blocked or allowed network requests, this metric focuses on distinct remote domains, offering a clearer, more actionable picture of your exposure to third-party servers.

### Why Count Distinct Third-Party Servers?

Web pages today frequently load resources from a multitude of external servers—such as content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics services, advertising platforms, and social media widgets. Measuring the sheer number of network requests or blocks can be misleading because:

- A single third-party domain might be contacted multiple times.
- Some requests may be redirects or retries.
- Block counts alone do not reveal if the connection was ultimately allowed or blocked.

uBO Scope counts unique third-party domains that your browser communicates with, regardless of how many individual requests occur per domain. This approach:

- Helps you understand the *reach* of external servers your browser is exposed to
- Reflects actual connection attempts rather than just filtering actions
- Encourages better privacy awareness by highlighting potential points of tracking or data exchange

### How uBO Scope Identifies Third-Party Domains

The extension listens to your browser's `webRequest` API, monitoring all network requests initiated from web pages. It extracts hostnames from URLs and calculates their **registrable domain** using the Public Suffix List to recognize domain boundaries accurately.

This means uBO Scope groups requests from subdomains under the same registered domain (e.g., `ads.example.com` and `cdn.example.com` both count as `example.com`). This domain-level grouping provides a consistent and meaningful count of distinct third parties.

Note that the count excludes first-party servers to focus attention on external entities.

---

### What Counts Towards the Badge?

uBO Scope categorizes network requests into three outcomes:

- **Allowed:** Requests that successfully connected to third-party domains.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that were silently blocked or redirected, often by content blockers operating stealthily.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked due to errors or filters.

The badge count specifically reflects the number of distinct third-party domains in the **allowed** category, representing actual network connections your browser established.

---

### Why Is This More Revealing Than Traditional Block Counts?

Traditional content blockers often display a block count representing the number of blocked requests. However, this measure can be deceptive:

- A blocker with a high block count may still allow numerous connections to distinct third parties, resulting in greater exposure.
- Focusing on block counts ignores allowed connections that may leak private data.

By contrast, uBO Scope's badge count highlights how many different external domains are actually contacted. A lower badge count generally indicates stronger containment of third-party connections.

### Real-World Scenario: Using Connection Counting

Imagine loading a news website. Your browser makes requests to:

- The website's own servers (first-party)
- A CDN for images (`cdn.news.com`)
- Analytics services (`analytics.tracker.com`)
- Ad networks (`ads.adcompany.net`)

If your content blocker blocks the ads but not analytics and CDN, traditional block counts might be high. Yet, your browser still connects to two third-party domains.

uBO Scope's badge count will show **2**, indicating the actual distinct third-party connections. This helps you see your true exposure beyond block statistics.

---

### Tips for Interpreting Connection Counts

- **Lower counts are better.** Aim to minimize the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connects to.
- **Recognize legitimate third parties.** Some domains, like trusted CDNs, are common and generally safe.
- **Consider stealth-blocked and blocked lists** in the popup for detailed domain breakdowns.
- **Refresh pages to observe changes.** Dynamic content may cause domain counts to fluctuate.

---

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Don't equate block counts with privacy strength.** Higher block counts don’t guarantee fewer connections.
- **Ignore synthetic ad blocker test pages.** They do not reflect realistic network patterns and can mislead.
- **Remember limitations of `webRequest` API.** Some network requests might not be observable depending on browser restrictions.

---

### How to View Detailed Data

Clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon opens the popup, revealing domain-level details:

- **Not blocked:** Domains with successful connections
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains blocked silently
- **Blocked:** Domains with explicit block errors

The badge count corresponds to the total distinct domains in the "not blocked" section.

### Conclusion

Understanding connection counting via uBO Scope lets you:

- Gain transparent insight into your third-party exposure
- Assess content blocker effectiveness by focusing on distinct connections, not just blocked requests
- Make informed decisions about your online privacy
