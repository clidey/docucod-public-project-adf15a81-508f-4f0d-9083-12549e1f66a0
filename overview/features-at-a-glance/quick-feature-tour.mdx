# Quick Feature Tour

Explore the essential features of the uBO Scope popup interface and understand how each UI element connects to your browser's workflow. This tour helps you make the most of uBO Scope's real-time visibility into your web connections.

---

## Popup Interface Layout Overview

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, a clear and informative popup opens. 

- At the top, the **Hostname Header** shows the fully qualified hostname of the active browser tab, visually decomposed into its subdomain and main domain.
- Below the header, the **Summary Section** provides a concise count of the total distinct third-party domains connected to by the web page.
- The main area of the popup is divided into three distinct **Outcome Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Lists third-party domains where connections were permitted.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Shows domains where connections were stealthily blocked (e.g., redirects intercepted).
  - **Blocked:** Displays domains where connections were explicitly blocked, such as by content or network blockers.

Each outcome section lists domains along with a count badge representing how many remote server access attempts were made.

This layered layout gives you immediate insight into the state of third-party connections for the current tab, helping you quickly grasp which domains are in active communication and under what treatment.

---

## Understanding Badge Counts

The toolbar icon badge number represents the count of **distinct third-party remote domains** that have active or successful connections for the current tab.

- A **lower badge count** is better — it means fewer third-party connections.
- This count excludes stealth-blocked and blocked domains, which are instead listed inside the popup.
- The badge count updates dynamically as network events occur and are processed in the background.

This count is your quick indicator of third-party exposure at a glance.

### Important Notes on Badge Interpretation

- The badge count measures unique domains, not total requests. One domain connecting many times still counts as one.
- Not all third parties are harmful: legitimate CDNs and services often appear.
- The badge count contrasts with blocked counts you might see in other tools — it shows what was *allowed* through, proving transparency.

## Connection Categorization Explained

uBO Scope groups third-party connections into three outcomes to accurately reflect your browsing activity:

| Outcome         | What It Means                                              | Example Scenario                                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Allowed**     | Connections that fetched resources successfully.            | Loading images from a CDN.                      |
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Connections that were redirected or silently intercepted by blockers. | An ad network redirecting but blocked silently. |
| **Blocked**     | Requests outright canceled due to errors or blocking rules. | A tracker domain completely blocked by your content blocker. |

Each category lists domains with counts showing how many times each domain was involved in an event matching that outcome.

By categorizing this way, you can precisely analyze both what your browser fetched and what was stopped.

## Tracking Remote Domains Per Tab

uBO Scope tracks and aggregates network connections at the per-tab level:

- When you load or navigate a page, uBO Scope resets and updates the connection details.
- It records the top-level hostname and derives the base domain.
- For each request occurring in that tab, it captures the outcome (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked) and the remote domain involved.
- The detailed per-tab summary is what is shown in the popup whenever you activate it for that tab.

This design ensures your view is always focused on the current context, giving precise, real-time analysis of third-party connections related to your active browsing.

## How UI Elements Integrate into Your Browser Workflow

1. **Tab Loads or Navigates:**
   - The extension detects network requests related to the tab.
   - It resets tracking data for main frame navigation.

2. **Network Request Events Occur:**
   - Requests are observed and recorded as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked based on API feedback.

3. **Background Aggregation:**
   - The background service worker collates domain and connection counts for each category.

4. **Badge Updates:**
   - The toolbar badge count is updated to reflect the count of allowed unique domains.

5. **Popup Activation:**
   - When you open the popup, it queries the stored per-tab data.
   - The popup UI renders this data, displaying hostname, badge summary, and categorized domain lists.

Through this workflow, uBO Scope seamlessly connects what happens behind the scenes in your browser’s network layers to what you see at your fingertips.

## Practical Example Walkthrough

Imagine visiting a news website:

- The **badge count** shows “4” indicating 4 distinct allowed third-party domains.
- Opening the popup shows the news site hostname split into subdomain and base domain.
- The **Not Blocked** section lists content delivery networks, analytics providers, or social widgets successfully loaded.
- The **Stealth-Blocked** section reveals a domain that tried redirecting traffic but was quietly blocked by an ad blocker.
- The **Blocked** section shows a tracker domain blocked due to your configured privacy tools.

This instant transparency helps you verify exactly what external connections your browser engages in — essential for privacy-conscious browsing and troubleshooting.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Use the popup frequently to monitor current tab connections for thorough awareness.
- Remember the badge count measures distinct domains, so occasional spikes suggest extra third-party dependencies.
- Consult the **stealth-blocked** section for domains that might otherwise be invisible but were intercepted.
- Use this detailed visibility to audit websites for unexpected or suspicious connections.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<Tip>
If you notice no data or unexpected empty popup:
- Ensure the page has completed loading network requests.
- Confirm your browser supports the `webRequest` API fully.
- Check that uBO Scope has proper permissions (active tab, webRequest).
</Tip>

<Tip>
If badge counts seem inconsistent:
- Remember badge count reflects unique allowed domains, not total requests.
- Some connections made outside the main frame or triggered by extensions might not appear.
</Tip>

For persistent issues, refer to _Troubleshooting Installation & Setup_ in the Getting Started section.
