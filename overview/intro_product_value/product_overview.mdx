# What is uBO Scope?

## See Every Network Connection Your Browser Makes

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension built to reveal every network connection—whether attempted or successful—that webpages open in your browser. It empowers you to see, in real-time, the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connects to.

This tool complements any content blocker you use by transparently showing what gets through and what is blocked, independent of your content blocker's internal workings or your DNS configuration.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- Instantly understand which external servers your browser interacts with on any webpage.
- Differentiate between legitimate resources (like CDNs) and potential unwanted trackers.
- Monitor real-time connection activity with badge counts on the toolbar icon.
- Gain visibility even when content blocking happens outside of your browser’s extension scope.
- Use it as an objective transparency and diagnostic tool alongside any content blocking setup.

### Who Benefits From uBO Scope?

- **Privacy-conscious users** who want to verify the network behavior of websites.
- **Content blocker users** looking to audit what connections are genuinely blocked or allowed.
- **Filter list maintainers** needing detailed network call insights.
- **Developers and security researchers** interested in network request visibility.

## Understanding uBO Scope

### What It Does

uBO Scope tracks and reports the outcome of every network request your browser makes as you navigate the web. Whether a connection is allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked outright, uBO Scope records and displays this information clearly.

It uses the browser's `webRequest` API to listen to network activity, providing a thorough, real-time view regardless of the blocking techniques or DNS-level filters you have configured.

### Core Purpose

It is designed to:
- Reveal all remote network connections initiated by webpages.
- Offer a simple badge count reflecting unique third-party remote servers connected to.
- Make visible the often-hidden network landscape behind your browsing experience.

### How It Stands Out

Unlike typical content blockers that only report what they block, uBO Scope pushes transparency by detailing all network contact points – blocked or allowed. This data is invaluable for users who want an honest audit without guessing at unseen connections.

### High-Level Flow

1. Listens to network events via the browser's webRequest API.
2. Categorizes connections into **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked**.
3. Tracks hosts and domains involved in connections per browser tab.
4. Updates a badge count showing the number of unique third-party domains accessed.
5. Provides detailed connection data in a popup UI when clicking the extension icon.

**Allowed:** Network requests successfully completed.

**Stealth-blocked:** Requests redirected or blocked stealthily by content blockers.

**Blocked:** Requests that failed or were blocked by any means.

## Core Features

### Real-Time Badge Counts
- Displays the count of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to for each tab.
- Helps you quickly gauge the network density of any webpage.

### Detailed Popup UI
- Opens a rich popup interface on icon click with segmented lists:
  - **Not Blocked:** Third-party connections allowed.
  - **Stealth Blocked:** Connections hidden or redirected by blockers.
  - **Blocked:** Connections that were outright stopped.

- Shows domain names with connection counts to highlight the most contacted endpoints.

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Works across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers with MV3 support.
- Adjusts to underlying platform API differences seamlessly.

### Persistent Session Tracking
- Maintains data on network connections per tab during browser sessions.
- Allows ongoing monitoring without losing historical connection details.

### Privacy by Design
- Does not interfere with browsing performance or privacy.
- Solely listens and reports network events without injecting or modifying content.

## Why Use uBO Scope?

### Transparency & Control
You get immediate insight into what third-party servers your browser talks to, cutting through the noise of complex filter lists and DNS settings.

### Myth-Busting Power
- Dispel misconceptions based on block counts alone; more blocked connections can mean more network calls before blocking.
- Avoid misleading browser tests that fake network requests unrepresentative of real browsing.

### Practical Use Cases
- Verify how effective your content blocker is at limiting external connections.
- Detect sneaky third-party trackers that escape your current protective measures.
- Analyze websites’ network behavior to better understand potential privacy risks.

### Experience Before and After
- **Without uBO Scope:** Blind to what third-party requests actually proceed.
- **With uBO Scope:** Clear visual indicators and detailed domain lists let you audit and understand your network footprint.

## Additional Tips & Best Practices

- Remember that a lower badge count generally means fewer third-party connections and better privacy.
- Use stealth-blocked and blocked lists in the popup to spot potential gaps or hidden trackers.
- Combine uBO Scope with your existing content blocker to effectively validate its coverage.

<Tip>
For the most accurate readings, ensure your browser and extension are kept up to date to support the latest webRequest capabilities.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- **No badge or connection data appears:** Check that the extension is enabled, and you have granted necessary permissions.
- **Unexpected high counts:** Some legitimate websites use multiple CDNs or third-party resources – consider domain reputation.
- **Stealth or blocked connections missing:** Verify your content blocker’s blocking method supports webRequest API visibility.
