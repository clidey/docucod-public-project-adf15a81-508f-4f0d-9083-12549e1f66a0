title: "Why Use uBO Scope?"
description: "uBO Scope empowers privacy-conscious users, filter list maintainers, and web auditors to make data-driven decisions about their browsing experience. By surfacing a concise count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by any webpage—exposing visibility commonly hidden by other tools—it demystifies content blocker effectiveness and uncovers stealthy or misreported network traffic."

# Why Use uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is designed for users who demand deeper transparency and actionable insights into the network connections made by their web browsing sessions. Whether you are a privacy-conscious individual, a filter list maintainer, or a web auditor, this page explains why uBO Scope is an essential companion tool to understand and verify what remote servers your browser contacts — information often obscured by other content blockers or browsing tools.

## Unveiling True Third-Party Connections

At its core, uBO Scope empowers you to see precisely which third-party remote servers a webpage contacts. Unlike other tools that might show counts of blocked requests or use heuristics, uBO Scope reports the **exact domains contacted** and their **connection outcomes**, providing clarity over your browsing footprint.

### What Does This Mean for You?
- **See beyond the block count.** The number of blocked requests shown by other ad blockers or content blockers doesn’t fully reflect the actual network activity. uBO Scope shows which domains _are_ contacted successfully, exposing connections that could be stealthily allowed despite high block counts.
- **Distinguish legitimate vs. suspicious domains.** Use insights to identify whether a low or high count corresponds to legitimate services such as common CDNs or potentially unwanted trackers.
- **Detect stealth blocks and errors.** Understand if some connection attempts were redirected, silently blocked, or failed, which can pinpoint issues or hidden network activity.

## Demystifying Content Blocker Effectiveness

Users often rely on generic block counters or 'ad blocker test' websites, which can be misleading. uBO Scope challenges these myths by basing its reporting on actual browser network request events via the `webRequest` API, thus revealing the true state of network connections independent of other filtering layers, including DNS blocking.

### User Insights Delivered:
- **Reality check against misleading block counts.** A higher block count does not guarantee better blocking. uBO Scope reveals how many distinct third-party domains are actually contacted.
- **Avoid false confidence in 'ad blocker test' pages.** These pages use unrealistic or fabricated connection patterns and cannot detect stealth blocking behaviors. uBO Scope shows real-world network behavior.

## Aid for Filter List Maintainers and Auditors

Filter list maintainers face unique challenges when diagnosing the effectiveness and impact of their filters. uBO Scope surfaces detailed connection data independent of the content blocker’s internal logic, making it a valuable diagnostic tool to:

- Verify which domains are truly contacted by users’ browsers.
- Detect subtle bypasses, redirects, or stealth blocks.
- Obtain a dependable baseline for filter evaluation on all browsers where `webRequest` API reports.

## Transparent, Reliable, and Lightweight

The extension offers a no-nonsense experience:

- **Compact UI** presenting counts and categorized domain lists (`allowed`, `blocked`, and `stealth-blocked`).
- **Browser compatibility** across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari, functioning wherever the necessary permissions exist.
- **No interference** with your current content blocker, providing complementing transparency rather than replacement.

## Real Scenario Example

Imagine browsing to an article on a news website. Other blockers might report blocking 30 connections, but uBO Scope shows you that your browser still successfully contacted a dozen third-party advertisers and trackers despite those blocks. This insight can guide you to adjust your blocker or understand when content blockers may not fully protect your privacy.

## How uBO Scope Fits in Your Workflow

1. **Install and activate uBO Scope alongside your regular blockers.**
2. **Open the uBO Scope popup on active pages to quickly view the distinct third-party domains contacted.**
3. **Review categorized lists under ‘not blocked’, ‘stealth-blocked’, and ‘blocked’ to understand the nature of those connections.**
4. **Use this data to fine-tune your filters or assess filter lists you rely on.**

## Practical Tips

- Use uBO Scope to compare network behaviors across different filter lists or content-blocking strategies.
- Pay attention to the ‘stealth-blocked’ category — it can indicate subtle network redirections.
- Remember the badge count reflects unique domains contacted, so a lower count often means fewer third parties and better privacy.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t confuse block count badges from other content blockers as the definitive measure of protection.
- Avoid relying on superficial 'ad blocker test' pages as your only validation tool.
- Be aware that network requests outside of `webRequest` reporting scope, such as some non-browser network activity, won't appear in uBO Scope.

_For the technical curious, uBO Scope leverages the browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor and categorize network events, correlating domain names using the publicly maintained [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to accurately identify domain boundaries. This transparency mechanism is a rare feature in traditional content blockers._


<Note>
The badge count you see on the browser toolbar icon shows the number of distinct **allowed** third-party domains contacted by the active tab, emphasizing minimal third-party exposure rather than mere blockage numbers.
