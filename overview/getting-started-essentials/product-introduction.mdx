# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Remote Connection Your Browser Makes

uBO Scope is a straightforward browser extension designed to reveal every connection attempt your browser makes to remote servers — whether those connections are successful, blocked, or redirected. It works alongside any existing content blockers or DNS configurations without interference, delivering a transparent view of your web traffic.

- **Complete Visibility:** See all remote server connections regardless of the content blocker or DNS settings in use.
- **Accurate Reporting:** Counts distinct third-party servers your browser communicates with, not just blocked requests.
- **Independent Analysis:** Operates independently of other blockers, capturing the actual network activity reported by the browser.
- **Cross-Browser Support:** Compatible with major browsers supporting the `webRequest` API.

**Ideal for:** Privacy-conscious users, filter list maintainers, and anyone who wants to understand what their browser connects to in real time.

## Understanding uBO Scope: What Does It Do and Why?

At its core, uBO Scope is a measurement tool. Unlike typical content blockers that stop unwanted content, uBO Scope focuses on *exposing* what connections your browser tries to establish. It detects attempts to connect to remote servers—even those that are ultimately blocked or stealthily redirected—and summarizes these events clearly.

### The Challenge It Solves

Modern web browsing is complex, with countless third-party domains involved, often hidden behind multiple layers. Typical content blockers might filter specific ads or trackers, but they don't provide a comprehensive overview of *all* network activities, especially when combined with various DNS-based blocking or stealth techniques.

uBO Scope fills this gap by leveraging the browser's own `webRequest` API. This API reports network requests the browser observes, regardless of which content blocker or DNS resolver is in charge. This lets uBO Scope expose connections made, not just those blocked or allowed by your tools.

### What Makes uBO Scope Different?

- **Non-Intrusive Observation:** It doesn't block or interfere but strictly reports.
- **Cross-Compatibility:** Works alongside any content blocker without dependency or competition.
- **Focus on Distinct Connections:** Counts unique third-party remote servers connected, providing a more meaningful privacy metric than just counting blocked requests.
- **Debunking False Metrics:** Challenges assumptions based on block counts or misleading ad blocker tests by focusing on actual third-party contacts.

### Simple Workflow Overview

1. uBO Scope listens to network request events via the `webRequest` API.
2. It records the outcome of each network request:
   - Allowed (successful connection)
   - Blocked (failed or blocked connection)
   - Stealth (redirected but not visible)
3. Tab-specific data is aggregated and presented via the extension's popup.
4. The toolbar badge displays the number of distinct third-party servers contacted in the active tab.

This workflow empowers you to see the raw connection landscape your browser is operating in without complex configurations.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Comprehensive Connection Exposure:** Captures any attempted or successful remote server connection — nothing escapes visibility.

- **Third-Party Domain Focus:** Emphasizes connections to third-party domains, which are often the core privacy concern.

- **Tab-Level Granularity:** Tracks connections on a per-tab basis for context-specific analysis.

- **Toolbar Badge Indicator:** Displays a real-time count of unique third-party domains connected in the active tab.

- **Straightforward Popup Interface:** Presents allowed, stealth (redirected), and blocked domain lists with connection counts.

- **Independence from Blockers and DNS:** Captures network outcomes no matter which blocking method or DNS configuration is active.

- **Open Source & Privacy Respecting:** Transparent code base, no user data collection, focused solely on connection measurement.

### Real-World Example:

Imagine visiting a popular news website. uBO Scope reveals that despite your content blocker, your browser connects to 12 unique third-party servers—some allowed, some stealthily redirected, some blocked. This insight helps you assess your exposure and refine your blocker or privacy settings accordingly.

## Why Should You Use uBO Scope?

### Outcomes You Can Expect

- **Greater Transparency:** Understand precisely what remote servers your browser contacts behind the scenes.

- **Improved Privacy Assessments:** Gauge your exposure to third-party trackers or unknown connections beyond simple block counts.

- **Filter List Validation:** Analyze the effectiveness of content blockers and DNS filtering with real connection data.

- **Myth Busting:** Avoid falling for misleading stats, such as high block counts correlating with more, not fewer, connections.

### Common Use Cases

- Privacy enthusiasts seeking clarity on their browsing footprint.
- Developers and researchers evaluating browser network behavior.
- Content blocker and filter list maintainers verifying the impact of their rules.
- Users troubleshooting unexpected data leaks or third-party requests.

### Experience Comparison

|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Blind to true number of third-party servers  | See all unique third-party connections       |
| Rely on block counts that may mislead         | Insight into actual connections allowed       |
| Vulnerable to stealthy redirects or DNS blocks | Detect stealth-blocked connections directly  |

## Getting Started Preview

Getting started with uBO Scope is as simple as installing the extension from your browser's addon marketplace. Once installed:

- Activate uBO Scope when browsing any webpage.
- Click the extension icon to open the popup showing connected domains.
- Observe the badge count on the toolbar for quick insight.

No complex configuration or setup is required.

### Prerequisites

- A modern browser supporting the `webRequest` API (Chromium, Firefox, Safari).
- Permissions requested during installation include network request observation (`webRequest`), active tab access, and local storage.

### Next Steps

For detailed installation instructions and first-time use tips, see [Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope](https://example.com/guides/getting-started-usage/install-setup) and [First-Time Setup & Permissions](https://example.com/getting-started/first-use-configuration/initial-setup).

## Additional Tips & Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope *in combination* with your existing content blockers to validate their effectiveness.
- Pay attention not only to blocked counts but to the allowed third-party domain count — your real privacy indicator.
- Avoid relying on ad blocker test pages; instead, rely on uBO Scope's holistic connection insights.
- Regularly review the popup's allowed, stealth, and blocked domain lists to identify any unexpected connections.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If no data appears in the popup, ensure uBO Scope has proper permissions and the browser supports the `webRequest` API.
- Badge count remaining empty may indicate no third-party connections detected or site uses network requests outside browser API reach.
- For persisting issues, refer to [Quick Validation & Basic Troubleshooting](https://example.com/getting-started/first-use-configuration/quick-validation).
