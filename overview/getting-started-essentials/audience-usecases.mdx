# Who is uBO Scope For?

Discover who gains the most from uBO Scope and understand the typical scenarios where it transforms how users perceive and manage their online privacy. Whether you're a privacy-conscious individual, a filter list maintainer, or simply curious about the third-party servers your browser connects to, this page details why uBO Scope is an essential tool for you.

## Unlock Transparency for Privacy-Conscious Users

Imagine browsing the web and wanting clear, instant insight into every third-party server your browser interacts with — the very servers that can track or profile your activity. uBO Scope serves precisely that purpose: revealing the invisible network connections browsers make under the hood.

Users who care deeply about safeguarding their privacy benefit immensely by seeing:

- Exactly which domains are contacted when they open a webpage.
- Which connections were allowed through, blocked, or stealth-blocked (intercepted silently).
- The true scale of third-party exposure beyond what typical content blockers indicate.

### Real Scenario
Jessica, a privacy advocate, suspects her favorite news site loads resources from many trackers. Using uBO Scope, she inspects the connection list and identifies unexpected third-party domains contacting her browser — information invaluable for adjusting her privacy settings or reporting to filter list maintainers.

## Empower Filter List Maintainers and Advanced Users

Maintaining filter lists demands precision and a deep understanding of real-world web traffic. uBO Scope equips list maintainers and advanced users with:

- A clear audit of domains contacted during browsing, facilitating discovery of new trackers or unwanted content.
- Ability to verify the effectiveness of existing filter lists by comparing allowed versus blocked domains.
- Insights into 'stealth-blocked' domains — where requests are intercepted to minimize page breakage or detection.

### Use Case
Alex, a filter list maintainer, relies on accurate data about the connections users’ browsers make to curate better blocking rules. By analyzing the domains reported by uBO Scope, Alex can pinpoint emerging tracking domains and refine filtering strategies.

## Curiosity & Education for the Inquisitive User

Not everyone is a privacy expert or a developer. Many users are simply curious about what happens behind the scenes in their browsers. uBO Scope offers an easy and visual way to:

- View all remote servers a webpage attempts to contact.
- See the categorized outcomes: which domains are blocked, allowed, or stealth-blocked.
- Understand the impact of content blockers beyond just “blocked or not.”

### Learning Scenario
Maria is fascinated by web technology. She uses uBO Scope to learn about third-party domains involved when she visits popular sites, helping her grasp how tracking and content delivery operate.

## Typical Problems uBO Scope Solves

- **Lack of Visibility into Third-Party Connections:** Most browsers do not natively show which servers your requests connect to or whether those connections were blocked.
- **Misleading Content Blocker Metrics:** Higher block counts in other blockers may imply more connections allowed, causing confusion. uBO Scope clarifies by focusing on the distinct domains connected rather than just block counts.
- **Manual Investigation Difficulty:** Without a tool, monitoring third-party domains requires technical skill and time-consuming manual efforts.
- **Filter List Validation:** Quickly and reliably validating the performance of filter lists on devices with limited tool access.

## Why You Should Care About These User Types

By understanding who benefits most from uBO Scope, you're better positioned to see how to incorporate it into your own workflow:

- **If you're concerned about online tracking:** uBO Scope gives you real power to see what your browser is revealing about your browsing habits.
- **If you build or maintain filter lists:** It provides the data you need to sharpen your work.
- **If you want to get hands-on with privacy tools:** uBO Scope acts as a straightforward, visual companion revealing behind-the-scenes network traffic.

## Getting Started: Experience uBO Scope in Action

From installation (covered in the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope)) to exploring the intuitive popup interface, users quickly gain transparency over remote connections:

- Open uBO Scope’s popup to see the current page’s domain and the distinct third-party domains contacted.
- Domains are neatly categorized into **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**, with counts to understand interaction volume.

Explore how uBO Scope fits naturally into your browsing or filter list development routine by moving to [Using uBO Scope for the First Time](/getting-started/first-use-configuration/using-the-extension) or learn more about [Exploring the Popup](/guides/getting-started-usage/understanding-popup).

---

## Practical Tips

- Regularly check the popup when visiting sensitive sites to detect new or unexpected connections.
- Use uBO Scope alongside content blockers to validate their real-world effectiveness.
- For filter list maintainers, combine uBO Scope data with traffic analysis tools for a robust testing setup.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not interpret a low block count on other blockers as definitive coverage—uBO Scope shows actual distinct server connections to clarify this.
- Remember that some third parties (like common Content Delivery Networks) are expected and typically benign.
- Understand that not all network requests may be visible to uBO Scope if they don’t route through the browser's `webRequest` API.
