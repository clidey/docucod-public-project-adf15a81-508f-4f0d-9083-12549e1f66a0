# Why Use uBO Scope?

## Unveiling the True Picture of Third-Party Connections

When you browse the web, countless connections happen behind the scenes—some necessary, some unwanted, and many invisible. uBO Scope cuts through this fog, providing unprecedented clarity by revealing **every** connection attempt your browser makes to remote servers, no matter which content blockers or DNS setups you use.

While traditional blockers might show how many requests they block, uBO Scope focuses on a more critical metric: the **number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser actually connects to**. This crucial insight reflects your true exposure and privacy footprint online.

## Breaking Down Common Myths About Content Blockers

### Myth 1: "A Higher Block Count Means Better Protection"

It’s intuitive to think that more blocked requests equals stronger blocking. uBO Scope reveals this is misleading: sometimes, a high block count actually coincides with having more connections to unique third-party servers. In other words, a blocker might show many blocked requests, yet still allow connections to an even larger number of third-party domains.

This happens because many blockers count every attempted request equally, even those leading to hosts already known as third parties. uBO Scope instead counts **distinct domains**, giving a **true representation of how many separate third parties your browser talked to.**

### Myth 2: "Ad Blocker Test Pages Reflect Real-World Blocking Effectiveness"

You may have come across webpages designed as "ad blocker tests". These tests often make unrealistic requests that don't represent typical website behavior. uBO Scope highlights that these tests can easily mislead users and do not reliably gauge a blocker’s effectiveness.

Many modern content blockers operate stealthily to avoid page breakage or detection, and these tricks confuse simple tests. Real browsing involves complex, dynamic connections that only a tool like uBO Scope can measure accurately.

## The Badge Count: Your Real-World Privacy Snapshot

uBO Scope’s toolbar badge displays the number of unique third-party servers your browser has connected with on any given web page. 

- **Lower is better:** The fewer third-party domains connected, the less tracking surface and potential privacy risk you have.
- **Actionable insight:** This count helps you quickly understand and compare the privacy impact of your content blocker settings.

This metric goes beyond individual request counts and provides you a clear, intuitive indicator of the real exposure on a site.

## Practical Benefits & Scenarios

- **Empower Privacy-Conscious Browsing:** Instantly see how many third-party connections your browser is making, regardless of blockers deployed.
- **Validate Content Blocker Effectiveness:** Use uBO Scope to compare how various blockers or filter lists impact actual third-party domain connections — not just raw block numbers.
- **Filter List Maintenance:** Especially useful for filter list developers and maintainers to identify where stealth blocking or unexpected connections happen.
- **Spot Misleading Claims:** Easily debunk misleading marketing or assumptions around blocking counts or ad blocker tests.

### Before uBO Scope

Users receive opaque numbers (blocked request counts) that can misrepresent real privacy impact. Misinterpretation is common, leading to false confidence or mistrust.

### After uBO Scope

Users gain a transparent, **domain-focused** perspective, enabling smart decisions about blockers, privacy settings, and web safety.

## Getting Started With uBO Scope’s Insights

To start realizing these benefits, simply install the extension and click the toolbar icon to open the popup. You will see three categories for the current active tab:

- **Allowed:** Domains from which connections were successfully made.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections that were silently blocked or redirected.
- **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked connections.

Explore these lists to understand which third parties your browser is talking to and adjust your privacy approach accordingly.
