# Feature Overview

Explore the core capabilities of uBO Scope designed to give you real-time, actionable insights into the network behavior of every webpage you visit. This page breaks down the essential features, focusing on what they mean for your privacy and browsing awareness.

---

## Live Tracking of Network Requests

uBO Scope continuously monitors the network requests made by webpages using the browser's `webRequest` API. This live tracking captures all connection attempts — successful, blocked, or redirected — providing an accurate and up-to-date view of remote server interactions as they happen.

### Why This Matters:
- Understand exactly which servers a webpage is talking to in real time.
- Detect hidden or stealthy connections that may go unnoticed by other tools.
- Gain transparency independent of which content blocker or DNS-based blocking is active.

**In the UI:** This feature feeds data directly to the popup interface where details are summarized per active tab.


## Aggregation and Reporting of Third-Party Domains

Unlike simple block counters, uBO Scope emphasizes counting **distinct third-party domains** that are contacted by the current tab. It distinguishes between:

- **Allowed:** Domains that connections successfully reached.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or stealth-blocked.
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed or were outright blocked.

These categories provide a clear map of network request outcomes, helping you assess your privacy footprint precisely.

### User Benefit:
- Easily identify how many and which third parties a site connects to.
- Understand the nature of each connection — allowed, stealth blocked, or blocked.
- Make informed decisions about site privacy based on domain-level data, not just request counts.

**Example:** When browsing a news site, you might see connections to a few first-party domains plus several third-party advertising and analytics domains flagged in these outcomes.


## Badge Count Updates for Quick Privacy Insight

uBO Scope dynamically updates the browser action toolbar badge to show the **number of distinct third-party domains allowed** for the active tab. This count provides a quick privacy health indicator at a glance.

### Benefits of the Badge:
- Immediate visual feedback about third-party connections on each tab.
- Encourages users to keep this number low for enhanced privacy.
- Supports rapid comparison of browsing sessions or sites.

<Tip>
Lower badge counts are better — they indicate fewer third-party servers are contacted by the page you’re viewing.

## Browser Support and Integration

uBO Scope is built to work seamlessly on all major modern browsers, including Chromium-based (Chrome, Edge), Firefox, and Safari. It leverages browser-native APIs and permissions:

- Requires `webRequest` permission to capture network data.
- Displays data via a lightweight popup UI accessible from the browser action icon.
- Uses browser storage APIs for session data persistence.

### Why This Matters:
- Consistent experience across your browsing environments.
- Easy installation and permissions management.
- Reliable operation without introducing page breakage or complex setup.


## Clear Results Interpretation in the Popup Interface

The extension’s popup presents aggregated domain data split into meaningful sections:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains that successfully connected.
- **Stealth Blocked:** Domains that were redirected or silently prevented from connecting.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts failed or were blocked explicitly.

Each domain row shows the domain name and the number of requests associated, giving nuanced insight into network traffic frequency.

### How This Helps You:
- Quickly assess the privacy implications of the current page.
- Spot unexpected or suspicious third parties.
- Understand not just *which* connections occur, but *how often* they happen.

### In-Context Example:
If a popular site connects to a content delivery network (CDN) many times and to several advertising domains a few times each, you’ll see these counts clearly.


## Summary

uBO Scope’s feature set empowers you to monitor and understand the remote server connections your browser makes per webpage, with a focus on third-party domains and their connection outcomes. The blend of live tracking, domain-level aggregation, real-time badge updates, multi-browser support, and an intuitive popup ensures you get meaningful privacy insights effortlessly.

<AccordionGroup title="Detailed Feature Insights">
<Accordion title="Live Network Request Tracking">
The extension listens for key network events in the browser — redirects, error occurrences, and response starts — to capture the lifecycle of every web request made by tabs. This ensures all types of request outcomes are logged precisely, regardless of content blocker behavior.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Third-Party Domain Categorization">
By extracting hostnames and determining their public suffix and base domain, uBO Scope cleanly aggregates connections under normalized domain names. This allows you to see a concise list of truly unique third-party domains contacted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Updates & Session Storage">
The badge dynamically updates only when meaningful data changes occur for the active tab. Session data, including domain connection histories, is stored between navigations in session storage to maintain consistency.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Cross-Browser Compatibility">
Implemented as a manifest v3 extension, uBO Scope uses a modular approach with background scripts and popup UI to maintain compatibility across browsers, respecting platform-specific APIs and permission models.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Interpreting Popup Data Sections">
Each popup section corresponds to a connection outcome, helping you distinguish between allowed connections you accepted, redirections or stealth blocking detected, and outright blocked requests.
