# Key Terminology and Concepts in uBO Scope

Understanding the language and key ideas behind uBO Scope empowers users to accurately interpret the network connection data the extension reveals. This page introduces essential terms such as ‘third-party servers’, ‘allowed’, ‘blocked’, ‘stealth’, and ‘badge count’. It clarifies what each category represents, illustrating how these concepts appear in the UI and the statistics reported.

## Understanding uBO Scope’s Domain Categories

uBO Scope classifies observed domains involved in network connections into three distinct categories. These classifications let users quickly grasp which third-party servers have been contacted and the nature of those connections.

### 1. Allowed Domains

- **Definition:** Domains from which network requests were successfully completed.
- **User Value:** This shows legitimate and permitted remote connections that have occurred or are being allowed by your content blocker.
- **UI Reflection:** Displayed under the “not blocked” section with domain names and request counts.

### 2. Blocked Domains

- **Definition:** Domains for which network requests were denied or failed due to content blocking.
- **User Value:** This reveals third-party servers your content blocker successfully stopped, improving your browsing privacy and security.
- **UI Reflection:** Listed under the “blocked” section with counts showing how frequently connection attempts were blocked.

### 3. Stealth-Blocked Domains

- **Definition:** Domains for which network requests were subtly redirected or intercepted as part of stealth blocking techniques.
- **User Value:** Reflects advanced blocking where attempts are hidden from the website but still prevented, avoiding detection or breakage.
- **UI Reflection:** Shown in the “stealth-blocked” section, distinguishing these from outright blocked connections.


## Key Concepts Behind Terminology

### Third-Party Servers

- These are remote domains that are different from the website you are currently visiting.
- uBO Scope tracks all such external connections, helping you understand the extent and diversity of remote interactions beyond the main website’s domain.

### Badge Count

- The badge on the extension’s toolbar icon reports the number of distinct **allowed third-party domains** contacted during your browsing session.
- A **lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, often a sign of stronger privacy protection.**
- The count reflects unique domains rather than total request volume.

### Hostnames vs. Domains

- **Hostname:** The exact network address your browser contacted (e.g., `track.example.com`).
- **Domain:** The registered domain under which multiple hostnames may exist (e.g., `example.com`).
- uBO Scope internally tracks both, but the UI primarily presents domain-level data for clearer insight.


## How These Terms Appear in the uBO Scope UI

When you click the extension icon, the popup UI presents:

- **Hostname Header:** Displays the current tab’s hostname and domain for context.
- **Summary:** Indicates the total number of connected domains.
- **Outcome Sections:** Separate listing for `not blocked`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked` domains.

Each domain listed here shows how often requests were made, giving quantitative insight.


## Real-World Example

Imagine you are visiting a popular news website:

- The **allowed** section might list legitimate CDN providers serving images and scripts.
- The **blocked** section could show advertising domains or trackers your content blocker stopped.
- The **stealth-blocked** section reveals domains that were quietly handled by stealth techniques, invisible to the website.

Seeing these categories helps you evaluate which third-party resources are active, which are blocked, and how stealth blocking contributes to your privacy.


## Summary of Important Terms

| Term               | Meaning                                           | UI Location           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Third-Party Server  | Any remote domain different from the visited site | All sections          |
| Allowed             | Requests completed successfully to third parties  | Not Blocked section   |
| Blocked             | Requests denied or failed due to blocking          | Blocked section       |
| Stealth             | Requests intercepted and silently blocked         | Stealth-Blocked section |
| Badge Count         | Number of distinct allowed third-party domains    | Toolbar icon badge    |


## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Interpret badge count as a privacy gauge**: Less typically means fewer third-party connections, indicating tighter control.
- **Review all three categories regularly**: Understanding stealth-blocked domains can reveal subtler content blocking.
- **Think in terms of domains, not just counts**: Some domains are essential (like content CDNs), so context matters.


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Assuming a high block count means better blocking — it may suggest more third-party connections are allowed overall.
- Ignoring stealth blocking as it’s not always obvious but important for privacy.
- Confusing hostname-level detail with domain-level summary — uBO Scope focuses on domain granularity for clarity.


## How This Fits Into the Bigger Picture

This terminology and concept foundation equips you to effectively navigate and understand the detailed information presented in the uBO Scope popup interface. It complements guides on interpreting network activity and validating your content blocker’s performance.

## Appendix: Example UI Elements Corresponding to Concepts

The following simplified HTML snippet shows how domain categories appear in the popup:

```html
<section class="outcome allowed">
    <h3>not blocked</h3>
    <div class="domains">
        <!-- Allowed domains inserted here -->
    </div>
</section>
<section class="outcome stealth">
    <h3>stealth-blocked</h3>
    <div class="domains">
        <!-- Stealth blocked domains inserted here -->
    </div>
</section>
<section class="outcome blocked">
    <h3>blocked</h3>
    <div class="domains">
        <!-- Blocked domains inserted here -->
    </div>
</section>
```

This layout confirms the conceptual grouping of network request outcomes and their presentation to users.
