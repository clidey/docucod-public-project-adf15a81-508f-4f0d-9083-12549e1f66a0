# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the key concepts and terminology behind uBO Scope is essential for interpreting its reports accurately and unlocking its full potential for privacy awareness. This page defines the critical terms you'll encounter while using uBO Scope, explains how the extension classifies network requests and outcomes, and clarifies the significance of the badge count displayed on the toolbar icon.

## What Is a Remote Server?

A *remote server* is any computer or device outside your local machine that your browser contacts to fetch resources or exchange data during web browsing. These servers provide content like images, scripts, stylesheets, advertisements, analytics, and other services embedded in web pages.

- They are typically identified by their hostnames or domains, such as `example.com` or `cdn.provider.net`.
- Remote servers can be first-party (matching the site being visited) or third-party (different from the site’s domain).

## Understanding Third-Parties

In the context of uBO Scope, a *third-party* is any remote server whose domain differs from the domain of the main webpage the user visits.

For example, if you browse `news.example.com`, and the page loads resources from `ads.adnetwork.com`, the latter is a third-party.

Third-party connections are important because they often relate to advertising, tracking, and other services that impact user privacy.

## Network Requests and Their Outcomes

uBO Scope listens to your browser's network activities and categorizes every outgoing network request based on what happens to it. Each request has an *outcome*:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** The request successfully connected to the remote server and data was exchanged.
  - These connections are fully established.
  - uBO Scope lists these servers under **`not blocked`**.

- **Blocked:** The request was explicitly prevented from reaching the remote server.
  - This blocking can occur via content blockers, DNS filtering, or browser mechanisms.
  - Servers in this category appear under **`blocked`**.

- **Stealth-Blocked:** The request was intercepted or redirected in a way designed to be concealed from webpages.
  - This outcome often results from stealth content blocking techniques that avoid revealing blocking actions.
  - uBO Scope reports these under **`stealth-blocked`**.

These categories provide users with a granular and transparent insight into which servers their browser talks to and which communication attempts are stopped.

## What Does the Badge Count Mean?

The badge count on the uBO Scope toolbar icon represents the **number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser has successfully connected to for the current active tab**.

- A *lower* badge count generally indicates better privacy because fewer third-party connections were allowed.
- The count reflects *unique domains* contacted, not the total number of requests.

<u>Note:</u> The badge does not count blocked or stealth-blocked servers; it focuses exclusively on successfully allowed connections to third parties.

## Domain vs. Hostname

- A *hostname* is the full domain label of a server, for example, `ads.tracker.example.com`.
- A *domain* refers to the registered main domain part, such as `example.com`, derived according to public suffix rules. This grouping helps classify requests accurately.

uBO Scope groups network requests by domain, enabling clearer aggregation and understanding of third-party connections.

## Practical Example

Suppose you visit `https://example.com` and open uBO Scope’s popup. You might see:

- **Not blocked:**
  - `example.com` (first-party, always allowed)
  - `cdn.examplecdn.net` (third-party content delivery)
- **Stealth-blocked:**
  - `stealthtracker.ads.com` (blocked invisibly)
- **Blocked:**
  - `annoyingads.network.com` (blocked explicitly)

The badge count would show **1** if only one third-party (e.g., `examplecdn.net`) was allowed.

## Best Practices to Interpret These Concepts

- Always consider both allowed and blocked server lists to understand the full picture of your browser’s network activity.
- Use stealth-blocked information to detect more subtle privacy protections your content blocker enforces.
- Don't rely exclusively on block counts from other content blockers—uBO Scope provides direct insight into actual network server connections.

## Summary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Remote Server | Any external server contacted by your browser during browsing |
| Third-Party | Any server whose domain differs from the main site’s domain |
| Allowed Request | Network request successfully connected and transferred data |
| Blocked Request | Request prevented from reaching the server |
| Stealth-Blocked Request | Request blocked or redirected invisibly to conceal blocking |
| Badge Count | Number of unique third-party domains with allowed connections |

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions & Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Why are some domains listed as stealth-blocked?">
Stealth-blocked domains indicate requests that were blocked in a way that’s hidden from webpages to avoid detection or breakage. This is normal behavior for stealthy content blockers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if the badge count is zero but I still see domains listed?">
The badge reflects third-party allowed domains only for the active tab. First-party domains or blocked domains don’t count toward the badge number.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does uBO Scope determine domains?">
Domains are resolved using the Public Suffix List to correctly identify the registered domain boundary, critical for accurate grouping of third parties.
