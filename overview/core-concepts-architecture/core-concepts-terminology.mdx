# Core Concepts and Terminology

Understanding the fundamental terms and concepts used in uBO Scope is essential to accurately interpret its data and make informed privacy decisions. This page clarifies key terminology such as third-party remote servers, the meanings of "allowed", "blocked", and "stealth" requests, and explains how badge counts correspond to actual privacy exposure.

## Why Does Terminology Matter?

Imagine browsing a website and seeing that your uBO Scope icon shows a number. What exactly does this number represent? Many users misunderstand badge counts and connection outcomes, which can lead to incorrect assumptions about their privacy safety. This page helps you decode what you see and empowers you with clear definitions to fully grasp the extension's reporting.

## Defining Third-Party Remote Servers

A **third-party remote server** is any server contacted by your browser that is *not* the main website domain you are visiting.

- **Main site (first-party)**: The root domain of the page you visit.
- **Third-party**: Any other domain contacted during the page load or interaction.

For example, if you visit `example.com` and your browser loads resources from `cdn.example.net` or `analytics.tracker.com`, those external domains count as third-party remote servers.

### Importance in uBO Scope

uBO Scope tracks **distinct third-party remote servers**. This count reflects the *number of different third-party domains* your browser connects to — a lower number improves privacy, as fewer external connections mean less data exposure.

## Understanding Request Outcomes

uBO Scope categorizes network requests to give you clarity on what happened during your browsing session:

### Allowed Requests
These requests were successfully sent and received data from the remote server.

- This means the connection was not blocked by any content blocker.
- These contribute directly to your privacy exposure since data is exchanged.

### Blocked Requests
These requests were prevented from completing, typically by a content blocker or other filtering mechanism.

- Blocking may happen through browser APIs, DNS filtering, or extensions.
- Not all blocked requests are visible through conventional means; uBO Scope reports based on `webRequest` API feedback.

### Stealth Requests
These are network requests that encounter **redirects** or are subject to stealth blocking techniques.

- They may be hidden or masked by content blockers to avoid detection or webpage breakage.
- Such requests don’t count as allowed, but their exact behavior varies depending on filtering techniques.

## How Badge Counts Relate to Privacy Exposure

The badge count shown on the extension icon indicates the number of distinct **third-party remote servers** for which a connection was successfully made (allowed requests). It is vital to understand:

- A **higher badge count means more third-party connections**, increasing your privacy exposure.
- A **lower badge count means fewer connections to third parties**, improving your privacy.
- **Blocked or stealth requests do not increase the badge count**, so the count reflects only actual network connections made.

### Common Misconceptions

- **More block counts on other extensions do not mean better blocking.** Some extensions show many blocked requests but still allow connections to multiple third-party servers, resulting in higher actual exposure.
- **Ad blocker test pages are not reliable.** They produce artificial conditions making it seem like some extensions block more, but real-web browsing scenarios reveal actual exposure best.

## Interpreting uBO Scope Data Accurately

### Example Scenario
You visit a news site. uBO Scope’s badge shows “3”. What does this mean?

- Your browser connected successfully to the main site and 3 other unique third-party domains (e.g., a CDN, analytics, and a social media widget).
- There might have been other requests blocked or stealthily blocked, but these are not counted in the badge.

### Practical Tips

- Use the popup panel to see detailed domain counts across **allowed, blocked, and stealth** categories.
- Do not judge privacy solely by block counts of other extensions; focus on third-party domains connected.
- Recognize stealth requests as a middle ground — they hint at filtered requests that might still affect privacy indirectly.

## Summary Table of Terms

| Term                     | Description                                                          | User Impact                                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Third-Party Remote Server| Any server domain other than the main site domain visited            | Indicates potential external data exposure      |
| Allowed Request          | Network request that completed successfully                          | Increases privacy exposure                       |
| Blocked Request          | Network request prevented by filtering mechanisms                    | Reduces data exposure                            |
| Stealth Request          | Request encountering redirects or stealth blocking                  | Indicates partial filtering or obfuscation      |
| Badge Count              | Number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected to    | A key privacy metric; lower is better            |

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions & Answers">
<Accordion title="Why does my badge number sometimes not match the number of blocked requests?">
Blocked requests do not count in the badge number. The badge exclusively counts distinct third-party domains for which connections were allowed, reflecting actual network exposure rather than all filtering actions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is a stealth-blocked request?">
Stealth requests are those that are effectively blocked but may still trigger network behaviors like redirects, to avoid web page breakage or blocker detection. They do not count as allowed but indicate hidden attempts to connect.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Should I trust ad blocker test webpages?">
No. These tests typically simulate artificial scenarios that do not reflect real-world browsing. Use uBO Scope’s data for genuine transparency about your browsers’ third-party connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I interpret entries in the popup panel?">
Allowed domains show third-parties your browser connected to, blocked domains are those prevented, and stealth domains represent partially or stealthily blocked requests. Comparing these helps understand your actual exposure and filtering effectiveness.
