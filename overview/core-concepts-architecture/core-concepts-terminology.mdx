# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the key terms used by uBO Scope is essential to interpreting its data and user interface accurately. This page introduces foundational concepts like 'third-party server', 'block count', 'stealth', and 'badge count', providing clear context so you can make informed decisions about your browsing privacy and network activity.

## Third-Party Server

A **third-party server** refers to any remote server contacted by your browser that is different from the primary website you are visiting. 

For example, if you visit `example.com`, but your browser also requests resources from `cdn.example.net` or `analytics.somesite.com`, those are third parties. uBO Scope tracks connections to these to help you understand the external entities involved during your browsing session.

> Knowing the number of distinct third-party servers contacted gives a more accurate picture of your privacy exposure than simply counting blocked requests.

## Block Count

The **block count** represents how many network requests were prevented from reaching their destination by your content blocker or other mechanisms. 

However, a high block count does *not* necessarily mean better privacy protection. It can be deceptive because allowing a connection to many different third parties might result in a lower block count but greater privacy risk.

<u>Key insight:</u> The block count does *not* reflect the number of distinct third-party servers contacted. Instead, it shows how many requests were *stopped*; these requests might still allow numerous undetected connections to other servers.

## Stealth

**Stealth** is a term uBO Scope uses to designate network requests that were blocked in a way that is hidden or disguised from the webpage itself — commonly employed by content blockers to prevent websites from detecting that content blocking is happening.

This means stealth blocking avoids breaking a webpage while stopping unwanted network requests.

In uBO Scope, stealth-blocked domains are reported separately, helping you distinguish between outright blocked connections and stealth blocking.

## Badge Count

The **badge count** shown on uBO Scope’s icon in your browser toolbar is a crucial privacy indicator.

It reflects the number of *distinct third-party domains* to which network connections were either attempted or successfully made during the current browsing session on the active tab.

### Why does badge count matter?

- It presents a simple number summarizing your exposure to external servers.
- A **lower badge count** suggests fewer external entities involved, thus lower privacy exposure.
- It overcomes misleading interpretations of block counts by focusing on distinct server connections, not the volume of blocked or allowed requests.

<Tip>
Remember, the badge count does not count first-party servers or subdomains of the page you're visiting. It strictly quantifies distinct third-party domains contacted.

## Real-World Context: Using These Terms

Imagine you're browsing a news website that loads content from its own server plus several external services like ad networks, analytics platforms, and content delivery networks (CDNs). 

- uBO Scope will track all these requests, categorizing them as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- The **badge count** will display how many unique third-party servers your browser contacted.
- By reviewing the popup interface, you can see which servers were blocked outright, which were stealthily blocked, and which connections succeeded.

This detailed categorization empowers you to understand your actual privacy exposure, not just raw request counts or superficial measurement metrics.

## Summary of Key Terms

| Term             | Description                                                                                          | User Benefit                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Third-Party Server | Remote server different from the main site domain you visit                                        | Recognize external entities engaging with your browser |
| Block Count      | Number of network requests blocked by content blockers or other methods                           | Understand what is prevented vs permitted       |
| Stealth          | Network requests blocked in a way that websites can't easily detect                               | Enables subtle blocking without webpage breakage |
| Badge Count      | Number of distinct third-party domains connected during a browsing session for active tab        | Quick, reliable privacy exposure indicator      |

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Use the **badge count** as your primary privacy metric rather than block count.
- Check the popup panel to differentiate between blocked, stealth-blocked, and allowed domains.
- Understand that legitimate third-party connections, such as CDNs, are normal and typically low in number.
- Avoid relying on external ad blocker test websites, as uBO Scope reveals real-world connection data directly from your browser.

## Common Pitfalls

- Misinterpreting the block count as a measure of privacy protection.
- Assuming stealth-blocked connections mean the same as fully blocked connections; stealth blocking hides blocking from webpages but still prevents data transfer.
- Believing that all third-party connections are malicious; many are necessary and benign.
