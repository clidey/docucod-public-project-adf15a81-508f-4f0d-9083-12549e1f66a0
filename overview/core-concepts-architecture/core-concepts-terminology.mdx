# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the core terminology behind uBO Scope is essential for accurately interpreting its data and evaluating your browser's network activity. This page introduces key terms such as third-party remote servers, allowed connections, blocked requests, stealth blocking, and clarifies how these relate to the badge counts and privacy assessment.

---

## What Are Third-Party Remote Servers?

When you visit a website, your browser often connects not only to the site's own servers but also to various other servers that provide content like advertisements, analytics, content delivery networks (CDNs), or social media widgets. These external servers are called *third-party remote servers* because they differ from the main site’s domain.

**Why is this distinction important?**
- Each third-party connection increases your exposure to remote servers.
- Monitoring these connections helps you assess your privacy surface.

uBO Scope tracks these connections per browser tab, revealing which third parties are contacted and how.

---

## Understanding Connection Outcomes

uBO Scope classifies network requests into three important outcomes based on whether and how the requests were allowed or blocked:

### Allowed Connections
These are network requests that successfully connected to remote servers. They represent resources loaded into the browser without interference.

_For example:_ A website loading images or scripts from a trusted CDN results in an allowed connection.

---

### Blocked Requests
Blocked requests are those prevented from reaching their destination by your content blocker or other mechanisms. These often represent attempts to connect to trackers, ads, or unwanted resources.

_Example scenario:_ A request to a known ad server is blocked, improving your browsing privacy.

---

### Stealth Blocking
Stealth blocking refers to connections that are blocked in a manner designed to be subtle, avoiding detection by webpages or scripts. These requests are silently prevented, reducing the chance of site breakage or reveal to the server.

_Stealth blocked requests show up in uBO Scope under the "stealth-blocked" category, providing insight into these specialized blocks._

## Badge Count: What Does It Mean?

The badge number on the uBO Scope toolbar icon displays **the count of distinct third-party remote servers your browser has successfully connected to on the active tab**.

- A **lower badge count is more desirable** because it means fewer unique third-party connections occurred.
- This count reflects servers from which resources were actually fetched, not just attempted connections.

<u>Crucially:</u> This count is not the number of blocked connections but the number of *allowed* distinct third-party servers detected.

---

## Why These Terms Matter for Privacy and Analysis

By understanding these concepts, you can:

- **Interpret uBO Scope data accurately:** Distinguish what allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked outcomes mean in practice.
- **Assess your browser’s network exposure:** Focus on distinct third parties rather than raw block counts or request volume.
- **Make smarter privacy decisions:** Knowing the difference between stealth blocking and regular blocking helps you understand the balance between blocking efficacy and website compatibility.

---

## Concrete Example User Flow

Consider you visit example.com, which loads:

- Scripts from `cdn.example.com` — **allowed connection**
- Ads from `ads.tracker.net` — **blocked connection**
- An analytics request to `analytics.stealth.org` — **stealth-blocked connection**

uBO Scope’s popup will categorize these domains accordingly and the badge count will reflect the number of unique allowed third-party servers (e.g., `cdn.example.com`).

This accurate breakdown allows you to spot which connections are permitted and which are prevented, equipping you with actionable insights.

---

## Best Practices When Using These Concepts

- Always cross-reference the badge count with the popup details to see the full connection picture.
- Use stealth blocking insight to evaluate sites that may be attempting to circumvent normal blocking.
- Remember that not all third-party connections are harmful; some are essential for site functionality.
- Keep your content blockers updated to maximize blocking efficacy and stealth capabilities.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions & Clarifications">
<Accordion title="Why is the badge count not showing the same number as blocked requests?">
The badge count only shows the number of distinct allowed third-party servers — blocked requests do not increment this count because those connections did not succeed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does stealth blocking mean in practice?">
Stealth blocking quietly blocks requests without letting webpages detect the block. This maintains site functionality while enhancing privacy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are all third-party servers bad?">
Not necessarily. Some third parties deliver necessary services like fonts or libraries. The goal is to minimize unwanted third parties, not all.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can the badge count be zero?">
Yes, if no third-party remote servers are contacted successfully, the badge will be blank or zero, indicating minimal external exposure.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

uBO Scope’s terminology is the key to unlocking its value:

- **Third-party remote servers:** external domains contacted by your browser.
- **Allowed connections:** successfully fetched resources.
- **Blocked requests:** prevented resource loads.
- **Stealth blocking:** subtle, undetectable blocking.
- **Badge count:** number of distinct allowed third-party servers.

With these clear definitions, you can confidently analyze network activity, assess blocking effectiveness, and optimize your browsing privacy.
