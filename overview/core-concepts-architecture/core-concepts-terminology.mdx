# Key Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the core terms behind uBO Scope is essential to fully appreciate how it reveals network activity and provides transparency on connections to third-party servers. This page breaks down the key vocabulary and explains how uBO Scope categorizes and reports network events, helping you make sense of the data and protect your privacy.

## What Are Third-Party Remote Servers?

When you visit a website, your browser loads resources not only from that site's domain but often from many other domains. These other domains are called **third-party remote servers** because they are external services not owned by the site you are visiting.

For example, a news site might load images from its own domain but also fetch ads or analytics from external providers. uBO Scope tracks all such connections to these third-party remote servers, giving you visibility into who your browser talks to behind the scenes.

---

## Outcomes: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Domains

uBO Scope organizes network events into three categories based on what happened to HTTP or WebSocket requests:

- **Allowed:** These are connections to remote servers that your browser successfully fetched resources from without being blocked. An allowed connection means that resources from that domain were retrieved and contributed to loading the page.

- **Blocked:** These are connection attempts that your content blocker or browser prevented from completing. When a domain falls under this category, no resources were fetched from it because the request was stopped — effectively protecting you from unwanted content or tracking.

- **Stealth:** These represent domains where connection attempts were intercepted in a way that they never actually completed, but without uBO Scope detecting a conventional block. These stealth domains might be involved in redirections or filtered by mechanisms that make blocking invisible or hidden, hence the term "stealth-blocked."

### Why does this matter?
By separating domains into these three categories, uBO Scope helps you understand not just what connections happen, but how effectively your blockers work — including those hidden from direct view.


---

## What Is a Stealth Domain?

Stealth domains are unique in that connections to them don't show up as outright blocked requests through common browser APIs but are nevertheless not fully loaded. 

This could mean that the network call was redirected, canceled, or blocked by advanced stealth techniques implemented by content blockers or intermediary network layers. 

uBO Scope still detects these stealth domains to provide insight into these hidden blocking events, offering a fuller picture of your browsing privacy.

---

## Badge Count Explained

On your browser's toolbar, the uBO Scope icon displays a **badge count** — a small number that reflects the number of distinct third-party remote **domains** with which the current tab established successful connections.

- **Meaning of the count:** The badge shows how many unique third-party domains were contacted **and allowed** during the page load.

- **Interpreting the count:** A **lower number is more desirable** because it means fewer external connections, reducing exposure to tracking or unwanted content.

- **Note:** This count only includes third-party domains that were successfully connected to, not those blocked.


---

## How uBO Scope Categorizes Network Events

When a network request is observed in the browser, uBO Scope uses the following logic to place it into one of the categories:

- If the request completes successfully and is not redirected or blocked, it is recorded as **allowed**.

- If the request fails or the browser signals an error (such as network blockage), it is recorded as **blocked**.

- If the request is redirected in a way where some intermediate domain cannot be observed or is filtered silently, it is recorded as a **stealth** domain.

This categorization is done per tab, allowing you to see exact network activity grouped by whether a domain was allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked.

## Relating Domains, Hostnames, and the Public Suffix List

To make sense of all the URLs your browser contacts, uBO Scope analyzes and groups outgoing requests by domain and hostname:

- The **hostname** is the full domain name of the resource requested, e.g., `images.example.cdn.com`.

- The **domain** is the effective second-level domain plus the public suffix, e.g., `cdn.com` or `example.co.uk`.

To correctly extract these domains despite varying global domain suffix structures, uBO Scope relies on the **Public Suffix List**, a standardized list that defines domain hierarchy rules worldwide.

This enables consistent grouping and counting of third-party domains, making the badge count and detailed reports accurate and meaningful.

### Practical Example:

- URL requested: `https://ads.tracker.example.co.uk/script.js`
- Hostname: `ads.tracker.example.co.uk`
- Domain (effective second-level): `example.co.uk`
- uBO Scope categorizes the request based on the domain, so multiple hostnames under `example.co.uk` count as one domain.


---

## How to Use This Terminology in Your Workflow

When you open uBO Scope's popup interface:

- You see three sections listing domains under **Allowed**, **Stealth**, and **Blocked**.

- Each domain is accompanied by a count showing how many requests to that domain were observed.

- The domain list is sorted alphabetically, and the summary section displays the total number of distinct allowed domains.

This terminology helps you quickly understand the network footprint of a browser tab:

- Are there many third parties connected?
- How many were blocked outright?
- Are there stealth domains that might indicate hidden blocking or redirects?


---

## Common User Scenarios & Tips

- If you notice a high badge count (allowed domains), consider reviewing the allowed third-party domains in the popup to investigate potential privacy risks.

- A high number of **blocked** domains indicates proactive blocking by your content blocker, but remember, **allowed domains matter most for privacy.**

- If you observe domains only in the **stealth** category, this may reflect complex blocking mechanisms, possibly invisible to normal network tools. It’s worth investigating these to understand your blocker’s stealth impact.

- Use the domain counts to identify unusual or unexpected third-party domains, which might indicate trackers or ad networks.
