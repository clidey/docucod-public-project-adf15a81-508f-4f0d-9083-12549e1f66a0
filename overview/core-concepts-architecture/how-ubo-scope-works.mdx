# How uBO Scope Works

Discover how uBO Scope continuously monitors and reports third-party network connections initiated by your browser. This page explains the mechanics behind its observation of network traffic, the meaning of the toolbar badge count, and how to interpret the displayed connection outcomes.

---

## Observing Network Connections with the Browser's webRequest API

uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API, a powerful tool that allows extensions to monitor all network requests initiated by web pages. Through this API, uBO Scope transparently tracks every connection your browser attempts or successfully establishes with remote servers while you browse.

This means that regardless of any content blocker or DNS-layer filtering you use, uBO Scope reports what actually happens with network requests visible to the browser. It listens for three key events:

- **Requests that redirect:** When a network request is rerouted to a different URL.
- **Requests that fail (errors):** When a request is blocked, cancelled, or otherwise fails.
- **Requests that succeed:** When a network request completes successfully with a response.

By collecting this comprehensive data, uBO Scope builds a clear picture of the web resources your browser attempts to contact.

## What Does the Toolbar Badge Count Mean?

The toolbar badge count is central to uBO Scope’s user interface. It shows the **number of distinct third-party remote servers that your browser connected to during the current browsing session for each tab.**

### Why Focus on Third-Party Remote Servers?

Most websites rely on a small number of first-party servers to deliver their content. However, they often load resources from external parties — like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), analytics services, or advertising networks.

A lower badge count means your browser has established connections to fewer distinct third-party servers, which often correlates to tighter privacy and less tracking exposure.

### What Does "Distinct" Mean Here?

uBO Scope counts unique domains of remote servers contacted, not raw requests. For example, if multiple resources load from the same third-party server, they are counted as one.

This approach helps you quickly understand the breadth of external connections a webpage initiates.

## The Data uBO Scope Collects and Displays

In the popup interface (activated by clicking the toolbar icon), uBO Scope categorizes all observed domains based on the outcome of each network request:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains from which your browser successfully fetched content.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or blocked in a way that is not directly observable to the webpage, typically by stealthy content blocking techniques.
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed explicitly due to blocking or error.

For each category, uBO Scope shows the domains contacted and the number of attempts per domain.

This granular visibility empowers you to understand exactly how and when your browser interacts with third-party services.

> #### Real-World Example:
> Imagine you visit a news website. The badge count shows '3'. Clicking the icon reveals:
>
> - **Not Blocked:** cdn.example.com (10 requests), analytics.example.net (4 requests)
> - **Stealth-Blocked:** tracker.ads.com (5 requests)
> - **Blocked:** malware.example.org (1 request)
>
>This tells you that despite some tracking attempts, your content blocker limits what the website can reach.

## How uBO Scope Handles Network Requests Behind the Scenes

For each browser tab, uBO Scope maintains an internal record of network requests and their outcomes:

1. When a **main frame request** (the top-level webpage) starts, uBO Scope resets tracking data for that tab.
2. Network requests are grouped by their respective domains and classified by outcome.
3. Redirects are tracked to capture stealth blocking or indirect blocking methods.
4. Blocked or errored requests are recorded separately to show which domains failed to load.
5. Successful requests increment counts for allowed domains.

This ongoing evaluation enables uBO Scope to dynamically update the badge count and popup details, reflecting the real-time browsing context.

---

## How to Interpret Outcomes

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** These domains represent resources your browser fetched successfully. A high count here means many third-party connections were allowed.

- **Stealth-Blocked:** Some blockers intercept requests invisibly (redirects or cancelled requests without webpage notice). uBO Scope surfaces these suppressed attempts, helping you assess stealth blocking effectiveness.

- **Blocked:** Domains where requests resulted in explicit failure or blocking, clearly visible to both the browser and the webpage.

Understanding these categories helps you differentiate between truly blocked content, stealthy suppression, and allowed resource loading.

---

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

- The badge count only reflects **network requests visible to the browser’s webRequest API.** Some browser- or system-level DNS blocking or extensions that bypass webRequest may not be fully captured.

- A lower badge count generally indicates better containment of third-party connections but verify which domains are involved to understand risks.

- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to gain transparency and validate blocking effectiveness.

- In cases where the badge count unexpectedly increases, check the blocked and stealth-blocked sections to identify changes in resource loading or new trackers introduced by webpages.
