# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the foundational terminology that uBO Scope uses is essential to harness its full power in monitoring and evaluating network connections within your browser. This page defines key domain-specific terms such as ‘third-party remote servers’, ‘webRequest listeners’, ‘allowed’, ‘blocked’, ‘stealth-blocked’, and the ‘public suffix list’. Mastering these terms equips you with the conceptual language needed to navigate and interpret uBO Scope’s reports and interface effectively.

## Why Terminology Matters

Imagine you are examining the network activity of a webpage. To interpret what you see in the uBO Scope popup or badge counts, you need clarity on what the data signifies. Without understanding the precise meanings of terms like 'allowed' or 'stealth-blocked', you might misread the results and arrive at incorrect conclusions about your privacy or content blocker effectiveness.

This page bridges that gap by defining terminology in user-centric language, empowering you to read further documentation confidently and interact with uBO Scope as it was intended — as a transparent, reliable tool to reveal remote connections.

## Key Terms Defined

### Third-Party Remote Servers
These are servers that are distinct from the main web domain of the page you are visiting. For example, if you visit `example.com` and it loads resources from `cdn.example.com`, that is first-party or a subdomain. However, if it connects to `analytics.thirdparty.com`, that counts as a third-party remote server.

Understanding connections to third-party servers is critical because these connections often involve data sharing with external entities, impacting your privacy.

### webRequest Listeners
These are the underlying browser APIs that uBO Scope uses to monitor network activity. They listen for network request events such as redirects, responses starting, or errors occurring during resource fetches from web pages. 

- `onBeforeRedirect` detects when a request is redirected.
- `onErrorOccurred` captures failed requests.
- `onResponseStarted` notices successful connections.

uBO Scope relies on these listeners to classify each network request's outcome.

### Connection Outcomes
uBO Scope categorizes network requests into three outcome types, reflecting the fate of each connection attempt:

- **Allowed:** The request was made and completed successfully. These connections are visible in your network activity because the resource was fetched.

- **Blocked:** The request was prevented or failed, typically due to content blocking or other network errors. This means the resource did not load.

- **Stealth-Blocked:** These are requests that were redirected or otherwise obscured in a way that is not directly visible as a block but reflect blocking behavior. For example, some content blockers quietly redirect requests to anonymize or silently block them.

### Public Suffix List (PSL)
The Public Suffix List is a curated, authoritative catalog of domain suffixes under which multiple distinct registrants can directly register domains. Examples include popular suffixes like `.com`, country codes like `.uk`, or more complex suffixes such as `.co.uk` or `.github.io`.

uBO Scope uses this list to accurately determine the "registrable domain" from a given hostname, ensuring it groups network requests correctly. This precision helps distinguish whether connections belong to the site you are visiting or truly third-party domains.

## How These Terms Fit Together in uBO Scope

When uBO Scope observes a network request, it extracts the hostname and uses the Public Suffix List to identify its domain. It tracks how many times each third-party domain is connected to and classifies these connections based on their outcome — allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

The badge count on the toolbar reflects the number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections, giving a quick privacy-relevant metric.

By understanding these conceptual terms, you can interpret the popup interface, read count badges accurately, and gain insights into real network behaviors, independent of your content blocker’s internal workings or reporting inconsistencies.

---

## Practical Examples

- Visiting a news site might lead to allowed connections to its main domain and stealth-blocked connections to tracking services that attempt to redirect requests.

- When a content blocker prevents ad networks from loading, uBO Scope will classify those requests as blocked.

- Some resources load from CDNs (content delivery networks) like `cdn.examplecdn.com` which, though third-party, may be essential and trusted. uBO Scope reports these distinctly.

---

## Best Practices for Using This Knowledge

- **Interpret badge counts with domain granularity in mind:** Each count represents a unique third-party domain, not the number of requests.

- **Use understanding of outcomes to assess content blockers:** A lower allowed domain count generally signifies fewer external connections, which helps evaluate privacy effectively.

- **Recognize stealth-blocked connections as nuanced blocking:** They may evade some blockers’ immediate detection but are flagged by uBO Scope for greater transparency.

- **Refer to the Public Suffix List concept** when confused about domain groupings—it clarifies why `a.b.co.uk` and `c.d.co.uk` belong to the same registrable domain `co.uk`.

## Troubleshooting Common Terminology Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Terminology Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count not match the number of blocked domains?">
The badge counts only **allowed** third-party domains — domains from which the browser successfully fetched resources. Blocked or stealth-blocked domains are reported separately in the popup and do not affect the badge count.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is the difference between hostname and domain in reports?">
The hostname is the full subdomain from the URL (e.g., `ads.tracker.example.com`), while the domain is the registrable domain derived using the Public Suffix List (e.g., `example.com`). uBO Scope groups connections by domain but also tracks hostnames internally.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does stealth-blocking differ from blocking?">
Stealth-blocking involves indirect blocking, such as redirections or silent failing of requests that may bypass standard error reporting but ultimately prevent resource loading. uBO Scope marks these separately to highlight less obvious blocking.
</Accordion>
