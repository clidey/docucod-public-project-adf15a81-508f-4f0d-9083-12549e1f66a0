# Key Terms & Concepts

Understanding the core terminology of uBO Scope is essential to decoding what this extension reports and appreciating the insights it provides about your web browsing connections. This page unpacks the most important terms and concepts including 'third-party remote server,' 'connection outcome,' 'stealth-blocked,' and the significance of unique domains and badge counts.

## What Is a Third-Party Remote Server?

When browsing the web, your browser connects not only to the website you actively visit (the "first-party") but also to various other servers providing resources, advertisements, or services. These others are known as **third-party remote servers** because they belong to domains different from the main website’s domain.

### Why This Matters

Third-party servers often track activity, deliver ads, or load external content. Knowing which third-parties your browser connects to is key for privacy-conscious users seeking transparency and control.

### Real-World Example

Visiting a news site (e.g., `news.example.com`) might cause your browser to contact domains like `ads.tracker.com` or `cdn.contentdelivery.net`. These are third-party remote servers distinct from the main site.

---

## Connection Outcome — What Happened to the Request?

uBO Scope reports **connection outcomes** for each attempted network request. These outcomes indicate whether the browser successfully connected to a remote server, had the connection blocked, or was prevented in a subtle way.

### Types of Outcomes

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** The browser successfully connected and retrieved content from the remote server. 
- **Blocked:** The connection was stopped — either by a content blocker or network-level filtering. 
- **Stealth-Blocked:** The request was blocked stealthily, meaning the blocker prevented detection or the page noticing the block, often by silently ignoring or redirecting.


### Why Connection Outcomes Matter

Knowing the outcome helps you distinguish between requests that actually load resources and ones that were prevented. Simply counting blocks is misleading without seeing which third-parties still connect.

---

## Stealth-Blocked Connections Explained

The **stealth-blocked** category is unique to uBO Scope.

### Definition

A request is stealth-blocked when the content blocker blocks the request but does so in a way that the webpage cannot easily detect — no error message, no visible delay. This approach avoids breaking websites while still stopping unwanted connections.

### Benefits

- Keeps websites functioning normally.
- Prevents scripts from detecting ad blocking and altering behavior.

---

## Unique Domains and the Badge Count

### How Domains Are Counted

uBO Scope aggregates connections by unique domains contacted from each browser tab. It distinguishes between hostnames and their **registered domains** (using the Public Suffix List to parse out registrable domains). 

### What the Badge Number Means

- The **badge count** on the toolbar icon shows the number of **distinct third-party domains** contacted by the active tab.
- A **lower number** is generally better, indicating fewer external domains are loaded.

### Why This Metric Is More Meaningful Than Block Counts

- Unlike block counts that can inflate with repeated blocking of the same domain, uBO Scope tracks unique remote domains.
- It shows your actual exposure rather than the volume of blocked requests.

---

## Domain Parsing Made Simple

uBO Scope uses the **Public Suffix List** — an authoritative list of domain suffixes like `.com`, `.co.uk`, `.app`, etc. — to determine:

- The **public suffix** part of a hostname.
- The **registered domain**, which includes the public suffix plus one additional label. 

### Why It’s Important

Correct domain parsing ensures connections are grouped properly. For instance, `ads.example.co.uk` and `images.example.co.uk` map to the same registered domain `example.co.uk`.

## Summary: What You See in uBO Scope

When opening uBO Scope’s popup interface, you will encounter three main sections:

1. **Not Blocked:** Domains your browser connected to successfully.
2. **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were blocked silently by filters.
3. **Blocked:** Domains with connections explicitly blocked.

Each entry lists the domain and the count of connections, empowering you with granular visibility.

---

## Practical Tips

- **Regularly review** the badge count to gauge how many third-parties your active tab is accessing.
- **Use the popup details** to identify and investigate unexpected or suspicious domains.
- **Understand stealth-blocking** as a subtle balance between blocking and maintaining site usability.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Do not rely solely on block count badges from other extensions; uBO Scope’s unique domain count offers clearer insight.
- Misinterpretation of what constitutes a "third-party" domain can occur without understanding domain parsing.
- Failing to consider stealth-blocked connections might cause you to underestimate some blockers' effectiveness.
