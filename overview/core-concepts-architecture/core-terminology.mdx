# Core Concepts and Terminology

Understanding the core concepts and terminology behind uBO Scope is essential for unlocking the full value of this powerful browser extension. This page defines key terms such as 'allowed', 'blocked', 'stealth', 'third-party server', and explains the significance of the badge count you see on the toolbar icon. Whether you're a casual user or an advanced researcher, these definitions will clarify how uBO Scope works, what you are observing, and how to interpret the data presented.

## Why These Terms Matter

uBO Scope is designed to transparently reveal all network connections attempted or made by the websites you visit, regardless of your content blocker settings. To make sense of the data in the popup panel and the badge count, you need a shared understanding of what certain outcomes mean and how "third-party" relationships are determined. This clarity prevents misconceptions and helps you draw accurate conclusions about your browsing privacy.

## Key Terminology

### Third-Party Server
A **third-party server** is any remote server domain different from the domain of the website you are currently visiting (the "first-party"). For example, when visiting "example.com", a connection to "analytics.tracker.net" is considered a third-party connection.

- uBO Scope groups hostnames into domains using the **Public Suffix List** to correctly identify the registered domain boundaries.
- The badge count on the toolbar icon represents the number of **distinct third-party domains** contacted by the current page.

Understanding third-party domains is crucial because these often represent external trackers, content delivery networks (CDN), ad services, or other external resources.

### Allowed
**Allowed** refers to network connections that were completed successfully—resources fetched from third-party servers without being blocked.

- These connections are visible to the web page and often necessary for page functionality or legitimate content delivery.
- uBO Scope tallies the domains and hostnames for all allowed requests, presenting them in the "not blocked" section.

### Blocked
**Blocked** refers to network connections that failed to reach their destination due to content blocking mechanisms.

- This includes requests explicitly stopped by your content blocker extension or other network blocking layers.
- Such blocked requests are reported in the "blocked" section of the popup.

### Stealth
**Stealth** describes network connections that were intercepted or redirected invisibly by content blockers to avoid detection by the web page.

- These connections might appear redirected or otherwise altered behind the scenes.
- uBO Scope categorizes these as "stealth-blocked" in the popup panel.


### Badge Count Explained

The **badge count** on the uBO Scope toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct third-party domains from which connections were allowed.

- A **lower badge count is better**, indicating fewer third-party domains contacted, which typically means less tracking exposure.
- This count is **not a block count**. It does *not* represent how many requests were blocked but rather how many unique external domains were contacted successfully.
- The extension uses browser `webRequest` API to capture request outcomes accurately, irrespective of your blocker configuration.


## How These Concepts Work Together

When you visit a web page, uBO Scope listens to all network requests the page initiates:

- **Allowed connections**: Resources fetched as intended and counted towards the badge.
- **Blocked connections**: Requests prevented from loading and listed in the blocked section.
- **Stealth connections**: Redirected or silently blocked requests that try to evade detection.

This categorization helps you understand not only the volume of third-party interactions but also if some attempts were blocked outright or disguised.

## Real-World Example

Imagine you open "example.com" with uBO Scope active:

- The popup shows:
  - **Not blocked**: `cdn.example.net` (3 requests), `fonts.gstatic.com` (2 requests)
  - **Stealth-blocked**: `tracker.badads.com` (5 requests)
  - **Blocked**: `ads.eviladserver.com` (4 requests)

- The badge count shows "2" because two distinct third-party domains (`cdn.example.net` and `fonts.gstatic.com`) were allowed.

This tells you that while some tracking domains were blocked or stealthily handled, a couple of external legitimate domains were contacted as expected.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Interpret badge count with context:** Don't equate a high block count from your blocker with better privacy. The real measure is the number of unique third-party domains your browser connects to.
- **Use the terminology to guide filter list maintenance:** Understanding allowed, blocked, and stealth outcomes will help filter list maintainers improve blocking precision.
- **Avoid 'ad blocker test' websites:** These often produce unrealistic results and do not reflect genuine network connections.
- **Know the limitations:** Connections initiated outside of the browser's network request API cannot be captured by uBO Scope.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions and Answers">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge show a number even if I have all ads blocked?">
The badge shows the count of distinct third-party domains allowed, not just ads. Many websites rely on multiple legitimate third-party services (such as CDNs or font providers), so the count rarely reaches zero.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What’s the difference between 'stealth' and 'blocked'?">
Blocked requests never reached their destination, while stealth-blocked ones are intercepted or redirected invisibly by blockers, making them undetectable by the originating site.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope detect all network requests?">
No. uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API, which does not cover some network activities such as those from service workers or certain browser internals.
