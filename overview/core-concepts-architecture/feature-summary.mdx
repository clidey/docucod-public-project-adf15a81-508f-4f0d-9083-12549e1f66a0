# Feature Summary

uBO Scope offers a concise yet powerful snapshot of your browser's interactions with third-party networks, providing real-time insights at a glance. This page highlights the key features that enable users to understand, monitor, and analyze network connections per browser tab, exposing third-party domains involved in web requests alongside their status.

---

## Real-Time Reporting of Third-Party Network Connections Per Tab

uBO Scope continuously monitors your active browser tab and reports every distinct third-party network connection it detects. This live reporting allows you to see exactly which domains your current tab is reaching out to during your browsing session.

- **Instant visibility:** Understand third-party network activity immediately as it happens.
- **Per-tab granularity:** Focus on one tab at a time to identify specific network behaviors related to that webpage.

### Example scenario:

While reading a news article, you can open uBO Scope’s popup and instantly see a list of third-party domains contacted, such as advertising or analytics servers, giving you a transparent view of external parties involved.

---

## Badge Count Reflecting Unique Third-Party Domains

The browser toolbar icon displays a badge count representing the number of unique third-party remote servers your active tab has communicated with.

- **Clear privacy indicator:** A lower count signals fewer third-party server connections, often correlating to better privacy.
- **Immediate feedback:** This numeric badge quickly informs you of potential network exposure without needing to open the popup.

<Tip>
Remember, not all third-party connections are harmful—some belong to legitimate services like CDNs. Use the badge count as a quick summary, then explore details for deeper understanding.
</Tip>

## Cross-Compatibility with Any Content Blocker

uBO Scope operates independently of any content blocker or filtering mechanism you have enabled.

- **Universal insight:** It reports network events whether requests are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- **Works alongside DNS-based or extension-based blockers:** As long as the browser exposes network request data, uBO Scope measures it.

This means you gain an unbiased, transparent view of network activity that helps verify what’s truly occurring beyond what traditional content blockers show.

---

## Session-Level Network Outcome Categorization

uBO Scope classifies network connections at the session level into three distinct categories, presenting a clear outcome for each domain connected:

- **Allowed:** Requests that successfully reached remote servers.
- **Blocked:** Requests that were explicitly blocked, such as by a content blocker.
- **Stealth:** Requests that were stealth-blocked, often hidden by blockers to prevent detection.

Within the popup, domains are grouped accordingly, helping you instantly identify which third-parties are actively communicating, which ones are blocked, and which are stealth-blocked.

### Practical benefit:

This categorization aids in evaluating content blocker effectiveness and understanding suspicious network activity.

## How It All Comes Together

When you open uBO Scope's popup for the active tab, you’re presented with:

- The hostname and domain of the current tab.
- A summarized badge count of unique allowed third-party domains shown on the toolbar icon.
- Three categorized sections listing domains by their network outcome: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

Each domain entry includes a count of requests made, providing quantitative insights per third-party.

---

## Tips for Getting the Most

- Open uBO Scope frequently during your browsing session to monitor how third-party connections evolve on dynamic or interactive pages.
- Use the categorized domain lists to pinpoint persistent or unexpected third-parties that may affect privacy or security.
- Combine uBO Scope with your preferred blocker to validate blocking behavior transparently.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Browser restrictions:** Network requests invisible to the browser’s `webRequest` API cannot be reported.
- **Badge count nuances:** The badge only counts unique third-party domains and does not imply the total number of requests.
- **Interpreting stealth:** Stealth-blocked requests mean they were hidden by blockers and can be subtle; understanding this helps avoid misjudging blocking effectiveness.
