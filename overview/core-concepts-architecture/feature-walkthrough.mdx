# Quick Feature Overview

Welcome to the Quick Feature Overview of uBO Scope, your essential guide to understanding its core user-facing capabilities. This page offers a clear, high-level walkthrough of the extension’s main features — the real-time tab summary, domain categorization, and the informative badge — empowering you to build a strong mental model of how uBO Scope supports your privacy and transparency needs.

## Instant Tab Summary

At the heart of uBO Scope's user experience lies the real-time tab summary displayed when you click the extension's toolbar icon. This summary reveals exactly which third-party domains your currently active browser tab is connecting to, helping you quickly gauge the network footprint of any webpage.

- **What it shows:** The summary breaks down connected domains by their network status:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which resource requests succeeded.
  - **Stealth Blocked:** Connections that were redirected or suppressed invisibly by stealth blocking mechanisms.
  - **Blocked:** Requests that failed due to blocking.

- **How it helps you:** Instead of guessing or relying on generic block counts, you see a precise, categorized list of domains involved in your browsing session. 

- **Example:** Imagine visiting a news website. With uBO Scope, a quick glance at the popup informs you if multiple advertising or tracking servers are contacted or blocked, providing immediate insight into data flows you might want to control or block.

## Domain Categorization

Understanding connection outcomes is vital, which is why uBO Scope classifies each remote server domain into three clear categories:

- **Allowed (not blocked):** Domains where connections succeeded, indicating resources were fetched.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where connections were intercepted or redirected stealthily — they don't always show as blocked explicitly but are controlled.
- **Blocked:** Domains that the extension or other content blockers have prevented from loading.

This categorization directly ties into user decision-making, helping you discern the effectiveness of blockers and transparently monitor all network activity the browser is aware of.

### Why Categorization Matters

Many users rely on toolbar badges counting blocked requests, but these can be misleading. uBO Scope’s categorization exposes the *actual* number of distinct remote third-party servers allowed or blocked on the tab, cutting through the noise caused by raw request counts.

## Informative Badge

The toolbar icon of uBO Scope does more than signal activity — it actively communicates the number of distinct allowed third-party domains contacted by the active tab.

- **Badge count meaning:** It displays the count of unique third-party remote servers from which resources were successfully fetched.
- **User benefit:** A lower badge count signifies fewer third-party connections, often indicating tighter privacy.
- **Contrast with other blockers:** This count reflects *distinct hosts* contacted rather than a simple count of blocked requests, providing a more meaningful metric.

### Practical Scenario

After navigating to an unfamiliar site, you notice the badge number is high. Opening the popup reveals many allowed third-party domains, signaling extensive network interactions. Conversely, a low badge count might reassure you that third-party tracking is minimal.

## How These Features Work Together

uBO Scope’s real-time tab summary, domain categorization, and badge count create a cohesive user flow:

1. **Load a webpage.** The extension monitors all remote network requests using the browser’s `webRequest` API.
2. **Record each connection's outcome** — success, stealth block, or full block — and attribute them to their respective domains.
3. **Update the tab’s data model** to maintain an accurate map of all connected domains.
4. **Display the badge count** representing distinct allowed third-party domains.
5. **Provide a detailed popup summary** upon user interaction, categorizing domains intuitively.

This fluid experience ensures you immediately grasp how a webpage interacts with networks around the globe without digging into technical logs.

## Best Practices

- **Check the badge often:** It gives you a quick privacy health indicator per tab.
- **Use the popup for deeper insight:** The categorized lists explain the badge count and reveal stealth blocking you might otherwise miss.
- **Combine with other blockers wisely:** uBO Scope complements existing content blockers by focusing on connection visibility rather than blocking itself.

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common User Questions">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge sometimes show zero even when I see trackers?">
The badge counts distinct *allowed* third-party domains. If a content blocker stealth-blocks connections (making them invisible to the webpage), they appear under 'stealth blocked' in the popup but do not increase the badge count.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if the popup shows no data?">
This usually means the active tab has not yet initiated or completed network requests detectable by uBO Scope, or permissions are not properly set. Try refreshing the tab or checking extension permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I rely on the badge count to measure all network activity?">
uBO Scope depends on the browser's `webRequest` API; some special requests or protocols outside this API's scope might not be monitored. However, for HTTP(S) and WebSocket requests covered by permissions, the badge provides reliable distinct domain counts.
