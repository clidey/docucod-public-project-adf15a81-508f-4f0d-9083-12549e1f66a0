# Quick Feature Tour

Discover the core user interface elements of uBO Scope in a glance. This page provides an in-depth walkthrough of the extension's popup window, where per-tab connection statistics, domain categorizations, and toolbar badge feedback converge to give you immediate insights about your browsing network activity.

---

## Overview of the Popup Interface

The popup window is the heart of uBO Scope's user experience. Designed for clarity and utility, it consolidates critical network connection data into a single, accessible panel.

### Key Elements You'll See:

- **Tab Hostname Header**
  - Displays the current active tab’s hostname with the wider domain highlighted separately.
  - Helps quickly identify which website's network activity you are reviewing.

- **Summary Section**
  - Shows the total number of distinct domains connected to by the active tab.
  - Provides a concise snapshot of the tab’s overall external server interactions.

- **Connection Outcomes Sections**
  uBO Scope categorizes remote connections into three distinct outcomes directly in the popup:

  1. **Not Blocked (Allowed)**
     - Lists domains to which connections were successfully made without being blocked.
     - Shows the count of connection attempts per domain.

  2. **Stealth-Blocked**
     - Displays domains where connections were stealthily blocked (redirected).
     - Useful for understanding hidden or background blocking actions happening under the hood.

  3. **Blocked**
     - Summarizes domains for which connection attempts failed or were outright blocked.
     - Helps identify problematic or restricted third-party domains.

Each of these sections presents the domains in order, with badges reflecting the number of requests per domain.

### Toolbar Badge

Independently from the popup content, the extension's icon on the browser toolbar shows a badge indicating the number of distinct allowed third-party domains connected by the current tab. This gives you real-time feedback without opening the popup.

## Using the Quick Feature Tour for Instant Insight

### Why Use This Page?

Imagine opening a web page and instantly knowing all external servers your browser interacted with — safe, suspicious, or blocked — without going through complex developer tools. This page guides you on interpreting the popup window to harness such insights efficiently.

### User Flow Example

1. **Open uBO Scope popup:** Click the extension icon to reveal connection data for the current tab.
2. **Identify the domain in use:** Read the hostname at the top, distinguishing the specific host and its domain.
3. **Review the summary of connected domains:** Check how many unique domains the page communicates with.
4. **Interpret the allowed connections:** See which domains are transparently accessed without blocking.
5. **Examine stealth-blocked domains:** Understand if any connections were redirected away stealthily.
6. **Check blocked domains:** Detect domains that your browser refused to reach, indicating content blocker action.

### Practical Tips

- Pay attention to the badge on the toolbar icon — fewer allowed distinct domains usually indicate stronger privacy.
- Use the ordering within each section to spot the most contacted domains.
- Review the stealth-blocked section for subtle privacy protections.
- If surprised by a domain in allowed or blocked, consider investigating it further to assess privacy implications.

---

## Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

- **Do not confuse high block counts with better content blocking.** The badge indicates allowed distinct domains, which is more critical.
- **Regularly check this popup per tab,** especially on privacy-sensitive sites, to ensure no unusual third-party connections.
- **Keep the popup open briefly after page load** to let uBO Scope finish recording network events completely.

<Warning>
The extension reports based on the webRequest API visible network events only; some network activity outside browser scope might not appear.
</Warning>

## Example: Understanding the Popup Contents

```plaintext
Tab Hostname: subdomain.example.com
Summary: domains connected: 5

Not Blocked:
- example.com (15 requests)
- cdn.examplecdn.net (7 requests)

Stealth-Blocked:
- tracker.spyads.com (3 requests)

Blocked:
- ads.suspiciousad.net (4 requests)
```

This output tells you your current page connected successfully to example.com and a CDN,
some requests to spyads.com were stealthily redirected (likely privacy-protecting),
and some ads were outright blocked.

If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or incomplete information:

- Refresh the tab to trigger new network activity.
- Wait a few seconds for background processing of network events.
- Verify that the extension has permissions and is enabled.
