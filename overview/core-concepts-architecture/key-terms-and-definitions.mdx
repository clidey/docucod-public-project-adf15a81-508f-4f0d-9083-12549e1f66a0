# Key Terms and Definitions

Understanding the terminology used throughout uBO Scope is essential for interpreting its reports and navigating the user interface effectively. This guide provides clear definitions of crucial terms such as third-party remote server, allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked, badge count, public suffix, and session data. Having a shared language empowers you to make sense of the connection data uBO Scope provides and helps you confidently evaluate your browsing security and privacy.

## Third-Party Remote Server

A **third-party remote server** is any external server contacted by a webpage you visit that is not under the primary domain of the site. For example, if you visit `example.com` and resources load from `cdn.example.com`, `ads.tracker.net`, or `analytics.thirdparty.org`, those latter servers are considered "third-party".

uBO Scope tracks all distinct third-party remote servers that your browser attempts to reach while loading webpages. This categorization helps isolate external connections that may have privacy or security implications.


## Allowed

**Allowed** refers to network requests made by a webpage that the browser successfully completes without being blocked or interrupted. These are connections where resources have been fetched successfully from the remote servers.

In uBO Scope, allowed requests are clearly listed to show which third-party domains have been accessed during your browsing session. An allowed connection indicates the content or resource was fetched and loaded.


## Stealth-Blocked

**Stealth-blocked** describes network requests that have been deliberately blocked by content blockers or other mechanisms but in a way that is hidden or transparent to the webpage. This means the request never reaches the remote server, yet the page doesn’t detect or show any sign that the resource was blocked.

Stealth-blocking is crucial for maintaining webpage functionality without revealing blocking activity to trackers or malicious scripts. uBO Scope identifies stealth-blocked connections to provide you with visibility into these concealed network request denials.


## Blocked

**Blocked** highlights network requests that were prevented from reaching their target remote servers by content blockers or security policies. Unlike stealth-blocked, these blocked requests may be detectable by the webpage or cause loading failures.

uBO Scope logs and presents blocked connections so you can understand which external contacts did not complete due to blocking rules.


## Badge Count

The **badge count** is the numeric indicator shown on uBO Scope's toolbar icon. It represents the number of distinct third-party remote domains that successfully connected (allowed) for the current browser tab.

A lower badge count generally indicates fewer external connections and potentially improved privacy. It helps you quickly assess the degree of third-party network activity at a glance.


## Public Suffix

A **public suffix** is the highest-level domain under which domains can be registered. This includes domains like `.com`, `.co.uk`, `.org`, and newer generic top-level domains (gTLDs).

uBO Scope uses the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to accurately parse and group domains and hostnames. For instance, it distinguishes between `example.com` as a registered domain and `.com` as the public suffix. This helps uBO Scope consolidate domains efficiently when reporting.


## Session Data

**Session data** refers to the temporary data uBO Scope stores during a browser session to remember network request details on a per-tab basis. This includes records of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked servers for each open tab.

This data enables uBO Scope to present detailed reports and badge counts per tab. Session data is refreshed and saved as you navigate and open or close tabs, ensuring that you get up-to-date and accurate connection visibility.

## Summary Table of Key Terms

| Term               | Definition                                                                                   | User Relevance                                                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Third-Party Remote Server | Any external server contacted that is not part of the primary domain you are visiting.               | Identifies which external servers your browser communicates with.       |
| Allowed            | Requests successfully completed without being blocked.                                     | Shows active third-party contacts that loaded resources.               |
| Stealth-Blocked    | Requests blocked transparently, without detection by the webpage.                          | Indicates invisible blocking enhancing privacy without webpage errors. |
| Blocked            | Requests explicitly blocked, potentially detectable by the webpage.                        | Reveals network contacts denied due to blocking policies.              |
| Badge Count        | Number on toolbar icon showing distinct allowed third-party domains per tab.               | Quick visual gauge of third-party network activity.                     |
| Public Suffix      | High-level domain under which domain names are registered (e.g., `.com`, `.co.uk`).        | Helps organize and aggregate domain data accurately.                    |
| Session Data       | Temporary per-tab stored network request data including allowed and blocked outcomes.       | Powers accurate display of connection counts and domain reports.        |

## Practical Example: Understanding a Popup Panel Report

When you open uBO Scope’s popup panel for the current tab, you see domains grouped in three outcome categories: **not blocked (allowed)**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

- Domains in **not blocked** are third-party servers actually contacted and allowed.
- **Stealth-blocked** domains represent connections blocked silently to avoid detection.
- **Blocked** domains are openly denied connections by your content blockers.

The badge count on the toolbar icon matches the number of unique domains listed under **not blocked**. This number is your quick indicator of how many distinct external connections succeeded.

Knowing these terms allows you to interpret whether your content blockers are preventing unwanted connections behind the scenes, or if some third parties still connect.

## Tips for Effective Use

- **Interpreting Badge Count:** Use the badge count as a quick reference for your current browsing tab’s third-party exposure. Fewer allowed third-party connections typically mean tighter privacy.

- **Identifying Stealth Blocking:** Seeing many stealth-blocked domains is a good sign that your blockers are working subtly, preventing trackers without breaking websites.

- **Evaluating Blocked Domains:** If many domains appear in the blocked category and you experience site breakage, consider adjusting your filter lists.

- **Remember Public Suffix Role:** Understanding how public suffixes group domains helps clarify why some domains may appear aggregated under a common suffix.
