# Terminology & Core Concepts

Understanding the terms used within uBO Scope is essential to accurately interpret the extension’s reports. This page clarifies the key vocabulary such as 'third-party remote server,' 'allowed,' 'stealth-blocked,' 'blocked,' and 'badge count.' Equipped with these definitions, you will confidently analyze network connection data presented by the extension.

## Key Terms Defined

### Third-Party Remote Server
A *third-party remote server* refers to any server contacted by a webpage you are visiting that does **not** share the same base domain as the page itself. These servers often provide external content or services, such as advertisements, analytics, or content delivery networks (CDNs).

**Example:** If you visit `example.com` and your browser connects to `cdn.somecdn.com`, this is a connection to a third-party remote server.

### Allowed
**Allowed** connections are network requests to third-party remote servers that were permitted to complete successfully by the browser and any active content blocker.

- These connections fetched resources or data without intervention.
- They are listed in the "not blocked" section of uBO Scope’s popup UI.

**Value:** Identifying allowed connections helps you understand which external servers your browsing session genuinely communicates with.

### Stealth-Blocked
**Stealth-blocked** connections refer to third-party requests that were blocked by stealthy content blocking mechanisms, such as redirects or silent blocking, that prevent the request without outright error reporting.

- These connections do not complete and are hidden or suppressed to prevent detection by webpages.
- They appear in the "stealth-blocked" section.

**Why it matters:** Stealth blocking minimizes webpage disruptions or breakage while maintaining privacy.

### Blocked
**Blocked** connections are third-party requests that failed due to explicit blocking by the content blocker or network errors.

- These show as failed attempts that the browser or blocking rules actively stopped.
- Displayed in the "blocked" list, they signify recognized and prevented external connections.

### Badge Count
The **badge count** is the number displayed on the extension’s toolbar icon. It shows:

- **The number of distinct third-party remote domains connected to in the current tab.**
- A *lower count* is desirable, indicating fewer external connections and potentially less tracking or exposure.

**Important:** The badge count is always relative to successful or allowed connections and does not reflect the number of blocked requests.

## How uBO Scope Uses These Terms

When you open the popup interface for an active browser tab, uBO Scope fetches and presents network connection details classified into the three outcomes:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** These are active third-party connections that completed successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** These are silently blocked requests, often by stealth techniques integrated into content blockers.
- **Blocked:** These connections were stopped due to errors or explicit blocking.

Each category lists the connected domain names along with the count of requests made.

### Sample User Scenario
Imagine you visit a news website. The popup shows:

- _Not blocked:_ Domains serving essential content and trusted CDNs.
- _Stealth-blocked:_ Domains possibly associated with tracking scripts silently blocked to prevent site errors.
- _Blocked:_ Domains known for ads or trackers explicitly blocked.

The badge count reflects only the unique and allowed third-party domains.

## Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- **Interpret badge count cautiously:** It tracks unique allowed remote servers, not total requests or blocked domains.
- **Legitimate connections exist:** Not all third-party connections are harmful; CDNs or third-party APIs are often necessary.
- **Stealth blocking indicates subtle protections:** Absence from allowed and blocked does not mean invisibility; stealth-blocked requests are silently handled.
- **Domains are normalized:** Using the [public suffix list](https://publicsuffix.org/), domains are accurately identified by their base domain for clarity.

## How This Fits Into Your Workflow

This terminology page provides the terminology foundation that aligns with the:

- [Navigating the uBO Scope Interface](./navigating-ubo-scope-ui) page showing how these terms relate to UI elements.
- [Understanding and Interpreting the Badge Count](../using-ubo-scope/interpreting-badge) which explains further nuances about the badge count.

Mastering this vocabulary enables you to comprehend every network event the extension observes and classifies.
