# Terminology & Core Concepts

Understanding the key terms and foundational concepts of uBO Scope is essential for effectively using the extension and interpreting its data. This page defines critical domain-specific vocabulary and explains the core categories that uBO Scope uses to classify network requests.

---

## Key Terms Defined

### Third-Party Server
A **third-party server** refers to any remote server domain different from the main domain of the webpage you are visiting. For example, if you are on `example.com` and your browser makes a connection to `cdn.example.net`, that `cdn.example.net` is a third-party server relative to `example.com`.

This is crucial because uBO Scope counts and reports connections to these third-party domains to reveal the extent of external network requests initiated by webpages.

### webRequest API
The **webRequest API** is an interface provided by modern browsers that allows extensions like uBO Scope to observe and intercept network activity initiated by webpages. Through this API, uBO Scope monitors all remote connections attempted by the page, regardless of any content blocker's effect.

This transparency is vital because other content blockers might conceal certain network activities or outcomes, but uBO Scope sees all network requests reported by this API.

### Hostname and Domain
- **Hostname**: The full host part of a URL (e.g., `sub.example.com`).
- **Domain**: The registered domain, generally the higher-level host name (e.g., `example.com`).

uBO Scope aggregates data primarily by domains to provide a concise view of third-party connections, helping you understand which main external entities your browser communicates with.

The extension uses the Public Suffix List (PSL) to accurately extract these domains even from complex hostnames, ensuring precise classification.

## Network Request Outcomes: What Do They Mean?

uBO Scope classifies network requests based on their final outcome into three clear categories, displayed in the popup UI and reflected in data summaries:

### Allowed
- **Definition**: Network requests that successfully fetched resources from third-party servers.
- **Meaning**: These are requests that were not blocked by content blockers and completed without error.
- **User Value**: Shows you which external domains your browser actually loaded content from during page visits.

### Blocked
- **Definition**: Requests prevented from completing, often by content blockers or browser policies.
- **Meaning**: These represent connections that did not reach the server or failed due to an error.
- **User Value**: Helps you identify which blocked requests would have otherwise contributed to resource loading.

### Stealth-Blocked
- **Definition**: Requests that were redirected or suppressed stealthily — the browser handles them in a way that hides their blocking from the webpage.
- **Meaning**: This category exposes subtle blocking tactics used by extensions to block requests without revealing their presence to web pages.
- **User Value**: Reveals hidden blocking that content blockers perform, helping advanced users understand stealth filtering.

## Why Understanding These Concepts Matters

At the core, uBO Scope is designed to enhance your visibility into third-party network connections that webpages make, regardless of blocking measures or obfuscation. Knowing the definitions above empowers you to interpret all data seen in the extension interface confidently.

For instance, a site might silently attempt dozens of connections to various third-party domains, but your content blocker might only block or report some. uBO Scope shines light on that entire landscape, clarifying privacy and security implications.

---

## Practical Examples

- **Scenario 1:** Visiting your favorite news site, you notice the `allowed` domain count is relatively low, but the `stealth-blocked` domains are numerous.
  - This indicates that while few third-party domains actually loaded content, many were blocked subtly without alerting the site.

- **Scenario 2:** A shopping website connects to multiple domains labeled `blocked`.
  - This may point to content blockers preventing ads or trackers, and you can see exactly which domains were stopped.

- **Scenario 3:** Some domains appear in both `allowed` and `stealth-blocked` categories.
  - This reflects mixed outcomes for different requests to the same third-party domains, offering granular transparency.

---

## Best Practices for Users

- Always consider **domains** over individual hostnames for a higher-level understanding of third-party connections.
- Use the **webRequest API** definitions to appreciate that uBO Scope reports all requests your browser observes, catching more than just what your content blocker reports.
- Interpret `stealth-blocked` as a sign of advanced blocking behavior that's aimed at invisibility to web pages — an important privacy insight.
- Remember that **allowed** requests are the actual third-parties your browser relied on, which may affect privacy and page behavior.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Confusing **hostname** with **domain** can cause misunderstanding of the scope of unique third-parties. Always check the domain for counting third-party servers.
- Misinterpreting `blocked` vs. `stealth-blocked` can lead to incorrect assumptions about whether blocking is visible or hidden from the webpage.
- Expecting uBO Scope to report network requests made outside the browser's webRequest API (such as internal browser processes) will lead to confusion since those are not captured.

## Quick Reference: Outcome Categories and Their Meaning

| Outcome        | What It Means                                    | User Impact                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Allowed        | Request succeeded, resource loaded               | Indicates third-party servers in use |
| Blocked        | Request prevented or errored                      | Shows explicit blocking            |
| Stealth-Blocked| Request handled so webpage cannot detect blocking| Reveals hidden blocking behavior   |
