# Integration with Browsers & Other Tools

uBO Scope is designed for seamless operation across the major browsers—Chromium-based, Firefox, and Safari—leveraging manifest-based packaging to ensure compatibility and independent functionality. This page details how uBO Scope integrates within these browser ecosystems, highlighting its unique position as an autonomous tool that works alongside or independently from other content blockers and privacy solutions.

---

## Why Browser Integration Matters

Understanding how uBO Scope integrates with various browsers gives you clarity on its reliability and flexibility. Whether you're on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Apple Safari, uBO Scope is tailored to tap into each browser's `webRequest` capabilities to deliver consistent insights.

This cross-browser support means you can use uBO Scope without worrying about compatibility hiccups or losing critical data on your network connections.

---

## Manifest-Based Packaging for Cross-Browser Compatibility

Each browser requires specific manifest configurations to register extensions properly. uBO Scope employs manifest version 3, utilizing:

- **Background Scripts or Service Workers** to manage network request events.
- **Host Permissions** for full visibility on HTTP and HTTPS network traffic.
- **Action Elements** such as toolbar icons and popups for user interaction.

### Browser-Specific Manifest Highlights

| Browser  | Key Manifest Features                                   | Notes                              |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Chromium | Uses a service worker background script (`background.service_worker`) for efficient event handling. Supports WebSocket permissions. | Minimum Chrome version 122.0 required.
| Firefox  | Uses background scripts (`background.scripts`) as a module to monitor requests, also supports WebSocket URLs in permissions. | Requires browser version 128.0+ for manifest 3 strict support.
| Safari   | Declares background scripts as modules; utilizes strict minimum version 18.5. WebSocket permissions are limited compared to others. | Safari extensions have stricter versioning and API constraints.

This manifest-based tailoring ensures uBO Scope exploits the best possible capabilities each browser has to offer while maintaining a consistent user experience.

## Independence and Coexistence with Other Privacy Tools

uBO Scope operates fully independently of content blockers such as uBlock Origin itself or other ad blocking extensions. It does not interfere with them nor does it rely on them. This independence provides several advantages:

- **Unbiased Visibility:** It reports network requests regardless of which content blocker is in use.
- **Reliable Measurement:** If a content blocker silently blocks connections, uBO Scope can still report the outcome based on browser-level `webRequest` events.
- **Complementary Operation:** Use uBO Scope alongside existing privacy tools to gain deeper insight into which remote servers your browser interacts with.

### How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Privacy Toolkit

- If you use content blockers, uBO Scope acts as a verification tool, showing the actual third-party connections attempted or blocked.
- If you prefer DNS-level or system-wide blockers, uBO Scope still provides network request outcomes as browsers report them.
- It is especially helpful for filter list maintainers and privacy researchers who need transparent, unfiltered evidence of network interactions.

## Practical Examples of Integration

### Scenario 1: Using uBO Scope with uBlock Origin

You run uBlock Origin to block ads and trackers but want to know exactly which third-party domains your browser attempts to contact.

- uBO Scope monitors network requests independently.
- Even if uBlock Origin stealthily blocks a request, uBO Scope categorizes the outcome as "stealth-blocked" if the browser reports the network event.
- The toolbar badge updates to reflect unique domains involved in your current tab, giving you granular insight.

### Scenario 2: Running uBO Scope on a Clean Browser

Without any content blockers installed, uBO Scope still tracks all network requests made by web pages.

- You can see the full landscape of third-party connections, helping you understand a website's behavior.
- The detailed popup interface categorizes allowed, blocked (if any), and stealth-blocked domains, assisting in privacy assessments.

### Scenario 3: Multi-Browser Setup

You use different browsers for various tasks (e.g., Chrome for general browsing, Firefox for privacy-critical work, Safari on macOS).

- uBO Scope’s manifests are configured to register and function properly on all.
- Your experience and data remain consistent regardless of the browser, enabling uniform analysis.

## Under the Hood: How Integration Enables Functionality

While internal implementation details are outside the direct user scope, it is helpful to grasp the integration flow:

- uBO Scope listens to browser network events via `webRequest` APIs.
- These events cover redirects, successful responses, and errors tied to web requests from tabs.
- Results per tab are stored and updated using in-browser session storage.
- The popup interface queries the background logic for live data display.

This design leverages manifest-based APIs native to each browser for efficient performance and asynchronous UI updates.

---

## Tips for Optimal Integration

- Ensure your browser version meets or exceeds the minimum required versions for your platform:
  - Chromium: 122.0+
  - Firefox: 128.0+
  - Safari: 18.5+

- uBO Scope requests standard permissions (`activeTab`, `storage`, `webRequest`) so accept these to enable full functionality.

- Remember that uBO Scope monitors requests reported by the browser; certain browser or OS-level blocks outside this scope may not be visible.

- Keep uBO Scope updated to benefit from any fixes or manifest compatibility improvements.

## Troubleshooting Integration Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Integration Concerns">  
<Accordion title="Why is uBO Scope not showing network data?">  
Verify that you have granted the requested permissions during installation or first launch. Ensure your browser supports required manifest v3 features and that the extension is active in the current tab.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Why doesn't the badge counter update correctly?">  
Network requests might be cached or belong to frames not fully reported to uBO Scope. Reloading the page or waiting a short moment usually triggers badge updates. Conflicts with other extensions are rare but possible.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Is uBO Scope affected by other content blockers?">  
No. uBO Scope operates independently and reports events from the browser's `webRequest` interface. Conflicts may only arise if browsers block extension permissions broadly.
</Accordion>
