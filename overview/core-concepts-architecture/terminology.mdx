# Fundamental Terms & Concepts

Understanding the key terminology behind uBO Scope is crucial to fully grasp how this extension reports and categorizes network connections made by your browser. This page clarifies essential terms such as allowed, blocked, and stealth domains, what constitutes a third-party remote server, the role of the webRequest API, and the significance of the badge count. Armed with these definitions, users will better interpret uBO Scope's reports and make informed privacy decisions.

## Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Domains

uBO Scope categorizes third-party domains encountered during your browsing sessions into three primary types, each representing distinct network connection outcomes:

- **Allowed Domains**: These domains are those from which your browser successfully fetched resources or established connections. An allowed domain means the network request to the remote server was completed without being blocked by any content blocker or network intervention.

- **Blocked Domains**: Blocked domains correspond to network requests that failed due to explicit blocking by your content blocker or network-level restrictions. These requests never completed, indicating that resources from these domains were prevented from loading.

- **Stealth-Blocked Domains**: This category is unique and refers to connections that were redirected or intercepted in a way designed to be stealthy. Stealth blocking typically means requests were prevented without obvious notification or signs to the webpage, helping to avoid detection or breakage. It indicates a subtle intervention of network requests.

Understanding these outcomes empowers you to see not just if connections are blocked, but how they are treated differently, revealing the true nature of third-party resource loading.

## What is a Third-Party Remote Server?

A **third-party remote server** in uBO Scope's context is any external domain contacted by your browser that is different from the origin domain of the website you are visiting. For example, if you are on `example.com` and your browser connects to `analytics-tracker.net` or `cdn-images.com`, these are third-party remote servers.

These third parties typically host ads, tracking scripts, content delivery networks, or other external services. uBO Scope tracks them to provide transparency about which and how many distinct third-party domains your browser interacts with during browsing.

## The webRequest API

The **webRequest API** is a foundational browser interface used by uBO Scope to observe, analyze, and report network requests made by webpages:

- It allows the extension to listen to network requests before they are sent, when redirects occur, upon response start, or on error.
- uBO Scope uses this API to classify requests as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked based on real-time network activities and browser-level event callbacks.

This API guarantees that uBO Scope can deliver accurate, reliable data about connections your browser attempts or completes, regardless of any content blocking or DNS-level protections in place.

## Badge Count Explained

The number displayed on uBO Scope's toolbar badge is a direct indicator of third-party exposure during a browsing session:

- It shows **the number of distinct third-party domains from which network connections were successfully allowed**.
- Importantly, it does **not** count blocked or stealth-blocked domains.
- A **lower badge count** indicates fewer third-party remote servers connected, generally correlating with better privacy and fewer external data exposures.

This distinct focus on allowed domains makes the badge a meaningful, non-misleading metric of network reach and third-party contact, unlike simplistic block count badges.

## How These Building Blocks Shape Your Understanding

The combined understanding of these terms helps you interpret uBO Scope’s popup panel and reports:

- When you see domains listed under **allowed**, you know these remote servers successfully connected during your browsing.
- **Blocked** and **stealth-blocked** lists convey which domains were prevented, explicitly or subtly.
- The badge count gives you a quick snapshot of how many unique third-party domains your browser truly reached, distinguishing mere blocking activity from real network exposure.

Together, uBO Scope paints a comprehensive, transparent picture of your browser's network activity toward third-party servers.

## Practical Usage Tips

- Always consider the badge count as your primary privacy indicator, not the number of blocked requests.
- Remember, not all third-party connections are harmful; some are necessary like CDNs or essential services.
- Use the classifications to decide if you want to enhance your blocker settings or investigate suspicious domains.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions About Terms">  
<Accordion title="Why aren’t blocked domains included in the badge count?">  
The badge counts only allowed third-party domains because it reflects actual connections made. Block counts can be misleading since a high block count might coexist with more allowed domains due to different filtering rules.  
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="What does stealth-blocked mean in practice?">  
Stealth blocking refers to network requests blocked in a way designed to be undetectable by the web page, improving user privacy while preventing site breakage or detection of blocking.  
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="How does uBO Scope identify third-party domains accurately?">  
uBO Scope uses the browser’s webRequest API to track requests and the public suffix list to correctly determine domain boundaries and third-party status.  
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Can all network requests be seen by uBO Scope?">  
No. Requests made outside the browser’s webRequest API scope, such as those by some plugins or external applications, are not visible to uBO Scope.  
</Accordion>
