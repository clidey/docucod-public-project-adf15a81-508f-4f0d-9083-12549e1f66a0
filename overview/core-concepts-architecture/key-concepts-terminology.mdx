# Key Concepts and Terms

Understanding the language that uBO Scope uses is essential to accurately interpret what the extension reports and how to navigate its user interface. This page defines the core terminology and concepts regarding third-party remote servers, badge counts, network request outcomes, and the underlying webRequest API behavior. These definitions help users form a clear mental model for analyzing and debugging network activity within uBO Scope.

---

## Third-Party Remote Servers

Third-party remote servers are external domains contacted by the web pages you visit, which are not part of the first-party site’s own domain. These include analytics services, CDNs, ad networks, trackers, and others.

- **Third-Party Domain**: A domain distinct from the main website you are visiting.
- uBO Scope highlights connections made to these third-parties to give you visibility into which external servers your browser talks to.

**Why it matters:** Exposure to numerous third-party domains may indicate tracking, advertising, or potential privacy risks. However, not all third parties are harmful; many serve legitimate purposes such as content delivery.

---

## Badge Count (Toolbar Icon Number)

The badge count shown on the extension’s toolbar icon represents the **number of distinct third-party remote domains that had a connection attempt within the active browser tab**. It is an exact reflection of unique third-party connections observed, not a count of blocked or allowed requests.

- A **lower count** is generally preferable as it means fewer external connections.
- The badge count is **independent of which content blocker is active**, reflecting actual network connection attempts, regardless of outcome.

**Important:**

- The badge count is a measure of unique third-parties contacted, not total network requests.
- Do not confuse badge count with the number of blocked requests; a high block count doesn’t necessarily mean fewer third-party connections.

## Network Request Outcomes

uBO Scope categorizes network requests based on their final status as observed through the browser’s `webRequest` API:

1. **Allowed (Not Blocked)**
   - Requests that successfully contacted their third-party remote servers.
   - Shown under the “not blocked” section in the popup UI.

2. **Blocked**
   - Requests the browser or content blockers prevented from reaching their destination.
   - These appear in the “blocked” section.

3. **Stealth-Blocked**
   - A subtle category representing requests that were redirected or invisibly blocked as part of stealth techniques by the content blockers.
   - These do not appear as outright blocked but are intercepted to avoid detection or reduce breakage.
   - Displayed in the “stealth-blocked” section.

Each outcome reflects different ways content blockers or the network environment can influence resource loading.

## The `webRequest` API

uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor and report network request activities:

- It listens to three key events:
  - `onBeforeRedirect`: a request being redirected.
  - `onErrorOccurred`: a request failing (blocked or errored).
  - `onResponseStarted`: a response beginning (successful).

- Through these, uBO Scope aggregates the final state of each request, mapping hostnames and domains accordingly.

**Limitations:**

- Requests **outside the scope of the `webRequest` API are not visible** to uBO Scope.
- Certain modern network features or browser changes may affect visibility.

**How this supports uBO Scope:** The API provides real-time, precise insights into the network requests your browser handles, enabling reliable distinctions between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked outcomes.

## Hostname vs. Domain

uBO Scope differentiates between hostnames and domains, employing the public suffix list for accurate parsing:

- **Hostname:** The complete host portion of a URL (e.g., `sub.example.com`).
- **Domain:** The registered base domain name (e.g., `example.com`), considered the main entity.

By grouping requests at the domain level for badge counts and summaries, uBO Scope provides a meaningful overview of distinct third-party entities.

---

## Summary of Concepts in the UI

The uBO Scope popup panel organizes information into three key sections that reflect these concepts:

- **Not Blocked:** Third-party domains successfully connected.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains associated with stealthy content blocking or redirects.
- **Blocked:** Domains where network requests were explicitly blocked or failed.

The summary shows the number of distinct domains contacted, giving users an immediate measure of exposure.

---

## Practical Example

When you load a webpage, uBO Scope monitors all network connections:

- A CDN serving images from `cdn.example.net` counts as one third-party connection under “not blocked” if successful.
- A tracking domain redirected covertly by your content blocker appears under “stealth-blocked.”
- A known ad server request blocked by the content blocker appears under “blocked.”

The badge count on the toolbar reflects the total unique third-party domains contacted (including allowed and stealth), making it easier to assess your exposure at a glance.

---

## Tips for Effective Use

<Info>
- Use the badge count to monitor third-party exposure per tab.
- Reference the categorized lists in the popup to identify which specific domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- Remember that stealth-blocking helps avoid site breakage, so not all blocked content is visible.
</Info>

<Warning>
- Avoid basing content blocker comparisons solely on block counts; rely on unique third-party connections for reliability.
- Be aware that some connections may occur beyond the `webRequest` API’s visibility.
</Warning>
