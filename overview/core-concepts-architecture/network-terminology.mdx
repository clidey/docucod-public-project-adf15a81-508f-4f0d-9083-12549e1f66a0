# Key Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the core terminology used in uBO Scope is essential to interpreting the extension’s reports accurately and confidently. This page defines crucial terms you will encounter in the UI and explains the significance of connection statuses throughout your browsing experience.

## What You Will Learn
- What are 'third-party remote servers' and why they matter
- Definitions of connection outcomes: 'allowed', 'blocked', and 'stealth'
- Explanation of how connection status is reported and what it implies

## Third-Party Remote Servers

**Third-party remote servers** are domains that websites connect to, which are not part of the primary site you are visiting. For example, if you visit `example.com` and your browser downloads resources from `cdn.example.net` or `analytics.tracker.org`, those belong to third parties.

### Why It Matters:
These external servers can track your activity, load ads, or deliver content. Understanding these connections helps evaluate your privacy exposure. uBO Scope counts and categorizes these connections so you can see exactly which third parties your browser is communicating with.

---

## Key Terms Defined

### Allowed
- **Allowed** connections are third-party remote servers that your browser successfully connected to without being blocked.
- These connections represent network requests that passed through any content blocker or any other filter.
- The **allowed** list indicates active third parties that fetched resources or data during your browsing.

### Blocked
- **Blocked** connections are network requests to third-party servers that were actively prevented from completing by some mechanism, typically your content blocker.
- A blocked request means the server was contacted but the request was denied or interrupted at some stage.
- This does not mean the connection was completely invisible; uBO Scope is able to detect and report these failed attempts.

### Stealth (Stealth-Blocked)
- **Stealth** connections represent requests that were blocked in a manner that aims to be undetectable by webpages.
- This is often done by some advanced content blockers to avoid breaking websites or to hide their blocking activity.
- In uBO Scope, stealth-blocked domains are logged separately, clarifying that these requests never reached the server in a visible way to the webpage.

## Connection Status Overview

uBO Scope uses browser network APIs to classify connection attempts based on the outcome:

| Status    | Meaning                                                                 | User Impact                                                    |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Allowed   | The browser successfully connected to the third-party server.           | Content was loaded or communication established.                |
| Blocked   | The request was actively canceled or interrupted by a content blocker.  | The resource or communication was prevented.                    |
| Stealth   | Blocking done invisibly to the webpage to avoid detection or breakage.  | No visible request made; considered a stealth block.            |

### What uBO Scope Reports

- The extension categorizes third-party domains encountered by each tab into these three groups.
- The toolbar icon badge reflects the number of *distinct* allowed third-party servers connected successfully, giving an immediate gauge of third-party exposure.
- The popup UI lists these domains, displaying each category clearly with counts for better insight.

---

## How Are Domains & Hostnames Presented?

uBO Scope breaks down connection data by:

- **Hostnames**: The specific subdomain or hostname (e.g., `cdn.images.example.com`)
- **Domains**: The registered domain portion (e.g., `example.com`)

The extension groups outcomes at both levels, helping you identify if many requests are coming from a single third-party (domain) or dispersed across multiple hostnames.

Additionally, uBO Scope uses the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to accurately determine registered domains, an industry-standard resource that helps distinguish subdomains correctly.

---

## Practical Example: Interpreting a Report

Imagine visiting `news-site.com` and seeing the following in uBO Scope’s popup:

- **Allowed:**
  - `cdn.fastly.net` (5 requests)
  - `ads.doubleclick.net` (3 requests)
- **Stealth-Blocked:**
  - `track.exampletracker.com` (2 requests)
- **Blocked:**
  - `malicious.badserver.com` (1 request)

### What does this tell you?

- Your browser successfully connected to Fastly and DoubleClick, trusted CDNs and advertising networks.
- Requests to `track.exampletracker.com` were blocked stealthily, so the page likely can’t detect the block.
- Requests to the known malicious server were actively blocked.

This clarity enables you to understand the types of third parties interacting with your browsing session and gauge your exposure precisely.

---

## Tips for Effective Use

- **Lower badge counts** are generally better, reflecting fewer distinct third-party connections that were allowed.
- Understand that **not all third parties are bad**; many are content delivery networks or essential services.
- Use the **stealth category** to recognize advanced blocking techniques in play.
- Review allowed domains regularly to spot unexpected or suspicious third-party servers.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting & FAQs">
<Accordion title="Why are some domains listed in Allowed even when using a strict content blocker?">
Some third-party resources are required by websites to function correctly and may be whitelisted by your content blocker. uBO Scope reports all actual connections, giving you a truthful view regardless of your filtering rules.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does 'stealth blocking' really mean?">
Stealth blocking is a technique used to silently block connections without letting websites detect the blocking. It prevents breakage and attempts to hide blocking activity from scripts on the page.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope detect all network requests?">
uBO Scope relies on browser's webRequest API, which covers almost all web requests made by your browser including those blocked by various content blockers. However, requests made outside this API (outside browser context) cannot be detected.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if I see a domain listed under Blocked but the website still loads content?">
Some blocked requests might be non-essential or fallback to alternatives. Blocking a domain doesn’t always mean the entire website breaks, but it prevents resources from those third parties loading.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
