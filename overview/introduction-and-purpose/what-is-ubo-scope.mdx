# What is uBO Scope?

## See Every Network Connection — Clear, Transparent, Accurate

uBO Scope is a straightforward browser extension designed to shine a light on the opaque world of webpage network connections. Unlike typical content blockers that focus heavily on counts of blocked elements, uBO Scope reveals every connection attempt made by a webpage — whether it was blocked, allowed, or stealthily redirected — by reporting the true number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Reveals _all_ network activity:** Shows you the full picture of remote connections made from any webpage, not just what was blocked.
- **Counts distinct third-party servers:** The badge on the toolbar icon shows how many unique external domains a webpage communicates with, giving you an immediate understanding of third-party exposure.
- **Independent of content blockers:** Works transparently regardless of which content blocker you use or even if you use none.
- **Clarifies misconceptions:** Debunks common myths around content blocker reliability and simplistic block count metrics.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users wanting genuine visibility into what servers web pages connect to.
- Filter list maintainers and developers who need accurate, on-device insight into network behavior.
- Researchers and security auditors analyzing third-party requests and resource flows.

## What Is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a browser extension that tracks and reports every network request initiated by webpages you visit. It monitors these requests as they happen, then categorizes them to let you know which connections were outright blocked, allowed, or subject to stealthy redirects — all reported down to individual third-party domains.

This is possible because uBO Scope uses the browser's `webRequest` API, which gives it access to real-time request outcomes including success, error, and redirect events. Unlike many content blockers that hide behind block counts or filter rules, uBO Scope surfaces the fundamental truth: how many distinct third-party servers does a site really talk to?

This tool is not a content blocker itself but a _companion_ diagnostic extension, perfect for understanding the actual network behavior of webpages.

### How It Works

- Listens to all relevant network requests made by webpages in your browser.
- Records details about each request, including the requested URL, its outcome (allowed, blocked, stealth redirect), and the associated domain.
- Aggregates this data for each browser tab, tracking distinct domains contacted.
- Updates the toolbar badge to show the total distinct third-party remote server count.
- Displays an interactive popup where users can explore which domains were connected to under each category.

By focusing on _true third-party domains_ and connections rather than just raw block statistics, uBO Scope gives a real-world snapshot of your browser's network exposure for each page.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Network Request Outcomes Tracking**  
  Categorizes network requests into three outcomes:
  - *Allowed:* Connections which succeeded.
  - *Blocked:* Connections that failed or were explicitly blocked.
  - *Stealth:* Connections that were redirected or stealth-blocked (where the request is suppressed without being obvious).

- **Tab-Specific Aggregation**  
  Tracks connection data separately for each browser tab, giving context-sensitive insights.

- **Toolbar Badge with Real-Time Counts**  
  Shows the number of distinct third-party servers contacted by the active tab, quickly indicating third-party exposure.

- **Popup Interface for In-Depth Exploration**  
  When clicking on the extension icon, users see a detailed list of all third-party domains contacted, grouped by request outcome with counts.

- **Transparent and Lightweight Design**  
  Designed purely as a measurement tool without interfering or blocking, ensuring accurate and unbiased data.

- **Utilizes Public Suffix List for Accurate Domain Grouping**  
  Uses a robust domain parsing mechanism to correctly identify registrable domains, avoiding common mistakes in domain aggregation.

### Real-World Example

Imagine visiting a news website. Without uBO Scope, you might only know if your content blocker has blocked ads or trackers but remain unaware of exactly how many unique external servers the site connects to.

With uBO Scope:
- The toolbar badge might show “12”, indicating the site made successful connections with 12 distinct third-party domains, including CDNs, trackers, or analytics.
- Clicking the icon reveals which domains were connected and under what outcome category.
- This visibility empowers you to make informed decisions about your privacy and security settings.

## Why Should I Care?

Understanding true third-party server connections is pivotal for privacy and security:

- **Accurate privacy awareness:** Knowing exactly which external servers a webpage talks to informs your understanding of your data footprint.
- **Better content blocker evaluation:** Block counts can be misleading; uBO Scope reveals whether a blocker truly limits third-party server connections.
- **Myth debunking:** Avoid placing trust in superficial metrics like "block count" or unreliable "ad blocker test" sites.
- **Filter list support:** Provide actionable insight for filter maintainers seeking to optimize rules based on real-world network behavior.

### Typical Use Cases

- **Privacy auditors** verifying the extraneous connections of websites.
- **Developers** wanting to test the effectiveness of content blockers beyond just block counts.
- **End users** curious about their browsing footprint and exposed third parties.

### What Happens Without uBO Scope?

- You may be unaware of stealthy third parties your browser talks to.
- You may misjudge the effectiveness of content blockers based on inaccurate block statistics.
- You miss essential context needed to make informed security decisions.

## Getting Started Preview

Getting started with uBO Scope is simple:

1. **Install the extension** from the official browser stores (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, etc.).
2. **Navigate to any webpage** and observe the toolbar badge updating with the number of unique third-party domains contacted.
3. **Click the extension icon** to open the popup and explore detailed domains grouped by whether they were allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked.

<u>Note:</u> uBO Scope itself does not block any content; it requires only browser permissions to monitor network requests.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope alongside your existing content blocker to gain nuanced visibility.
- Pay attention to the number of _allowed_ distinct domains rather than block counts.
- Beware of overinterpreting the "stealth" category; it captures connections redirected or quietly suppressed.
- Frequent high counts may indicate aggressive third-party tracking or complex resource loading.

## Troubleshooting

- The badge may show no data immediately after installation—load a page and wait a moment for data collection.
- If the extension shows no data for specific pages, verify that no browser restrictions block access to `webRequest` API.
- Some very specific or encrypted connections might not report correctly if outside browser network monitoring.
