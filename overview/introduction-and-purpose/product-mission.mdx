# What is uBO Scope?

## A Lightweight Extension Revealing All Remote Network Connections

uBO Scope is a powerful yet lightweight browser extension designed to unveil every network connection—attempted or successful—that your browser makes to remote servers when you visit a website. Beyond simply tracking what loads, uBO Scope exposes the reality of third-party connections on the web, giving you visibility into the unseen network activity your browser performs on your behalf.

### Why uBO Scope Matters
- **Complete Transparency:** Understand exactly which remote servers your browser connects to, including those that succeed, fail, or get stealth-blocked.
- **Focus on Distinct Third-Parties:** The toolbar badge count reflects the number of unique third-party domains contacted, highlighting the breadth of external interactions.
- **Independent Monitoring:** Works alongside any content blockers or DNS-level filters by observing network requests through the browser’s webRequest API.
- **Myth-Busting Tool:** Debunks common misconceptions about content blockers and test pages by showing actual network connections rather than relying on block counts.

### Who Benefits from uBO Scope?
- Privacy-conscious users wanting deep insights into third-party network activity.
- Filter list maintainers who need accurate data on remote connections for improving blocking rules.
- Security researchers and power users requiring reliable network monitoring unaffected by content blocker stealth.

## What Is uBO Scope?

### A Clear View of Your Browser’s Network Activity
uBO Scope is a minimalist browser extension focused specifically on reporting all network connections a webpage attempts to make to remote servers. These connections include successful fetches, blocked attempts, and redirects—offering a complete picture of external network interactions beyond what standard content blockers report.

### Solving the Opacity of Web Connections
Webpages often load numerous third-party resources that remain hidden from everyday users. uBO Scope bridges this gap by revealing these connections, empowering users with an understanding of who their browser communicates with—even when those connections are blocked or stealthy.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?
- It does not block ads or content itself but reports what happens to network requests, making it an insightful companion to existing blockers.
- The badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted, not just the raw totals of requests or blocks.
- It leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to capture all network requests visible to the browser environment, regardless of your existing blocking setup.

### How It Works, at a High Level
uBO Scope listens to the browser’s network events via `webRequest` listeners, recording every connection attempt initiated by webpages. It categorizes outcomes as:

- **Allowed:** Requests that successfully connected.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed or were blocked.
- **Stealth:** Redirects or stealthy blocks that attempt to hide their activity.

These outcomes are aggregated per browser tab to provide a detailed look in the extension’s popup interface.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Comprehensive Connection Reporting:** Tracks all network requests on every site you visit, regardless of blocking extensions or filters.
- **Third-Party Focus:** Differentiates first-party domains from third-party connections, emphasizing privacy-relevant data.
- **Live Badge Indicator:** Shows a real-time count of distinct third-party domains connected by the active tab.
- **Categorized Outcomes:** Separates network connections into allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked for clarity.
- **Persistent Session Data:** Remembers connection outcomes across browsing sessions for consistent monitoring.

### Practical Example:
When you visit a news website, uBO Scope will show you all the legitimate first-party connections (such as the news domain) and secondarily list all third-party domains like ad servers, CDNs, analytics providers, or trackers that the page attempted to contact. You can instantly see which connections were blocked or redirected without guessing from block counts.

## Why Should You Care?

### Gain Full Visibility for Better Privacy Decisions
By understanding exactly which external servers your browser contacts, you can make informed decisions about your online privacy and security posture.

### Use Cases Where uBO Scope Excels:
- **Investigating Suspicious Sites:** Quickly identify unexpected third-party domains trying to connect.
- **Evaluating Content Blockers:** Move beyond misleading block counts to see actual network connection outcomes.
- **Supporting Filter List Development:** Precision data on connections allows maintainers to craft more effective rules.
- **Network Debugging:** See the detailed outcome of every network request from within the browser.

### Before uBO Scope:
Users relied on block counters or ad blocker test sites that often provide inaccurate or misleading insights.

### After uBO Scope:
You get a trustworthy window into the real network behavior of websites, clarifying which external domains are involved and whether their connections succeed or fail.

## Tips and Best Practices
- Remember: A lower badge count means fewer third-party domains connected, which typically indicates better privacy.
- Not all third-party connections are harmful; some, like CDNs, are essential for site performance.
- Use uBO Scope in combination with content blockers for complementary visibility and control.

## Troubleshooting

If you notice no data appearing or the badge count not updating:
- Ensure the extension has the required permissions.
- Confirm your browser version meets minimum requirements.
- Verify that no browser settings are blocking the `webRequest` API.
