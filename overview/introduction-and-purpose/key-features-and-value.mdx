# Key Features and Value Proposition of uBO Scope

Discover the essential capabilities that make uBO Scope an indispensable tool for anyone looking to thoroughly understand and manage the network connections initiated by webpages. This page delves into uBO Scope’s core functions, highlighting benefits that empower users and filter list maintainers to gain accurate and actionable insights into web privacy and tracker exposure.

---

## Real-Time Domain Connection Analysis

uBO Scope continuously monitors network activity in your browser, providing an immediate and transparent view of all domains contacted by the webpage you are visiting. This feature lets you instantly see the number and identity of distinct third-party servers your browser connects to — not just raw block counts, but actual network relationships.

**What this enables you to do:**
- Gain instant clarity on web requests reaching external servers
- Distinguish between first-party and third-party connections
- Understand the true reach of third-party domains beyond what standard blockers show

**Practical example:** Watching a news site load, you see uBO Scope's badge count update to reflect all unique third-party domains contacted—such as advertising networks or content delivery services. This insight helps you determine whether numerous trackers sneak through.

---

## Visibility into Stealth-Blocked Connections

Unlike many content blockers that simply hide blocking actions, uBO Scope reveals ‘stealth-blocked’ connections — network requests blocked invisibly or silently to prevent webpage breakage or detection.

**User benefit:**
- Understand when and where stealth blocking occurs
- Evaluate how stealth blocking impacts your browsing experience
- Assess content blockers' effectiveness beyond overt blocking

For example, when a third-party tracker attempts to load resources that are silently suppressed by your content blocker, uBO Scope categorizes these as stealth-blocked, making hidden blocking explicit and measurable.

---

## Content-Agnostic Request Logging

uBO Scope records all network requests regardless of the content type — be it scripts, images, stylesheets, or websockets.

This holistic logging enables you to:
- Track all remote server interactions without bias
- Detect unexpected or suspicious requests that could threaten privacy
- Develop a comprehensive understanding of webpage network flows

Whether it's content-related or non-content-related network requests, you have full visibility, empowering precise decisions.

---

## Badge Count Reflecting Unique Third-Party Servers

The toolbar icon's badge always shows the **number of unique third-party domains** with successful connections, not simply the number of blocked items or requests.

**Why this matters:**
- Offers a reliable metric for measuring exposure to trackers and external servers
- Helps negate common misconceptions based solely on block count comparisons
- Enables smarter assessment of content blockers’ performance

A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party remote servers contacted, signaling better privacy protection.

---

## Empowering Filter List Maintainers and Privacy-Conscious Users

uBO Scope's features are designed not just for everyday users but also as a powerful aid for filter list maintainers:

- Offer precise connection data without relying solely on browser DevTools
- Work effectively even on restricted environments where complex tools are unavailable
- Support effective filter list optimization and testing

Filter list maintainers gain a practical reporting tool to verify blocking comprehensively and swiftly.

---

## Seamless Browser Integration with Minimal Setup

uBO Scope seamlessly integrates with popular browsers (Chromium-based, Firefox, Safari), requiring only installation and enabling permissions to start monitoring network connections.

Because it leverages the browser `webRequest` API:
- It captures network events transparently and in real time
- It respects browser security constraints while reporting comprehensive data

This straightforward setup ensures everyone can benefit from its insights without deep technical knowledge.

---

## Summary

With uBO Scope, you gain a uniquely clear and actionable vantage point over network requests made by webpages. By focusing on the true scope of third-party domains contacted—including those stealth-blocked or content-agnostic requests—it empowers you to make informed decisions about privacy and content blocking effectiveness. Whether you are a privacy-conscious user wanting clarity or a filter maintainer needing detailed insight, uBO Scope provides the crucial data you need.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Regularly check the badge count:** Use it as a meaningful indicator of third-party exposure.
- **Explore the popup panel:** Review allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains to understand request outcomes.
- **Use alongside content blockers:** Combine uBO Scope insights with your blocker’s logs for comprehensive monitoring.
- **Leverage for testing:** Validate how well your filters are working and identify gaps.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- If you see no data or the badge does not update, ensure the extension has the correct permissions and is enabled.
- Confirm that your browser supports the `webRequest` API fully, as uBO Scope depends on it to capture network events.
- Remember, network requests outside the browser context (e.g., native apps) won’t be reported.
