# Why Use uBO Scope?

## Unlock Transparency Across All Content Blockers

uBO Scope is uniquely designed to expose the true scope of network connections triggered by the websites you visit — independent of content blockers.

Many ad blockers and privacy tools operate as a "black box," showing only what they block or hide. uBO Scope lifts this veil, giving you direct visibility into every remote server connection made in your browser, regardless of any active blocking rules. This level of transparency ensures you see the full picture, not just a filtered subset.

### Key Reasons to Use uBO Scope
- **See all outgoing network connections**: Detect domains your browser contacts even if they evade your usual ad blocker.
- **Debunk myths about ad blockers**: Validate claims about intrusive trackers or hidden connections by observing real-time data.
- **Support privacy awareness**: Understand exactly what third parties websites communicate with behind the scenes.
- **Audit and improve filter lists**: Identify ineffective or missing blocking rules by analyzing unblocked connections.
- **Function on restricted platforms**: Use uBO Scope where traditional content blockers may not be supported or fully operational.

## Understanding the Value

Imagine browsing your favorite news site or social media platform. You rely on your ad blocker to stop trackers and unwanted ads, but how do you know it’s working completely? Are there domains silently contacted that you haven’t seen before? uBO Scope answers that question instantly by reporting every remote connection your browser attempts — whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked by your existing filters.

This empowers you to:

- Gain deep insights into a website’s online footprint.
- Confirm your content blockers operate as expected.
- Discover new tracking or ad delivery domains to fine-tune your blocking rules.

## Real-World Scenario

_Alice is privacy-conscious and uses multiple blocking extensions. One day, she suspects her main ad blocker misses certain trackers. She opens uBO Scope, visits the site in question, and immediately sees connections reaching unexpected domains labeled as "allowed" or "stealth-blocked." With this visibility, Alice can adjust her settings and update her filters, ensuring tighter privacy control._

## Supporting Your Privacy and Audit Efforts

Unlike simple blockers, uBO Scope lets you review:

- **Allowed Connections**: Domains accessed without interference.
- **Stealth-Blocked Connections**: Connections prevented in ways that hide their presence from the page.
- **Fully Blocked Connections**: Requests completely denied by existing filters.

Such categorization helps uncover subtle data flows and refine blocking strategies, making it indispensable for privacy advocates and filter maintainers.

## Works Even Under Platform Restrictions

Certain browsers or environments have limitations on what content blockers can do. uBO Scope leverages browser APIs in a lightweight manner to stay functional where others might fail, thus maintaining your network visibility and control unrestricted.

## Summary

Choosing uBO Scope means gaining unmatched clarity on network activity, empowering you with actionable information to protect your privacy, validate your blockers’ efficacy, and optimize your browsing environment.

## What You’ll See in uBO Scope’s Popup Interface

When you open uBO Scope's popup (the user interface for immediate insights), you’ll find:

- A header indicating the currently inspected hostname.
- A summary showing the total number of connected domains.
- Sections listing domains by their connection outcome:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains your browser successfully contacted.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections stealthily prevented (hidden from the page).
  - **Blocked**: Connections fully blocked by your filters.

Each section conveniently details the domains involved and how frequently connections occurred.


## Best Practices to Maximize uBO Scope

- Use uBO Scope alongside your current content blockers for full-spectrum visibility.
- Regularly review "stealth-blocked" domains to identify emerging tracking mechanisms.
- Leverage insights from the popup to create or update your custom filter lists.
- Combine uBO Scope with other privacy auditing tools for comprehensive web security.


## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **No Data Displayed**: Ensure permissions are properly granted and the extension is active on the tab.
- **Unrecognized Domains**: Some domains may appear due to browser background requests; verify their legitimacy.
- **Platform Limitations**: On certain restricted browsers, some network events might be less detailed.
