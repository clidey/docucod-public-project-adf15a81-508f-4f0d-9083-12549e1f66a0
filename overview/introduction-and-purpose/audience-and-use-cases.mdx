# Target Audience and Use Cases

## Who Benefits from uBO Scope?

uBO Scope serves a diverse audience by providing a clear, unbiased view into the network connections initiated by webpages. Whether you are a privacy-conscious individual wanting to understand which third parties your browser connects to, a filter list maintainer tasked with refining content blocking rules, or a power user evaluating the effectiveness of your content blocker, uBO Scope delivers critical insights tailored to your workflow.

### Primary Users

- **Privacy-Conscious Individuals:** Empower yourself by seeing all remote connections made on each tab. Understand the true scope of third-party exposure beyond mere block counts.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Gain direct insights into the network requests your rules allow or block, particularly useful on devices or browsers where developer tools are limited or unavailable.
- **Power Users and Researchers:** Evaluate and debunk common myths around content blocker metrics, and confidently measure blocked, stealth-blocked, and allowed connections.


## How uBO Scope Fits Into Varied Workflows

uBO Scope integrates seamlessly with everyday browsing and advanced security auditing. Here are some practical scenarios showcasing its value:

### Evaluating Content Blockers

You want to verify not just how many connections a content blocker reports as blocked, but to whom your browser actually connects. uBO Scope uniquely shows:

- The count of distinct third-party domains your browser successfully connects with — a lower number means better privacy.
- Domains stealth-blocked through redirects or other subtle blocking mechanisms.
- Domains outright blocked, regardless of the blocking method.

This data helps you move beyond simplistic badge counts and misleading website ‘ad blocker tests’ that do not reflect real-world blocking effectiveness.


### Debunking Myths About Ad-Block Metrics

Common misconceptions can lead to wrong conclusions, such as assuming a higher block count means superior blocking. uBO Scope exposes the truth by measuring actual network connections irrespective of the content blocker's internal accounting:

- Block counts alone do not assess quality or reliability.
- Higher block counts may correspond to allowing more unique third-party servers, resulting in greater exposure.
- Stealth-blocked connections show subtle blocking that many tools miss.


### Assisting Audits Where Browser Tools Are Limited

On platforms or devices lacking comprehensive browser developer tools or network inspectors, uBO Scope stands as a reliable alternative to:

- Monitor network requests and their outcomes in real time.
- Identify third-party connections at the domain level for focused audit or troubleshooting.
- Provide data-driven insights for filter list improvement without deep access to developer tools.


## Real User Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Privacy Enthusiast Checking Daily Browsing**

Alice suspects some sites load hidden trackers. She opens uBO Scope on her browser tab and immediately sees a list of third-party domains contacted under allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories. This visibility helps her understand which connections actually happen in real time, empowering informed decisions on privacy tools.

**Scenario 2: Filter List Maintainer Refining Rules**

Bob maintains a filter list but works often on mobile where browser tools are limited. Using uBO Scope, he audits network requests on various sites, confirming the effectiveness of his filters and identifying stealth connections that could be better blocked.

**Scenario 3: Researcher Evaluating Content Blockers**

Carol runs comparative tests of different content blockers by using uBO Scope alongside them. She notices that the blocker with the highest badge count allows more distinct third-party connections. Armed with uBO Scope's insights, she chooses the blocker with fewer actual connections, prioritizing true privacy.


## Key Benefits Recap

- **Complete transparency:** See all remote server connections regardless of blocking method.
- **Accurate measurement:** Focus on distinct domains contacted, not just block counts.
- **Versatility:** Useful for casual users, power users, and filter list maintainers.
- **Reality check:** Debunk misleading claims about content blockers and test sites.
- **Accessible diagnostics:** Audit network traffic even on limited browsers or systems.


## Tips for Getting the Most from uBO Scope

- Always interpret the badge count as the number of unique third-party domains contacted — a lower number indicates less network exposure.
- Use the detailed popup to differentiate between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains for deeper understanding.
- Regularly compare results alongside your content blocker settings to validate effectiveness.
- Filter list maintainers should leverage uBO Scope to identify stealth connections not caught by block lists.


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t rely solely on block counts shown by content blockers to assess privacy.
- Avoid ad blocker test webpages for evaluation; these often do not represent real-world browsing conditions.
- Understand that not all third-party connections are harmful; CDNs and legitimate services commonly appear.
