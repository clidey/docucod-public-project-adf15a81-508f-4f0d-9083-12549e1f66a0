# Integration & Interoperability

uBO Scope is designed to work harmoniously alongside other privacy tools and content blockers, providing an unbiased lens on your web traffic without interfering with content blocking functions.

## How uBO Scope Complements Other Privacy Tools

Unlike traditional content blockers, which actively block or filter network requests to enforce privacy or remove ads, uBO Scope adopts a purely observational role. It reveals **all** connections a webpage attempts to make, whether those requests were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked by other tools. This transparency empowers users to precisely understand the actual network activity behind the scenes.

- **Observer, Not Blocker:** uBO Scope does not block or alter network traffic; it captures and reports.
- **Compatible with Any Blocker:** It cooperates with content blockers that utilize browser network APIs and do not bypass browser's `webRequest` API.
- **Holistic Visibility:** It reports all connections regardless of how blocking is implemented—browser extension, DNS-based, or network-level filtering—as long as the browser surfaces the requests through the `webRequest` API.

## Compatibility with Content Blockers

uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor network requests. This API is a shared resource among browser extensions to observe and influence web traffic.

- **Works with Browser API-Based Blockers:** Most popular blockers like uBlock Origin, AdGuard, and others that intercept requests via the `webRequest` API function in harmony with uBO Scope.
- **Limits with API Bypass Techniques:** Some privacy solutions or blockers use methods that completely bypass or obscure the `webRequest` API (e.g., network proxies, VPNs, or proxy extensions that hide requests from the browser API). In those cases, uBO Scope can’t detect those connections.
- **No Conflict in Blocking Decisions:** Because uBO Scope only observes, it neither competes nor conflicts with the blocking logic of other extensions.

## Understanding `webRequest` Integration Limits

While the `webRequest` API enables uBO Scope to capture a detailed snapshot of connection attempts and results, be aware of inherent limitations:

- **Not All Requests Are Visible:** Requests initiated outside the browser’s native networking stack (e.g., by some native applications, proxies, or particular browser processes) do not appear.
- **Redirects and Errors:** uBO Scope captures redirections, errors, and successful responses as reported by the `webRequest` API, but nuanced timing or lower-level network details are outside its scope.
- **Dependent on Browser Support:** As of now, uBO Scope fully supports Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers that support Manifest V3 and expose the necessary APIs.

## Edge Cases & Operational Details

- **Multiple Blockers Installed:** When several blockers are active, uBO Scope reports what the browser network stack processes, reflecting combined impact.
- **DNS-based Filters:** Some users deploy DNS filtering at the network level for enhanced privacy; uBO Scope still observes requests that pass through the browser stack.
- **Stealth Blocking:** Some blockers apply stealth techniques to avoid detection; uBO Scope categorizes such connections under "stealth-blocked," helping uncover evaded blocks.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine you use a popular content blocker and want to verify how many unique third-party domains your browser actually connects to on a news site. With uBO Scope:

1. It observes every network request, regardless of which blocker blocked or allowed it.
2. It transparently reports the count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted.
3. You can analyze which domains were blocked or allowed, and detect stealth-blocked domains invisible to normal content blockers.

This comprehensive insight helps you fine-tune your privacy setup, debunk block count myths, or troubleshoot unexpected connections.

## Troubleshooting Integration

If you suspect uBO Scope isn't capturing all intended data:

- **Check Browser Compatibility:** Ensure your browser version supports Manifest V3 and the required `webRequest` API.
- **Verify Other Extensions:** Some extensions or proxies might bypass or interfere with the browser’s network APIs.
- **Confirm Permissions:** uBO Scope requires host permissions for HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS URLs to observe traffic properly.

To maximize accuracy, run uBO Scope alongside your blockers in standard browser mode, avoiding VPN/proxy software that may hide traffic from browser-based APIs.
