# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is designed as a powerful yet approachable tool that serves a distinct audience of users united by an interest in monitoring, understanding, and controlling web connections. If you care about transparency in your browser’s network traffic or are involved professionally or hobby-wise in web privacy, content blocking, or network auditing, uBO Scope offers unique insights that complement existing content blocking tools.

## Target Audience Profiles

### 1. Privacy-Conscious End-Users
Every day, millions of users depend on content blockers to stop unwanted network connections, protecting their privacy and improving browsing speed. uBO Scope elevates this experience by revealing the entire picture behind these blockers — showing what connections your browser attempts, which are allowed, which are stealth-blocked, and which fail to connect.

- **Why it matters:** Instead of guessing, users get clear visibility into their exposure to third-party servers, allowing informed decisions about privacy.
- **Typical users:** Individuals who want assurance about how effective their content blockers really are, or those who want to audit any suspicious or unexpected network activity.

### 2. Filter List Creators and Maintainers
Filter lists form the backbone of most content blockers, but maintaining them requires detailed information about active connections on websites.

- **Why uBO Scope helps:** It captures and categorizes live network requests per tab, including stealth-blocked connections that might otherwise go unnoticed.
- **How it complements other tools:** While browser developer tools can show request logs, uBO Scope uniquely aggregates this data per tab and offers clear domain categorization, streamlining identification of third-party domains and potential filters.
- **Typical use case:** Creating precise and efficient block rules by observing which third-party connections are truly breaking through or being stealthily blocked by existing measures.

### 3. Advanced Analysts and Auditors
Security auditors, privacy researchers, and technical analysts require reliable, comprehensive data on network connections initiated by browsers.

- **Why uBO Scope is valuable:** It reports connection attempts regardless of which content blocker or DNS filtering mechanism is active, providing an objective source of truth.
- **Scenario examples:** Validating claims about content blocking efficacy, investigating new tracking techniques, or verifying compliance with privacy policies.

## Real-World Scenarios Illustrating uBO Scope’s Unique Insight

- **Case 1:** A user installs multiple popular content blockers. Despite seemingly high block counts in one, uBO Scope reveals that more distinct third-party servers are contacted, indicating the blocker may be less effective than assumed.

- **Case 2:** A filter list maintainer observes network requests in developer tools but misses stealth-blocked connections. uBO Scope’s categorization brings these to light, allowing refinement of filter rules.

- **Case 3:** An auditor tests a client environment and uses uBO Scope to confirm that DNS-level blocking is working across all third-party connections, despite aggressive blocking from the browser side.

## Why This Matters Compared to Other Content Blocker Tools

Most browser developer tools or content blockers themselves do not show every connection attempt or the context behind blocked and stealth-blocked requests. uBO Scope fills this gap by measuring _all_ network requests reported through the browser’s `webRequest` API and reporting outcomes in an easy-to-understand, tab-specific way.

This transparent insight empowers users to:

- See the full scope of third-party network traffic, not just the blocked fraction.
- Differentiate between stealth-blocked (hidden from websites) and outright blocked connections.
- Evaluate their content blockers and filter lists based on actual network connection exposure.

## Summary

If your goal is to better understand and control your exposure to third-party network connections, uBO Scope gives you the precise, actionable insight you need. Whether you are a privacy-aware user, a filter list expert, or an analyst, this extension complements other privacy tools by illuminating what is happening behind the scenes.
