# Feature Overview

Discover at a glance how uBO Scope empowers you to monitor all third-party remote server connections your browser makes for each active tab. This page guides you through the core user capabilities that put network transparency right at your fingertips, enabling you to assess the privacy impact of the webpages you visit in real time.

## Understanding What You See With uBO Scope

At its core, uBO Scope is designed to reveal the number and nature of unique third-party remote servers contacted by your browser for any open tab. The extension shows not only which domains were allowed but also which were stealth-blocked or fully blocked by your content blockers or DNS filtering. This immediate insight lets you identify how many and which external parties have network footprints within the tab’s loaded page.

### Real-Time Tab Activity Badge

The badge count displayed on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon updates live with the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected to in the currently active tab. This dynamic count offers a quick, at-a-glance indicator of the tab's network activity intensity:

- A higher number means more unique external connections, implying more exposure to third parties.
- A lower number indicates fewer third-party connections, generally signaling tighter privacy control.

This badge serves as an ongoing privacy health meter as you browse.

### The Popup Interface: Detailed Domain Breakdown

Clicking the toolbar icon opens the uBO Scope popup, where you can drill down into the precise lists of domains by connection outcome:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains that your browser connected to successfully. These are the third parties effectively delivering resources.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were stealthily blocked, meaning their requests were intercepted and prevented without outright errors visible to the page. This reflects subtle network blocking typically done to avoid detection or page breakage.
- **Blocked:** Domains with network requests that were fully blocked and failed outright, typically resulting in error events.

The popup clearly lists these domains, along with the count of requests per domain, helping you identify the most contacted servers and monitor their presence over time.

## What You Can Do With uBO Scope

Harnessing the feature set of uBO Scope allows you to:

- **Track Unique Third-Party Connections by Domain per Tab:** Understand the scope of third-party reach by visualizing distinct domains your browser talks to when loading each webpage.

- **Inspect Sanctioned Domains vs. Blocked and Stealth-Blocked:** Quickly categorize third parties into those allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked, gaining a nuanced perspective on your content blocker’s effectiveness.

- **Monitor Tab-Specific Network Activity in Real Time:** See how connections fluctuate as you navigate websites, with the badge count reacting immediately to new or removed connections.

- **Identify Potential Privacy Risks:** Spot unexpectedly high numbers of connections indicating privacy leaks or excessive third-party tracking.

- **Aid Filter List Debugging and Validation:** Validate how your content blockers or privacy filters operate across sessions and tabs by correlating the domains reported with filtered results.

## Illustrating the User Workflow

Imagine you load a new web page and want to understand its privacy impact:

1. **Observe Badge Count:** The toolbar icon badge immediately shows, say, "7", informing you that seven distinct third-party domains were contacted.
2. **Open uBO Scope Popup:** Clicking the icon reveals the detailed lists.
3. **Review Allowed Domains:** You see domains like `cdn.example.com` and `analytics.example.net` listed, indicating resources successfully fetched.
4. **See Stealth-Blocked Domains:** Some domains, perhaps ad trackers, appear under stealth-blocked.
5. **Check Blocked Domains:** Finally, you notice certain advertisers fully blocked.
6. **Make Privacy Decisions:** Armed with this breakdown, you can adjust your content blocker configurations or decide whether to avoid the site.

## Tips for Effective Use

- Regularly glance at the badge count while browsing sensitive sites to detect unexpected third-party connections.
- Use the domain lists to identify persistent trackers or advertising networks trying to circumvent content blockers.
- Remember that not all third parties are harmful; common CDNs and necessary services often appear in the allowed list.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't rely solely on the blocked counts from other content blockers to measure privacy — uBO Scope focuses on the distinct domains actually connected to, which matters more.
- Beware that some network requests can't be observed if outside the scope of the browser `webRequest` API.

## Step-by-Step: Exploring Your Tab’s Network Profile

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup panel showing the current tab’s network connections.
</Step>
<Step title="View the Total Connected Domains">
Check the summary at the top displaying the count of unique third-party domains contacted.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Allowed Domains">
Browse the "not blocked" section to see which domains successfully delivered content or data.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Stealth-Blocked Domains">
Look at the "stealth-blocked" section for domains where requests were silently suppressed.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Fully Blocked Domains">
Inspect the "blocked" section to recognize domains whose network requests failed outright.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Information to Make Privacy Judgments">
Adjust browser privacy settings or content blockers based on observed network patterns and domains.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with Feature Visibility">
<Accordion title="Popup shows 'NO DATA' or empty lists">
This typically means no network connection data is available for the current tab. Try refreshing the tab or navigated to another page to trigger new network activity.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count does not update">
Check if the extension has permission to monitor web requests. Some browsers or private browsing modes may restrict access. Also ensure the tab URL is allowed by the extension's host permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpectedly high allowed domain count">
Verify if the browsing session includes embedded content like ads, trackers, or CDNs. Use the domain breakdown to identify unwanted third parties.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
