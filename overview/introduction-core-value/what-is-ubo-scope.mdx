# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlocking Visibility Into Remote Server Connections

Imagine browsing the web and knowing with certainty exactly which remote servers your browser is trying to connect to — whether these connections succeed, get blocked, or are stealthily redirected. **uBO Scope** is a lightweight browser extension that brings this transparency to your fingertips. It reveals the *full landscape* of network activity triggered by the webpages you visit, empowering you with insight into third-party connections that are typically hidden.

## What is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to observe and report all *attempted* or *successful* connections made by your browser to remote servers while you navigate websites. Using the browser's webRequest API, it tracks every network request your browser attempts, then categorizes and displays these connections in an easy-to-understand format.

Unlike typical content blockers that only show block counts or incomplete statistics, uBO Scope focuses on the reality of *remote server connections*. This focus helps you accurately gauge the true network activity your browser performs — regardless of any content blocker in place.

## Why Does This Matter?

### Solve the Mystery of Third-Party Connections

Webpages today rely heavily on third-party services like CDNs, analytics, ad networks, and more. Some of these connections are essential and legitimate, others can be trackers or unwanted. Understanding exactly which connections are made — and which ones your content blockers allow or block — is critical for both privacy-conscious consumers and developers.

### Empower Filter List Maintainers and Advanced Users

For filter list maintainers engaged in refining blocking rules, having precise visibility into network request outcomes is invaluable. uBO Scope reports these outcomes irrespective of the blocking method (extension, DNS, or system), enabling more informed decisions and efficient list maintenance.

### Debunk Misleading Metrics

Some users mistake high block counts on other blockers for better protection. uBO Scope reveals the truth: a high block count doesn’t mean fewer third-party connections were made. Instead, it highlights the *number of distinct remote servers* your browser connected to— a lower count here means better efficacy.

## How Does uBO Scope Work?

uBO Scope hooks into your browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor all network requests initiated by webpages. It listens to key events such as requests being redirected, blocked (errors), or successfully completed. Using this data, it builds a session-based map associating connection outcomes with domains and hostnames linked to each browser tab.

These outcomes are organized into three main categories:

- **Allowed:** Connections that succeeded and were not blocked
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that were redirected stealthily
- **Blocked:** Connections that failed due to blocking or error

This categorization enables you to see at a glance which third-party servers your browser interacted with, and which requests were prevented from completing.

The extension also maintains a public suffix list (from publicsuffix.org) to distinguish domains and hostnames effectively.

## Key Benefits at a Glance

- **Complete network visibility:** Track every remote server connection initiated by a webpage, even under complex blocking scenarios
- **Accurate third-party measurement:** Understand the *distinct* third-party servers involved, not just raw request counts
- **Insight beyond block counts:** Avoid being misled by simplistic block metrics; focus on actual network exposure
- **Support for filter maintainers:** Gain detailed insight to refine filtering rules and better evaluate content blockers
- **Lightweight and privacy-respecting:** Only observes connections; does not interfere or block by itself

---

## Real-World Scenarios Where uBO Scope Shines

- **Privacy-conscious users** who want to audit the true extent of third-party connections on websites they visit
- **Web developers and security analysts** investigating how webpages load resources and where connections are routed
- **Filter list maintainers and content blocker developers** validating the effectiveness of blocking rules and uncovering blind spots
- **Users comparing content blockers** to understand which one truly limits third-party network connections

## Before and After: Understanding Your Web Traffic

| Without uBO Scope                                       | With uBO Scope                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| You see block counts that could be misleading           | You know the actual distinct third-party servers contacted|
| You guess which connections are allowed or blocked     | You get accurate, real-time reports on connection outcomes|
| You rely on unreliable 'ad blocker test' webpages       | You make decisions based on actual network behavior       |

---

## Getting Started

uBO Scope installs as a browser extension easily and runs silently in the background. Its toolbar badge updates dynamically, showing the count of distinct third-party servers connected. Clicking the badge reveals a popup detailing which connections were allowed, stealthily redirected, or blocked.

For initial setup and installation instructions, please see the [Installation Instructions](./getting-started/installation-and-setup/installation-instructions) page.

## Summary

uBO Scope reveals the unseen world of network requests your browser makes behind the scenes. It empowers you to monitor third-party server connections transparently and accurately. Whether you’re a privacy advocate, developer, or filter list maintainer, uBO Scope provides essential clarity to better understand and control your web experience.

# Example: What the Toolbar Badge Represents

When browsing a page:

- The **number shown on the badge** is the count of *distinct third-party remote servers* that the page connected to successfully or attempted connection with.
- A **lower badge count** indicates fewer third-party connections, which is typically better for privacy.


```text
Toolbar Badge: 3

Means:
- The browser contacted 3 distinct third-party domains
- Some connections may be allowed, stealthly blocked, or blocked
```

Clicking the toolbar icon opens a popup window showing details grouped by allowed, stealth (redirected), and blocked connections, helping you pinpoint exactly what is happening.

---

# Practical Tips

- Remember, **not all third-party servers are bad**; some serve legitimate content delivery or functionality.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to *verify* what connections are truly allowed or blocked.
- Avoid relying on external 'ad blocker test' websites; uBO Scope provides real-world connection data.


---

# Troubleshooting

If uBO Scope shows no data or badge count is unexpectedly empty:

- Ensure the extension is properly installed and enabled for your browser.
- Check that your browser’s webRequest API supports extension listeners (most modern browsers do).
- Visit the [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup Issues](./getting-started/troubleshooting-common-issues/troubleshooting-install-setup) page for help.
