# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Network Connection Initiated by Web Pages

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to uncover and reveal all network requests—whether successful or attempted—that web pages make to remote servers. It acts as a privacy lens, helping you clearly understand which third-party servers your browser contacts as you browse the web.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Reveal the Hidden Traffic:** Many web pages initiate behind-the-scenes connections that you may never be aware of. uBO Scope shows you every such network connection.
- **Assess Privacy Impact:** By seeing exactly which third-party domains are contacted, you can evaluate the privacy implications of visiting a given site.
- **Independent from Blockers:** It reports connections regardless of any content blockers in use, providing an accurate picture of what actually happens on the network.

### Designed For

- Privacy-conscious users who want to be fully informed about their browsing activity.
- Security auditors seeking visibility into third-party web connections.
- Filter list maintainers and developers who need a tool to validate network activity.

## What Is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a browser extension that listens to all network requests triggered by web pages and reports back on their outcomes. It tracks requests initiated when loading or interacting with a page, categorizing them based on whether they were allowed to connect, stealthily blocked, or explicitly blocked.

### Core Purpose

Websites often connect to a myriad of third-party servers, some necessary, others potentially tracking or intrusive. uBO Scope directly addresses the challenge of visibility by providing clear insight into these connections. It empowers you to:

- See all remote servers contacted by any given web page.
- Understand the volume and type of third-party network activity.
- Identify discrepancies between expected and actual network connections.

### Unique Advantages

- **Complete Transparency:** Unlike simple content blockers, uBO Scope reveals even failed or stealthily blocked requests, exposing attempts that other tools might hide.
- **Not Reliant on Page Reports:** Because it gathers data via browser APIs, it bypasses reliance on page scripting, which can be manipulated or incomplete.
- **Lightweight and Focused:** It has a singular mission of network request exposure, avoiding complexity to ensure clarity and reliability.

## How uBO Scope Works (At a Glance)

Upon activation, uBO Scope monitors web requests in your browser at a high-privilege level using the browser's `webRequest` API. It collects data on requests’ target domains, status (success, blocked, redirected), and categorizes these by domain and hostname.

When you open uBO Scope's popup interface, it presents:

- The domain of the current active tab.
- Counts and lists of domains contacted under three categories:
  - **Not Blocked:** Connections that succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections intercepted via stealth blocking.
  - **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked by other means.

The extension also displays a badge on its toolbar icon showing the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected, emphasizing privacy significance.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Real-Time Network Connection Reporting**  
  Captures all HTTP(S) and WebSocket attempts initiated by web pages, reporting outcomes regardless of block status.

- **Detailed Categorization**  
  Organizes connected domains into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked, making understanding outcomes intuitive.

- **Tab-Specific Tracking**  
  Monitors connections per browser tab, giving precise context to which page initiated each connection.

- **Domain and Hostname Resolution**  
  Uses the Public Suffix List to accurately extract base domains for meaningful aggregation of connections.

- **Badge Display**  
  Shows the current tab’s distinct allowed third-party domain count as a badge, signaling exposure level instantly.

- **Persistent Session Data**  
  Retains network request details during browser sessions, allowing retrospective analysis.

### Real-World Scenario

Imagine visiting a news website. uBO Scope silently records every attempted connection, whether to the main site, ad servers, social media trackers, or content delivery networks (CDNs). The popup reveals that while a few connections to trusted CDNs are allowed, several third-party tracking domains are stealth-blocked or outright blocked by your content blocker. This insight helps you understand your current privacy posture and the effectiveness of your blockers.

## Why Should You Care?

### What You Gain

- **Full Visibility into What Gets Loaded:** Know every external resource attempt by any website.
- **Accurate Privacy Assessment:** Distinguish between truly blocked traffic and stealthy requests continuing unnoticed.
- **Myth Busting:** Avoid misleading conclusions from inaccurate badge counts of content blockers or deceptive third-party testing sites.

### Common Use Cases

- **Verify Content Blocker Effectiveness:** Instead of relying on generic block count badges, see how many distinct third-party servers are actually contacted.
- **Audit Suspicious Sites:** Quickly capture and review all network connections for potentially malicious or privacy-invasive domains.
- **Filter List Maintenance:** Refine filter lists based on factual network requests and outcomes for better block precision.

### Before uBO Scope

Users rely on indirect signals like block counts or third-party test websites which can be misleading or inaccurate.

### After uBO Scope

Users have direct, verifiable, and detailed data on web connections, enabling informed privacy decisions.

<Tip>
For the best experience, ensure your browser supports the `webRequest` API fully, as uBO Scope’s accuracy depends on this browser capability.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Asked Questions">
<Accordion title="Why does my badge count show fewer domains sometimes?">
The badge reflects the number of unique third-party domains for which connections were allowed, not blocked. A lower count indicates fewer distinct third-party servers contacted, which is beneficial for privacy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope block any connections itself?">
No, uBO Scope is a monitoring tool only. It does not block or modify network requests; it reports on what happens.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is uBO Scope affected by other content blockers?">
uBO Scope reports the outcome of network requests regardless of other blockers, including stealth blocking done by other extensions, providing an unbiased view.
