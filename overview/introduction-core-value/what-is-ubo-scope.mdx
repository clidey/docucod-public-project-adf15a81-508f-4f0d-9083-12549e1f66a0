# What is uBO Scope?

Discover the powerful simplicity of **uBO Scope**, a browser extension designed to illuminate all remote server connections your browser makes while you surf the web. Whether these connections are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked, uBO Scope reveals the full landscape of third-party servers that web pages interact with.

## Revealing Remote Connections: Why It Matters

When you visit a website, your browser often communicates with numerous third-party servers behind the scenes — content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics tools, advertising networks, and tracking domains. Each connection represents a potential privacy risk or a footprint of your browsing activity.

By reporting every distinct third-party remote server connection attempt, uBO Scope enables you to:

- **Understand your online exposure** at a glance.
- **Identify unnecessary or unexpected connections** that may compromise privacy.
- **Validate the effectiveness of your content blocker and privacy tools** by measuring actual network activity rather than relying on indirect metrics.

The *number* of distinct third-party connections is especially important: a lower count signifies stronger privacy and less exposure to external services.

## The Problem uBO Scope Solves: Transparent Network Auditing

Most browsers and privacy tools obscure the details of network connections or report only partial information, making it difficult for users to verify what their browser is truly communicating with.

Additionally, common heuristics like badge counts on blockers or simplistic "ad blocker tests" can mislead users by conflating block counts with protection quality or by simulating unrealistic network activity.

uBO Scope directly addresses this gap by providing a clear, actionable view of every remote connection, sidestepping misleading metrics, and empowering users with verified facts.

## How uBO Scope Works in Practice

uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to listen to network request events, tracking requests in real time and classifying them as:

- **Allowed**: Connections successfully made to remote servers.
- **Blocked**: Connections prevented by your content blockers or network rules.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Connections that were redirected or hidden from the usual detection paths.

This comprehensive auditing works regardless of what content blocker you use and includes requests blocked at DNS levels, as long as the browser reports them through the `webRequest` API.

### Badge Count: Fast & Clear Status

The browser toolbar icon displays a badge with the **count of distinct third-party remote servers** your browser connected to on the current tab. This count excludes first-party servers and focuses on external domains.

> A lower badge count means fewer third-party connections, which is typically better for privacy.

### Detailed Popup Panel

Clicking on the toolbar icon opens a popup listing all domains connected to the current page grouped by outcome (allowed, blocked, stealth blocked), along with connection counts, helping you quickly assess your browsing's network footprint.

## Real-World Example

Imagine you're visiting a news website. Without uBO Scope, you might see the page load seemingly without issue, but dozens of connections to trackers and ad networks may go unnoticed. With uBO Scope, you see exactly these connections — their domains and frequencies — helping you decide if you want to tighten your content blocking or investigate those domains.

## Why Lower Server Counts Matter for Privacy

Each external connection is a potential path for tracking, fingerprinting, or data leakage. Reducing these connections minimizes your digital exposure and consolidates your browsing footprint.

Many legitimate third parties, such as CDN providers, appear in connection logs but are generally low in number and widely trusted, distinguishing them from trackers and third-party advertisers.

## What Sets uBO Scope Apart

- **Works alongside any content blocker:** uBO Scope measures actual network events, including those blocked by other blockers or via DNS.
- **Accurate, real-time reporting:** Continuously monitors and updates connection info during browsing.
- **Simple and focused:** No complicated settings or interference, just raw data on remote connections.
- **Cross-browser support:** Available for Chromium, Firefox, and Safari with consistent behavior.

## Summary

uBO Scope is your microscope into the hidden world of web connections, putting you firmly in control by revealing who your browser talks to — and how often. Lower server counts equal better privacy and fewer third parties tracking you.

Unlock transparency and insight with uBO Scope.
