# What is uBO Scope?

## See Every Third-Party Connection Your Browser Attempts

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension built to provide complete transparency about your browsing sessions' network activity. It reveals every attempted or successful connection to third-party remote servers — connections that often go unnoticed yet impact your privacy.

### Why This Matters
When you visit a website, countless requests may be sent behind the scenes to various remote servers — including trackers, ad servers, or content delivery networks (CDNs). Understanding these connections empowers you to evaluate your privacy exposure accurately.

- **Identify all third parties:** See the full list of domains your browser connects to while loading a page.
- **Track connection outcomes:** Know whether these requests were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- **Debunk misconceptions:** Stop relying on misleading block count comparisons and fake test pages.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?
- Privacy-conscious web users curious about real network connections
- Security researchers analyzing third-party requests
- Filter list maintainers needing accurate connection data

## What Is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a specialized tool that reports all network requests made by your browser during a page load, focusing on connections to third-party remote servers. Unlike traditional content blockers which act to block unwanted content, uBO Scope’s mission is to measure and disclose each network interaction, whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.

#### Purpose
uBO Scope helps you visualize and understand which domains your browser attempts to communicate with, exposing the real scope of third-party data leakage.

#### How It Works (High-Level)
- Listens to network requests in real-time through the browser's `webRequest` API.
- Categorizes connections into **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth-blocked** based on their outcomes.
- Groups connections by domains and hostnames, leveraging the Public Suffix List to differentiate registrable domains.
- Updates a browser toolbar badge reflecting the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.

This data-driven approach provides an unfiltered account of your network activity, regardless of what content blocker you may be running.

#### What Sets uBO Scope Apart
- **Accurate Network Data:** Reports the reality of network requests irrespective of stealth techniques used by content blockers.
- **Privacy-First Transparency:** Shows connections that are allowed or blocked — not just block tallies.
- **Myth Busting:** Clears up common misunderstandings about block counts and ad-block tester reliability.
- **Simplicity:** Provides a clear, easy-to-read summary, without interfering with your browsing experience.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Third-Party Connection Detection:** Automatically identifies all remote servers contacted during browsing, filtering out first-party connections.
- **Outcome Classification:** Categorizes each request as "allowed," "blocked," or "stealth-blocked," giving nuanced insight.
- **Domain Aggregation:** Utilizes robust domain parsing from the Public Suffix List to group hostnames under their registrable domains.
- **Real-Time Badge Count:** Displays a badge on the browser toolbar indicating the count of distinct third-party domains encountered, providing at-a-glance awareness.
- **Compact Popup Details:** The extension popup lists detailed domain rows under each outcome category, showing connection counts per domain.

### Real-World Example
Imagine loading a news website. Behind the scenes, your browser contacts the news site's servers (first-party) but also:
- Connects to ad servers hosted on domains like `ads.example.com` (allowed requests).
- Blocked trackers on domains like `trackers.example.net` (blocked requests).
- Redirected connections that content blockers stealthily suppressed (stealth-blocked).

uBO Scope exposes all these connections so you can assess how much third-party interaction is actually happening on the sites you visit.

## Why Should You Care?

**uBO Scope transforms invisible network activity into tangible data you can act on.**

### Primary Benefits
- **Control Your Privacy:** See precisely which outside domains gain access while you browse.
- **Make Informed Decisions:** Evaluate different content blockers not by block counts, which can be misleading, but by real third-party domain exposure.
- **Avoid False Confidence:** Understand that high block numbers don’t always mean better privacy; sometimes fewer blocks mean fewer connections.
- **Debunk Fake Tests:** Stop trusting "ad blocker test" pages that don’t replicate real-world scenarios.

### Common Use Cases
- **Privacy Audit:** Analyze which trackers and third-party services websites truly connect to.
- **Content Blocker Verification:** Cross-check block effectiveness by measuring the result in domain-level connections.
- **Filter List Maintenance:** Identify domains requiring blocking or whitelisting based on real connection attempts.

### Before and After Using uBO Scope
| Without uBO Scope                         | With uBO Scope                                  |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Blind to actual third-party domains     | Visible, countable list of all connected domains|
| Misled by flaky block counts            | Reliable data on genuinely allowed connections  |
| Fall for fake "block test" web pages  | Clear understanding of real-world network activity|

Furthermore, uBO Scope saves you time by summarizing complex network data simply and effectively.

## Getting Started Preview

Start exploring your browsing connections immediately after installation: click the uBO Scope browser toolbar icon to open the popup panel.

### What To Expect
- **Domain Summary:** An at-a-glance count of third-party domains your browser connected to on the current tab.
- **Categorized Domain Lists:** See domains grouped into "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" sections, with the number of connection attempts.

### Prerequisites
- A supported browser (Chromium-based browsers, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Permission to access network request data (granted during extension install).

### Next Steps
- Visit the **Installation Guide** page to install uBO Scope for your browser.
- Proceed to the **First Inspection** guide to learn how to interpret the popup data.
- Explore advanced features and mythbusting scenarios in the Guides section.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- If the extension shows "NO DATA," try reloading your current tab to trigger data collection.
- Remember that connections made outside the browser's ability to report (`webRequest` API) will not be visible.
- The badge count resets per tab and reflects only active connections from the current page.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your favorite content blockers for complementary insights.
