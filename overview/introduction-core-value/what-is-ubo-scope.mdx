## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension companion to content blockers. Its core function is to report and visualize all network connections initiated by the current active web page. Unlike traditional content blockers that focus primarily on blocking unwanted content, uBO Scope tracks all network activity irrespective of blocking decisions or content blocker presence.

Its primary goal is to empower you with detailed insights into third-party and first-party connections, promoting informed decisions about your privacy and security online.

### Why Does This Matter?

Modern web pages often load resources from many remote servers, some essential, others intrusive or tracking-oriented. Content blockers vary in what they block, sometimes allowing more connections than you expect. uBO Scope lifts the veil on these network activities, showing you exactly which third-party domains your browser connects to and how these connections are handled.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

- **Neutral Observation:** It passively monitors network requests without interfering, offering an unbiased view.
- **Browser-API Reliant:** Uses the browser's `webRequest` API to gather data without affecting browsing performance.
- **Universal Compatibility:** Works alongside any content blocker, DNS-level blocking, or stealth modes.
- **Precision Counting:** The toolbar badge reflects the count of distinct third-party domains connected, not just total requests.

## Core Concepts at a Glance

- When a web page loads, it attempts connections to various remote servers.
- uBO Scope detects these attempts and categorizes each connection as:
  - **Allowed:** Successfully completed connections.
  - **Blocked:** Connections prevented or errored out.
  - **Stealth:** Redirected connections, often hidden from the page.
- These categorizations are presented clearly in uBO Scope’s popup panel.

By distinguishing these outcomes, uBO Scope guides you in understanding what your browser actually loads and what is blocked or hidden.

## How to Interpret What You See

The uBO Scope toolbar badge shows the number of *distinct third-party domains* your browser has connected to for the current tab. A lower count on this badge generally means fewer third-party connections, which is a positive privacy indicator.

Inside the popup panel, you see grouped lists of domains under categories "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked" — giving you a detailed breakdown of each connection’s fate.

### Example Scenario:
Imagine visiting a news website. uBO Scope might reveal:
- 3 third-party domains successfully connected (CDNs, analytics).
- 1 stealth-blocked domain redirected.
- 2 blocked domains (tracking servers).

Knowing this breakdown lets you gauge the privacy posture for the site beyond just what your content blocker reports.

## Practical Tips to Get the Most Out of uBO Scope

- Use uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blocker to verify which third parties are truly being blocked.
- Keep an eye on the toolbar badge as a privacy indicator; sudden spikes may signal trackers or unwanted connections.
- Review the popup panel details to identify unexpected domains, which could warrant further investigation or filter list customization.
- Remember that not all third-party connections are harmful; many are essential, such as CDN services.

## Summary of User Workflow

1. **Install uBO Scope:** Add the extension to your browser from official stores.
2. **Browse Normally:** Navigate to web pages as usual.
3. **Monitor the Badge:** Notice the number on the uBO Scope icon reflecting third-party domains connected.
4. **Open the Popup:** Click the icon to open the detailed domain list, reviewing allowed, stealth, and blocked outcomes.
5. **Interpret & Act:** Use insights to adjust content blockers or raise awareness of site behavior.

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- **Zero or No Data Displayed:** This can occur if the current tab has no network activity yet or if the page doesn’t load external resources.
- **Badge Count Not Updating:** Ensure your browser supports `webRequest` API correctly and that uBO Scope is allowed permissions.
- **Unexpected High Counts:** Some sites legitimately connect to many services; consider looking at domain names to differentiate benign CDN from trackers.
