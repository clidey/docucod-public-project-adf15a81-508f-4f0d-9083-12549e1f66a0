# What is uBO Scope?

## Gain Full Visibility into Your Browser’s Network Connections

uBO Scope is a lightweight, transparent browser extension designed to reveal every remote third-party connection your browser attempts or completes when visiting web pages. Unlike traditional content blockers, which primarily focus on blocking or filtering content, uBO Scope’s mission is to empower users with complete insight into network activity — regardless of which content blocking measures are currently active.

### Why uBO Scope Matters
- **Transparent Reporting:** It surfaces all network connections to third-party servers, visible or blocked, to give you a truthful picture.
- **Independent of Content Blocking:** Its visibility is unaffected by any active ad blockers, tracking blockers, or DNS-level filters.
- **Empowerment Through Data:** By knowing which external servers pages connect to, you can make more informed security and privacy decisions.
- **Clear Differentiation of Outcomes:** It categorizes connections as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, clarifying the fate of each network request.
- **Easy-to-Understand UI:** A concise badge and detailed popup report help you grasp your browsing exposure at a glance.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?
- Privacy-conscious users who want deeper insight beyond what typical blockers reveal.
- Filter list maintainers aiming to understand network requests on real websites.
- Security professionals and researchers analyzing third-party connections.
- Developers seeking to validate network requests and external dependencies.

## What is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a browser extension companion to uBlock Origin. It quietly monitors and records all network requests to remote third-party servers initiated by visited web pages and surfaces these connections transparently to the user. It listens to the browser’s `webRequest` API, tracking all URLs where network activity occurs — whether the requests are allowed, blocked, or silently stealth-blocked.

This enables you to fully understand the network behavior of websites in real time. The extension’s badge on the toolbar reports how many distinct third-party domains your browser connected to, making it easy to gauge network exposure without digging into developer tools.

## What Problem Does uBO Scope Solve?

Web users often lack visibility into the myriad network connections their browsers establish when loading pages. Content blockers and privacy tools may block some connections silently or partially, and browser developer tools can be complex and fragmented. This opacity leaves users uncertain about which third parties are actually contacted and what data might be shared.

uBO Scope solves this lack of transparency by providing a continuous, reliable report of all connection attempts. Whether connections are permitted, silently blocked, or actively denied, uBO Scope tracks and classifies these outcomes for you. This empowers users to discern ‘how many and which’ third parties web pages really interact with, enabling smarter privacy decisions.

## How Does uBO Scope Work?

uBO Scope hooks into the browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor network requests in real time. It records:

- The fully qualified hostname and domain of each request
- The request’s outcome, such as successful connection, stealth blocking (invisible blocking), errors, or redirects

These data points are aggregated per browser tab and broken down into three key outcome categories:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** Connections which succeeded or were allowed
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests quietly blocked to prevent website detection
- **Blocked:** Requests actively blocked with error outcomes

A badge count on the extension icon reflects the current number of distinct allowed third-party domains connected during browsing.

Inside the popup panel, uBO Scope presents a detailed overview showing domains contacted in each outcome category, alongside the number of connection attempts per domain.

<Tip>
uBO Scope respects the browser’s enforcement of active content blockers or DNS-based filters. It only reports on requests visible to the browser’s network stack.

## Why Should You Care?

Using uBO Scope delivers tangible benefits for privacy awareness and web transparency:

- **Understand Your Exposure:** See which third parties you actually connect to across sites, beyond just what blockers report.
- **Detect Stealth Blocking:** Identify where connections are silently denied, which can impact website functionality.
- **Avoid Misleading Assumptions:** Don’t rely solely on block count badges or test pages—know the actual connections.
- **Improve Decision-Making:** Use true network data to fine-tune privacy settings or evaluate filter list effectiveness.
- **Save Time:** Quickly gauge the third-party network footprint of websites without manual digging.

Imagine browsing a news site and wondering how many distinct invisible trackers load scripts. uBO Scope instantly reveals all these domains, whether your blockers hid them or not.
