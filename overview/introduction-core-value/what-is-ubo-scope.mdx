# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Transparency in Web Connections Instantly

uBO Scope is a straightforward browser extension designed to reveal every outward network connection that your browser attempts or completes when loading web pages. It transparently reports all remote server connections, giving you a clear picture of what servers your browser communicates with—regardless of which content blocker you use.

- Tracks both successful and attempted network connections from any web page
- Operates independently of content blockers, reflecting real network activity
- Presents connection data succinctly through a toolbar icon badge and a detailed popup
- Helps users distinguish between legitimate third-party services and excessive unwanted connections

Ideal for users who demand clarity on their browser’s network activity, privacy-focused individuals, and filter list maintainers seeking objective insights.

## Understanding uBO Scope: Your Window into Network Activity

At its core, uBO Scope is a companion extension to popular content blockers but with a unique mission: to report all network requests made by the browser to remote servers during page loads. It does so by tapping into the browser’s `webRequest` API, capturing the outcomes of these requests whether they are allowed, blocked, or redirected.

Unlike content blockers that only control or block requests, uBO Scope provides visibility into *what actually happens* on the network layer, beyond any content blocking. This critical transparency enables users to analyze and verify the true scope of connections happening behind the scenes.

Its independence from specific filtering logic ensures an unbiased view—whether you run no content blocker or multiple blockers simultaneously, uBO Scope offers an accurate measure of your browser’s connection footprint.

## Core Features of uBO Scope

- **Comprehensive Network Request Monitoring:** Listens to all network requests through the `webRequest` API to capture the outcomes including successes, errors, and redirects.

- **Domain and Hostname Aggregation:** Organizes connected remote servers by hostname and registered domain using an internal public suffix list, helping you see distinct parties communicating with your browser.

- **Real-Time Badge Count:** Displays a badge on the toolbar icon showing the number of distinct third-party remote domains currently connected, providing at-a-glance awareness.

- **Detailed Popup Interface:** Offers a categorized list of connected domains, broken down into "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked," helping you quickly grasp the connection landscape.

- **Persistent Session Data:** Maintains state across browser sessions to accumulate connection data until tabs are closed.

### How uBO Scope Adds Value in Real-World Scenarios

Imagine opening a website and instantly knowing how many third-party servers it communicates with—even those blocked by your content blocker. uBO Scope clearly highlights if a website loads content from many external sources or just a minimal set of trusted providers like CDNs.

For privacy-conscious users, this visibility is enlightening, showing the real exposure on every page visited.

Filter list maintainers gain a powerful validation tool for testing how effective their rules are, by observing which connections are actually blocked or allowed.

## Why uBO Scope Matters to You

- **Achieve True Network Transparency:** See all remote server connections attempted by websites, not just those a content blocker reports.

- **Avoid Misleading Block Counts:** Understand that block counts alone don't reflect content blocker effectiveness—uBO Scope shines a light on actual network activity.

- **Debunk Common Content Blocking Myths:** Rely on real data instead of fabricated ad-blocker test pages or unverifiable block statistics.

- **Make Informed Privacy Decisions:** Recognize and act on excessive third-party connections that might compromise your privacy.

- **Streamline Troubleshooting and Analysis:** Use connection data to investigate unexpected content loads or privacy concerns.

## Getting Started with uBO Scope

Getting started is effortless:

1. **Install the extension** from your browser's add-on store.
2. Once enabled, **browse normally**.
3. Observe the **badge on the toolbar icon** which updates live with the count of distinct connected third-party domains.
4. Click the icon anytime to open the **popup panel**, which breaks down connections into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories.

No configuration or setup is required — uBO Scope begins monitoring immediately, offering transparency with zero hassle.

<Tip>
For best results, ensure your browser supports the `webRequest` API permissions required by uBO Scope. It operates smoothly on major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari with appropriate privileges.

## Common User Workflow Example

1. **Open a website you want to analyze.**
2. Notice the badge icon number updating to reflect connected servers.
3. Click the icon to launch uBO Scope's popup.
4. Review the categorized connections:
   - **Not Blocked:** Third-party servers your browser successfully connected to
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Third-party domains blocked through stealth means, invisible to many tools
   - **Blocked:** Domains blocked outright by content blockers or network errors
5. Use this information to decide if the presented network activity aligns with your privacy and security expectations.

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

- If the badge count does not update, ensure that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (`webRequest` and `activeTab`) enabled in your browser.

- Some network requests, such as those made outside the browser’s visibility or not accessible via the `webRequest` API, cannot be monitored.

- Use uBO Scope in combination with your favorite content blocker for enhanced insight rather than as a control tool itself.
