# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Your Browser Makes — Clearly and Transparently

uBO Scope is a lightweight, yet powerful browser extension designed to reveal all remote server connections that your browser attempts or completes when you visit websites. It provides real-time visibility into network requests that usually remain hidden behind the scenes, giving you immediate insight into the third-party hosts involved on each page.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You

Modern websites often load resources from multiple external servers, many of which belong to third parties such as advertisers, analytics providers, or content delivery networks (CDNs). Knowing exactly which connections are made—and whether they are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked—places you in control of your browsing privacy and security.

### What uBO Scope Shows You

- **Third-party remote servers contacted by your browser:** See the exact domains involved with each page you visit.
- **Connection outcomes per domain:** Instantly understand if the connection was allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- **Badge overview:** A convenient browser toolbar badge displays a live count of distinct third-party domains successfully connected.

### Key Value Propositions

- **Transparency beyond typical blockers:** uBO Scope reveals network activity regardless of your content blocker, providing a clear measure of actual third-party exposure.
- **Simple, actionable data:** The popup interface organizes domains into 'not blocked,' 'stealth-blocked,' and 'blocked' categories for fast understanding.
- **Supports informed decisions:** By knowing the true list of connected servers, you can better evaluate your content blockers and privacy posture.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users wanting to know which external servers their browser reaches.
- Developers and security professionals analyzing network requests of webpages.
- Filter list maintainers and content blocker enthusiasts who need an unbiased third-party connection report.

## What is uBO Scope, Exactly?

uBO Scope is a browser extension that monitors network traffic within your web browser and reports all remote servers contacted during page loads and resource fetching. It listens to network events provided by your browser's internal APIs (notably, the `webRequest` API) and aggregates connection outcomes.

It is a companion tool rather than a blocker itself, designed primarily to measure and report connections rather than block them. This makes it uniquely valuable for gaining insight into the behavior of websites and content blockers in your browser.

### The Problem it Addresses

Content blockers typically display metrics like the number of blocked requests or blocked resource counts. These numbers can be misleading and fail to communicate the bigger picture: the actual number of distinct third-party domains your browser ends up contacting.

Many users and professionals seek a clear, trustworthy way to see which remote servers their browser connects to independent of blocking strategies — and that's exactly what uBO Scope delivers.

### How uBO Scope Works in Simple Terms

When you load a webpage, your browser makes lots of network requests:

- Some are allowed by your content blocker.
- Some are blocked outright.
- Others may be stealth-blocked, meaning blocked in a way that’s transparent to the page.

uBO Scope tracks these requests, associates each with a domain, and categorizes them by their outcome. It then surfaces this data via an easy-to-understand popup and a numeric badge, giving you a straightforward view of your browsing connections.

## Core Differentiators of uBO Scope

- **Outcome transparency**: Rather than just counting requests, it shows their result (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).
- **Domain-centric reporting**: Aggregates connection data about domains, not individual requests, so you see the broader relationship.
- **Independent of blockers**: Reports connections regardless of which content blocker or DNS filtering is in use, as long as the browser exposes network requests.
- **Lightweight and efficient**: Designed as a best-effort viewer without adding overhead to your browsing experience.

## How Does the uBO Scope Popup Work?

The extension popup, accessible by clicking the toolbar icon, provides a snapshot of connections for the active browser tab:

- The **hostname** and **domain** of the currently active tab are displayed at the top.
- A **summary** shows the total number of distinct connected domains.
- Three categorized sections list domains by outcome:
  - **Not blocked**: Domains your browser successfully contacted.
  - **Stealth-blocked**: Domains blocked transparently to the webpage.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where the connection was outright blocked.

Within each section, domains are accompanied by a count showing how many requests were involved.

### Example User Scenario

Imagine visiting a news website with extensive third-party advertising:

- Upon clicking uBO Scope’s toolbar icon, the popup reveals that 15 distinct third-party domains were contacted.
- It shows 10 are allowed, 3 stealth-blocked, and 2 blocked.
- Seeing this, you realize your content blocker is doing more than just blocking individual requests—it is stealthily blocking some connections, reducing your exposure.

This empowers you to verify content blockers' effectiveness while understanding the true scope of third-party connections.

## Summary

uBO Scope is your browser’s transparent observer, revealing which remote servers your browser connects to from the currently active tab. By focusing on distinct third-party domains and connection outcomes, it empowers you to make informed decisions about your privacy and the effectiveness of content blockers.

Whether you're a privacy advocate, developer, or filter list maintainer, uBO Scope gives you clarity that standard tools simply can't.
