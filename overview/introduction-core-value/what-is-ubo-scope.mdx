# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlock Transparency: See Every Third-Party Connection Your Browser Makes

uBO Scope is a lightweight, companion browser extension designed to bring unprecedented transparency to your web browsing experience. It measures and reveals **all** connections your browser attempts or successfully makes to remote servers, lifting the veil on third-party network activity.

### Why This Matters
When you browse the web, hundreds of network requests can occur behind the scenes—loading content, analytics, ads, trackers, or necessary resources. uBO Scope exposes these connections so you can clearly see which remote third parties are interacting with the pages you visit.

### Key Benefits of uBO Scope
- **Immediate Insight:** A simple toolbar badge shows the count of distinct third-party servers your browser connected to, helping you gauge the level of third-party interaction at a glance.
- **Accurate Measurement:** Unlike typical block counters, uBO Scope counts distinct third-party domains that successfully connected, offering a more meaningful measurement of your privacy exposure.
- **Independent of Blocker:** It reports network request outcomes regardless of which content blocking solution is active, or even when blocking happens at DNS level, as long as the browser's `webRequest` API is accessible.
- **Myth Busting:** Use uBO Scope to debunk common misconceptions around ad blockers and content blockers by showing what actually connects instead of relying on block counts or test pages.

### Who Benefits Most
uBO Scope is ideal for privacy-conscious web users, security researchers, filter list maintainers, and anyone interested in uncovering the hidden third-party connections that web pages make.

## Defining uBO Scope

At its core, uBO Scope is a browser extension that **monitors network request activity through the browser's webRequest API**. By capturing data about requests initiated by webpages, it aggregates information about which third-party domains were contacted and presents this data to the user.

This extension does not block or modify content; instead, it acts as an objective observer—a transparency tool that tells the real story behind every connection a webpage attempts.

## The Problem It Solves

Many users rely on ad blockers or content blockers but lack clear visibility into how many and which third-party servers their browsers talk to. Common metrics, like block counts, can be misleading and do not capture the true picture of third-party interactions. uBO Scope fills this gap by tracking **distinct successful connections**.

## What Makes uBO Scope Unique

- **Focus on Third-Party Server Count:** Instead of raw block or request counts, it measures distinct third-party domains with successful connections.
- **Transparency over Control:** Designed as a measuring tool, it stays neutral and is compatible with any blocking setup.
- **Debunking False Assumptions:** Helps users and developers critically evaluate content blocker effectiveness beyond conventional benchmarks.

## How uBO Scope Works at a High Level

While detailed internal mechanics are beyond this introduction, here's a conceptual overview:

1. **WebRequest Listeners:** uBO Scope hooks into the browser's webRequest event system to observe requests being made by web pages.
2. **Domain Extraction:** For each request, it extracts the hostname and computes the registered domain using the Public Suffix List, ensuring proper handling of subdomains and suffixes.
3. **Outcome Recording:** Each request is classified based on its status (allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked) and logged accordingly.
4. **Session Storage:** Connection data is stored in the browser session and updated dynamically to reflect activity per browser tab.
5. **User Interface:** The toolbar icon badge displays the count of distinct allowed third-party domains, while a detailed popup provides categorized lists of connected, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.

## Real-World Context: Understanding uBO Scope in Action

Imagine visiting an online news site. Behind the scenes, your browser might attempt connections not only to the news site itself but also to analytics providers, content delivery networks (CDNs), advertising networks, social media widgets, and more.

With uBO Scope installed:

- You glance at the extension’s badge and see a small number, indicating how many distinct third-party servers your browser connected to.
- Opening the popup reveals exactly which domains were contacted, how many requests succeeded, which ones were blocked, and which were stealth-blocked (invisible to content blockers).
- This clarity helps you make informed decisions—adjusting your filters, choosing safer sites, or just satisfying your curiosity.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Use in tandem with content blockers:** uBO Scope complements blockers by showing you what goes through.
- **Watch the badge number:** A lower count means fewer external parties interacting with the site.
- **Understand stealth blocking:** Some requests may be stealth-blocked by content blockers to avoid detection but still attempt connections.
- **Profile sites:** Use uBO Scope to compare third-party connections across sites you frequent.

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- **Misinterpret block counts:** Unlike typical blockers, the badge counts distinct domains connected, not blocks or requests.
- **Relying on test pages:** Synthetic blocker test pages do not reflect real-world traffic; trust uBO Scope's direct measurements instead.
- **Expect rapid updates:** uBO Scope updates data based on actual network requests and may have a small processing delay.
