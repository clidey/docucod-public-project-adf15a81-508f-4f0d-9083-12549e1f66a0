# Value Proposition & Use Cases

Discover how uBO Scope transforms your understanding of web privacy by providing transparent insight into all third-party network connections initiated by web pages. Whether you're a privacy enthusiast, a power user comparing different content blockers, or a filter list maintainer auditing effectiveness, this page explains the unique benefits and practical scenarios where uBO Scope delivers unmatched visibility and clarity.

## Why uBO Scope Matters

The modern web is rife with third-party connections that can impact your privacy, security, and browsing experience. Many blockers focus on filtering content, but none clearly reveal what connects behind the scenes. uBO Scope fills this gap by showing all attempted and successful remote connections — regardless of whether blocking occurs or not — empowering you with factual information to take control.

### Core Benefits

- **Complete Visibility:** See every third-party server your browser attempts to connect to, providing a transparent view that no content blocker can fully reveal.
- **Independent of Blocking:** Understand network activity even if content is blocked by DNS, browser or extensions, because uBO Scope taps into the browser's native `webRequest` reporting.
- **Accurate Privacy Insight:** Focus on the actual number of distinct third-party servers contacted, not just block counts or misleading webpage tests.
- **Filter List Maintenance:** Auditors can verify filter effectiveness in environments without developer tools, supporting more reliable filter improvements.
- **Debunk Myths & Misunderstandings:** Clarify common misconceptions around block counts and unreliable ad blocker test pages.

## Target Users & Their Goals

### Privacy-Minded Individuals

If your goal is to safeguard your online privacy, uBO Scope gives you direct insight into the extent of third-party tracking attempts. Instead of guessing or relying solely on blocklist metrics, see the actual domains involved and how many times connections are attempted or blocked.

### Power Users Evaluating Content Blockers

Are you comparing content blockers based on block counts or test pages? uBO Scope shifts the focus to what really matters — the number of distinct third-party servers contacted. This helps you accurately assess which blocker truly limits exposure rather than just inflates block numbers.

### Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining effective filter lists is challenging, especially on devices or platforms without access to browser developer tools. uBO Scope provides a simple and reliable way to audit the impact of filter lists by exposing network requests and their outcomes, even when traditional inspection options are not available.

## Practical Use Cases

### Monitoring Privacy Leakage

Visit a news website and open uBO Scope to review all third-party connections initiated — from ad networks to analytics providers. Instantly identify unexpected or suspicious domains and decide to tighten your blocking accordingly.

### Comparing Blocker Effectiveness

Test different content blockers by observing their impact on network connections with uBO Scope. Despite one blocker showing a higher block count, uBO Scope might reveal it lets through more unique third-party servers, guiding your choice towards the true privacy winner.

### Auditing on Restricted Platforms

On mobile browsers or limited environments where dev tools are absent, use uBO Scope as your auditor's eyes. Export connection data or examine the popup to verify filter rules and detect possible filter failures or blind spots.

### Debunking False Positives from Blocker Test Sites

Instead of relying on *ad blocker test* webpages, which fabricate unrealistic scenarios, use uBO Scope to see live, real-world network activity. This practical approach avoids misjudging blockers due to artificial tests.

## How uBO Scope Adds Value Compared to Alternatives

- **Block Counts vs. Connection Counts:** Many blockers' badges report block counts, which can be artificially inflated and misleading. uBO Scope's badge reports the number of distinct third-party servers contacted without bias.
- **Complete Data on Stealth Blocking:** uBO Scope distinguishes between allowed, stealth-blocked (redirected or silently blocked), and outright blocked connections, offering deeper clarity.
- **Works Across Content Blocking Layers:** Even if your content is blocked by DNS-level or stealthy extension-level filters, uBO Scope reflects what the browser reports at the network level.

---

## Tips for Maximizing Value

- **Regularly Check the Popup:** Use the popup display to get a categorized overview of `Allowed`, `Stealth-Blocked`, and `Blocked` third-party domains for the active tab.
- **Interpret Badge Counts Wisely:** A lower badge count means fewer distinct third-party connections; aim to minimize it for better privacy.
- **Combine with Other Tools:** Use uBO Scope alongside content blockers to see what they actually block or miss.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Look forward to upcoming features that will allow more detailed inspection of requests for fine-grained auditing.

## Common Scenarios & Examples

### Scenario 1: Unexpected Third-Party Connections

You visit an e-commerce site and notice via uBO Scope several connections to domains you don't recognize. This insight prompts you to investigate further and adjust your filter lists or privacy settings.

### Scenario 2: Comparing Two Content Blockers

You switch from one content blocker to another and see lower block counts but the badge number in uBO Scope increases. This signals that although fewer requests are shown as blocked, more unique third-party servers are contacted, highlighting the new blocker allows more connections.

### Scenario 3: Mobile Browser Limitations

Without developer tools on mobile, you install uBO Scope and quickly validate which third-party servers still connect despite your filters, helping you tune your blocking strategy.
