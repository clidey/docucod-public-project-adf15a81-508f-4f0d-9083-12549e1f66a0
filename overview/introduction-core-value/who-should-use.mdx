# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

uBO Scope serves a diverse set of users unified by a common goal: gaining clear, actionable insights into the remote third-party connections your browser makes while you surf the web. This page profiles the primary user groups and maps out the practical scenarios where uBO Scope empowers more informed decisions and better control over digital privacy.

## Privacy-Conscious Individuals

If you care deeply about your digital footprint and want transparency into the invisible network connections your browser initiates, uBO Scope is designed for you. Rather than guessing which third-party servers are communicating behind the scenes, you get precise reporting on the distinct remote servers connected to by every page.

### What You Gain:

- **Clear visibility on third-party domains:** Know exactly how many distinct remote servers your browser touches, helping you evaluate tracking or unwanted resource loading.
- **Empowerment to reduce exposure:** Use the insights to refine your existing content blockers or privacy settings more effectively.
- **Badge count as a privacy metric:** The toolbar icon’s badge shows the number of unique remote servers your current browsing session reached, encouraging you to maintain a lower, safer number.

### Real-World Scenarios:

- Browsing sites known for heavy ad or tracker presence and verifying if your blockers work as expected.
- Testing different privacy configurations or new firewall/DNS settings to detect any unseen connections.
- Gaining peace of mind by confirming that only necessary connections are established.

## Filter List Maintainers and Content Blocker Developers

Those who curate or test content blocking filter lists gain a reliable tool to validate blocking effectiveness and uncover stealthy connections.

### Why uBO Scope Helps You:

- **Uncompromised reporting:** It tracks network requests regardless of blocking methods—including extensions’ stealth techniques or DNS-level blocking—provided the browser’s `webRequest` API exposes them.
- **Accurate third-party connection insight:** Unlike some metrics that count blocked requests but don’t reveal unique remote endpoints, uBO Scope reports distinct server counts helping maintainers prioritize filters.
- **Myth busting support:** It offers factual data to dispel misleading claims based on block counts or unreliable ad blocker test sites.

### Use Cases:

- Quickly assessing whether your filtering rules reduce the number of remote third-party connections effectively.
- Diagnosing filter leaks where connections are allowed despite intended blocking.
- Comparing variations of filter lists or new blocking technologies in realistic browsing scenarios.

## Content Blocker Evaluators and Researchers

Researchers analyzing or comparing different content blockers will find uBO Scope invaluable to objectify network connection behaviors based on unique remote server counts rather than ambiguous block metrics.

### Benefits:

- **Consistent, cross-browser network visibility:** Works with Chromium, Firefox, and Safari, offering a common baseline understanding.
- **Focus on distinct remote servers:** Helps avoid the misleading intuition that more blocked requests mean better blocking.
- **Helps reveal real-world impact:** By showing actual third-party server contacts, it supports a better evaluation of privacy impact.

### Typical Workflows:

- Running comprehensive tests with multiple content blockers and observing the unique remote server connections for the same web setup.
- Educating users and developers on realistic privacy measurement and debunking flawed ad blocker test pages.
- Documenting and reporting on content blocker effectiveness in real browsing conditions.

## Summary: How These Groups Benefit Collectively

Ultimately, uBO Scope serves users who want to understand and control the web’s hidden network activity pragmatically and reliably. It provides a universal lens to measure third-party exposure, helping users, developers, and evaluators focus on what truly matters: the unique remote servers contacted by their browsing sessions.

## Pro Tips for All Users

- **Interpret the toolbar badge wisely:** A lower number means fewer distinct remote servers connected, which is generally better for privacy.
- **Use alongside content blockers:** uBO Scope complements blockers but does not block connections by itself.
- **Check popup categories:** Analyze allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third parties in the popup for granular insights.
- **Avoid relying on block counts alone:** Focus on unique server counts to gauge real privacy impact.
