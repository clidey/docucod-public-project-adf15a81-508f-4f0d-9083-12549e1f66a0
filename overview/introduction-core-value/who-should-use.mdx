# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Discover why uBO Scope is an essential tool tailored for privacy-conscious users, filter list maintainers, researchers, and anyone interested in uncovering the true nature of third-party network activity during web browsing. This page highlights who benefits most from its insights and lays out the practical use cases where uBO Scope powers informed decisions and deeper awareness.

## Unlocking Transparency for Privacy-Focused Users

If you value your online privacy and want a clear window into how websites interact with external servers, uBO Scope is made for you. It demystifies the opaque world behind the scenes, showing exactly which remote servers your browser contacts — blocked or allowed — regardless of any content blocking extensions or DNS-level filters. 

### User Goals:

- See precisely which third-party domains your browser connects to while visiting any website.
- Understand the effectiveness of your privacy tools by observing the actual network outcomes.
- Identify unexpected or unwanted connections that might compromise your privacy.

### Why uBO Scope Matters for You:

- **True visibility:** Unlike traditional content blockers that only show what they blocked, uBO Scope reveals *all* attempts to connect, highlighting potential privacy leaks.
- **Independence from blockers:** Reports the real network picture regardless of filtering method or browser nuances.
- **Actionable insights:** Helps you adjust your privacy settings or blockers based on real-world data.

## Empowering Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining effective filter lists requires continuous observation of the evolving web ecosystem. uBO Scope serves as a precision instrument to understand and validate how well your filters work — especially on devices or environments with limited access to developer tools.

### What You Can Achieve:

- **Identify missed connections:** Spot domains or requests slipping through current blocking rules.
- **Verify stealth blocking:** Confirm obscure or stealth-based blocking techniques by content blockers.
- **Cross-check and compare lists:** Validate the comparative effectiveness of different filter lists or blocking strategies.

### Benefits:

- A minimal, focused extension providing concise connection data without overhead.
- Access to connection outcomes even on restricted environments (e.g., locked-down browsers).
- Planned upcoming features aimed specifically at filter list authors for deeper detail.

## Supporting Researchers and Analysts

For researchers who analyze web tracking, online behavior, or network infrastructure, uBO Scope provides an indispensable real-time lens into third-party connections.

### Use Cases:

- **Privacy audits:** Rapidly assess sites for third-party leakage or abusive tracking.
- **Content blocker studies:** Objectively measure the real impact of blockers by focusing on servers contacted, not block counts.
- **Filter effectiveness validation:** Ensure community-maintained lists are actually stopping connections as intended.

## Insight for Anyone Investigating Third-Party Network Activity

If you’re curious about how websites weave third-party services into their content delivery — whether for ads, analytics, CDN, or other purposes — uBO Scope presents the full network landscape.

### Common Scenarios:

- Compare two content blockers by examining actual server connections made through your browsing sessions.
- Investigate suspicious network behavior or unexpected connections while visiting familiar websites.
- Validate claims made by content blockers or network filters around connection blocking.

## Making Sense of uBO Scope’s Value

With many tools claiming to enhance privacy, it’s easy to get misled by superficial block counts or unreliable tests. uBO Scope cuts through these illusions by reporting raw connection data — giving you the real story on third-party reach.

- **Not just block counts:** A lower number of distinct third-party connections means truly better privacy protection.
- **Bypassing fake benchmarks:** Ignore ad-blocker test pages that simulate unrealistic network behaviors.
- **Independent validation:** Get trusted evidence of network outcomes regardless of which content blockers or DNS filters are active.

## Practical Tips

- Review the popup panel often to monitor connection counts and categories: blocked, stealth-blocked, and allowed.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blockers to get a fuller picture of network activity.
- Share your observations when maintaining or suggesting filter list improvements.

<Note>
Keep in mind that while smaller numbers in uBO Scope’s reports generally reflect stronger privacy, some legitimate services (like CDNs) may appear as third parties. Judging connections contextually ensures the best user decisions.
