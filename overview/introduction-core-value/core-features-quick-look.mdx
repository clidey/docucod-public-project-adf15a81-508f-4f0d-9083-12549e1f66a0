# Core Features at a Glance

Discover the essential capabilities of uBO Scope that effortlessly bring visibility to your web browsing connections. This page highlights how uBO Scope categorizes network requests, offers detailed reporting on remote connections, and provides real-time badge counts—all designed to empower you in everyday privacy monitoring and analysis.

---

## Instant Visualization of Network Request Outcomes

uBO Scope classifies all network requests made by your browser into three distinct categories:

- **Allowed:** Requests that successfully connected to remote servers.
- **Blocked:** Requests that were prevented from reaching remote servers.
- **Stealth-Blocked (Invisible):** Requests quietly blocked via redirects or stealth mechanisms.

This categorization helps you immediately understand which third-party connections your browser is making, which it is blocking, and which requests are suppressed in less visible ways.

### How You See This

Within the popup panel, domains are grouped under clearly labeled sections:

- **Not Blocked:** Lists all allowed domains your browser connected to.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Displays domains whose requests were stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked:** Shows domains where requests were explicitly blocked.

Each domain entry shows how many connections have occurred, giving a quantitative view of remote resource usage.

> _Example: When loading a news website, you might see a handful of allowed domains chiefly for content delivery, while numerous ad or tracking domains appear under blocked or stealth-blocked, providing transparency you cannot get elsewhere._

## Comprehensive Reporting of Remote Connections

uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to track and report all remote connection attempts made by web pages, regardless of your content blocker or DNS-level filtering. This complete insight reveals the true picture of network activity including:

- Third-party domains contacted
- Requests allowed despite blockers
- Requests redirected or failed

This is crucial for privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers who want an unbiased, precise understanding of third-party data flows.

## Real-Time Toolbar Badge Indicator

The extension icon badge displays the count of distinct third-party remote servers connected to by the active tab in real time. Key points about the badge:

- It counts **distinct** domains — avoiding inflated counts due to repeated requests to the same server.
- A **lower badge count** generally indicates better privacy, as it means fewer third-party remote connections.
- The number updates dynamically as you browse, providing immediate feedback.

This immediate visual feedback helps you quickly assess site privacy without diving into detailed panels.

## Designed for Daily Privacy and Analysis Tasks

Whether you are simply curious about which domains your browser is connecting to, auditing privacy exposure, or debugging filter rules, uBO Scope puts the essential network request information front and center.

- Identify unexpected third-party trackers or ads being allowed through.
- Confirm that your content blockers are effectively blocking unwanted connections.
- Understand stealth blocking - normally hidden from ordinary tools.

### Practical User Flow

1. Click the uBO Scope icon after loading a webpage.
2. Observe the badge for the count of distinct third-party connections.
3. Open the popup panel to see categorized detailed lists.
4. Analyze which domains are allowed and which are blocked to make informed privacy decisions.

## Tips for Success

- Remember, not all third-party servers are harmful; CDNs and essential services may appear as allowed with good reason.
- A high number on the badge could indicate either more third parties or less effective blocking.
- Use this page alongside other guides like 'Auditing and Reducing Third-Party Connections' to deepen your analysis.

## Common Pitfalls

- Relying solely on block counts in other content blocker badges can be misleading. uBO Scope focuses on _distinct third-party servers_ to give clarity.
- Assuming ad blocker test sites provide accurate results is a mistake — uBO Scope helps reveal realistic connection data.

## Code Example: Using Domain Counts

```javascript
// Example: Interpret allowed domains count for a tab
browser.runtime.sendMessage({ what: 'getTabData', tabId: currentTab.id }).then(serializedData => {
    const tabData = deserialize(serializedData);
    console.log('Allowed third-party domains count:', tabData.allowed.domains.size);
});
```
