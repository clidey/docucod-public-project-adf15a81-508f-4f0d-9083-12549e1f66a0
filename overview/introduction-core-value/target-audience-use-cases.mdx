# Target Audience & Use Cases

uBO Scope is designed to deliver clear, actionable transparency about the network connections your browser makes when loading webpages. Understanding exactly who benefits most from uBO Scope and the scenarios where it adds unique value will help you unlock its potential effectively.

## Who Should Use uBO Scope?

### Filter List Maintainers
Filter list maintainers need precise, evidence-based insights into the actual network requests that webpages generate. uBO Scope:
- Provides direct observation of third-party remote servers contacted, regardless of the filters or blockers in place.
- Helps validate the effectiveness of filter rules beyond mere block counts.
- Offers data independent of content blocking methods, including DNS-based blocking.

This makes uBO Scope an indispensable tool for maintainers to ensure their lists genuinely reduce third-party tracking and resource loading.

### Privacy-Conscious Users
If you care deeply about digital privacy and want to understand which third parties your browser connects to, uBO Scope offers:
- Real-time visibility of all network requests — both allowed and blocked.
- An accurate count of distinct third-party servers, giving a meaningful metric of your exposure.
- Insight into stealth-blocked connections which may bypass typical content blocker detection.

This empowers you to assess your privacy posture and take informed action.

### Curious Web Users and Researchers
Anyone interested in web security, networking, or how sites operate behind the scenes can use uBO Scope to:
- Analyze how websites utilize third-party services.
- Study different browsing configurations and their impact on network connections.
- Verify claims about content blockers, including debunking common myths.

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. Validating Filter Efficiency
Filter list block counts alone are an unreliable metric for filter performance or privacy protection. Using uBO Scope, you can:
- Confirm the actual number of unique third-party servers your browser connected with while visiting a site.
- Detect stealth connections that filters may miss but still load resources.
- Compare different blocker configurations by directly measuring network exposure.

_Example:_ A filter maintainer testing a new rule can open uBO Scope to verify the rule reduces distinct third-party domains, not just block counts.

### 2. Verifying Browser Privacy Settings
If you suspect your browser's privacy features or extensions aren't working as intended, uBO Scope helps you verify what connections actually occur:
- Track all outgoing third-party connections per tab in real time.
- Identify unexpected or excessive server contacts even with blockers enabled.
- Gain confidence that your privacy tools are effectively minimizing third-party reach.

_Example:_ A user comparing browsers or extensions can use uBO Scope's badge count and popup details to evaluate which setup offers better privacy.

### 3. Analyzing Third-Party Requests on Websites
Understanding a website's third-party footprint can clarify its privacy impact or troubleshoot network-related issues:
- See allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains separated clearly.
- Examine counts of requests per third party for a nuanced picture.
- Identify legitimate third parties (e.g., CDN providers) versus potential trackers or ads.

_Example:_ A security researcher auditing a website can profile its external contact points to assess tracking and data leakage risks.

### 4. Debunking Content Blocker Myths
Many users incorrectly rely on block count badges from blockers to judge their efficacy. uBO Scope:
- Offers an independent network-focused perspective.
- Reveals how a higher block count does not necessarily imply better blocking.
- Educates users on real-world blockers’ stealth techniques that fake block count impressions.

_Example:_ A blogger writing about privacy tools can use uBO Scope data to demonstrate why some ad blocker test pages don’t reflect actual browsing privacy.

## Example Workflow: Checking Third-Party Connections on a Webpage

1. Install uBO Scope and open a website you want to analyze.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to view the popup.
3. Observe the badge number indicating distinct third-party servers contacted.
4. In the popup, browse the "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked" sections to see domains categorized by connection outcome.
5. Use this information to decide if your content blocker or privacy settings are effective.

### Code Snippet: Accessing Tab Data

For users interested in integrating or extending insights, uBO Scope provides a message API to fetch current tab data:

```javascript
browser.runtime.sendMessage({ what: 'getTabData', tabId: yourTabId }).then(response => {
  const tabDetails = deserialize(response);
  console.log(tabDetails);
});
```

This enables programmatic analysis of allowed, stealth, and blocked domains per tab.
