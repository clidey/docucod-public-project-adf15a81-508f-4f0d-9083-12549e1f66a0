## Debunking Common Misconceptions with uBO Scope

### Myth: "Higher Block Counts Mean a Better Content Blocker"

uBO Scope reveals the truth: a high block count can actually reflect more third-party requests allowed initially, instead of effective blocking. The real indicator is the tally of distinct third-party servers that deliver resources — the lower, the better for privacy.

### Myth: "Ad Blocker Test Pages Show Accurate Blocking"

Such test sites often simulate unusual request patterns that don’t mirror real websites. uBO Scope tracks actual browser network activity, exposing the limitations of synthetic tests and fostering realistic evaluations.
