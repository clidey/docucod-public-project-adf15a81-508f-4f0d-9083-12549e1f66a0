# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Understanding who benefits most from uBO Scope is key to unlocking its full potential. Whether you're vigilant about your privacy, developing or maintaining web filter lists, or evaluating the effectiveness of content blockers, uBO Scope offers practical insights tailored for your needs.

## Introduction: Tailored for Privacy-Conscious Users and Professionals

uBO Scope is designed to empower users with transparent, accurate visibility into the external connections their browser makes while loading web pages. This snapshot of real network activity helps you understand what third-party domains your browser talks to — information often obscured or misrepresented by traditional content blockers.

### Why This Matters:
- **See beyond simple block counts:** The extension focuses on *distinct third-party remote servers actually contacted* rather than just tallying blocked resource counts.
- **Accurate underlying data:** Detects network requests at the browser level via the `webRequest` API, showing what truly reaches your device (or is stealthily blocked).
- **Clear distinction of connection outcomes:** uBO Scope categorizes servers as allowed, stealth-blocked (blocked but hidden from the website), or fully blocked.

## Primary Users and Use Cases

### 1. Privacy-minded Users

**Goal:** Understand and monitor what third-party servers your browser communicates with to protect your online footprint.

Typical scenarios:
- Visit websites and instantly see how many and which third-party servers you connect to.
- Verify that privacy tools and content blockers are genuinely reducing unseen third-party contacts.
- Detect suspicious or unexpected connections for further investigation.

*Example:* Alice regularly browses news sites but worries about trackers silently collecting data. With uBO Scope, she can see every third-party remote server connected to during her browsing session, helping her make informed privacy decisions and adjust her blockers accordingly.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers

**Goal:** Analyze real-world network requests to improve blocklists by gaining detailed insight about domains involved in web transactions.

Typical scenarios:
- Identify domains involved in network requests on various websites for crafting or refining filter rules.
- Verify the impact of filter updates by monitoring changes in connected domains.
- Use data from devices with limited debugging tools where access to developer consoles or network logs is restricted.

*Example:* Bob maintains an adblock filter list and needs to verify that recent changes actually reduce the number of distinct third-party servers reached by popular websites. He uses uBO Scope to gather these insights precisely and efficiently without relying on browser dev tools.

### 3. Evaluators and Analysts of Content Blocking Solutions

**Goal:** Assess the effectiveness of content blockers by monitoring the real third-party connections allowed or blocked.

Typical scenarios:
- Compare how different content blockers affect third-party network connections beyond block counters.
- Debunk common myths around block counts by showing actual server connections.
- Validate content blocker stealth modes by observing stealth-blocked outcomes.

*Example:* Caitlyn is testing extension-based blockers. Using uBO Scope, she discovers that a higher block count badges does not always mean fewer third-party connections, clarifying misconceptions prevalent in blocker performance comparisons.

## Illustrated Use Cases

### Everyday Scenario: Quick Privacy Check

When visiting your favorite website, simply click the uBO Scope extension icon to view a categorized list of all third-party domains contacted. The badge count reflects the total number of distinct third-party servers reached, offering instant awareness without complex setup.

### Advanced Scenario: Filter List Refinement

Filter list maintainers can use uBO Scope data over various sessions and sites to detect domains frequently contacted despite filters, then update lists accordingly. The extension's classification into allowed, stealth, and blocked categories improves targeting and understanding of network behaviors.

### Analytical Scenario: Content Blocker Evaluation

Before switching content blockers, evaluators open uBO Scope to capture the number of distinct servers accessed. After switching, a fresh snapshot reveals whether the new blocker reduces third-party network exposure or if apparent block counts mislead.

## Practical Tips for Users

- **Monitor regular browsing:** Use uBO Scope as a companion to your favorite content blocker to verify its real-world privacy impact.
- **Investigate unfamiliar domains:** If you spot odd or unexpected domains, research their reputation to enhance your privacy stance.
- **For maintainers:** Leverage uBO Scope insights before updating filter lists to avoid unintended side effects or leaks.
- **Evaluate stealth blocking:** Understand that stealth-blocked domains are those blocked invisibly—use this to detect advanced tracker blocking.

## Common Pitfalls and How uBO Scope Helps

- **Mistaking block counts for effectiveness:** Many assume a blocker with a higher block count is superior; uBO Scope shows that the count of distinct third-party servers is the true privacy metric.
- **Relying on fabricated test pages:** ‘Ad blocker test’ sites produce unrealistic network requests; uBO Scope reveals real-world network activity, providing trustworthy data.
- **Limited debugging on some devices:** When dev tools are unavailable, uBO Scope offers visibility into network connections unobtainable otherwise.

## Summary

uBO Scope bridges the gap between user curiosity and technical insights by revealing the full picture of third-party network connections. It stands apart as a precise, browser-level measurement tool that benefits privacy enthusiasts, filter list maintainers, and content blocker evaluators alike.
