# Target Audience & Use Cases

uBO Scope was purpose-built with a specific set of users and scenarios in mind. Understanding who benefits the most from this tool—as well as why and how—is key to unlocking its full potential.

---

## Who Is uBO Scope For?

- **Privacy-Focused Users:** Individuals who want transparent, detailed insights into every remote server their browser attempts to connect to. This empowers better-informed decisions about their digital footprint and enhances online privacy awareness.

- **Filter List Maintainers:** Experts and volunteers who curate content-blocking filter lists gain an independent, device-agnostic view of network requests. This helps refine blocking efficacy, spot evasion attempts, and improve list quality especially on browsers or devices with limited developer tools.

- **Web Developers & Security Researchers:** Those who need to analyze third-party resource loading patterns, verify network-level blocking, or debug stealthy redirection and blocking outcomes.

---

## Why Does This Matter?

Today’s webpages often load content from dozens of third-party domains—advertisers, trackers, CDNs, analytics, and more. Typical ad-blocking metrics like raw block counts fall short in revealing the true exposure:

- **Debunking Misleading Metrics:** A higher block count does *not* mean better privacy or blocking performance. uBO Scope shifts the focus to *distinct third-party connections allowed*, providing a clearer signal of actual network exposure.

- **Unmasking Stealthy Connections:** Some network requests are redirected or stealthily blocked by content blockers, behaviors not visible in usual blocking stats. uBO Scope exposes these nuanced outcomes.

- **Supporting Filter List Tuning:** On devices with limited browser developer console access (e.g., mobile or sandboxed environments), uBO Scope supplies crucial connection visibility, helping list maintainers track filter effectiveness remotely.

## Primary Use Cases

### 1. Real-World Analysis of Remote Server Connections

Imagine visiting your favorite news site. With uBO Scope:

- You can instantly see how many unique third-party domains the page tries to connect with.
- The popup categorizes these connections as **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked**, painting a precise picture of real network requests.

This immediate visibility helps you spot unnecessary trackers or unexpected connections in real browsing scenarios.

### 2. Debunking Misleading Ad-Block Statistics

Many users rely on block count stats from content blockers or test pages.

- uBO Scope proves that higher block counts can coincide with *more* third-party unique connections, contradicting superficial assumptions that more blocks equal better blocking.
- Trusted filter list maintainers use these insights to communicate clearer privacy performance messages.

### 3. Empowering Filter List Maintainers on Limited Tools

Maintainers often work on devices without full browser devtools capabilities.

- uBO Scope operates independently of the browser’s UI, reporting outcomes reliably through webRequest APIs.
- It provides a lightweight, accessible way to monitor network requests and evaluate rules’ impact without complex toolchains.

## Typical User Journey

1. **Install uBO Scope** in your preferred browser (Chromium, Firefox, Safari).
2. Navigate to any website.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon in your toolbar.
4. See an instant badge count reflecting distinct third-party domains allowed.
5. Open the popup panel to explore detailed breakdowns:
   - *Allowed:* Connections successfully made.
   - *Stealth-Blocked:* Requests redirected or silently blocked.
   - *Blocked:* Requests actively blocked with errors.
6. Use these insights to adjust your browsing habits, tweak filters, or contribute filter list improvements.

## Best Practices

- **Use uBO Scope Regularly:** Make it part of your privacy toolkit to observe connections on diverse sites.

- **Combine With Content Blockers:** Use alongside uBlock Origin or similar tools to validate their effect.

- **Leverage for Filter Tuning:** If maintaining or testing filter lists, use uBO Scope to track subtle changes in network connections.

- **Beware of Overinterpretation:** Not all connections imply malicious intent; many legitimate third-party services use CDN domains.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Misreading the Badge Count:** The badge shows allowed distinct third-party domains, *not* total requests or block counts.

- **Expecting Full Network Coverage:** Connections outside browser `webRequest` API visibility (e.g., native OS apps, non-web requests) are not reported.

- **Using Ad-Block Test Pages as Benchmarks:** Such pages don’t reflect real-world browsing or blocker behavior; rely on uBO Scope for authentic measurement.
