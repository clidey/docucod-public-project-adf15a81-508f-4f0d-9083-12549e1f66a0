# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Understanding who benefits most from uBO Scope is key to unlocking its full potential. This page identifies the primary audiences for uBO Scope, illustrating practical scenarios and real-world value. Whether you are a privacy advocate, a user comparing content blockers, a filter list maintainer, or someone interested in debunking myths around blocking effectiveness, uBO Scope provides clear, actionable insights.

## Privacy-Conscious Individuals

If you care about your online privacy, uBO Scope is an indispensable tool. Webpages often attempt connections to numerous third-party domains, many of which track or serve ads. uBO Scope exposes these connections, grouping them into:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully made
- **Blocked:** Connections actively blocked
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections blocked in ways that evade detection by webpages

By monitoring these categories, privacy-conscious users can detect unexpected or excessive third-party connections and better understand their browsing footprint.

**Real-World Example:**

Imagine visiting your favorite news site and opening uBO Scope’s popup. You immediately see the number of distinct third-party domains your browser contacted, including which were blocked and which snuck through stealthily. This empowers you to make informed decisions about expanding or tightening your content blocker.

## Users Comparing Content Blockers

Many users wrestle with how to effectively compare ad-blocking or privacy tools. uBO Scope clarifies common misconceptions:

- A **higher block count badge** does NOT necessarily mean better blocking. It can indicate that more network requests were made in the first place.
- Counting **distinct third-party domains allowed** reveals which tool truly reduces your exposure.

Using uBO Scope alongside different content blockers, users can evaluate which one better minimizes third-party connections in a transparent, data-driven way.

**Practical Tip:**

Use uBO Scope on the same sites when switching blockers. Compare the distinct third-party domain counts shown in the popup badge to assess real-world effectivity.

## Filter List Maintainers and Privacy Researchers

Maintaining or improving filter lists is complex and requires clear feedback on effectiveness. uBO Scope acts as a lightweight diagnostic tool:

- Transparently reports all remote server connections that browsers attempt or successfully complete.
- Shows stealth blocking — the subtle blocking methods filter lists might trigger that aren’t obvious from standard tools.
- Records domain-level counts, helping to identify prevalent and problematic third-party servers.

This empowers maintainers to fine-tune blocking rules, benchmark list improvements, and track stealth behaviors across different platforms.

**Use Case:**

When testing new filter rules, a maintainer can observe how server connections change in uBO Scope, helping verify if stealth blocking rules behave as intended.

- **Myth:** “Ad blocker test” websites provide accurate reliability metrics.

uBO Scope gives users a clear lens to dispel these myths by showing actual network connection counts—unaffected by artificial test scenarios or misleading badge metrics.

By relying on uBO Scope’s data, users become more informed about the real impact of privacy tools.
