# Why Use uBO Scope?

Discover the core value of uBO Scope, a powerful yet lightweight browser extension designed to bring unprecedented transparency to your web browsing experience. Whether you're a casual user curious about where your data travels, a privacy advocate demanding clarity, or a filter list maintainer working behind the scenes, uBO Scope empowers you to see and understand all third-party network requests a webpage attempts or makes — no matter which content blocker or DNS service you use.

## Unlock Transparency in Web Connections

uBO Scope shines in slicing through the complexity and often-hidden nature of third-party network requests. Many users assume that having a content blocker or private DNS means they fully control or understand the remote servers their browser contacts. However, uBO Scope reveals the full story by tracking all outgoing network connections originating from your browsing session, categorizing them by their outcome (allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked).

This transparency lets you:

- Identify exactly which domains your browser communicates with on every site
- Understand requests invisible to standard developer tools or content blockers
- Evaluate the effectiveness of your content blocking or DNS setups


## Core Benefits Tailored to Your Needs

- **For Everyday Users:** Gain insight into hidden trackers, ads, or unwanted connections on sites you visit. See who's quietly collecting information or serving adverts behind the scenes.
- **For Privacy Advocates:** Validate that blocking tools are effective and spot unexpected data leaks or stealthy redirects across domains.
- **For Filter List Maintainers:** Analyze real-world network outcomes to refine rule sets, ensuring that blocking is precise without unintended site breakage.


## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Validating Content Blockers
You activate uBO Scope alongside your favorite blocker. Instantly, you see a categorized list of domains contacted by the page — including those stealth-blocked or outright blocked. This confirms that your blocking setup works as intended and identifies hidden connections needing further blocking.

### 2. Investigating Privacy Concerns
After visiting a news site, you notice multiple third-party domains contacted that you didn’t expect. uBO Scope helps you uncover trackers or analytics services your content blocker missed, informing you whether to tighten your protection.

### 3. Supporting Filter List Development
Filter maintainers monitor live browsing sessions with uBO Scope to see which network requests evade filters or trigger false positives, enabling informed decisions to improve filter accuracy.

## How uBO Scope Delivers Transparency

Behind its simplicity, uBO Scope logs all relevant requests that your browser attempts to make. It then categorizes them as:

- **Allowed:** Requests that completed successfully without being blocked.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked by content blockers or privacy tools.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that were redirected, hidden, or failed in a way that typical tools may not reveal.

By presenting this data in a clear UI via its popup window, users instantly comprehend all outbound connections for individual browser tabs.
