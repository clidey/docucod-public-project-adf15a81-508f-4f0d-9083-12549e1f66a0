# Key Benefits & Value Proposition

## Discover Transparency in Third-Party Network Connections

uBO Scope is designed to empower you with clear, unbiased insight into the network behavior of the web pages you visit. Unlike traditional block counters or adblocker tests, it focuses on the **number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connects to**, providing a meaningful measure of privacy impact.

- **See the full landscape** of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections initiated by pages in real time.
- **Understand why fewer distinct third-party domains is better**, rather than simply counting the number of blocked requests.
- **Debunk misleading assumptions** about content blockers by showing actual network activity rather than artificial test cases.
- **Make informed privacy decisions** based on detailed connection data, helping you differentiate stealthy tracking from essential services.

This approach puts control back in your hands, offering clarity on the complexity of web tracking and content blocking.

## Why uBO Scope Matters

### Addressing Common Misconceptions About Adblockers

Most users rely on toolbar badge counts or adblock test pages to judge the effectiveness of their content blockers. uBO Scope challenges these flawed metrics by revealing:

- Not all block counts are equal: high block numbers can coincide with more third-party servers being contacted, which means less privacy.
- Adblock test pages often use fake or unrealistic requests, which do not reflect real-world connections.
- Many blockers exhibit _stealth blocking_, a subtle mode that prevents network requests without obvious blocking signals, which test pages and badges don’t account for.

### Revealing Actual Network Interactions

By monitoring real network requests at the browser API level, uBO Scope shows exactly which third-party connections were:

- **Allowed:** Successfully established connections that the browser made.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests internally blocked without disrupting webpage functionality or alerting detection mechanisms.
- **Blocked:** Explicitly denied or failed requests.

This comprehensive visibility helps you differentiate between legitimate third-party services and tracking or unwanted connections.

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Curious Privacy Advocates:** Gain full visibility over the third parties connecting during your browsing sessions.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Leverage uBO Scope's detailed connection data to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of blocking rules.
- **Advanced Users and Developers:** Verify how content blockers behave under different conditions and ensure blockers are not just blocking more requests but reducing distinct third-party connections.

## Before and After Using uBO Scope

| Scenario                                | Without uBO Scope                  | With uBO Scope                          |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Measuring Privacy Impact                 | Reliance on block count badges     | Insight into distinct third-party domains |
| Evaluating Content Blockers             | Trusting adblock test sites         | Understanding stealth blocking and network realities |
| Making Informed Decisions About Blocking| Guesswork and myths                 | Data-driven decisions based on actual network requests |

## Quantifiable Benefits

- **Time Savings:** Quickly assess privacy impact without manual inspection or misleading test pages.
- **Increased Confidence:** Validate blocker performance based on real network activity.
- **Smarter Privacy Management:** Focus on reducing unique third-party domains instead of chasing high block counts.

## Summary

uBO Scope provides a clear, transparent view into your browser’s third-party network connections, challenging common myths around adblocking and offering a meaningful metric for privacy: the number of distinct third-party domains connected.

## How It Works at a Glance

The extension tracks network requests using browser APIs and categorizes them into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked outcomes. It then presents this data in an intuitive popup panel sorted by domain, helping you quickly grasp the real state of your browser’s network interactions.

## What You See in the Popup Panel

- **Hostname Display:** Shows the current active tab's hostname and domain.
- **Summary Section:** Displays the count of distinct connected domains.
- **Connection Categories:** Three sections list domains by connection status:
  - Allowed (green highlights)
  - Stealth-Blocked (red highlights)
  - Blocked (red highlights)


---

## Practical Tips

- Keep an eye on the badge count – a lower number usually means better privacy.
- Investigate domains in the stealth-blocked section to identify trackers silently prevented.
- Use uBO Scope alongside content blockers to validate blocking behavior.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t assume higher block counts equate to better protection.
- Avoid relying on adblock test pages to judge blocker effectiveness.
- Understand that some third-party connections (like CDNs) are legitimate and often necessary.

## Next Steps

Experience the value of uBO Scope firsthand by installing it from your browser’s extension store and opening the popup panel during browsing sessions. For installation details and walkthroughs, refer to the **Installation Instructions** and **Understanding the Popup Panel** guides.
