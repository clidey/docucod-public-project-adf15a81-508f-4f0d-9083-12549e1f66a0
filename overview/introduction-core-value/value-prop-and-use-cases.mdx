# Who Is It For and Why Use It?

uBO Scope is designed for a diverse audience, each sharing a common goal: to gain clear, actionable insight into the network connections your web browser makes. Whether you're an everyday privacy-conscious user, a filter list maintainer, or a technical evaluator, this page explains why uBO Scope matters to you and how it empowers your browsing experience.

## Audience Profiles

### 1. Everyday Privacy-Conscious Users

If you care about what third-party domains your browser contacts when you navigate the web, uBO Scope is your effortless window into these activities. It reveals every network connection a webpage attempts — blocked, allowed, or stealth-blocked — helping you understand who your browser is talking to behind the scenes.

*Benefit:* By visually seeing all third-party domains contacted, you can better assess how exposed your browsing session is to trackers, advertisers, and other entities. This empowers you to make informed decisions about privacy tools and browsing habits.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers

Filter list maintainers have the critical task of crafting rules that block unwanted or harmful content efficiently without breaking websites. uBO Scope delivers detailed, real-time visibility into network requests—showing not just successes, but failures and redirects as well.

*Benefit:* With uBO Scope, maintainers can validate their filter rules by observing unreachable, stealth-blocked, or allowed third-party servers. This sharpens filtering accuracy and helps in uncovering edge cases in network behavior.

### 3. Technical Evaluators & Security Researchers

For those who assess ad blockers, content blockers, or network privacy tools, uBO Scope is an independent measurement tool that clarifies the actual network connections—not just what a block badge or an adblock test page claims.

*Benefit:* It debunks common myths about block statistics and demonstrates real blocking efficacy by focusing on distinct third-party domains contacted, rather than misleading request counts.

## Why Use uBO Scope? Your User Journey

### Verify Real Third-Party Trackers

Imagine browsing a website you like but want to ensure minimal tracker exposure. Opening uBO Scope's popup reveals all third-party domains your browser tried to connect with while loading that page. You see: 

- Domains successfully contacted ('not blocked')
- Domains stealth-blocked (requests attempted but hidden from scripts)
- Domains fully blocked

This transparency reveals trackers or CDN domains at a glance, helping you understand privacy exposure accurately.

### Debunk Common Ad Blocker Myths

Many users mistakenly believe a higher block count means better privacy, or that "ad blocker test" sites represent real-world blocking. uBO Scope shows why these beliefs are flawed:

- Block count badges measure distinct allowed domains, not just count of blocked requests.
- High block counts can correspond to more third-party contacts, meaning less effective blocking overall.
- Ad blocker test pages create unrealistic network calls, which do not reflect daily browsing.

uBO Scope guides you to trust real-world domain connection data rather than misleading metrics.

### Observe Actual Blocking Outcomes Beyond Badges

Toolbar badges indicate the number of distinct third-party connections made—fewer is better. uBO Scope categorizes these into allowed, stealth, and blocked results, providing tangible data. For example, if a known tracker domain appears in the "allowed" section, you know your blocker missed it.

This empowers you to fine-tune your blocking setup or choose better filters, leading to measurable privacy improvements.

## Real-World Scenarios

- **You open a news website**: uBO Scope reveals several third-party domains contacting ad servers or analytics services. You decide to adjust your blocking setup.

- **You maintain a filter list**: Using uBO Scope while browsing shows that some tracker domains are still allowed through stealth redirects, prompting you to update your rules.

- **You compare blockers**: Instead of relying on block badges, you use uBO Scope to count actual distinct third-party domains each blocker allows or blocks, making more informed evaluations.

## Tips for Getting the Most from uBO Scope

- Remember, not all third-party connections are harmful; legitimate CDNs often appear and are low in number.
- Use the popup panel as your primary interface; it filters connections into categories for easy understanding.
- Regularly monitor the badge count in your toolbar as an immediate signal of third-party connections.
- Combine use of uBO Scope with solid privacy practices for comprehensive protection.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Do not equate a high block count badge with better blocking; focus on distinct third-party domains allowed.
- Avoid assuming stealth-blocked domains are fully invisible—uBO Scope clarifies what stealth-blocking means in practice.
- Do not rely solely on ad blocker test sites; real browsing behavior is what matters.

| Category          | Description                                         | Why It Matters                              |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked       | Domains your browser successfully connected to      | Legitimate or allowed third-party connections|
| Stealth-Blocked   | Connections attempted but hidden from scripts       | Tracking attempts that are obscured or bypass common detection|
| Blocked           | Domains where connection attempts were blocked      | Active enforcement of blocking rules               |


This categorization gives you a full spectrum view of network behavior per tab and webpage.

# Troubleshooting Common Situations

If uBO Scope does not display data:

- Ensure the extension has the necessary permissions.
- Your browser must support the webRequest API fully.
- Make sure the page you are browsing initiates network requests.

For filter list maintainers:

- Cross-check domain detection with other network monitoring tools.
- Understand that some 'stealth' requests may be invisible to standard debuggers.
