# Key Benefits and Value Proposition

## Understanding uBO Scope's Unique Value

uBO Scope is not just another network monitoring tool—it's designed with privacy enthusiasts, filter list maintainers, and everyday users in mind, providing an unprecedented level of transparency into the web's network activity. Unlike traditional content blockers that focus on counting blocked requests, uBO Scope tracks the *number of distinct third-party remote servers* contacted by web pages. This shift in focus offers a clearer, more meaningful metric to assess privacy exposure.

### Why Tracking Third-Party Remote Servers Matters

Most users and even some advanced users often default to block counts as the measure of a content blocker's effectiveness. uBO Scope challenges this approach by emphasizing the importance of the *distinct third-party remote server count* instead. Why? Because a high block count can be misleading:

- **Block counts do not differentiate between repeated requests to the same server and requests to multiple servers.**
- **Allowing connections to more third-party servers—even with a high block count—may result in greater privacy risk.**

By reporting how many unique third-party server domains your browser connects to, uBO Scope gives you the insight needed to truly understand your exposure beyond superficial block numbers.

## Key Value Propositions

- **Accurate Awareness of Network Exposure:** See exactly how many distinct third-party servers a webpage connects to, cutting through the noise of traditional block counts.

- **Bypass Block Count Myths:** Stop relying on misleading metrics and gain a deeper understanding of what content blockers are actually doing.

- **Cross-Blocking Transparency:** Works independently of which content blocker you use or whether blocking occurs at the browser, DNS, or network level, as long as the browser reports network requests.

- **Insight for Filter List Maintainers:** Provides actionable data on network connections, enabling maintainers to evaluate filter lists even on devices where developer tools are unavailable.

- **Stealth vs Blocked Reporting:** Differentiate between third parties that are blocked outright versus those stealthily blocked or allowed, shedding light on the true state of network requests.

## Benefits Explained Through Real-World Context

### Imagine You Are a Privacy-Conscious User

You visit a news website. Traditional blockers show you a block count of 20. Without uBO Scope, you might think your browser prevented connections to 20 potential trackers. But uBO Scope reveals that your browser actually connected to 7 distinct third-party servers. This transparency helps you understand the actual scope of exposure instead of relying on a potentially deceptive block number.

### For Filter List Maintainers

uBO Scope gives you a clear lens to examine the network requests happening behind the scenes. It helps identify which third-party servers are truly involved in content delivery or tracking, enabling you to refine filter lists and improve blocking rules.

### Everyday Use Cases

- Quickly assess how aggressive a content blocker is by viewing if it reduces the count of remote server connections.
- Identify stealthy connections that traditional blockers might block invisibly, helping detect trackers that evade detection.
- Understand network request behaviors on complex webpages loaded with multiple third-party resources.

## Debunking Common Myths

<u>Myth:</u> "A higher block count means better content blocking."

<u>Reality:</u> High block counts often correlate with allowing more third-party server connections, increasing privacy risks. uBO Scope helps you see beyond this to gauge the real effectiveness.

<u>Myth:</u> "Ad blocker test pages provide a reliable benchmark."

<u>Reality:</u> Those test pages use fabricated network requests not seen on real websites. uBO Scope helps avoid relying on unrealistic metrics, focusing instead on actual web behavior.

<Note>
<u>Important:</u> uBO Scope reports only requests visible through the browser's webRequest API. Some network requests made outside this API's scope cannot be tracked.

|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tracking distinct third-party servers | Get meaningful, actionable privacy metrics beyond block counts      |
| Independent of content blocker      | Provides transparency regardless of which blocker or DNS filtering is active |
| Visibility into stealth blocking     | Understand hidden blocking behaviors that prevent detection by webpages |
| Lightweight and simple to use       | Easy integration into daily browsing without overhead or configuration |

## How This Changes Your Browsing Experience

Before uBO Scope, you may have relied on superficial block counts or ad blocker test pages that misrepresent actual privacy risks. After installing uBO Scope, you gain a clear window into the actual third-party connections your browser makes, empowering you to make informed decisions about your blockers and filter lists.

## Getting the Most Out of uBO Scope

- Use the icon badge count to monitor the number of distinct third-party servers on any webpage; lower counts signify reduced exposure.
- Utilize the detailed popup interface to see categorized lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Combine insights from uBO Scope with your existing content blockers to optimize privacy without compromising browsing quality.

<Tip>
Regularly check uBO Scope’s counts and lists while browsing to develop an intuitive sense of how different sites respect your privacy – and adjust your blockers accordingly.
