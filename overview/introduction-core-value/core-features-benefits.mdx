# Core Features & Benefits of uBO Scope

Discover how uBO Scope empowers you with real-time insights into your browser's network activity. This page breaks down the essential capabilities that allow you to monitor connections, quantify unique remote servers, and gain accurate, impartial reporting — all designed with privacy advocates and filter maintainers in mind.

---

## Real-Time Connection Monitoring

**What It Means for You:**

uBO Scope continuously listens to your browser's web requests to report, as they happen, every connection attempt to remote servers. This live tracking means you're never in the dark about which third parties your browser talks to while browsing.

- **Why It Matters:** Being able to observe network connections in real time equips you to detect unexpected or suspicious third-party interactions immediately.
- **How It Works:** The extension hooks into browser `webRequest` APIs, capturing events of redirects, successful connections, and errors.

**Practical Scenario:**

Imagine loading a webpage and instantly seeing the extension’s badge count update as third-party servers engage — giving you transparent, ongoing feedback on your browsing exposure.

## Badge Count of Unique Remote Servers

**Clear and Actionable Summary:**

The badge on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser has connected to during the active tab session.

- **Real User Benefit:** By quantifying *unique* servers, it cuts through the noise of repeated requests to the same entities, giving you a concise measure of external connections.
- **What the Number Tells You:** A lower count suggests fewer third-party exposures, typically indicative of better privacy.

**Tip:** Use this badge count as a privacy health indicator, not just a raw tally. It complements other privacy tools by focusing on connections rather than blocked requests.

## Always-Accurate Reporting Regardless of Content Blockers or DNS Setup

**Reliable Transparency Across Complex Environments:**

uBO Scope's data integrity stands firm no matter which content blocker you use or whether DNS-level blocking is in effect.

- **Problem Solved:** Many content blockers obscure or interfere with reporting mechanisms, creating misleading stats. uBO Scope listens directly to the browser’s network layer.
- **What You Achieve:** Confidence that the connections you see represent actual network activity, not skewed by any filtering or DNS overrides.

**How This Benefits You:**

- Validates claims about block counts made by different extensions or tools.
- Exposes real third-party connections, helping debunk common misconceptions about content blocker performance.

## Deep Analysis Support for Filter Maintainers and Privacy Advocates

**Powerful Insights for Power Users:**

Beyond casual awareness, uBO Scope offers extensive data to those maintaining filter lists or auditing privacy.

- **Detailed Outcomes:** It categorizes connections into three outcomes:
  - **Allowed:** Connections that went through
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Connections blocked in a way that's transparent to the browser
  - **Blocked:** Explicitly stopped connections
- **Domain-Level Granularity:** Tracks connections at both hostname and domain levels, enabling precise analysis.

**Real-World Use Case:**

A filter maintainer can use uBO Scope to identify new third-party domains emerging on popular sites to update block lists effectively.
