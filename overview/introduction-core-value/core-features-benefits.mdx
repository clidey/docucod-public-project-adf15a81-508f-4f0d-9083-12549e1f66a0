# Core Features & Benefits of uBO Scope

Discover the unique capabilities of uBO Scope that empower you to oversee every connection your browser attempts while surfing the web. This page highlights the key features that differentiate uBO Scope, offering unparalleled transparency and accuracy compared to traditional content blocking metrics.

---

## Unlock Complete Visibility of Third-Party Connections

At its heart, uBO Scope is designed to reveal every connection attempt made by a webpage—to every remote server, especially third-party domains. Unlike many content blockers that simply show block counts, uBO Scope shows **which distinct third-party servers your browser interacts with**.

### Why Third-Party Connection Visibility Matters

Third-party connections are often the gateways through which your data is shared or tracked. By knowing exactly which third parties connect during page loads, you get a clear picture of your actual network exposure.

- **Badge Count on Toolbar Icon:** Reflects the **number of distinct third-party remote servers connected**, not just blocked requests.
- **Lower Counts Are Better:** Since legitimate third parties (like CDNs) are usually few, a low distinct count signals tighter privacy.

<u>Example:</u> If you visit an online news site, uBO Scope might tell you it connected to just 3 distinct third-party servers—such as the CDN, ads network, and analytics provider—so you can decide which, if any, you want to block or allow.

## Three Outcome Categories: Allowed, Stealth, Blocked

uBO Scope categorizes connection attempts into three clear groups, providing a deep understanding of network request outcomes beyond just blocked or allowed:

- **Not Blocked:** Connections successfully made.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests redirected or modified stealthily, reflecting the subtle work of content blockers avoiding webpage breakage.
- **Blocked:** Connections that were stopped entirely.

This helps distinguish between overt blocking and more covert techniques used by extensions and DNS filters.

---

## Independent Network Outcome Reporting

uBO Scope works independently of browser content blockers or DNS filters by using the browser's `webRequest` API:

- It reports on **all network requests made by webpages**, regardless of what content blocker is in use.
- It detects the actual **final outcome of network requests**: whether they succeeded, were stealthily redirected, or blocked outright.

This makes uBO Scope invaluable in understanding your real network footprint across any blocking mechanism.

---

## Busting Common Myths Around Ad Blocking Metrics

Many assume that higher block counts mean better blocking. uBO Scope dispels these misconceptions with facts:

- A high block count can reflect a content blocker that allows more unique third-party connections, thereby blocking less effectively.
- “Ad blocker test” webpages often give misleading results because they rely on artificial network conditions that don't represent real-world browsing.

<u>Pro Tip:</u> Focus on the **number of distinct third-party servers connected**, not block counts, when measuring privacy effectiveness.

## Real-World Use Cases for uBO Scope Features

1. **Privacy Enthusiasts:** Accurately monitor which third-party servers your browser is interacting with and adjust your blocking preferences accordingly.
2. **Filter List Maintainers:** Identify stealthy or unnoticed third-party connections to refine blocking rules and improve filter lists.
3. **Developers & Power Users:** Validate that privacy tools work as intended across complex network conditions.
4. **Content Blocker Evaluations:** Use uBO Scope’s independent reporting to objectively compare effectiveness beyond simplistic badge counters.

## How uBO Scope Helps You Gain Clarity Fast

- **Visual Interface:** The popup lists domains under allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked, with counts for each, providing intuitive insights.
- **Real-Time Badge Updates:** The toolbar badge dynamically reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains per active tab.
- **Accuracy:** Uses exact network request outcomes from the browser’s networking API.
- **Transparency:** No guessing games; you see what requests actually happened.

---

## Best Practices for Using Core Features

- Regularly check the badge count when browsing sensitive sites to track exposure.
- Use the detailed popup to identify unexpected third-party connections.
- Remember that not all third parties are harmful—some are essential infrastructure like CDN providers.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with your existing content blocker settings to optimize privacy.

---

## Summary

uBO Scope offers crystal-clear insights on remote server connections, revealing what traditional content blockers often miss—the true breadth of third-party connectivity. By categorizing connection outcomes distinctly and reporting independently of blocking filters, it puts you in control, helping you understand and minimize your digital footprint effectively.

# Example Toolbar Badge Insight

When browsing your favorite website, the toolbar icon shows a badge with the number “5”. This means your browser connected successfully to five distinct third-party domains.

Opening the uBO Scope popup reveals:

- **Not Blocked:** 3 domains (e.g., CDN, analytics, essential services)
- **Stealth-Blocked:** 1 domain (a request was stealthily redirected or suppressed)
- **Blocked:** 1 domain (completely blocked connection)

This data allows confident evaluation on what third-party connections are active behind the scenes.

# Technical Note

uBO Scope leverages browser `webRequest` listeners for complete network request reporting, including HTTP(s) and WebSocket connections where supported. It uses a public suffix list to accurately aggregate requests by domain, and updates data seamlessly as you browse.
