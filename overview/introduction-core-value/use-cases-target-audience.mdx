# Who is it for? Use Cases & Audience

### Unlocking Transparent Network Insights for Diverse Users

uBO Scope is designed for anyone curious about the unseen connections happening behind the scenes as they browse the web. By revealing all remote server connections—whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked—this extension provides clarity and transparency to users who value privacy, security, and accurate information about web traffic.

## Target Users

### Privacy-Conscious Users

Users who care deeply about their online privacy find uBO Scope invaluable. By showing the count and identity of third-party servers your browser communicates with, uBO Scope helps you understand how many and which external parties are involved in loading a webpage. Seeing this data empowers you to make informed choices about managing your content blockers or choosing which websites to trust.

**Example:** Imagine visiting an online news website. uBO Scope reveals that, in addition to the main site, your browser is connecting to multiple third-party domains for ads, analytics, and trackers. This visibility lets you gauge the privacy implications more reliably than simply trusting an ad blocker’s block count.

### Filter List Maintainers

Creators and maintainers of content filter lists benefit from uBO Scope’s network connection insights without needing access to advanced browser developer tools. With uBO Scope, you can monitor which third parties appear frequently in network connections, helping you refine filter lists by identifying redundant or stealthy connections missed by traditional metrics.

**Example:** A filter list maintainer notices several third-party domains often connected on a set of webpages even though some are not listed in common filters. uBO Scope empowers them to capture and document these domains for potential inclusion, improving overall blocking efficiency.

### Web Developers and Security Professionals

Developers and professionals monitoring application behavior gain a detailed and practical way to audit network requests involved in loading web apps or pages. uBO Scope’s granular visibility supports verifying whether blocked or allowed resources correspond to intended functionality or unexpected third-party communications.

**Example:** A developer investigating a content blocker’s impact on their web app can use uBO Scope to accurately see which external requests succeeded, were stealth-blocked (hidden), or outright blocked, helping debug feature breakages and optimize resource loading.

### Content Blocker Evaluators and Researchers

Researchers and evaluators assessing the effectiveness of content blocking solutions quickly discover that superficial metrics can be misleading. uBO Scope exposes myths surrounding content blocker comparisons by focusing on the number of distinct third-party connections rather than just block counts.

**Example:** Many websites or tests inflate block numbers using artificial or unrealistic requests. uBO Scope reveals actual real-world network activity, exposing exaggerated claims by test pages and enabling more trustworthy evaluations.

## Everyday Use Cases

### Debunking Misleading Block Counts

Users often rely on toolbar badges that count blocked requests to determine a content blocker’s effectiveness. uBO Scope clarifies this misconception by showing the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connects with, regardless of block counts, offering a more accurate privacy indicator.

### Supporting Investigative Workflows

Privacy advocates, journalists, and security auditors often need robust insights into web network activity. uBO Scope’s transparency enables these users to track and document hidden or stealth blocked requests that otherwise evade standard browser developer tools.

### Enhancing Content Blocking Management

By supplying detailed connection outcomes (allowed, stealth, blocked) per domain, uBO Scope helps users and filter maintainers make more precise decisions about blocking rules or exceptions, improving browser performance and security.

### Cross-Platform Consistency

Because uBO Scope reports data using the browser's `webRequest` API, it works independently of which content blocker is configured or whether blocking occurs at the browser or DNS level. This makes it a reliable companion across diverse privacy setups.

## Why uBO Scope Matters to You

- **See beyond block counts** – Understand true network exposure, not just what content blockers report
- **Reveal stealthy connections** – Identify connections masked from usual browser tools or webpages
- **Empower informed decisions** – Gain actionable knowledge about third-party involvement for privacy and security
- **Improve or maintain filter lists** – Gain data critical to refining and validating blocklists
- **Debunk unreliable test metrics** – Avoid misleading results from synthetic test pages

## Practical Tips for Users

- Use the toolbar badge as a quick privacy indicator; fewer third-party connections generally means better privacy.
- Open uBO Scope’s popup panel to view detailed domain lists under Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked categories.
- Combine uBO Scope with your existing content blocker to better understand blocking outcomes and refine your rules.
- If you notice unexpected third-party domains, consider investigating their purpose or adding them to your content blocker.

<Note>
The badge count shows only the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to during browsing. A lower number reflects fewer third-party requests reaching your browser.
