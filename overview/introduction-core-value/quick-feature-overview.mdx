# Key Features at a Glance

uBO Scope delivers a focused, transparent view into the network behavior of every webpage you visit. It’s designed not just to track connections but to translate raw network activity into clear, actionable insights — empowering you to make informed decisions about online privacy and security.

---

## Instant Third-Party Visibility via Toolbar Badge

At a glance, the toolbar icon badge counts the number of unique third-party remote servers your browser connects to for the current tab. This immediate visual metric helps you gauge the actual exposure your browsing activities create.

- **Why it matters:** Not all third parties are equal. Seeing these distinct connections allows you to discern if a webpage loads resources primarily from essential services or from a long tail of trackers and ads.
- **Real scenario:** When visiting a news website, a low badge count usually means minimal third-party requests, often limited to CDNs. A high count signals many remote servers contacted, which may warrant further inspection.

---

## Detailed Popup Panel with Comprehensive Connection Summaries

Clicking the toolbar icon opens a well-organized popup panel that breaks down remote connections into three clear categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Connections made successfully without interference.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests that were stealthily blocked, often by content blockers operating silently to avoid detection.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked or failed to establish due to errors.

### What You Gain:
- **Clear categorization:** Understand exactly which domains are loaded, which are silently blocked, and which are overtly stopped.
- **Connection counts:** Each domain is accompanied by the number of times it was contacted during page loading, giving you granular usage insights.
- **User-friendly presentation:** Domain names are converted to Unicode, enhancing readability especially for internationalized domains.

### Example Use Case:
Upon visiting an e-commerce site, you can quickly see if tracking domains or ad networks are allowed or blocked, assisting in judging the effectiveness of your content blocking setup.

## Robust Handling of Network Requests Across Browsers

uBO Scope listens to the browser's webRequest API to capture connection events including:

- **Successful requests**
- **Redirects**
- **Errors or failures**

This comprehensive capture ensures accurate reporting regardless of other active content blockers or network-level blocking layers.

**Benefit:** You get authentic, unfiltered visibility into what actually happens at the network level when you browse — no guessing or assumptions.

---

## Domain and Hostname Segregation for Precise Analytics

uBO Scope intelligently maps network requests to hostnames and their registered domains using the Public Suffix List. This method:

- Groups related hostnames under logical domains.
- Ensures accurate badge counts and summaries by counting distinct servers, not just URLs.

**Why this matters:** Content blockers and privacy tools rely heavily on domain-level decisions. By reflecting connections at this level, uBO Scope aligns with how users and tools conceptualize third-party access.

---

## Efficient Session Management and Real-Time Updates

The extension keeps track of network requests on a per-tab basis throughout your browsing session, updating badge counts and popup data dynamically.

- Session data is persistently saved, maintaining state across tab reloads or browser restarts.
- Badge updates reflect the current state, promoting a responsive and reliable user experience.

---

## Summary of What Users Experience

1. **Open a new tab and load a webpage.**
2. The badge updates live, showing how many unique third-party servers are connected.
3. Click the icon anytime to view detailed connection counts categorized by outcome (allowed, stealth, blocked).
4. Use these insights to validate content blocker effectiveness or to investigate privacy concerns.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep an eye on badge counts:** A rising count on frequently visited sites could indicate increased tracking or ad network activity.
- **Cross-check with your content blocker:** Use the detailed popup outcome lists to verify if your blocker is stealth-blocking or openly blocking suspicious requests.
- **Be aware of stealth-blocked entries:** These often explain why a page might function correctly while still maintaining your privacy behind the scenes.
- **Use domain counts instead of raw request numbers:** Domains represent distinct third parties, giving a more meaningful measure than simply tallying all requests.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- If the badge count shows no data or zero on pages you expect connections for, ensure permissions are granted for webRequest in your browser.
- Some network requests made outside browser APIs (e.g., OS-level DNS filtering) will not be detected by uBO Scope.
- Badge updates may lag briefly when many network requests happen simultaneously; allow a moment for data to refresh.
