# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover the True Scope of Web Connections

uBO Scope is a lightweight, privacy-focused browser extension designed to reveal every remote server connection a website attempts or establishes—whether those connections are allowed, stealthily blocked, or explicitly blocked. By exposing the full network landscape of your browsing session, uBO Scope empowers you with unparalleled transparency into remote communications initiated by webpages.

### Key Benefits of Using uBO Scope

- **Complete Visibility:** See all third-party remote servers contacted by the pages you visit, providing an accurate picture of external connections beyond what content blockers report.
- **Independent Measurement:** Understand network request outcomes regardless of which content blocker you use or if blocking happens on different layers, offering trustworthy data not tied to any single blocker.
- **Privacy Empowerment:** Monitor and reduce unnecessary third-party connections to enhance your privacy and reduce potential tracking.
- **Myth Busting:** Challenge common misconceptions about how content blockers work and are evaluated, based on reliable, real-world connection observations.
- **Lightweight & Non-Intrusive:** Monitors network requests efficiently without heavy overhead or interference in your browsing experience.

### Who Should Use This Page?

This page is aimed at privacy-conscious users, researchers, web developers, and filter list maintainers who want to deeply understand the network footprint of webpages. If you are curious about what connections your browser truly makes during a browsing session, this page lays the foundation for grasping uBO Scope's mission and unique approach.

## What Exactly is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a simple yet powerful browser extension that logs and reports the network requests made by webpages, focusing on remote server connections. It tracks which network requests succeed, which are blocked, and which are stealthily redirected or blocked without explicit indication.

Unlike conventional content blockers that primarily act to block unwanted content, uBO Scope functions as a measurement tool. It answers the question: “What remote servers did this webpage try to reach, and what became of those attempts?” This objective stance gives you raw insight instead of filtered or partial data.

### What Problem Does It Solve?

Browser-based content blockers vary widely in how they block content — from DNS-level filtering through to extension-based blocking and stealthy redirection. This variation can obscure the true picture of your browsing's network activity.

uBO Scope cuts through this uncertainty by comprehensively monitoring all network request outcomes detectable through the browser’s `webRequest` API. It thereby offers you a reliable, real-time report on the scope of remote connections, regardless of the blocking method used.

### How uBO Scope Stands Apart

- **Content-Blocker Agnostic:** Works independently of your content blocker, even detecting connections blocked outside the extension layer.
- **Focus on Remote Server Count:** Emphasizes the number of distinct third-party servers your browser talks to, a more meaningful metric for privacy than request or block counts.
- **Myth Debunking:** Clarifies misunderstandings, such as the irrelevant nature of block count comparisons and the shortcomings of synthetic 'ad blocker test' pages.

## Features at a Glance

### 1. Toolbar Icon Badge

uBO Scope displays a badge count on the browser toolbar icon that reflects the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected to during your current browsing tab. A lower number signifies a cleaner network footprint.

### 2. Popup Panel Summary

Clicking the toolbar icon opens a popup panel showing a categorized list of domains:
- **Not Blocked:** Connections allowed successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were silently redirected or blocked.
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked by the browser or other blockers.

This real-time report helps you quickly assess the extent and nature of external communication by the active webpage.

### 3. Transparency Across Browsers

uBO Scope is implemented for Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari, taking full advantage of each browser’s network request APIs to ensure consistent and comprehensive network reporting.

### 4. Open Source and Privacy Respectful

The source code is openly available ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope)) and licensed under GNU GPLv3. uBO Scope does not gather or transmit your browsing data anywhere—it only localizes network request measurement for your awareness.

## Why Does uBO Scope Matter to You?

### Achieve Real Transparency in Web Activity

Imagine browsing a website without knowing all the third-party servers contacted behind the scenes. With trackers, CDNs, analytics, and advertisement servers lurking in the network interactions, it’s impossible to gauge your true exposure.

With uBO Scope, you see exactly which domains your browser connects to—allowing you to make informed decisions about privacy, security, and blocking where needed.

### Challenge Misleading Metrics

Many evaluate content blockers by the sheer number of blocks, assuming more blocks mean better blocking. uBO Scope reveals that a high block count can coexist with a larger number of allowed third-party connections, undermining such assumptions.

This shifts the focus to what really impacts your exposure: the count of distinct allowed third parties. It also exposes why 'ad blocker test' pages provide unreliable benchmarking.

### Empower Filter List Maintainers

By transparently reporting network request outcomes, uBO Scope aids in fine-tuning filter lists, especially where browser tools or internal metrics are inaccessible.

## How Does uBO Scope Work in Action?

1. Upon activating the extension in your browser, uBO Scope listens to network request events via the browser's `webRequest` API.
2. It tracks each request’s outcome — whether it loaded successfully, was blocked explicitly, or was stealthily redirected or blocked.
3. It aggregates this data by domain and hostname, recording counts of network interactions.
4. The popup panel displays this categorized information, and the toolbar badge shows the count of distinct allowed third-party domains.

### Example Scenario

You visit a news website. Without uBO Scope, you see if your content blocker reports blocks but not the totality of allowed remote connections.

With uBO Scope:

- The toolbar badge indicates 12 distinct third-party domains connected.
- In the popup, you see domains categorized as "not blocked" (8), "stealth-blocked" (2), and "blocked" (2).
- You discover some domains you were unaware of, prompting you to refine your blocking or blocklists.

## Practical Tips for Getting the Most from uBO Scope

- Use uBO Scope alongside your favorite content blocker to gain insights into what it allows or misses.
- Regularly review the "stealth-blocked" section to understand subtle blocking behaviors.
- Don’t rely on the block count badge of any blocker as a performance metric; instead, use uBO Scope’s domain count.
- Avoid using third-party “ad blocker test” pages as a benchmark for blocker effectiveness—they are not representative.

## Code Snippet: Understanding the Popup Panel Rendering

The popup panel uses categorized sections to display connection outcomes, dynamically filled from gathered network data:

```html
<section id="summary">
    domains connected: <span>?</span>
</section>
<section class="outcome allowed">
    <h3>not blocked</h3>
    <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
<section class="outcome stealth">
    <h3>stealth-blocked</h3>
    <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
<section class="outcome blocked">
    <h3>blocked</h3>
    <div class="domains"></div>
</section>
```

Each domain entry displays the domain name and count of connection attempts, updated live.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- If the badge count does not update, make sure your browser supports the necessary `webRequest` API permissions. uBO Scope requires permissions to monitor https, http, and websocket connections.
- Some network requests made outside the browser’s visibility scope (e.g., outside the `webRequest` API) cannot be captured by uBO Scope.
- Stealth-blocked domains may be due to redirects or DNS-level blocking outside uBO Scope's direct control—this is expected behavior.

Use the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/troubleshooting/common-issues) page for more guidance.
