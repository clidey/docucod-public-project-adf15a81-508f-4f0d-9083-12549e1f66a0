# Key Features at a Glance

## Get Instant Insight into Your Webpage Connections

When you click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon, you receive a powerful snapshot of the network connections initiated by the current browser tab. This page provides a quick scan of the extension's major features that bring unparalleled clarity to the complex web of third-party servers your browser interacts with.

### What You See at a Glance

- **Toolbar Badge Showing Third-Party Server Count**: The extension's toolbar icon displays a badge representing the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the page. This count updates dynamically, giving you immediate awareness of your exposure and helping you spot unexpected third-party connections.

- **Detailed Pop-Up Breakdown per Tab**: Clicking the icon opens a pop-up that breaks down connections by domain, categorized by their network request outcomes. This granular view shows how many requests to each domain were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, empowering you to understand exactly which third parties are reaching your browser and how they are handled.

- **Reporting Regardless of Content Blocker or DNS Control**: Unlike tools limited by content blocker settings or DNS-based filtering, uBO Scope captures every network request outcome visible through the browser’s webRequest API. This means it reports connections including those affected by external DNS control or other blockers, ensuring you never miss a connection attempt.

- **Full Transparency on Network Request Outcomes**: The pop-up neatly separates domains into three categories — not blocked (allowed), stealth-blocked, and blocked — giving you clear visibility into which connections succeeded, which were invisibly redirected or hidden, and which were outright blocked.

## Explore Connections with Confidence: How It Works

uBO Scope continuously listens to your browser’s network activity and collects information on all third-party server requests initiated by each open tab. The toolbar badge number represents the distinct count of allowed connections, updated live as you browse.

When you open the pop-up panel for a tab, it presents:

- The total count of connected domains
- A breakdown by domain and category:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains where network requests successfully fetched resources
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where requests were redirected or stealthily handled
  - **Blocked**: Domains where requests were failed or blocked

This per-tab insight helps users quickly assess their exposure and detect unexpected or potentially intrusive connections.

## Key Features and Their Benefits

### 1. Toolbar Badge: Real-Time Third-Party Server Count
- **Benefit:** Immediately reveals the number of distinct third-party domains your current tab is contacting.
- **User Scenario:** A privacy-conscious user glances at the badge to verify that a shopping website isn’t unexpectedly contacting dozens of tracking servers.

### 2. Per-Tab Pop-Up with Connection Breakdown
- **Benefit:** Understand the exact landscape of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains, plus how often they are contacted.
- **User Scenario:** A filter list maintainer inspects the stealth-blocked domains to refine their rules and increase blocking precision.

### 3. Unaffected by External Blocking Mechanisms
- **Benefit:** Reliable reporting even when DNS-level blocking or other extensions intervene, ensuring no connection escapes your view.
- **User Scenario:** Technical evaluators verify that DNS filtering isn’t silently missing connections by cross-checking with uBO Scope data.

### 4. Clear Categorization of Connection Outcomes
- **Benefit:** Quickly identify which requests succeeded, were stealthily blocked (e.g., redirected), or blocked outright.
- **User Scenario:** An end-user curious about what their browser’s content blocker is doing can see the difference between allowed requests and those stealth-blocked.

## Real-World Example: Making Sense of Your Network Footprint

Imagine visiting your favorite news website. The toolbar badge might show “5,” indicating five unique third-party servers have been contacted. Opening the pop-up, you see:

- **Not Blocked:** cdn.news-site.com (12 requests), api.analytics.com (2 requests)
- **Stealth-Blocked:** tracking.adnetwork.com (3 requests)
- **Blocked:** ads.clicktracker.com (5 requests)

This breakdown lets you quickly grasp the scope of third-party interaction, evaluate privacy exposure, and understand what traffic your browser has blocked or allowed.

## Tips for Maximizing Value

- **Keep an Eye on the Badge**: A high number on the toolbar badge signals many third-party connections, which might warrant further investigation.
- **Use the Pop-Up to Audit Domains**: Spot unfamiliar or unexpected domains to detect tracking or potential privacy risks.
- **Understand Stealth Blocking**: Not all blocking is visible; stealth-blocking means the connection was redirected or altered without breaking the page, giving you insight into subtle network manipulations.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **No Badge Count Appearing?**
  - Ensure the extension is installed and enabled.
  - Verify that the page actively makes network requests to third-party servers.

- **Pop-Up Shows 'NO DATA'?**
  - Refresh the tab to allow uBO Scope to gather fresh network data.
  - Confirm that browser permissions allow the extension to monitor web requests.

- **Content Blocker Interaction**
  - If another content blocker or DNS block is in place, uBO Scope still reports connection outcomes but some details depend on browser webRequest API visibility.
