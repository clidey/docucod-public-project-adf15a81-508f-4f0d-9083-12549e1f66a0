## Ideal Users of uBO Scope

### Privacy Enthusiasts
If you care deeply about your online privacy, uBO Scope reveals the truth behind the webpages you visit. It exposes every remote server connection attempted by your browser — regardless of whether it was blocked or allowed — helping you:

- Understand exactly which third-party servers your browser communicates with.
- Identify stealthy or unexpected network activity hidden from conventional browser tools.
- Challenge misinformation about content blockers by seeing real outcomes rather than relying on misleading metrics like block counts.

### Filter List Maintainers
Maintaining and updating filter lists demands accurate data on third-party domains and their behavior. uBO Scope provides:

- Detailed insights into all remote connections initiated by webpages, invaluable for spotting domains that require blocking or special handling.
- A lightweight means to collect relevant data, especially beneficial for maintainers working on devices or browsers where traditional developer tools or uBlock Origin’s built-in tools are inaccessible.

### Website Auditors and Analysts
If you audit websites for security, privacy compliance, or performance, uBO Scope helps you:

- Validate whether content blockers are performing as expected by independently verifying which domains are blocked or allowed.
- Detect third-party domains silently redirecting or interfering with site behavior.
- Gain a more transparent picture of network requests than standard browser panels or deceptive 'ad blocker test' websites provide.

### Users with Limited Access to Native Browser Tools
Accessible and lightweight, uBO Scope is perfect for users on platforms where:

- Browser developer tools are restricted, unavailable, or difficult to use.
- Network inspection capabilities are limited or do not report fully on how content blockers affect traffic.
- You need a simple, independent extension to report third-party connections without complex setup or heavy resource use.

## Real-World User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Evaluating Your Content Blocker’s Effectiveness
You suspect your current content blocker is allowing connections to unwanted trackers. Using uBO Scope, you open your favorite news site and watch the popup panel or toolbar badge. You see a precise list of all third-party domains contacted, split by those allowed, stealth-blocked (concealed or redirected), and explicitly blocked. This direct insight confirms for you whether your blocker is truly protecting your privacy.

### Scenario 2: Maintaining a Filter List
As a filter list maintainer, you test popular websites daily on a device with restricted browser tools. uBO Scope silently collects network request data for you, listing domains that repeatedly appear and require blocks or exclusions. This transparency accelerates your filter tuning without the overhead of heavy network debugging suites.

### Scenario 3: Auditing a Client’s Website
During a security audit, you must confirm no unauthorized third-party calls are made. With uBO Scope enabled, you capture every remote connection attempted, even those stealthily redirected or blocked, providing an independent, trustworthy record you can report.
