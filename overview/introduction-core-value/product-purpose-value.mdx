# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlocking Visibility into Your Browser's Network Connections

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to reveal every attempted and successful connection your browser makes to remote servers. If you're seeking to understand which third-party servers your web pages contact—whether allowed, stealthily blocked, or outright blocked—uBO Scope puts this data right at your fingertips.

### Why This Matters
Every time you load a webpage, numerous network requests may occur behind the scenes. Some connect to necessary resources, while others touch third-party servers that can impact privacy and performance. uBO Scope shines a light on these connections, empowering you to:

- **Gain clear insight** into all remote servers your browser interacts with.
- **Assess content blocking effectiveness** by focusing on distinct third-party connections rather than raw block counts.
- **Distinguish between legitimate third parties and potential trackers or unwanted servers.**
- **Support filter list maintainers** with real-world data on network requests.

### Who Benefits from uBO Scope?
Whether you're a privacy-conscious user wanting transparency, a web professional auditing third-party content, or a filter list maintainer refining blocking rules, uBO Scope offers a precise view of remote connections that guides smarter decisions.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension companion to uBlock Origin, dedicated exclusively to measuring and reporting network connections initiated by your browser as you surf the web.

- **It captures all connection attempts to remote servers** — successful or blocked — and categorizes them for easy analysis.
- Uses browser `webRequest` listeners to track network requests regardless of your content blocker or DNS setup.
- Presents results in a simple popup interface showing domains categorized into **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

---

## How Does uBO Scope Work?

At its core, uBO Scope listens to every network request your browser processes within a page load. Each request is:

- Inspected for its URL, hostname, and outcome (allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked).
- Mapped to its domain for aggregated counts.
- Organized by whether the request is:
  - **Allowed:** Connection succeeded.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Redirected or altered silently by content blockers.
  - **Blocked:** Explicitly prevented by a content blocker or network error.

This data is stored per browser tab to provide domain-level summaries you can quickly interpret via the toolbar popup.

<uBO Scope’s approach emphasizes counting **distinct third-party domains** over raw request counts, producing a richer, more meaningful metric of real-world network exposure.>

## Key Benefits of Using uBO Scope

- **Complete transparency:** see all remote connections your browser attempts, including those stealthily blocked or allowed.
- **Reliable comparison tool:** debunk misleading block count myths between content blockers by focusing on unique third-party domains.
- **Helps you maintain privacy:** easily identify excessive third-party network activity that could jeopardize data confidentiality.
- **Supports filter list maintenance:** filter authors gain concrete evidence of which domains occur in real browsing contexts.
- **Minimal performance impact:** operates efficiently while delivering detailed insights.

## Real-World Scenario: How uBO Scope Changes Your Browsing Insight

Imagine you install multiple content blockers and check their reported block counts. One shows 1000 blocks, another only 500 — which is better?

Traditional block counts can mislead because they don’t reflect how many **distinct third-party servers** ultimately load resources. A blocker with fewer blocks might actually block more third parties by silently preventing some connections, while a blocker with more blocks might allow connections to many different third-party domains.

By using uBO Scope, you see the accurate number of **distinct third-party domains contacted.** It highlights that the higher block count extension may actually allow more third parties, helping you choose the extension that best protects your privacy.

## How to Explore uBO Scope

- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup interface.
- The main hostname and domain of the active tab are displayed prominently.
- Three categorized sections list unique third-party domains:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** domains from which resources successfully loaded.
  - **Stealth Blocked:** domains whose requests were transparently redirected or intercepted.
  - **Blocked:** domains where requests failed or were actively blocked.
- Each domain shows a count of requests related to it, providing context to its network footprint.

This straightforward interface lets you quickly assess the third-party landscape of any site you visit.

---

## Practical Tips

- **Focus on distinct domains rather than raw numbers:** A lower count means fewer third-party connections, which is often better for privacy.
- **Check the "stealth-blocked" group:** These requests are silently blocked and may explain differences in block counts reported by different blockers.
- **Use uBO Scope regularly:** Monitor changes in third-party connections when browsing new or unknown sites.

## What uBO Scope Does Not Do

- It does not block connections itself; it only reports what happens.
- It does not analyze content from network requests or track data beyond hostname and domain information.
- It does not require or expose personal browsing data beyond what the browser’s webRequest API reports.
