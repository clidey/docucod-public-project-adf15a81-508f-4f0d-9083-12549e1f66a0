# Features At a Glance

## Real-Time Badge Counts for Remote Domains

From the moment you install uBO Scope, the toolbar icon keeps you informed with a real-time badge count. This number reflects the distinct third-party remote domains contacted by the active web page. 

- **Instant insight:** At a glance, understand how many unique third-party servers your current tab is communicating with.
- **Privacy awareness:** A lower badge count indicates fewer external connections, helping you gauge your exposure.
- **Actionable feedback:** Use the badge as a trust signal while browsing, highlighting when websites reach out to multiple remote servers.

_For example, when visiting a news site, you might see several third-party domains like content delivery networks (CDNs) or ad servers. The badge count updates live as your browsing session triggers new connections or blocks others._


## Intuitive Popup Panel with Connection Status Breakdown

Clicking the toolbar icon opens the uBO Scope popup panel—a clear, organized display of all remote server connections categorized by their network request outcome:

- **Allowed:** Domains with successful connections.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where network requests were silently redirected or intercepted.
- **Blocked:** Domains actively blocked by the browser or blocker.

This panel uses a simple interface with easy-to-read sections that allow you to:

- **Visualize connection health:** Quickly identify which third parties are successfully connected versus blocked.
- **Drill down:** View domain names alongside badge counts representing individual request occurrences.
- **Understand stealth blocking:** Spot subtle network behaviors invisible to most users or content blockers.

_Imagine visiting a webpage with embedded videos. The popup will show you which video hosts are allowed, which were stealth-blocked by your content blocker, and any connections that failed outright._


## Cross-Browser Support for Wide Accessibility

uBO Scope is designed to provide consistent functionality across major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Leveraging the browser's native `webRequest` API:

- **Uniform experience:** Enjoy the same badge counts and popup panel regardless of your preferred browser.
- **Extensive coverage:** Support for both HTTP(S) and WebSocket network protocols ensures comprehensive tracking.
- **Seamless integration:** The extension respects each browser’s security model while providing transparent network visibility.

This multiplatform support guarantees that your privacy insights and debugging capabilities travel with you, no matter where you browse.


## Why These Features Matter

uBO Scope’s focused feature set equips you with immediate, verifiable information about network requests without overwhelming you with unnecessary complexity. This approach:

- **Empowers privacy enthusiasts:** See exactly how many and which third-party domains interact with your browser.
- **Supports filter list maintainers and researchers:** Quickly verify which connections are truly blocked or allowed.
- **Debunks common ad blocker misconceptions:** The straightforward data helps clarify the real impact of blocking strategies.

## Using the Features in Practice: Quick User Flow

1. **Install uBO Scope** from your browser’s extension store.
2. **Browse to any website.** Watch the badge update the count of distinct third-party remote domains.
3. **Click the toolbar icon** to open the popup panel.
4. **Review the categorized lists:**
   - Which domains loaded resources successfully?
   - Which were stealth-blocked (silently handled)?
   - Which were blocked outright?
5. **Make informed decisions** about your browsing and privacy practices based on these real-time insights.

**Tip:** A lower badge count generally means fewer third-party trackers and better privacy, but always consider the nature of the allowed domains before drawing conclusions.

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Don’t equate a high block count with stronger privacy.** The badge shows allowed connections, which is what really matters.
- **Remember some legitimate third-party domains (like CDNs) are safe.** Use the popup panel to identify them easily.
- **Understand stealth blocking.** It’s a subtle behavior and seeing these domains helps recognize advanced blocking techniques.
- **Cross-check with your content blocker settings.** uBO Scope provides visibility, not direct blocking controls.
