# Who Should Use uBO Scope—and Why?

uBO Scope is designed to serve a specialized but diverse group of users who seek deep, honest insight into their browser’s network activity. Understanding who benefits most from uBO Scope—and how—helps you determine if it’s the right tool for your needs. This page identifies the core user personas and explains the value uBO Scope delivers to each.

## Tailored for Privacy Enthusiasts

Privacy-conscious users want to know exactly what third-party connections their browser tab initiates, regardless of what content blockers or DNS filters do under the hood. uBO Scope:

- Provides transparent, real-time visibility into **all** network requests initiated by a tab.
- Reveals how many distinct third-party servers actually receive connections, which matters more than simple block counts.
- Debunks common misconceptions about blocker effectiveness, helping users understand the real impact on their privacy.

> *Example:* If you use multiple content blockers, one may show a higher number of blocked requests. But uBO Scope might reveal that it still allows connections to more distinct third-party servers than others, meaning a seemingly aggressive blocker might actually leak more.

This clarity empowers privacy enthusiasts to make informed decisions about their blocker setups and understand what’s truly happening during browsing.

## Essential for Filter List Maintainers

Filter list maintainers need reliable, comprehensive data about network requests across platforms, including environments where browser developer tools are limited or inaccessible.

uBO Scope:

- Captures network request outcomes independently of content blockers and DNS filtering, as long as the browser’s `webRequest` API reports them.
- Functions as a lightweight, transportable verification tool to confirm where and how filters work.
- Offers ongoing plans to include deeper network request details to aid list development and troubleshooting.

> *Scenario:* On devices like mobile browsers or restricted platforms where browser debugging tools are unavailable, maintainers can install uBO Scope to verify filtering behavior reliably and identify stealth-blocked or blocked requests.

This makes uBO Scope invaluable for those maintaining and validating filter efficacy in real-world conditions.

## Valuable to Power Users

Power users who customize their browsers for speed, security, or control will find uBO Scope useful to understand:

- How many distinct external domains load resources.
- Which requests are allowed, blocked outright, or stealth-blocked (blocked without the server knowing).
- The difference between raw block counts and actual distinct connections.

This detailed insight aids users in optimizing browser performance and privacy configurations with clear, factual data.

---

## Instrumental for Researchers and Analysts

Researchers studying web behavior, tracking, censorship, or network performance need unbiased data about network activity seen from the browser level.

uBO Scope:

- Reports connection results consistently, regardless of filtering method.
- Exposes real-world third-party domains without injecting test scenarios.
- Avoids using synthetic ad blocker tests that don’t reflect actual browsing behavior.

> *Insight:* Researchers can rely on uBO Scope to gather genuine, unmanipulated data about network connections initiated by browser tabs, facilitating accurate studies and reports.

## Why uBO Scope Stands Apart

- **Focus on Network Reality:** Instead of delivering misleading block counts or running fabricated tests, uBO Scope reveals the **true** set of remote servers contacted.
- **Cross-Filter Transparency:** Works independently of content blockers, making results comparable regardless of filtering.
- **Lightweight and Accessible:** Simple installation and operation, available across major browsers, including on platforms with limited tooling.

---

## Best Practices and Tips

- Use uBO Scope to monitor active browsing tabs for unexpected third-party connections.
- Compare connection counts to your content blocker’s reported block count to understand actual filtering impact.
- For filter maintainers, test on platforms without developer tools to confirm filter behavior.
- Remember that some third-party connections, like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), are typically legitimate and low in number.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t rely solely on your content blocker’s block count as a measure of effectiveness.
- Avoid synthetic 'ad blocker test' websites—they don’t reflect real-world browsing.
- Be aware that uBO Scope only tracks requests visible to the browser’s `webRequest` API, so certain types of network calls outside this scope won’t be reported.
