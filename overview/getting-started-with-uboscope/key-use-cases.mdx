# Typical Use Cases of uBO Scope

uBO Scope is a powerful companion tool designed to offer detailed insights into the web requests a browser tab initiates. This page focuses exclusively on the core scenarios where uBO Scope excels, empowering you to audit, validate, monitor, and tune your content blocking and network activity without relying on the built-in browser developer tools.

---

## Why Use uBO Scope for These Scenarios?

Most browsers provide developer tools to observe network requests, but these tools often lack accuracy in reflecting the true outcome of a request when content blockers or DNS filters intervene stealthily. uBO Scope fills that gap by leveraging `webRequest` listeners to report with high precision:

- Which connections were **allowed** through
- Which were **blocked** outright
- Which underwent **stealth blocking** or redirection

This makes it a uniquely reliable and comprehensive source for real-world network visibility.

## 1. Auditing Website Connections

When you visit a website, dozens or even hundreds of connections might be made to various servers — some first-party, many third-party. Understanding exactly which remote domains your browser talks to is vital for privacy and security analysis.

**How uBO Scope Helps:**

- Tracks **all network requests** by tab with breakdowns at both domain and hostname levels.
- Displays distinct remote servers connected to, distinguishing between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked.
- Updates the browser extension badge with a count of **unique third-party domains allowed**.

**Example Use Case:**

You're curious how many and which third-party services a news website contacts. Open uBO Scope's popup panel to instantly see a categorized list of these servers, allowing you to assess potential privacy risks or performance impacts.

## 2. Validating Content Blockers and Filters

Content blockers vary widely in their effectiveness, and popular metrics like block counts can be misleading. A high block count may mean more requests are targeted, but it does not guarantee fewer third-party connections actually occur.

**How uBO Scope Helps:**

- Reports requests outcomes regardless of the content blocking technology or DNS-based blocking active.
- Offers **accurate insights** into what content blockers allow versus block.
- Helps distinguish between genuinely blocked requests and those silently allowed or stealth-blocked.

**Example Use Case:**

You have multiple blockers enabled and want to verify which one is most effective at reducing connections to third parties. Using uBO Scope, you can measure and compare third-party domain connections for each blocker configuration, quantifying real-world protection.

## 3. Monitoring Third-Party Requests

Websites commonly load resources from third parties like CDNs, ad networks, analytics platforms, and trackers. Monitoring these third-party connections is crucial to understand external dependencies and potential privacy leakages.

**How uBO Scope Helps:**

- Provides detailed reports on **third-party domains and their connection counts** per tab.
- Separates stealth-blocked domains from openly blocked and openly allowed connections.
- Allows rapid identification of unexpected or suspicious third-party activity.

**Example Use Case:**

A website seems slow; it could be loading resources from many third parties. With uBO Scope, you pinpoint which third-party domains dominate requests, enabling you to take informed action such as enabling blocking or manually tuning filters.

## 4. Supporting Filter List Tuning Without Developer Tools

Filter list maintainers and privacy advocates often work in environments or devices that limit access to usual browser tools. Additionally, relying on synthetic test webpages can be misleading.

**How uBO Scope Helps:**

- Enables filter tuning by **showing real browsing connection data** instead of artificial test patterns.
- Works independently of browser devtools, providing raw connection outcomes directly.
- Supports deeper investigation by allowing export and review of domain-based outcomes.

**Example Use Case:**

You are maintaining or refining a filter list and need to observe the practical effect of your rules against live browsing data. uBO Scope shows you which hosts are allowed or blocked to tune your filters effectively, especially helpful on devices like mobile browsers where devtools access is restricted.

---

## Getting the Most From uBO Scope in These Use Cases

- **Look beyond block counts:** Focus on the number of distinct allowed third-party domains — fewer is better for privacy.
- **Use stealth blocking awareness:** Observe domains that are stealth-blocked (redirected silently), which typical tools might miss.
- **Check badge counts for quick overviews:** The toolbar badge offers immediate feedback on third-party connection volume.
- **Combine with filter maintenance:** Use the connection insights to optimize filter lists and enhance blocking precision.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- If no data appears for a tab, ensure the page has network activity and that uBO Scope was installed before the tab was loaded.
- Badge counts might be temporarily inaccurate if the browser delays webRequest events; refreshing the tab updates data.
- Some browser or network configurations might prevent webRequest event delivery; consult system requirements and permissions.
