## Understanding uBO Scope’s Audience

uBO Scope is not for passive users—it’s designed to empower those who want to deeply understand what’s happening behind the scenes of their web browsing sessions. The extension provides clear, real-time visibility into all remote connections a webpage makes or attempts, classified by their blocking status.

### Primary Audiences

- **Privacy-Conscious Users**  
  If your top priority is to safeguard your privacy from unwanted tracking and third-party connections, uBO Scope offers an unparalleled transparent window into what websites really connect to. It enables you to verify what is blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed, helping you gauge the effectiveness of your content blockers and privacy setups.

- **Filter List Maintainers**  
  For those curating or developing content blocking filter lists, uBO Scope becomes a vital diagnostic tool. It provides real-world network connection data, including stealth blocking behavior and failures, especially valuable on devices where standard browser development tools are limited or unavailable.

- **Browser Power Users and Researchers**  
  If you’re someone who strives to master your browser’s behavior or analyze web traffic patterns in detail, uBO Scope delivers actionable, categorized connection data at your fingertips. It helps you explore third-party embedded services, detect any connection anomalies, and better understand the network footprint of a site.

## Typical Use Cases

See how uBO Scope makes a difference in real, practical scenarios where connection transparency matters most.

### 1. Verifying Content Blocker Effectiveness

When you want to confirm that your content blocker is truly minimizing third-party connections, rely on uBO Scope to show:

- The exact third-party domains that were allowed, stealth-blocked (blocked silently to avoid site breakage or detection), or fully blocked.
- A distinct count of domains connected per tab, visible as a badge, enabling instant feedback on browsing sessions.

**Example:** You install a new content blocking filter list and browse your favorite website. Using uBO Scope's popup, you see a reduced number of allowed third-party domains compared to before, confirming your filter’s impact.

### 2. Analyzing Network Connections on Restricted Devices

On devices where browser developer tools are constrained or inaccessible—such as corporate or restricted environments—uBO Scope provides:

- A no-frills, reliable report on what remote servers your browser reaches.
- Insight into stealth blocking actions that happen silently under other privacy tools.

This enables security analysts or IT professionals to audit browser network activity without needing advanced tooling.

### 3. Auditing Third-party Resource Usage

Websites often embed multiple third-party resources such as CDNs, tracking scripts, or social widgets. uBO Scope allows you to:

- Monitor third-party domains and assess whether you want to allow or block them.
- Understand how stealth blocking masks certain connections.

**Example:** You want to know if a news website loads any hidden analytic tools or advertising servers. uBO Scope reveals these connections explicitly, empowering you to make informed blocking choices.

## Why You’ll Care

Using uBO Scope lets you transition from guessing about what your browser does to knowing with certainty. The extension unmasks the real network footprint of each webpage and reveals blocker behavior in detail. This visibility translates to:

- Greater confidence and control over privacy.
- Better-informed maintenance or creation of filter lists.
- Improved security awareness by spotting unexpected connections.

In short, it arms you with fact-based insight that historically required significant technical know-how or unavailable tools.

## Start Exploring Today

Access uBO Scope’s main interface instantly through the browser toolbar icon. When you click it, you get a categorized overview of remote connections for your current active tab, neatly grouped as:

- **Allowed:** Connections that succeeded without interference.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections silently prevented by content blockers to avoid detection or site breakage.
- **Blocked:** Connections fully blocked, typically causing errors.

Each domain is listed with a count of connections made, providing granular, easy-to-interpret data.

For precise instructions on installing and using uBO Scope, consult the [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) guide and the [What is uBO Scope?](overview/intro-value-audience/what-is-ubo-scope) documentation.

<Tip>
Privacy-conscious users should routinely check uBO Scope’s reports alongside their content blockers to measure actual real-world effectiveness versus perceived blocking.
</Tip>

<Note>
uBO Scope’s badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party domains connected—not overall request counts or blocked counts—so a lower badge number always signals better privacy.
</Note>

<Warning>
This tool depends on the browser's `webRequest` API; connections made outside this scope or blocked at the DNS level may not always be reported.
</Warning>

#### Code Example: Launching uBO Scope Popup

Opening uBO Scope during active browsing sessions immediately displays categorized domain connection data for the current tab:

```javascript
// Example snippet that runs automatically in the popup
(async () => {
  const [tab] = await browser.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true });
  const response = await sendMessage({ what: 'getTabData', tabId: tab.id });
  const data = deserialize(response);
  renderPanel(data);  // Renders allowed, stealth, and blocked domains
})();
```

This flow illustrates how uBO Scope fetches and presents connection data seamlessly as users navigate the web.
