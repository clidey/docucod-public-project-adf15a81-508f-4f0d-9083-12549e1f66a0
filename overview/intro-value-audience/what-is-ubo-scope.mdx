# What is uBO Scope?

## Introducing uBO Scope: Transparency in Network Connections

uBO Scope is a unique browser extension designed to shine a light on all network connections a webpage attempts or successfully establishes with remote servers. Unlike traditional content blockers that focus on blocking or filtering unwanted content, uBO Scope's core mission is to provide clear visibility into the connections your browser makes — whether they are blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed.

This transparency arms you with actionable insights into the behavior of websites, enabling you to understand and analyze remote server interactions beyond what typical content blockers reveal.

## Why uBO Scope? Understanding the Need

Most users rely on content blockers that actively prevent unwanted elements from loading. However, this approach leaves a blind spot: you rarely see the full picture of what connections were attempted behind the scenes. Were some connections silently blocked by your DNS? Did stealth-blocking mechanisms hide certain network activities? 

uBO Scope cuts through this opacity by reporting every connection attempt, regardless of the content blocker in use or DNS filtering active in your system. 

This means:

- You get a comprehensive overview of all third-party and first-party remote server connections.
- The badge count on the toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct **third-party remote servers** your current tab connected with — a lower number often indicates a cleaner browsing session.
- You gain clarity on network requests outcomes, including completed, blocked, or stealth-blocked connections.

## What Makes uBO Scope Different?

Traditional content blockers primarily focus on blocking and filtering content, often without revealing all network activity to the user or even themselves. uBO Scope is different in several significant ways:

- **Complete Reporting:** It captures **all network connection attempts**, including those bypassed or stealthily blocked, providing unmatched visibility.

- **Content-Blocker Agnostic:** Works independently of which content blocker you use or DNS filtering, as long as the browser exposes the `webRequest` API.

- **Outcome Categorization:** Clearly separates connection outcomes into `allowed`, `blocked`, and `stealth-blocked`, presenting a nuanced picture of network activity.

- **Badge Indicator Insight:** Focuses on the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected, helping debunk misconceptions that raw block counts equal better blocking.

- **Transparency Tool:** Especially useful for filter list maintainers and privacy-conscious users by exposing real world network behavior.

## How uBO Scope Works at a Glance

uBO Scope listens to your browser's network events using the `webRequest` API. It records every connection attempt initiated by a webpage, analyzes the request's outcome, and classifies it as:

- **Allowed:** Successfully connected remote servers.
- **Blocked:** Failed connection attempts, often due to content blocking.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were redirected or obstructed in a less obvious manner.

Then, it aggregates these remote servers by domain and hostname, displaying detailed counts for the active browser tab.

The result is a dynamic report accessible via the extension’s popup, showing you the full landscape of third-party connections your browser made.

## Real-World Scenario: Why You Should Care

Imagine you are visiting an unfamiliar website and want to know how many external servers it connects to — and whether those connections succeed or are blocked. Without uBO Scope, you’d be guessing or relying on incomplete indicators.

With uBO Scope:

- You open the extension popup and see a categorized list of domains connected.
- You notice some domains appear under "stealth-blocked," signaling that something tried to connect but was redirected or obscured.
- The badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party domains allowed, giving you a quick risk assessment.

This level of insight empowers you to better protect your privacy and make informed decisions about which sites to trust or avoid.

## Key Benefits Summary

- **Full visibility** into all remote server connection attempts.
- **Independent of content blockers**, offering unbiased data.
- **Actionable analytics** that facilitate privacy and security decisions.
- **Supports advanced use cases** such as filter list validation and debunking block count myths.

## Getting Started with uBO Scope

For users new to uBO Scope, your initial experience will be straightforward:

1. **Install the extension** from your browser’s add-on marketplace.
2. **Browse as usual.** uBO Scope silently records connection attempts in the background.
3. **Click the extension icon** to open the popup and get instant reports showing allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
4. Use these insights to understand which third-party servers your browser actually talks to.
