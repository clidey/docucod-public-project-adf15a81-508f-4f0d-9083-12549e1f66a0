# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding uBO Scope begins with mastering a set of foundational concepts and terms. This knowledge empowers you to interpret the extension’s data accurately and make informed decisions about your web privacy.

## Third-Party Remote Server

A **third-party remote server** is any external server contacted by a webpage you visit, which is not part of the primary domain. When you load a website, your browser may reach out to various servers owned by other companies or services to fetch additional resources like ads, images, analytics, or social media content.

**Why It Matters:**
- uBO Scope tracks these third-party servers to expose every connection attempt a website makes beyond its own domain.
- A lower number of third-party servers connected often indicates better privacy, as fewer external companies can track or profile you.


## Badge Count

The **badge count** is the number displayed on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon. It represents:

> **The number of distinct third-party remote servers with which there was a connection attempt or success during page loading.**

**Key points:**
- This count includes all connections *regardless* of whether they were blocked or allowed, focusing on unique server domains.
- A *lower badge count* indicates fewer unique external servers contacted, enhancing privacy.
- This count is a more reliable indicator of your online exposure than traditional block counts shown by ad blockers.


## Connection Classifications: Blocked, Allowed, and Stealth

uBO Scope categorizes third-party connections into three outcomes based on how network requests were handled.

### Allowed
Connections that were successful and not blocked by any content blocker or filtering mechanism. These represent actual data exchanged between your browser and external servers.

### Blocked
Connections that were explicitly prevented from loading by content blockers or network-level filters, resulting in network errors or request failures.

### Stealth
Connections that were intercepted or redirected by content blockers in a way that hides their blocking action from the webpage. This 'stealth' mode ensures the webpage behaves normally without knowing a resource was blocked.

**Benefit:**
- This classification helps you understand not just what was blocked or allowed but also what was blocked invisibly, providing a full picture of network activity.


## How uBO Scope Measures Network Connections

### Using WebRequest API

uBO Scope relies on the browser's [`webRequest` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest) to capture detailed information about network requests initiated by webpages. This API reports:
- The URL being requested
- The status of the request (success, error, redirect)
- The type of resource being fetched (main page, script, image, websocket, etc.)

Even connections filtered through DNS-based content blockers or intermediate proxies are reported as long as the `webRequest` API receives the event.

### Hostname and Domain Extraction

To group requests meaningfully, uBO Scope extracts:
- **Hostname:** Fully qualified name from the URL.
- **Domain:** Registered domain plus one additional label (e.g., `example.com` from `sub.example.com`) using the public suffix list.

This classification condenses multiple requests to the same domain for a clearer summary.

<u>Note:</u> Hostnames and domains are converted from Unicode to Punycode and vice versa for both storage and display.

### Public Suffix List (PSL)

The extension uses the [Mozilla Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to accurately determine what constitutes a registered domain versus a public suffix. This is critical because many domain extensions are multi-level (e.g., `.co.uk`).

<u>Technical insight:</u> uBO Scope utilizes a compact and optimized JavaScript implementation of the PSL (`publicsuffixlist.js`), enabling efficient domain parsing and classification.


## Terminology Recap

| Term                     | Description                                                                                   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Third-party remote server| External servers contacted by a website beyond its main domain.                              |
| Badge count              | The number shown on the toolbar icon indicating distinct third-party servers connected.     |
| Allowed connections      | Network requests permitted and successfully completed.                                       |
| Blocked connections      | Requests prevented by content blocking mechanisms.                                          |
| Stealth connections      | Requests blocked without webpage awareness for stealthy blocking.                           |
| Hostname                 | The exact host portion of a URL (e.g., `ads.example.net`).                                  |
| Domain                   | The registered domain derived from hostname using the public suffix list (e.g., `example.net`).|


## Why This Vocabulary Matters

Grasping these terms allows you to:
- Accurately interpret the numbers and lists displayed by uBO Scope.
- Understand the difference between blocking individual resources versus blocking entire third-party domains.
- Assess the true exposure of your browsing session by focusing on unique third-party servers rather than raw block counts.
- Engage confidently with the tool, filter lists, and the community discussions around privacy and network connections.


## Practical Examples

1. **Example of Third-Party Server Identification:**
   - Visiting `https://news.example.com` triggers resources from `cdn.examplecdn.com` and `ads.tracker.com`.
   - `cdn.examplecdn.com` and `ads.tracker.com` are distinct third-party remote servers.
   - uBO Scope’s badge count increases by 2.

2. **Understanding Badge Count Impact:**
   - You switch from one ad blocker to another.
   - Old blocker shows 150 blocked requests, new one shows 300.
   - uBO Scope shows the first blocker connected to 10 third-party domains but the second connected to 20.
   - The new blocker is potentially less effective even though it blocked more requests; it allowed more distinct external connections.

3. **Stealth Blocking:**
   - Some requests to trackers are blocked silently to avoid webpage breakage.
   - uBO Scope separates these from outright blocked requests.
   - This enables you to verify stealth techniques and understand their impact.


## Tips & Best Practices

- Use the badge count as your primary privacy metric, not raw block counts.
- Regularly consult this terminology when reviewing popup data and network summaries.
- Remember that not all third-party servers are harmful; some are essential services like CDNs.
- Keep in mind stealth blocking helps maintain website usability while protecting privacy.


<Note>
Understanding these core concepts unlocks the full value of uBO Scope’s network visibility. Armed with this vocabulary, you can confidently explore connection details and assess privacy exposure.
