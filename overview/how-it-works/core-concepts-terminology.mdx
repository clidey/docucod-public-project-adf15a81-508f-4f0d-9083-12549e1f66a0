# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the fundamental concepts and terminology of uBO Scope is crucial to effectively interpreting its reports and making informed decisions about your web privacy and content blocking. This page clarifies key terms such as 'third-party remote server,' the meaning behind the classifications 'allowed,' 'blocked,' and 'stealth,' and explains the significance of the badge count compared to traditional block counts.

## What Is a Third-Party Remote Server?

At its core, uBO Scope measures connections from your browser to remote servers. A **third-party remote server** is any server that is _not_ part of the website's primary domain you are visiting but hosts resources or services your browser requests during your web session.

### Why Third-Party Domains Matter

Third-party domains often provide content such as ads, analytics, content delivery networks (CDNs), social media plugins, and tracking scripts. Monitoring these domains helps you understand the number and nature of external entities interacting with the website you are on, which directly impacts your privacy and security.

<u>Example:</u> When visiting `example.com`, a request to `cdn.example.com` is first-party, but a request to `ads.tracker.com` or `analytics.thirdparty.net` is third-party.

## Understanding Request Outcomes: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth

uBO Scope categorizes network requests into three distinct outcomes, reflecting how connections to these third-party servers are handled:

### Allowed
These are requests to third-party servers that completed successfully. They represent active connections that potentially fetched resources like images, scripts, or data necessary for the website’s operation or content display.

**User Value:**
- Understand which third-party servers your browser is actively communicating with.
- Assess whether unexpected or unwanted external domains are involved.

### Blocked
These requests were explicitly prevented by your content blocker or another blocking mechanism. A blocked request means that your browser tried to connect to a third-party server but was denied.

**User Value:**
- Verify what your content blocker is effectively stopping.
- Identify potentially intrusive or unwanted connections being mitigated.

### Stealth (Stealth-Blocked)
Stealth refers to requests that were silently redirected or otherwise stealthily blocked, such that the webpage or user might not be aware of it directly. These connections were not openly allowed or reported by the requesters but were intercepted.

**User Value:**
- Gain insight into subtle blocking actions not apparent in normal browsing.
- Detect advanced blocking that avoids alerting the webpage.

## What Does the Badge Count Mean?

The badge count on the browser toolbar is one of uBO Scope’s most critical indicators. Unlike traditional ad blockers that count how many individual requests were blocked, uBO Scope’s badge reflects:

> **The number of distinct third-party domains for which connections were successfully established during your browsing session.**

### Why a Lower Count Is Better
Having fewer distinct third-party connections means that fewer external entities were allowed to communicate with your browser, which generally indicates better privacy.

<u>Important:</u> This count is not a block count. It does not increase with more blocks but rather shows how many unique third-party domains were actually reached and used.

### Difference from Traditional Block Counts
Traditional content blockers often display a block count badge — how many requests they blocked. However, a higher block count does not necessarily equal better blocking. Sometimes a high block count coincides with your browser still connecting to _more_ unique third-party domains, which can result in more third-party leakage.

## Debunking Common Myths About Content Blocker Effectiveness

uBO Scope helps clarify misunderstandings often encountered by users evaluating content blockers or using so-called "ad blocker test" pages.

### Myth #1: Higher Block Count Means Better Blocking

**Reality:** What truly matters is the number of distinct third-party connections _allowed_, not just how many requests were blocked. A content blocker allowing fewer unique connections while potentially blocking fewer requests overall is often more effective in privacy protection.

### Myth #2: Ad Blocker Test Pages Provide Reliable Benchmarks

**Reality:** These test pages typically simulate artificial or unrealistic network requests designed to trigger blockers. They don't reflect real-world web behavior. Many blockers use stealth techniques that confound simple detection, making these tests misleading.

## Practical Tips for Users

- Focus on the **badge count** as a measure of your browsing privacy, aiming for the lowest distinct third-party domain connections.
- Use the **popup report** to see precisely which domains are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Remember that not all third parties are malicious; many legitimate services (such as widely used CDNs) enhance website performance and functionality.
- For filter list maintainers, uBO Scope offers invaluable visibility into network requests that might not be evident from conventional blockers.

## How This Fits Into Your Workflow

1. Install and activate uBO Scope.
2. Visit websites as normal and observe the badge count.
3. Open the popup to examine which third-party domains are categorized as allowed, blocked, or stealth.
4. Use this understanding to adjust your content blocker settings or filter lists, improving your privacy and browsing efficiency.
