## What You'll Get From uBO Scope

- **Real-Time Third-Party Network Request Tracking**  
  uBO Scope continuously monitors your browser's network requests to identify distinct third-party remote servers that webpages connect to during your browsing sessions.

- **Clear Distinction of Connection Outcomes**  
  Connections are categorized into three meaningful groups: 
  - **Not Blocked:** Connections that succeeded without interference.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were silently redirected or otherwise stealthily handled.
  - **Blocked:** Connections that failed or were explicitly blocked.

- **Distinct Third-Party Server Counting**  
  The extension tracks the count of unique third-party servers contacted, giving you clarity on your network exposure. The toolbar badge number represents this count, signaling the degree of external network activity.

- **Cross-Browser Support**  
  uBO Scope integrates seamlessly with modern browsers including Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari, utilizing each platform's `webRequest` API to report detailed network connection information.

- **Privacy-Respecting and Non-Intrusive Operation**  
  By focusing strictly on reporting network request outcomes using only browser APIs, uBO Scope respects user privacy and operates independently of content blockers in use, ensuring unbiased insights.

## Real-World Example: Reviewing Third-Party Connections

Imagine browsing to your favorite news site. Without uBO Scope, it's unclear how many outside servers the site contacts behind the scenes. When you open the uBO Scope popup:

- You see the domain of the current tab displayed with Unicode domain names for clarity.
- You find a summary count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- Below, domains are neatly grouped by outcome. For instance, CDN servers may appear in the “not blocked” group, while ad trackers may show up as “blocked” or “stealth-blocked.”

This clear breakdown instantly tells you how exposed your browsing session is and where privacy protections are working.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Check the Toolbar Badge Regularly:** A low badge count means fewer third-party connections, indicating better privacy.

- **Use with Any Content Blocker:** uBO Scope compliments rather than replaces blockers by showing real network activity post-blocking.

- **Interpret Counts Thoughtfully:** Not all connections are harmful. CDNs and legitimate services can inflate counts but are often necessary.

- **Refresh Your Browsing Session:** Clearing tabs updates accurate real-time data for your current web activities.

- **Explore Full Details in the Popup:** The popup panel organizes domains and gives counts—you can easily spot any suspicious domains that persist.
