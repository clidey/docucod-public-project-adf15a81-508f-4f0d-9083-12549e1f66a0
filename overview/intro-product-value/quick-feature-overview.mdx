# Key Features at a Glance

## A Snapshot of What uBO Scope Offers

uBO Scope is a powerful yet lightweight browser extension designed to provide clarity about your browser's network activity—specifically the connections your active tabs make to remote servers. This page summarizes its key features, helping you quickly understand why it is essential for privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers alike.

---

### Core Features

- **Live Domain Connection Reporting**: Continuously tracks and reports all third-party remote servers your current browser tab connects to, giving you immediate insight into network activity.

- **Toolbar Badge Breakdown**: The extension icon's badge shows the count of unique third-party domains contacted by the active tab, keeping you informed at a glance without opening any UI.

- **Detailed Popup Summary Table**: Beyond the badge, the popup UI breaks down connections into three clear categories—"not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked"—presented with domain counts for easy inspection.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Fully functional on Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari (version 18.5+), ensuring consistent experience regardless of your browser choice.

- **Independent of Any Specific Content Blocker**: Operates transparently alongside any content-blocking extension or DNS-level filtering. It reports network outcomes regardless of which blocker is active or even if none are present.

### Who Benefits Most?

- Privacy-conscious users seeking transparency on the remote servers their browser talks to.
- Users wanting an unbiased view of network requests unaffected by content blockers.
- Filter list maintainers looking for a reliable tool to audit and validate blocking effectiveness.

## What Does Each Feature Mean for You?

| Feature                      | What It Does for You                                   |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Live Domain Connection Reporting | See in real-time what external servers your browser contacts, enabling quick detection of unexpected or intrusive domains. |
| Toolbar Badge Breakdown       | Get immediate feedback on third-party connections without interrupting your browsing. |
| Detailed Popup Summary Table  | Understand the nuance of which connections were allowed, stealth-blocked (silently filtered), or explicitly blocked, helping you make informed privacy decisions. |
| Cross-Browser Compatibility   | Use the same trusted extension seamlessly across multiple browsers without learning new tools. |
| Independence From Blockers    | Trust that the data reflects real network outcomes, not skewed by the content blockers’ internal reporting. |

## How These Features Work Together

Imagine browsing the web with uBO Scope active:

1. As you load a webpage, uBO Scope instantly tracks every outgoing connection made by your tab, across HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and Secure WebSocket protocols.
2. The toolbar icon badge updates dynamically to show the count of distinct external domains contacted — a concise, immediate signal of your tab’s network footprint.
3. Clicking the icon reveals a detailed popup that categorizes connected domains into:
   - **Not Blocked:** Connections that were successful.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests silently prevented, often by content blockers to avoid detection.
   - **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked, showing what was prevented and why.
4. This accurate, blocker-agnostic reporting ensures that the displayed data reflects what really happens, giving you a trustworthy window into network activity.

## Practical Tips

- **Monitor the Toolbar Badge** regularly to quickly spot privacy shifts while browsing, such as sudden rises in third-party connections.
- Use the **popup domain breakdown** to identify suspicious or unwanted domains, enabling targeted blocking.
- Run uBO Scope alongside your content blocker during filter list testing to verify actual network outcomes.
- Remember the badge shows unique third-party domains contacted, not total requests; a lower count means fewer third-party contacts.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t interpret the badge count as a block count. It actually reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains—lower is better.
- Avoid relying on generic ad block test pages to judge blocker effectiveness; use uBO Scope’s transparent reporting instead.
- Note that uBO Scope can only capture requests observable by the browser’s `webRequest` API. Requests outside this scope (such as those made by some internal browser components) are not reported.
