# Core Value & Benefits of uBO Scope

Discover the tangible benefits that **uBO Scope** brings to your browsing experience, empowering you with transparency and actionable insights regarding the third-party connections initiated by your browser.

## Unveiling Hidden Connections

With **uBO Scope**, you gain a clear and immediate view into every third-party server your browser connects to from the active tab. This transparency allows privacy-conscious users to:

- **Identify all outgoing network requests** without interference from content blockers or filter lists.
- Understand precisely which domains and hostnames are contacted, providing clarity rather than guesswork.

Imagine browsing a news site and instantly knowing whether your browser silently connects to dozens of tracking or advertising servers. By lifting this veil, uBO Scope helps you reclaim control over your web footprint.

## Myth Busting Common Ad Blocker Assumptions

Many users assume that ad blockers fully conceal or block all tracking or advertising behavior. 

uBO Scope challenges these misconceptions by showing where browsers still engage with remote servers, irrespective of blocking decisions:

- See the reality behind ad blocking — what requests truly occur and which are stealthily redirected or blocked.
- Recognize stealth-blocked connections, helping you identify potential privacy leaks that aren't obvious in the browser UI.

This clarity supports more **fact-based privacy decisions** rather than relying on assumptions or hearsay.

## Actionable Network Insights at a Glance

The extension’s **badge count** on the browser toolbar provides a dynamic summary of third-party connections your active tab allows:

- The number displayed reflects the count of uniquely allowed domains contacted.
- A quick glance at the badge helps you stay informed without opening the popup.

Inside the **reporting popup**, connections are categorized into three distinct groups:

- **Not blocked (allowed)** — domains your browser connected to freely.
- **Stealth-blocked** — connections that were redirected or otherwise masked.
- **Blocked** — domains entirely prevented from loading.

Each group lists involved hostnames with call counts, enabling targeted exploration and understanding.

## Empowering Informed Privacy Choices

uBO Scope doesn’t just monitor connections; it equips you to:

- Reveal the actual network landscape behind websites.
- Debunk myths and misinformation about ad blockers and privacy tools.
- Make **data-driven decisions** about which sites and connections to trust or block.

Take control of your browsing privacy with confidence, backed by concrete evidence.

## Practical Examples

- When visiting an online retailer, instantly see if your session contacts unexpected ad networks or tracking services.
- Validate if a news portal loads social media scripts stealthily despite having ad blockers enabled.
- For developers and filter list maintainers, verify which domains need to be added or monitored based on real observed traffic.

## Tips for Maximizing Value

- Regularly observe the badge count and popup to familiarize yourself with normal versus unusual connection patterns.
- Use the categorized views to track stealth connections that content blockers often conceal.
- Combine uBO Scope’s insights with uBlock Origin to fine-tune your blocking preferences based on actual connection data.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t interpret low badge counts as complete privacy — always inspect stealth-blocked domains.
- Remember that stealth-blocked does not mean fully secure; it signifies redirections or potential obfuscations.
- Avoid relying solely on extensions claiming total blocking without inspection; uBO Scope encourages transparency over assumption.
