## Understanding Over-Trusted Sites

### What Are Over-Trusted Sites?
Over-trusted sites are domains that a website relies on heavily but may not warrant such trust given privacy risks or suspicious behavior. Identifying these is crucial because excessive third-party connections increase your browser's exposure surface.

### How uBO Scope Helps
uBO Scope reveals all distinct third-party domains contacted by your browser for each active tab. By focusing on the domains listed under "not blocked" in the popup, you can spot domains your browser talks to frequently that might demand review.

### Example workflow:
- Navigate to a website you trust.
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
- Review the "not blocked" domains list.
- Identify domains that appear unexpectedly often or seem unrelated to the site's core functionality.

### Practical Tip
Some domains might be legitimate CDNs or analytics services, so cross-reference with domain owners before making blocking decisions.

## Validating Your Filter Lists and Content Blockers

### The Challenge
Many users rely on filter lists and content blockers but lack visibility into whether these tools effectively block unwanted domains or inadvertently allow privacy-invasive connections.

### uBO Scope's Solution
uBO Scope provides an unfiltered count of all third-party remote servers contacted, unaffected by which content blocker or DNS-level blocking you use. This enables accurate validation of your filters' real impact.

### How to Use uBO Scope for Validation
1. Load a site with your content blocker active.
2. Open uBO Scope’s popup and note the counts and lists under "allowed", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked".
3. Temporarily disable your content blocker and observe changes in the popup.
4. Use this side-by-side to verify if your content blocker is effectively reducing distinct third-party connections.

### Best Practices
- Focus on the number of distinct third-party domains contacted, not just block counts.
- Use the "stealth-blocked" category to identify connections your filter hides to avoid webpage breakage.

## Debunking Misleading Ad-Blocker Test Results

### The Myth
Some users trust "ad blocker test" websites as accurate measures of content blocker effectiveness.

### Why They Mislead
These test pages generate artificial and unrealistic network requests, ignoring how extensions stealthily block content to avoid detection and breakage. Their results do not reflect real-world browsing privacy.

### Using uBO Scope Instead
Use uBO Scope to see actual network behavior on real websites rather than relying on synthetic test pages.

### What to Watch For
- Real websites show varying complex third-party connections;
- High block counts on test pages don't necessarily mean better privacy protection.

## Tips for Practical Adoption

- **Keep uBO Scope active during regular browsing** to get real-time insights into your exposure.
- **Regularly review connected domains** to discover new or suspicious third parties.
- **Incorporate insights into your privacy workflow** by adjusting blocking rules accordingly.
- **Share findings with filter list authors** to aid in improving public filter lists.

## Summary
By focusing on real-world network activity rather than arbitrary metrics, uBO Scope empowers users and filter list maintainers alike to make informed privacy decisions. Its granular view of third-party connections reveals where trust is misplaced and validates filtering effectiveness more reliably than traditional block counters or test sites.
