# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

## Unlocking Privacy Insights for the Right Users

uBO Scope is tailored primarily for two key groups: web privacy enthusiasts and filter list authors. This page explains who these users are, what they want to achieve, and how uBO Scope empowers them—whether for personal browsing privacy awareness or professional content blocker maintenance.

## For Web Privacy Enthusiasts

Imagine browsing the web and truly knowing every third-party connection your browser initiates. For privacy-conscious users, this knowledge is invaluable. uBO Scope reveals the unique third-party servers contacted by each website, helping you:

- **Gain Transparency**: See exactly which external domains your browser reaches out to, regardless of your current content blocker.
- **Evaluate Your Privacy Exposure**: Understand whether your existing blockers reduce network connections or just increase block counts.
- **Make Informed Decisions**: Identify stealthy or unexpected connections that might compromise your privacy.

### Real-World Scenario

Sarah uses multiple privacy extensions but wants to verify their effectiveness. She installs uBO Scope and observes the distinct third-party domains across her frequent sites. This helps Sarah detect subtle connections that her blockers miss, enabling better control and awareness.

### Best Practices for Enthusiasts

- Regularly check the toolbar badge count; a lower number means fewer unique third-party contacts.
- Review the categorized connection outcomes (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked) in the popup panel for granular insights.
- Use uBO Scope to debunk myths about ad blocker effectiveness, focusing on distinct servers contacted, not just block counts.

## For Filter List Authors

Filter list maintainers rely on accurate network connection data to improve blocking rules. uBO Scope serves as a powerful auditing and validation tool that:

- **Surfaces All Network Requests**: Captures requests even on devices or platforms with limited browser devtools access.
- **Shows Actual Outcomes**: Reports whether requests are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked, regardless of underlying blocking mechanisms.
- **Enables Rule Optimization**: Helps authors identify missed connections or ineffective rules for better filter list crafting.

### Practical Example

Mike maintains a content blocker filter list aiming to reduce third-party tracking. Using uBO Scope, he monitors real browsing sessions and uncovers domains that slip through his filters, assisting him in tightening his rules.

### Tips for List Authors

- Leverage uBO Scope on restricted environments (e.g., mobile browsers where devtools are limited).
- Analyze stealth and blocked outcomes to understand filter list behavior across different blocking techniques.
- Track session data over time to identify patterns and verify the stability of filtering rules.
