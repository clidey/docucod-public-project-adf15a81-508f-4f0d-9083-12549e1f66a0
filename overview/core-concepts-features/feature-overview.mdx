# Features at a Glance

uBO Scope equips users with a focused and transparent view into every network connection a webpage attempts or successfully completes, providing unprecedented insight into third-party contacts and connection outcomes. This page summarizes the core features and capabilities that make uBO Scope an essential tool for privacy-conscious users, filter list maintainers, and those who demand real transparency in their browsing experience.

## Core Features

### 1. Per-Tab Network Request Tracking
- **Tab-Specific Data:** uBO Scope records network requests distinctly per browser tab, ensuring that users can analyze exactly which domains each webpage connects to without confusion.
- **Detailed Outcome Categorization:** Requests are classified into three outcomes — **allowed** (successful connections), **stealth-blocked** (invisible redirects or blocks), and **blocked** (explicit request failures).

### 2. Popup Panel Visualization
- **Clear Summary:** The popup interface concisely displays the total number of distinct domains connected for the current tab, enabling quick assessment of third-party exposure.
- **Outcome Sections:** Separate sections list domains grouped by their network outcome status—helping users easily identify which third parties are allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.
- **Detailed Counts:** Each domain entry shows the number of requests, giving users a sense of interaction frequency with third-party servers.
- **Unicode Support:** Domain names display in Unicode, accurately rendering internationalized domain names for improved readability.

### 3. Toolbar Badge Counter
- **Distinct Third-Party Domain Count:** The extension’s badge on the browser toolbar shows the number of unique third-party domains with active connections for the current tab.
- **Privacy Indicator:** Since the badge count reflects distinct contacted third parties rather than block counts, it serves as a more meaningful privacy exposure metric.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Badge count dynamically updates as network request outcomes change, giving real-time feedback.

### 4. Compatibility with All Content Blockers
- **Unbiased Monitoring:** uBO Scope uses the browser’s `webRequest` API listeners, allowing it to track and report network requests regardless of the content blocker (extension-based or DNS-based) in use.
- **Comprehensive Visibility:** Even stealth-blocked requests and DNS-blocked connections are accounted for as long as they go through the browser’s API reporting channel.

### 5. Efficient Recording and Session Management
- **Session Data Persistence:** Network request outcomes are serialized and stored in the browser session, allowing consistent data tracking across tab reloads and browser restarts.
- **Performance Optimization:** Network requests are batched and processed asynchronously to maintain extension responsiveness without dropping events.

## How These Features Benefit You

- **Accurate Privacy Assessment:** By tracking connections per tab and counting distinct third-party domains, uBO Scope provides a practical metric for privacy risks beyond misleading block counts.
- **Clear Visualization:** The popup panel makes network request data easy to interpret, empowering users to make informed decisions about filtering and blocking.
- **Real-Time Awareness:** The badge updates offer an at-a-glance summary, helping users monitor ongoing network activity effortlessly.
- **Broad Compatibility:** No matter which content blocking setup you have—be it extension filters or DNS blocking—uBO Scope reliably reports network outcomes.

## Real-World Example Scenario

Imagine browsing a webpage that loads content from multiple third-party providers. With uBO Scope installed and active:

- The toolbar badge immediately shows the number of distinct remote servers contacted.
- Opening the popup panel, you see which domains the page successfully connected to, which were stealth-blocked (e.g., hidden redirects that failed), and which were blocked outright.
- The numeric counts next to each domain indicate how heavily your page interacts with each entity.
- If you switch between content blockers or enable DNS-based blocking, uBO Scope’s reports remain consistent and reliable, revealing the true effectiveness of your privacy tools.

This insight is invaluable for discerning true third-party exposure and debunking misleading claims based on block counts alone.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Regularly Check the Badge:** Use the badge count as a quick privacy overview—fewer distinct third parties generally means better tracking protection.
- **Use the Popup for Details:** Investigate the popup’s allowed, stealth, and blocked lists to understand the nature of the connections your browser makes.
- **Consider Stealth-Blocked Domains:** These may indicate redirects or filtering mechanisms at work; knowing them helps refine your content blocking strategy.
- **Combine With Filter Lists:** Use uBO Scope alongside trusted filter lists to validate which domains are allowed through.
- **Remember Limitations:** Network requests outside the `webRequest` API’s reporting scope, such as those made by the browser directly or certain HTTPS connections, cannot be tracked.
