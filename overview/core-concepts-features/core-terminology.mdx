# Key Terminology

Understanding the key terms used within the uBO Scope extension is essential to interpreting the data presented in its popup user interface. This page introduces and clarifies the critical concepts such as 'allowed', 'blocked', and 'stealth' outcomes, the role of 'third-party remote servers', and the significance of the badge count.

## What You Will Learn

- Definitions of major connection outcome categories.
- Explanation of third-party remote servers.
- How the badge count reflects your real privacy impact.
- Why these terms matter as you analyze the popup panel.

## Connection Outcomes: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth

uBO Scope classifies network requests originating from a webpage into three primary outcome categories, displayed in distinct sections within the popup UI:

### Allowed
- These are network connections **successfully established and not blocked** by any content blocking mechanism.
- Represent third-party servers from which resources were fetched by the current webpage.
- The 'Allowed' section shows domains and counts representing these active connections.

### Blocked
- These requests were **explicitly prevented or failed** due to content blocking rules or privacy filters.
- The 'Blocked' section lists domains where connection attempts were thwarted.
- Blocked connections indicate a privacy benefit, as data exchange with the respective remote servers was stopped.

### Stealth (Stealth-Blocked)
- Stealth refers to connection attempts that were **silently blocked or redirected**, often to avoid breaking webpages or revealing blocking activity.
- Unlike the 'Blocked' category, stealth-blocked connections may appear as if allowed from the webpage perspective, but in reality, the data exchange was prevented.
- This ensures your browsing experience remains smooth without revealing the presence of blockers.


<Tip>
The **'stealth' outcome is a sophisticated privacy mechanism** that balances blocking effectiveness with user experience by quietly stopping tracking attempts without alerting the site.

## Third-Party Remote Servers

Understanding what counts as a _third-party remote server_ helps clarify the core privacy metric uBO Scope tracks.

- **Third-party servers** are those that are external to the main site you are visiting.
- They typically provide services like advertisements, analytics, fonts, or content delivery networks (CDNs).
- While not all third-party servers are malicious or invasive, a large number of them can result in increased tracking and data sharing.
- uBO Scope identifies and groups connections by registrable domains derived from hostnames, using a trusted public suffix list to accurately distinguish between first-party and third-party domains.


<Note>
For domain parsing and public suffix determination, uBO Scope relies on the official list maintained by https://publicsuffix.org, ensuring correct categorization of domains.

## Badge Count: Your Privacy Impact Score

The badge number displayed on the browser toolbar icon is one of uBO Scope's most valuable insights:

- It shows **the count of distinct third-party domains successfully connected to** by the current webpage.
- A **lower badge count means fewer third-party contacts**, reflecting a smaller exposed surface to tracking or data collection.
- The badge count focuses on domains, not the total number of requests, thus giving a clearer picture of third-party exposure compared to simplistic block count numbers.


<Warning>
Do not confuse this badge count with total blocked requests or ads blocked. It is specifically tuned to represent the unique and distinct third-party remote connections allowed, which correlates strongly with privacy risk.
</Warning>

## Why These Terms Matter in the Popup UI

When you open the uBO Scope popup, you see three main outcome sections, each listing domains with a badge count. Knowing what these terms mean enables you to:

- Quickly assess how many third-party domains your browsing session is exposed to.
- Understand if connections are truly allowed, blocked outright, or stealthily blocked.
- Make informed decisions on adjusting filter lists or privacy settings to reduce unwanted connections.
- Avoid relying on misleading metrics like raw block counts, instead focusing on meaningful privacy indicators.

## Practical Example

Imagine visiting an online news site:

- The **allowed** section might list `fonts.gstatic.com` and `cdn.jsdelivr.net` indicating necessary resources fetched.
- The **stealth** section might show `tracker.example.com` indicating attempts at tracking quietly blocked.
- The **blocked** section might list `ads.adnetwork.com` showing ad scripts actively prevented.
- The badge count would display the number of unique allowed third-party domains (e.g., 2 in this case).

This layered insight helps you grasp your actual exposure and uBO Scope’s effectiveness.

## Summary

| Term          | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Allowed       | Connections made successfully without blocking               |
| Blocked       | Connections prevented or failed due to blocking               |
| Stealth       | Connections silently blocked or redirected to avoid detection|
| Third-Party   | Domains outside the current site's registered domain          |
| Badge Count   | Number of distinct allowed third-party domains connected     |
