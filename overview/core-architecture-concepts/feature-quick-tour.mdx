# Feature Quick Tour

Welcome to the feature quick tour of uBO Scope—the compact yet powerful interface that puts detailed third-party connection insights at your fingertips. This walkthrough quickly orients you to the popup interface, showing you where to find domain summaries, how to interpret various sections, and what each part of the UI reveals about your browsing exposure. Use this guide as a foundational step before diving deeper into configurations, troubleshooting, or advanced analysis.

## What You See: The Popup Interface at a Glance

When you click the uBO Scope browser action icon, the popup opens, displaying real-time connection summaries for the active browser tab.

### Hostname Display — Know Your Current Site

At the top, you see the hostname of the webpage you’re currently visiting, broken down into two parts:

- The *subdomain* or additional hostname portion (if present).
- The *base domain* (the core recognizable domain name).

For example, on `news.example.com`, `news.` is the subdomain, and `example.com` is the base domain shown clearly.

This immediate context assures you which site’s network activity you're analyzing.

### Summary Section — Total Third-Party Domains Connected

Below the hostname, a straightforward summary shows the total number of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to on this tab. This count corresponds to the domains whitelisted as allowed connections (not stealth or blocked). 

**Why does this matter?**

A lower count here generally means fewer external exposures from third-party trackers, advertisers, or content distribution networks, empowering you with a quick health check of your browsing privacy.

### Outcome Sections — The Heart of uBO Scope’s Insights

uBO Scope classifies third-party domains into three categories, each presented as a distinct section:

#### Not Blocked
These are domains your browser successfully connected to during this browsing session. This section lists each domain and the number of requests or resources loaded from it.

#### Stealth-Blocked
Domains appearing here were stealth-blocked — meaning requests to these domains were interrupted or hidden in a way that typical web pages or scripts cannot detect the blocking easily. This subtle outcome indicates advanced blocking techniques that enhance privacy without disruption.

#### Blocked
This section shows domains that uBO Scope detected as blocked outright. Such domains had network requests denied or failed, reflecting blocks applied by content blockers or other security measures.

Each domain entry shows the domain name and a badge indicating how many connections were made or blocked during the tab’s current lifecycle.

## How to Interpret the Domain Lists

- Domains are sorted alphabetically for easy lookup.
- The count next to each domain reveals the volume of network interactions.
- Domains appear in their Unicode representation for full clarity, thanks to integrated Punycode decoding.

For example, if you see `cdn.example.net` with a count of 10 under _Not Blocked_, it means ten requests were successfully made to that CDN domain.

## Using This View Effectively

### Real-World Scenario
Imagine you’re browsing a news website. 

- By glancing at the summary count, you see it connected to 7 third-party domains.
- In the ‘Not Blocked’ section, you spot familiar domains like major CDNs or social media platforms.
- The ‘Stealth-Blocked’ section lists domains your content blocker covertly prevented, increasing your privacy while keeping the site functional.
- The ‘Blocked’ section confirms domains you explicitly blocked or which failed to connect.

This combined view delivers actionable insights: which third parties your browser contacts, which ones are blocked stealthily or obviously, helping you make informed decisions about your privacy settings.

### Tips for Success

- Regularly consult the popup as you visit new websites to spot unusual third-party connections.
- Use the domain counts to gauge the intensity of third-party resources—higher counts may affect performance or privacy.
- Consult the ‘Stealth-Blocked’ and ‘Blocked’ lists to verify your content blocker’s effect beyond just what the browser reports publicly.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting and FAQs">
<Accordion title="Why is the domain list sometimes empty or shows 'NO DATA'?">
If you see 'NO DATA' or empty lists, it means uBO Scope has not yet recorded network connections for the current tab. This can happen if the page just loaded or is a new tab with no content. Refreshing the page or waiting a moment will typically populate the data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some domains appear in multiple sections?">
Domains are classified distinctly in one outcome category per request lifecycle, but over time, domains can move between outcomes depending on how requests succeed or fail. The popup represents a snapshot of the current tab state.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does the badge number on the browser action icon represent?">
The badge shows the count of *allowed* third-party domains — those not blocked or stealth-blocked — thus reflecting the breadth of third-party exposure. A lower badge count generally indicates better privacy control.
