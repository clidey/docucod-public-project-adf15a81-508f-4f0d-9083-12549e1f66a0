# Key Concepts & Terminology

Understanding uBO Scope’s reporting hinges on mastering a few essential terms. This page clarifies the meaning of key labels like 'distinct third-party remote server,' as well as how requests are categorized as **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth blocked**. By mastering these concepts, you will confidently interpret the data shown in the popup and toolbar badge, empowering you to make informed privacy and security decisions.

## Distinct Third-Party Remote Server

A **distinct third-party remote server** refers to any server that is *not* the primary domain of the website you're visiting but is nevertheless contacted by the browser. For example, if you visit `example.com` and it loads resources from `cdn.example.net` and `ads.partner.org`, each of those counts as a distinct third-party server.

- **Why it matters:** Reducing the number of distinct third-party connections limits your exposure to tracking and potential privacy risks, as well as improves performance.
- uBO Scope’s toolbar badge reflects the number of these distinct servers for which *allowed* network connections were made.


## Request Outcome Categories

Each network request observed by uBO Scope falls into one of these classifications, which are reflected in the UI under three main sections:

### 1. Allowed Requests

Network connections that successfully fetched resources, meaning the request was allowed by the browser and content blockers.

- These reflect third-party servers your browser really contacted and downloaded data from.
- Within the popup, domains associated with allowed requests are displayed under “not blocked.”

### 2. Blocked Requests

Network requests that were explicitly blocked by a content blocker or extension before any data was received.

- These requests failed to connect through normal means, often resulting in a failure event.
- Domains relating to these requests appear under the “blocked” section in the popup.

### 3. Stealth Blocked Requests

Requests that were blocked in a way that does not generate a failure event visible to the page or standard blocking APIs. These are requests suppressed quietly or redirected to prevent detection.

- They represent techniques to block requests while minimizing webpage breakage or script detection of the blocker.
- Domains connected to stealth blocked requests are shown under the “stealth-blocked” section.


## Labels and Counts in the User Interface

To clarify what you see in the popup panel:

- **Domains**: Each domain represents a distinct remote server identified by its registrable domain (e.g., `example.net`).
- **Counts**: Indicate how many requests have occurred for that domain in the current browsing context.
- The **total domain count** shown in the summary reflects how many unique third-party domains have been contacted in the active tab.

### Interpreting the Sections

| Section        | Meaning                                                           | User Takeaway                                                                |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Not Blocked    | Domains from which network requests successfully loaded resources | These are third-party servers actively contacted and potentially exposing data |
| Stealth-Blocked| Domains where requests were suppressed without API failure events | These indicate subtle blocking that prevents requests from succeeding quietly |
| Blocked        | Domains from which requests were explicitly blocked or failed     | Third-party connections your blocker prevented clearly                         |


## Common Scenarios and How uBO Scope Reflects Them

### Scenario 1: Legitimate CDN Content
A page loads JavaScript and images from a trusted CDN. These domains appear in the **not blocked** section with counts reflecting request frequency.

### Scenario 2: Malicious or Undesired Ad Servers
Requests to known ad or tracking servers are blocked by your content blocker, listed under the **blocked** or **stealth-blocked** sections, indicating successful prevention.

### Scenario 3: Stealth Blocking to Avoid Page Breakage
Sometimes, to avoid breakage, blockers silently prevent certain requests without an error event. These domains surface under **stealth-blocked**, signaling subtle control.


## Practical Tips

- Use the domain counts to identify high-frequency third-party servers contacting your browser.
- A lower **not blocked** count generally signifies better network privacy.
- Check **stealth-blocked** entries to understand hidden suppression that might not be obvious from failure counts alone.
- Combine this knowledge with your content blocker settings to optimize your web experience.


## Troubleshooting Common Misinterpretations

- **Misconception:** High block counts mean better blocking.
  - _Reality:_ High block counts can coincide with more domains loaded, meaning less effective blocking overall.

- **Misconception:** Stealth blocking is a failure.
  - _Reality:_ Stealth blocking is a deliberate technique improving blocking stealth and reducing webpage breakage.

- **Misconception:** Every domain shown is suspicious.
  - _Reality:_ Many third-party domains are legitimate, such as CDNs, analytics, or payment providers.
