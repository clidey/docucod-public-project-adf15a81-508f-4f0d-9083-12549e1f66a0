# Feature Overview

Discover the essential capabilities of uBO Scope at a glance. This page details the core functionalities that make uBO Scope an indispensable tool for revealing and understanding third-party network connections while you browse.

## Real-Time Counting of Third-Party Remote Servers

At the heart of uBO Scope is its ability to continuously monitor your browser’s network requests and keep a live tally of distinct third-party domains contacted by each browser tab. This count is reflected immediately in the toolbar badge, providing an at-a-glance indicator of your exposure to remote servers.

- **Accurate Metrics:** Counts only unique third-party remote servers a tab connects to, focusing on meaningful privacy indicators.
- **Immediate Feedback:** The badge updates dynamically to reflect changing network conditions as you navigate.

***Example:** When visiting a typical webpage, the badge might show ‘5’, meaning five separate third-party domains were connected to — allowing you to assess your actual privacy footprint instantly.*

## Toolbar Badge Integration

The toolbar icon serves as your dashboard’s frontline. The badge attached to the uBO Scope icon delivers a numeric summary of your browsing session's network footprint:

- **Visibility:** Displays the number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections for the active tab.
- **Simplicity:** No confusing metrics – a direct count that helps you quickly grasp third-party activity.
- **Interaction:** Clicking the icon opens the popup with deeper details (covered below).

## Informative Popup Visualization

Beyond the count, uBO Scope provides a detailed popup interface that unfolds the story behind the badge:

- **Domain Breakdown:** Lists all distinct third-party domains contacted by the active tab, categorized by
  - **Not Blocked:** Connections allowed by your current content blockers
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections blocked stealthily without obvious indicators
  - **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked

- **Request Counts:** Each listed domain shows how many requests were made, helping you identify heavy network interactions.
- **Unicode Support:** The popup displays domain names using their proper Unicode representation for better readability, especially for international domains.

*This popup empowers users to interrogate their browsing in fine detail, revealing which domains are involved behind the scenes and how content blockers are performing.*

## Support for Multiple Browsers

uBO Scope is designed for versatility and broad compatibility across modern browsers:

- **Chromium-Based Browsers:** Fully supported with MV3-compliant integration.
- **Mozilla Firefox:** Supports recent Firefox versions with tailored manifest and API usage.
- **Safari:** Supports Safari 18.5 and above, with adaptations for Safari extension guidelines.

This multi-browser support ensures that your workflow remains consistent regardless of your browser preference.

## Behind the Scenes: Reliable Network Request Monitoring

While this page focuses on user-visible features, it’s important to understand the reliability of uBO Scope’s data:

- Uses browser `webRequest` API listeners to monitor network requests in real time.
- Records outcomes for each request including allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked, redirects, and errors.
- Aggregates counts by domains and hostnames for clear reporting.

This architecture provides a robust and trustworthy snapshot of your true network exposure, unaffected by the content blocker in use.

## Practical Use Case: Visualizing a Complex Site

Imagine you are investigating a news website known for heavy third-party advertising:

1. Load the website and glance at the badge number immediately.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup and see the categorized domain list.
3. Identify which third-party domains are allowed versus stealth-blocked or blocked.
4. This insight helps you fine-tune your content blocker settings or evaluate filter lists if you are a maintainer.

## Tips for Effective Use

- **Interpret the Badge Correctly:** A lower badge count means fewer distinct third-party connections and typically better privacy.
- **Refresh Often:** Navigation on a tab resets counts; revisit the popup after new loads for fresh insights.
- **Combine with Other Tools:** Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker’s UI to verify effectiveness.

## Troubleshooting Common Display Issues

If the badge does not update or the popup shows no data:

- Ensure the extension permissions include all necessary webRequest scopes.
- Confirm your browser version supports the extension’s API features.
- Reload the tab or restart the browser to reset session data.
- Check for conflicts with other privacy tools that may interfere with webRequest APIs.

## Summary

uBO Scope’s feature set is focused on delivering a transparent and user-friendly view into your browsing's third-party network connections:

- Real-time counting visualized in a browser toolbar badge
- Detailed popup with categorized domain lists and request counts
- Multi-browser support with seamless integration

By understanding these features, you gain the tools to see exactly what network interactions your browser initiates, regardless of your content blocking setup.
