# Key Features at a Glance

Experience a real-time window into your browser's network activity with uBO Scope's core features designed for clarity, transparency, and reliability. This page highlights the essential capabilities that empower you to precisely understand which external connections your browser establishes—whether allowed, stealthily blocked, or fully blocked—independent of any content blocking in place.

---

## Real-Time Active Connection Display

uBO Scope tracks every connection attempt your browser makes to third-party servers as it happens. The extension dynamically updates a live list that shows all domains associated with these connections, categorized by their outcome:

- **Not Blocked** (allowed connections)
- **Stealth Blocked** (connections suppressed silently during redirection)
- **Blocked** (connections explicitly denied or errored)

This immediate visibility lets you observe network behavior without delay, helping you spot unexpected or privacy-invasive third-party domains.

### How It Works for You
Imagine you're browsing a site and want to audit where your data might be going. You click the uBO Scope icon and see an instant, organized snapshot of domains connected to your active tab. This real-time insight is critical for privacy aficionados and filter list maintainers alike.

## Clear Categorization by Connection Outcome

The extension groups connections by outcome, giving you a straightforward way to interpret network activity:

- Domains that your browser successfully reached
- Domains blocked silently by stealth methods (often by filter rules that redirect requests without page interruption)
- Domains fully blocked or resulting in network errors

Each category presents domains alongside counts of how many connection attempts were made, offering detailed clues on filtering effectiveness and third-party presence.

### Practical Example
If you see a domain listed under "stealth blocked," it means a request was intercepted and suppressed quietly—helping you understand stealth blocking behavior without guesswork.

## Cross-Browser Support

uBO Scope supports all major browsers—including Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari—ensuring a consistent, dependable experience regardless of your choice. The extension leverages the browser's `webRequest` API for comprehensive monitoring, guaranteeing that connections are tracked uniformly across platforms.

## Independence from Content-Blocking Mechanisms

Unlike traditional network monitors, uBO Scope doesn't depend on any content-blocking extension or DNS-based filtering to measure network connections. It listens directly to the browser's networking layer, capturing connection attempts irrespective of:

- Installed blockers like uBlock Origin or others
- DNS filtering setups

This makes it the definitive tool to audit your browser's real third-party network communications without bias.

## Utility for Network Transparency and Filter List Verification

Beyond privacy monitoring, uBO Scope serves as an invaluable tool for:

- **Filter List Maintainers:** Verify if filter lists correctly block or stealth block targeted domains.
- **Security Analysts:** Detect suspicious or unexpected connection attempts in real time.
- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Understand the exact third-party domains reached by visited sites.

Its clear UI and categorization make it easier to audit and identify filter list gaps or over-blocking scenarios.

## Visual Breakdown of the Popup UI

The extension’s popup interface presents a clean design:

- **Hostname Header:** Shows the active tab’s hostname and registered domain in a human-readable format.
- **Summary Section:** Displays a total count of distinct connected third-party domains.
- **Outcome Sections:** Separate grouping for allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains, each listing the domain name and its connection count.

Every domain name shown is converted from punycode to Unicode for clarity.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Use in Conjunction with Content Blockers:** Although independent, uBO Scope complements blockers by verifying their effectiveness objectively.
- **Interpret Badge Count Wisely:** The toolbar badge shows the number of distinct allowed third-party domains; fewer allowed domains generally indicate tighter filtering.
- **Refresh Your Tab:** Connection data updates automatically but reloading a tab can ensure all new network activity is captured.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Not Seeing Data?** If the popup says "NO DATA," switch to an active web page tab where network requests occur.
- **Expect All Network Traffic?** Some requests may not be intercepted if handled outside the browser’s webRequest API scope.
