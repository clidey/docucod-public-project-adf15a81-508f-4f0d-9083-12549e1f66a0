# Essential Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the language of uBO Scope is critical to unlocking its full value. This guide explains the core terms used throughout uBO Scope — such as 'allowed', 'blocked', and 'stealth' domain outcomes — and clarifies how third-party remote server connections are counted. It also demystifies the badge icon count displayed on the toolbar, enabling you to correctly interpret uBO Scope’s reports for better insights into your browsing network activity.

## Fundamental Terms

### Allowed Domains

These are domains to which the browser has successfully connected without blocking. They represent third-party servers from which resources were fetched during page loading.

- **User Intent**: Understand which external servers were contacted openly.
- **Benefit**: Identifies the actual third-party endpoints involved in page composition, independent of blocking behavior.

### Blocked Domains

These domains represent third-party servers whose requests were prevented from completing — typically due to content blocking rules or failures in network connection.

- **User Intent**: Know which third parties were denied access.
- **Benefit**: Helps validate and quantify your content blocker's effectiveness.

### Stealth Domains

Stealth domains are connections that uBO Scope identifies as redirected or “hidden” attempts, often arising from redirection chains or subtle content blocker interactions.

- **User Intent**: Detect potentially covert or indirect third-party connections.
- **Benefit**: Reveals connections that might bypass some blocking methods or use redirections.

## Third-Party Remote Server Connections and Counting

uBO Scope focuses on _distinct_ third-party domains contacted during your browsing session. Here’s how it treats the counting:

1. **Third-Party Definition**: Any domain that is not the same as the page’s main domain is considered third-party.
2. **Distinctness**: Multiple requests to the same third-party domain count as a single connection for the badge count, emphasizing unique remote servers.
3. **Domains vs. Hostnames**: While uBO Scope internally tracks at the hostname level, the badge count and summary focus on effective domains — the registrable, organizational domain part (e.g., `example.com`), leveraging the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to correctly identify domain boundaries.

This approach ensures you get a clear, aggregated count of unique third-party servers involved, simplifying analysis and avoiding double counting caused by subdomains.

## Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count

The toolbar badge's numeric count corresponds to the number of distinct third-party domains allowed (i.e., connected to successfully) for the active tab.

- A higher badge count means more third-party connections, which can imply greater exposure to external networks.
- Conversely, a lower count suggests fewer third-party remote servers were contacted — generally better for privacy and security.

> **Important:** The count reflects _unique_ domains, so repeated requests to the same third-party domain do not inflate the count.

### Practical Example

Imagine visiting a news website. The main site loads from `news.example.com`. During loading, resources are fetched from various third-party domains:

| Domain                | Connection Outcome |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| ads.tracking.com      | Blocked            |
| cdn.example.com       | Allowed            |
| analytics.example.org | Stealth            |
| fonts.provider.net    | Allowed            |

- The badge count will *count* `cdn.example.com` and `fonts.provider.net` (2 allowed third-party domains).
- `ads.tracking.com` is blocked, so it does not increase the badge count.
- `analytics.example.org` shows as stealth but is not counted towards the badge (only allowed domains count).

## Why These Terms Matter

uBO Scope’s value lies in giving you transparency and clarity on your browser's third-party network activity. Without understanding these basic terms, you might misinterpret data:

- Confusing blocked with stealth domains may cause false assumptions about your content blocker's effectiveness.
- Misreading the badge count might lead you to overlook the scope of allowed connections.

Knowing how uBO Scope categorizes and counts domains helps you make informed decisions about your privacy and security settings.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Focus on Allowed Count:** Use the badge count as a primary measure of exposure to third-party domains.
- **Analyze Stealth Domains:** Investigate stealth domains for hidden or redirected connections, which might reveal bypasses or unexpected behaviors.
- **Validate Content Blocking:** Cross-reference blocked and allowed domains to understand blocker performance.
- **Domain Normalization:** Trust that uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List to map hostnames accurately to their effective domains, avoiding confusion over subdomains.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Terminology Questions">
<Accordion title="Why don’t stealth domains count towards the badge number?">
Stealth domains indicate redirections or edge cases, not straightforward allowed connections. Counting only allowed domains keeps the badge count meaningful and focused on actual resource loads.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can the badge number exceed the number of visible third-party domains in reports?">
No. The badge count strictly represents distinct allowed third-party domains. Some UI views might show hostnames or multiple entries under a domain, but the badge aggregates uniquely.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if I see a zero badge but the site still loads external content?">
This may indicate content loaded from the first-party domain itself or network requests outside uBO Scope’s reporting scope, such as requests not captured by the browser's webRequest API.
</Accordion>
