# Feature Quick Tour

Welcome to the Feature Quick Tour of uBO Scope—a powerful yet lightweight browser extension designed to give you an unparalleled window into your browser's third-party network connections. This tour highlights the core capabilities that empower you to understand and audit remote server connections effectively, regardless of the content blockers in use.

---

## Key Features at a Glance

- **Tracking Third-Party Remote Connections**  
  Instantly see every third-party remote server your active browser tab contacts, whether connections are successful, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.

- **Real-Time Domain Statistics for Active Tabs**  
  Monitor dynamic domain-level stats while browsing. uBO Scope refreshes this data live as your browsing context evolves, giving you insight into background connections without guesswork.

- **Badge Counts for Quick Assessment**  
  The browser toolbar icon’s badge count displays the number of distinct third-party remote domains for your current tab. A lower count means fewer third-party connections — a quick privacy health check at a glance.

- **Extensive Reporting Independent of Content Blocker Type**  
  Whether your content blocker operates inside the browser or intercepts connections externally (e.g., DNS-based filtering), uBO Scope reports all network request outcomes as long as the browser's webRequest API tracks them.

---

## What You Can Achieve with These Features

Imagine browsing your favorite site and instantly seeing not just what content loads, but the full spectrum of all domains in contact behind the scenes—those allowed through, those silently blocked, and those explicitly blocked. This transparency helps you:

- Validate that your blocker is effective without relying solely on raw block counts.
- Identify unexpected or excessive third-party requests that might affect privacy or performance.
- Debunk misleading "ad blocker test" sites by examining the actual network request outcomes.
- Audit content blocking behavior for filter list maintenance or personal privacy verification.

## Detailed Feature Breakdown

### Tracking and Display of Third-Party Remote Connections

Every network request your browser attempts is meticulously tracked and categorized:

- **Allowed connections:** Third-party domains your browser successfully contacted.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Requests hidden from the page via stealth blocking techniques.
- **Blocked connections:** Requests that were explicitly blocked by your content blocker.

The popup UI lets you see counted domains and request totals within each category. This granular detail enables you to assess connections beyond the simple "blocked" vs. "allowed" dichotomy.

### Real-Time Domain Statistics for Active Tabs

uBO Scope works tab by tab, presenting stat summaries tailored to your current active tab. As you navigate across websites or interact with dynamic content, uBO Scope updates these statistics in real-time.

This continuous update cycle means you always have the latest insight into how many and which third-party domains are involved in the background, without needing to reload or manually refresh.

### Badge Counts for Quick Assessment

The extension’s toolbar icon features a badge that visibly displays the count of distinct third-party domains contacted from your current tab. This number offers a quick, at-a-glance indication of exposure to remote servers.

A low badge count often correlates with higher privacy since your browser is connecting to fewer external sources. Monitoring this count helps you notice spikes in third-party connections that may indicate trackers or unwanted resource loading.

### Reporting Regardless of Active Content Blocker

One of uBO Scope’s most valuable differentiators is its ability to report on network requests outcomes *regardless of which content blocker you use*. This includes:

- Extension-based blockers like uBlock Origin.
- DNS or network-level filtering tools.
- Any other system that the webRequest API in your browser can observe.

Because it relies on the browser's native webRequest API, uBO Scope offers unbiased reporting even when multiple blockers or filtering layers operate simultaneously.

## Tips for Success and Common Pitfalls

- **Interpreting Badge Counts:** Remember, a low number is better — it means fewer third-party connections. However, some third-party domains, such as CDN providers, are common and usually innocuous.

- **Checking Stealth Blocks:** Stealth-blocked requests won’t be obvious on most content blockers. Use uBO Scope to reveal these hidden connections for a fuller picture.

- **Compatibility Reminder:** To report all possible network events, ensure your browser version supports the webRequest API fully (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

- **Refreshing Data:** The popup UI updates automatically as you switch tabs or navigate, but if you notice stale data, try clicking the extension icon again to force a refresh.

- **Understanding the Data:** If you are new to network requests terminology, reviewing [Core Concepts and Terminology](overview/introduction-core-concepts/core-concepts-and-terminology) is strongly recommended.
