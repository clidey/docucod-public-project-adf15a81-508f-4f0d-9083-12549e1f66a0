# Target Audience & Use Cases

## Who Benefits Most from uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is designed with a focused audience in mind — people who want a transparent, clear window into the network connections initiated by the web pages they visit. It delivers value to:

- **Privacy-Conscious Users** who want to identify and understand which domains their browser connects to when loading a webpage.
- **Filter List Maintainers** who need reliable, real-world network request data to maintain and improve content blocking rules.
- **Content Blocker Evaluators** who want an objective tool to analyze the effectiveness of different blocking solutions beyond common myths and misleading benchmarks.

By exposing detailed analytics of network connections, uBO Scope empowers these users to make more informed decisions about privacy and content blocking.

## Typical Scenarios Where uBO Scope Shines

### Investigating Website Trackers

Imagine you're curious about how many third-party trackers a website attempts to connect with. By opening uBO Scope's popup panel while browsing, you see an organized list of domains grouped by their fate: allowed, stealth-blocked (requests silently redirected or hidden), or outright blocked. This transparency:[-] helps you quickly identify unexpected or suspicious trackers,[-] understand which content blocking rules are effective,[-] and verify that privacy protections are working.

### Debunking Ad Blocker Myths

Many users believe that a higher block count means a better content blocker. However, uBO Scope clarifies this misconception by showing that the true impact lies in the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected—not just those blocked. 

With uBO Scope, you can directly observe that a content blocker with fewer blocked domains may actually be more effective if it allows fewer remote connections overall.

### Diagnosing Filter List Effectiveness on Locked-Down Devices

Filter list maintainers often need to validate their rules on devices where traditional browser developer tools are unavailable or limited.

uBO Scope offers a lightweight, easily accessible solution to:
- Collect network request outcomes,
- See which domains are blocked or allowed,
- Troubleshoot filter lists remotely or in restricted environments.

This makes it indispensable for maintainers aiming to optimize filters for real-world conditions.

## How the Target Audience Interacts with the uBO Scope Popup Panel

When a user clicks the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup panel immediately displays:

- **Hostname Header:** Shows the current webpage’s hostname and domain in an easily readable format.
- **Summary Section:** Reports the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- **Outcome Sections:** Three clear groups display domains based on request outcomes:
  - *Not Blocked* — connections allowed by the content blocker.
  - *Stealth-Blocked* — connections silently redirected or handled without explicit blocking.
  - *Blocked* — connections that were outright blocked.

Each domain entry also shows a count of the number of requests associated with it, helping users gauge the intensity of connection attempts.

## Best Practices and Tips for Using uBO Scope

- **Use uBO Scope in Real Browsing Situations:** For accurate analysis, open the popup panel on pages you visit naturally, rather than artificial test sites that do not reflect real-world behavior.

- **Beware of Misleading 'Ad Blocker Test' Sites:** These tests often generate synthetic traffic patterns that don’t correspond to genuine browsing and can misrepresent content blocker performance. uBO Scope helps you see actual network requests underlying your browsing experience.

- **Compare Distinct Domains, Not Just Block Counts:** Focus on how many unique third-party domains are allowed versus blocked rather than raw block numbers to assess privacy protection.

- **Leverage for Filter List Diagnostics:** If you manage filter lists, regularly check your blocking rules with uBO Scope, especially on devices without advanced tools, to ensure expected coverage.

## Summary

uBO Scope provides essential analytics for understanding third-party network connections tied to webpage loads. By categorizing these connections by their outcome, it empowers users and maintainers to evaluate privacy impacts, clarify misconceptions about content blockers, and troubleshoot filter effectiveness.

Use uBO Scope’s popup panel during real browsing to gain actionable insight and take control of your web privacy landscape.
