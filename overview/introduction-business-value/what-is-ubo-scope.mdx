# What is uBO Scope?

Discover uBO Scope, a straightforward browser extension purpose-built to expose every connection your browser attempts or successfully makes to remote servers. By revealing this network activity, uBO Scope empowers you with clear visibility into third-party tracking domains and overall web privacy behaviors.

## Unlock Complete Visibility into Network Connections

When you activate uBO Scope, it instantly lists all remote endpoints contacted by the webpage you're currently viewing. This includes connections that were:

- Allowed through by your browser or content blockers
- Stealthily blocked without your direct notice
- Explicitly blocked due to content blocking rules

This comprehensive insight lets you uncover hidden trackers, CDN networks, or other third-party services silently communicating behind the scenes.

### Why This Matters to You

Web privacy and security hinge on understanding who your browser talks to during browsing. Many websites rely on multiple external resources, some benign and some intrusive. uBO Scope provides the transparency to:

- Identify and evaluate third-party servers
- Understand the effectiveness of your content blocking tools
- Gain confidence in how your browser behaves with respect to connections made

## How uBO Scope Works

At its core, uBO Scope acts as a companion extension leveraging your browser's `webRequest` API. It listens to network activity across HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and secure WebSocket protocols. Whether network requests succeed, fail, or redirect, uBO Scope records each connection attempt, categorizing domains into:

- **Allowed:** Domains with successful connections.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where requests were redirected or silently blocked.
- **Blocked:** Domains with failed or explicitly blocked requests.

This extension then aggregates the data per tab and visually surfaces it in an organized popup interface alongside a convenient toolbar badge.

## Real Scenarios Where uBO Scope Makes a Difference

Consider the following practical use cases:

- **Evaluating a Content Blocker:** You want to know the actual distinct third-party domains your blocker lets through; uBO Scope reveals the exact domains instead of vague block counts.
- **Exploring Suspicious Behavior:** You suspect a webpage loads hidden trackers; uBO Scope shows every remote connection attempt so you can investigate further.
- **Confirming Privacy Settings:** After changing privacy configurations, you want to ensure fewer third parties connect; uBO Scope provides instant feedback.

## What You See Inside the Extension Popup

Upon clicking the uBO Scope icon for an active tab, you access a clear panel that:

- Displays the webpage's hostname with clear domain distinctions
- Shows the total number of distinct connected domains
- Categorizes and lists domains as Not Blocked, Stealth-Blocked, or Blocked, with connection counts for each

This structure enables quick comprehension of the network landscape tied to any webpage.

## Practical Tips

- A **lower count** on the badge is better — it means fewer third-party connections.
- Not all third parties are inherently malicious — some, like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), serve necessary resources.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to cross-verify blocked domains versus those silently allowed.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

### Why might some network requests not appear?

uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API. Certain network traffic outside this scope (like some DNS-level blocks or network requests via other channels) may not be visible.

### Does a higher block count mean better protection?

No. High block counts often mean your browser fetched resources from more third-party servers. What matters is the number of distinct domains with allowed connections — fewer distinct allowed domains usually indicate better blocking.

## Getting Started

To try uBO Scope, simply install the extension from your browser's addon store and click its icon while browsing. The popup shows live network connections related to the current tab, giving you immediate, actionable insights.
