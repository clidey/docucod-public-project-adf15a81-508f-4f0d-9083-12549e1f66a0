# Core Concepts & Key Terminology

Understanding uBO Scope begins with grasping the essential terms that you will encounter throughout your experience. This knowledge will give you a solid foundation and a clear vocabulary to navigate deeper topics with confidence.

## What Does uBO Scope Track?

uBO Scope reveals all connections — whether attempted or successful — to remote servers initiated by webpages. This allows you to understand exactly which external domains your browser interacts with during web browsing.

### Distinct Third-Party Remote Servers

- **Definition:** These are servers outside the primary website domain that your browser contacts while loading a page.
- **Why it matters:** Tracking them exposes how many external entities are actively involved behind the scenes.
- **Example:** If you visit `example.com`, and your browser contacts `cdn.example.com`, that is _first-party_ if it shares the same registrable domain. However, contacting `analytics.com` or `ads.network` counts as a distinct third-party.

### Hostname vs Domain

- **Hostname:** The full server address, e.g., `sub.example.com`.
- **Domain:** The registrable root domain derived from the hostname, e.g., `example.com`.

uBO Scope normalizes hostnames into domains to count and report distinct remote servers meaningfully.

## Connection Outcomes

uBO Scope classifies network requests reported by the browser’s webRequest API into three main outcomes:

### Allowed

- **Meaning:** The request to a third-party server was made and successfully completed (or is in progress).
- **Why you want to see it:** It indicates third-party connections that were not blocked and thus are active.

### Blocked

- **Meaning:** The request was blocked, often due to content blocking extensions or network-level blocking, and thus never completed.
- **Why you want to see it:** It reflects third-party connections prevented from loading.

### Stealth-Blocked

- **Meaning:** The connection was redirected or altered such that it was blocked in a stealthy manner, invisible to the page or scripts.
- **Why it is unique:** Unlike regular blocking, stealth-blocking tries to hide the presence of blocking to prevent page breakage or detection by trackers.

### Practical View

- When you see a domain under **Allowed**, it means resources from that third-party were loaded or attempted without obstruction.
- When you see a domain under **Blocked**, the request was stopped outright.
- When you see a domain under **Stealth-Blocked**, the loading was prevented quietly to keep the browsing experience intact.

## The WebRequest API

- A browser-provided interface that allows extensions like uBO Scope to monitor network requests initiated by webpages.
- It reports events such as:
  - Requests starting and finishing.
  - Redirects.
  - Errors or blocked requests.

uBO Scope utilizes this API to gather accurate real-time data about the web’s remote connections, independent of any content blocker.

## Why These Concepts Matter

Suppose you're browsing a news website. You notice the toolbar badge shows a number — this is the count of distinct third-party domains that the website contacted that were **allowed**.

- A low number means limited external exposure, generally better for privacy.
- Domains under **Blocked** or **Stealth-Blocked** indicate the number of connection attempts that your browser or extensions prevented.
- Differentiating **stealth-blocked** connections helps you understand how blocking might be happening invisibly.

Knowing these terms empowers you to interpret uBO Scope’s reporting correctly and make informed decisions about your privacy and browsing security.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Focus on the ‘Allowed’ count:** The badge number reflects how many distinct third-party domains your browser successfully connected to. Lower counts typically mean better privacy.
- **Understand stealth-blocking:** A high number in stealth-blocked could mean your content blocker is protecting you silently.
- **Domains vs Hostnames:** uBO Scope consolidates multiple hostnames under the same domain for clarity — the count relates to domains, not individual hostnames.
- **Not all Third-Parties Are Harmful:** Some third-party domains are legitimate providers like CDNs. Use uBO Scope to identify who these third parties are before deciding to block them.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Misinterpreting Badge Counts:** The badge does *not* count total requests but distinct third-party domains allowed. Don't equate it with how many requests were blocked.
- **Ignoring Stealth-Blocked Connections:** These are often overlooked but are critical to understand the true effectiveness of your blockers.
- **Assuming Hostnames Equal Domains:** Without this differentiation, you might mistakenly overcount different subdomains of the same third party.

## Troubleshooting

If the numbers or classifications don’t seem to make sense:

- Confirm uBO Scope has the necessary permissions.
- Understand that some network requests may not be visible if made outside webRequest API’s scope.
- Remember that stealth-blocked connections may not be visible in some browser tools but are accounted for.
