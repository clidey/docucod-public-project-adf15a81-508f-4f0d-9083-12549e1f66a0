# Feature Overview & Supported Browsers

## Unlock Complete Visibility into Third-Party Connections

uBO Scope is a powerful companion extension designed to reveal all network connections your browser initiates to third-party remote servers. This page provides a concise overview of its major features, how its badge behavior communicates connection insights, and the browsers you can run it on. Understanding these aspects ensures you get reliable, consistent information across platforms.

---

## Key Features That Empower You

- **Distinct Third-Party Domain Counting:** The toolbar badge does not simply count network requests or blocked items; it reports the **number of unique third-party domains** your browser connects to, helping you measure actual privacy exposure more accurately.

- **Comprehensive Outcome Reporting:** uBO Scope classifies every observed network request into three categories:
  - **Allowed:** Connections that successfully reached third-party servers.
  - **Blocked:** Failures due to content blocking.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Redirects or blocked connections hidden by stealth mechanisms in content blockers.

- **Universal Content Blocker Independence:** Regardless of which content blocker or DNS-based blocklist you currently use, uBO Scope intercepts and reports connection outcomes as long as the browser exposes network data via the `webRequest` API.

- **Session Persistence & Real-Time Updates:** The extension tracks every open tab’s third-party connection activity in real-time, dynamically updating badge counts and popup summaries for immediate insight.

- **Accurate Badge Behavior:** The toolbar icon badge number represents a **lower-is-better count** of distinct third-party domains contacted, providing a clear, meaningful privacy metric rather than misleading block counts.

- **Lightweight & Privacy-Respecting:** uBO Scope only monitors connections for transparency. It does not interfere with your browsing experience or collect personal data.

- **Accessible Popup Display:** Clicking the extension icon shows a categorized list of domains connected to by the active tab, grouped by connection outcome — giving you quick, actionable information.

## Badge Behavior Explained

The badge count on the toolbar icon is central to understanding the scope of your browser’s third-party connections.

- **What the number means:** It reports the count of distinct third-party domains **allowed** (i.e., successfully connected) on the current tab.

- **Why this matters:** Lower numbers indicate fewer third parties accessed, which typically correlates with better privacy controls.

- **No inflated block counts:** Unlike some content blockers that inflate block numbers, uBO Scope focuses on privacy exposure by showing what is actually connecting during browsing.

- **Real-World Relevance:** By measuring domains instead of raw request counts, the badge reveals meaningful differences invisible to raw block counters.

## Supported Browsers & Platform Considerations

uBO Scope has been designed for cross-browser compatibility, supporting the major browser platforms with appropriate adaptations:

| Browser     | Minimum Version             | Installation Link                                                                 | Notes                                                                                         |
|-------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chromium** (Chrome, Edge, etc.) | 122.0+                      | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) | Uses Manifest v3 service worker background; requires `webRequest` API support.                 |
| **Firefox** | 128.0+                     | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)             | Supports `webRequest` API fully; compatible with Firefox desktop and Android.                 |
| **Safari**  | 18.5+                      | Distributed through Apple Extension Gallery                                       | Safari-specific manifest; requires macOS/iOS version with webRequest API accessible.          |

> **Note:** All supported browsers must provide access to the `webRequest` API for uBO Scope to function correctly. Network requests invisible to this API (e.g., behind some proxy layers or novel browser internals) cannot be tracked.

## Installation & First Steps

To get started with uBO Scope, visit the store listing for your preferred browser and install the extension directly. After installation:

- Observe the badge on the toolbar as you browse to see the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connects to.
- Click the badge icon to open the popup, revealing detailed counts of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked third-party domains for the active tab.

For platform-specific installation and initial configuration, please see the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/essentials/installation).

## Practical Example: From Connection to Badge Update

When you load a website, uBO Scope listens to all network requests:

1. **Request Initiated:** Browser attempts to connect to a resource.
2. **Request Interception:** uBO Scope hooks into the `webRequest` API to capture relevant events: success, redirects, failures.
3. **Outcome Classified:** Each request is categorized as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
4. **Domain Extraction:** The extension organizes hostnames into their base domains using the public suffix list.
5. **Session Update:** Data is associated with the current tab’s session.
6. **Badge Refresh:** The toolbar badge updates the count of allowed distinct third-party domains.
7. **Popup Display:** Details are shown on demand for the active tab to provide granular insights.

## Platform Manifest Differences (High-Level)

The extension manifests vary slightly to accommodate each browser’s requirements:

- Chromium uses manifest v3 with a service worker background script.
- Firefox and Safari use module-based background scripts with specific minimum version and API requirements.

All maintain consistent icons, permissions (activeTab, storage, webRequest), and popup configurations to ensure a unified experience across platforms.

---

## Tips for Success

- Keep your browser updated to meet the minimum supported version to ensure all extension features run smoothly.
- Use the badge count as your privacy exposure metric—lower is better.
- Use the popup to analyze which third parties are most active and investigate unexpected or unwanted domains.
- Refer to related guides for advanced usage, interpreting badge counts, and real-world analysis.

---

## Troubleshooting & Limitations

- Some network requests made outside the reach of the `webRequest` API (e.g., certain WebSocket connections) may not be reported.
- Badge counts may temporarily fluctuate during navigation as requests are processed asynchronously.
- Stealth-blocked connections represent cases where content blockers hide blocked requests, which can lead to misunderstood block counts if relying solely on other tools.

Always cross-reference with detailed popup info for clarity.
