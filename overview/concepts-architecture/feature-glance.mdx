# Key Features at a Glance

Discover the essential capabilities that make uBO Scope a must-have extension for anyone eager to gain transparent insight into their browser's network activity. This page offers a clear and concise rundown of uBO Scope’s standout features, highlighting why it’s effective, reliable, and uniquely valuable.

## Live Badge Count of Third-Party Remote Servers

The toolbar icon badge instantly shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers your active tab has connected to. This live, real-time count helps you measure third-party exposure at a glance, empowering you to quickly gauge the breadth of external contacts a webpage initiates.

- **Benefit:** Quickly assess potential privacy risks without diving into complex logs.
- **User Scenario:** Spot when you unexpectedly connect to numerous third-party servers, potentially indicating hidden trackers or unwanted resource loading.

## Detailed Domain Statistics in the Popup

Clicking uBO Scope’s toolbar icon opens a popup with categorized domain stats for the current tab. Here, you’ll find:

- **Allowed domains:** Third-party servers connections that succeeded or are permitted.
- **Stealth-blocked domains:** Connections that were intercepted or hidden by stealth blocking techniques.
- **Blocked domains:** Connections that failed or were actively blocked by your content blocker or other means.

Each domain shows how many connection attempts occurred, offering a granular view of the network activities tied to the page you’re browsing.

- **Benefit:** Understand exactly which remote servers are impacting your browsing experience, and how each is treated.
- **Example:** Verify if a well-known CDN is allowed, or if suspicious domains are being blocked effectively.

---

## Cross-Platform Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope supports major browsers including Chromium-based browsers (like Chrome, Edge), Firefox, and Safari. This breadth of support guarantees consistent experience no matter your preferred browser, helping you maintain strong privacy hygiene across platforms.

- **Benefit:** Seamless network transparency no matter your browsing environment.
- **Note:** Minimum browser versions apply (e.g., Chrome 122.0+, Firefox 128.0+, Safari 18.5+).

---

## Content-Agnostic Request Logging

Rather than relying on webpage content or document inspection, uBO Scope captures all network requests reported by the browser’s webRequest API. It follows every network event — redirects, errors, successes — to deliver a complete picture of actual remote server connection attempts.

- **Benefit:** Receive reliable, unbiased data regardless of content type or complexity.
- **Scenario:** Detect connections even if a content blocker silently or stealthily manages requests.

---

## Evaluating Filter Coverage and Debunking Misconceptions

uBO Scope serves as an indispensable ally for filter list maintainers and privacy analysts by:

- **Validating block coverage:** Confirm which connections your filters effectively block versus those they miss.
- **Debunking myths:** Challenge common misunderstandings such as assuming higher block counts mean stronger blockers, or trusting unreliable "ad-block test" sites.

This makes uBO Scope a trusted diagnostic tool beyond standard user privacy needs.

This flow demonstrates how uBO Scope hooks into the browser’s underlying APIs to capture network data transparently and relay it immediately through the popup and badge interface.

## Practical Tips

- Keep an eye on the badge count while browsing unfamiliar sites to quickly detect unexpected third-party connections.
- Use the popup to review domains and identify patterns that may indicate trackers or unwanted resources.
- Remember that not all third-party domains are malicious; many are legitimate (e.g., CDNs).
- When assessing a content blocker’s effectiveness, compare its block coverage with uBO Scope’s detailed connection logs.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Interpreting block counts without understanding distinct domain counts can be misleading.
- Relying on "ad blocker test" webpages as an accuracy measure can lead to incorrect conclusions.
- Network requests initiated outside the browser’s webRequest API scope (rare) may not appear in uBO Scope’s reporting.
