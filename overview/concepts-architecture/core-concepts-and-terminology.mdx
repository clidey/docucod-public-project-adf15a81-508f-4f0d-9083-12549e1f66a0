# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding uBO Scope starts with mastering its essential terms and concepts. This page clarifies key definitions such as third-party remote servers, the differences between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections, how badge counts reflect your browsing, and the inherent limitations imposed by browser network APIs. Mastery of these concepts empowers confident, accurate interpretation of data that uBO Scope provides.

## Why These Concepts Matter

When you browse the web, your browser interacts with countless servers behind the scenes—some necessary, some potentially intrusive. uBO Scope uncovers these hidden connections, but it’s vital you understand the language it uses to describe them.

By getting familiar with these core terms, you will:
- Accurately assess which remote servers your browser communicates with.
- Differentiate between genuinely allowed connections and those which are blocked or stealth-blocked.
- Interpret the badge count on uBO Scope’s icon with clarity, understanding what it truly measures.
- Recognize what uBO Scope can and cannot observe based on browser API limitations.


## Key Terms Explained

### 1. Third-Party Remote Servers

A 'third-party remote server' is any server contacted by your browser that is not the main website you are visiting. For instance, if you visit `example.com` and your browser fetches ads, analytics data, or content from other servers like `trackersite.net` or `cdn.mediaprovider.com`, those are third-party servers.

<u>Why do these matter?</u> These servers can affect your privacy, security, and page performance. uBO Scope tracks all such servers to give you transparent insight.

### 2. Allowed Connections

These are network requests made by your browser to third-party servers that were successfully completed and not blocked. They indicate active data exchange with the remote server.

- Example: A legitimate CDN delivering images for a website.

### 3. Blocked Connections

Blocked connections represent attempts by the browser to contact third-party servers that were stopped by a content blocker or another mechanism. These requests never reached the remote server.

- Example: A tracker blocked by your content blocker.

### 4. Stealth-Blocked Connections

Stealth-blocking refers to requests intercepted in such a way that the webpage is unaware of the block, often for seamless user experience or to foil anti-adblock scripts. These connections look like they're proceeding normally to the web page but are silently blocked by your content blocker.

- Example: A script-loading request made to a tracking domain but quietly canceled by the blocker to avoid website breakage or detection.

### 5. Badge Count

The number you see on the uBO Scope toolbar icon—the badge count—represents the number of **distinct third-party remote servers** with allowed connections on the currently active browser tab.

- A **lower count is better** because it means fewer third-party connections were allowed.
- Crucially, it does *not* represent the number of blocked or stealth-blocked requests.



## What uBO Scope Can See

- **Network requests visible to the browser's webRequest API:** uBO Scope listens to this API to monitor outgoing requests and their outcomes.
- **Outcomes of requests:** success (allowed), error (blocked), and redirects (stealth-blocked).
- **Tab-related data:** Connections are tracked per browser tab; closing a tab clears its data.

<u>Important limitations:</u>
- Requests made outside the `webRequest` API’s visibility (such as some specialized protocols or internal browser mechanisms) are invisible to uBO Scope.
- The extension cannot view request payloads or content, only metadata such as hostname, domain, and status.


## How uBO Scope Classifies Connections

Based on browser network events, uBO Scope groups third-party domains and hostnames into three categories:

| Category       | What It Means                         | User Outcome                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Allowed        | Resources fetched successfully       | Data received from these servers             |
| Blocked        | Requests stopped or failed           | No data received; connection prevented       |
| Stealth-Blocked| Blocked silently, without detection | Webpage believes request succeeded, but it didn’t |


## Understanding Domains vs Hostnames

uBO Scope categorizes data both by **hostname** (detailed server address) and by **domain** (organizational namespace). For example:

- Hostname: `ads.tracker.example.com`
- Domain: `example.com`

Aggregating by domain helps reveal overall third-party interactions without overwhelming detail.


## Practical Tips for Using This Knowledge

- **Interpret badge counts with care:** Focus on how many different third-party domains your browser contacted, not just raw blocked or request counts.
- **Spot stealth blocking:** Because stealth-blocked requests are hidden from websites, uBO Scope’s separate stealth category helps you distinguish these subtle events.
- **Use domain aggregation:** Viewing connections grouped by domain simplifies your analysis by highlighting major third-party players.
- **Remember limitations:** If some connections don’t appear, it’s likely because those requests fall outside browser API visibility.


## Common Misinterpretations Clarified

<u>Myth:</u> "More blocks means better protection."

<u>Fact:</u> A content blocker showing a higher block count might still allow more distinct third-party connections, meaning it blocks less effectively. uBO Scope helps you see actual distinct servers connected.

<u>Myth:</u> "Ad blocker test sites accurately show blocking performance."

<u>Fact:</u> Such test pages often use fabricated requests and cannot detect stealth blocking, so their results are misleading.


## Summary

By understanding these core concepts and the terminology uBO Scope uses, you will unlock the full value of the extension. You gain clear visibility into your browser’s network behavior, distinguish allowed and blocked requests, and learn how to confidently interpret badge counts and connection data.
