# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the fundamental terms used within uBO Scope is essential for making sense of the insights it provides. This page clarifies key concepts such as ‘third-party remote server’, ‘network request’, and what it means for connections to be ‘allowed’, ‘blocked’, or ‘stealth-blocked’. Establishing a shared vocabulary enables you to interpret the extension’s reports with confidence.

## What Is a Third-Party Remote Server?

A _third-party remote server_ is any server that your browser contacts which is not part of the website currently open in your browser tab. This distinction is critical for privacy and security because many websites embed content, scripts, or resources from domains other than their own, potentially exposing you to tracking or unwanted connections.

- **Example:** When visiting `example.com`, a request to `cdn.example.com` is _first-party_ because it shares the main domain. But a request to `analytics.example.net` is _third-party_, as it comes from a different domain.

uBO Scope focuses on identifying and reporting these _third-party_ connections because these are typically where privacy concerns arise.

---

## Understanding Network Requests

A _network request_ is any attempt your browser makes to load content from a remote server. This includes:

- Fetching images, scripts, or stylesheets
- Loading ads or trackers
- Requesting fonts or other resources
- WebSocket connections

uBO Scope observes every network request your browser attempts or successfully completes for the active tab to provide an accurate picture of what external servers it interacts with.

## Connection Outcomes: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth-Blocked

uBO Scope classifies network requests based on whether they were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked by your content blockers or network conditions. Understanding these categories is crucial for interpreting the data shown.

### Allowed Connections

- These are network requests that your browser completed successfully.
- The requested resources were fetched from the remote server without interruption.
- Often includes required services like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) or APIs essential for website functionality.

✔ **User Benefit:** Identifying allowed third-party domains helps you understand which external services your browser is truly communicating with, verifying privacy exposure.

### Blocked Connections

- These are requests your content blocker or browser actively prevented from completing.
- They never reached the remote server or the response was halted.
- Typical examples include trackers, ads, and other undesired content.

✔ **User Benefit:** Blocked connections demonstrate your blocker’s effectiveness in preventing unwanted data exchange.

### Stealth-Blocked Connections

- These requests are blocked silently, making it appear as if they succeeded to the webpage.
- Content blockers sometimes use stealth blocking to prevent webpage breakage or detection by hiding blocking activity.
- Such connections are neither fully allowed nor openly blocked, making them less visible without tools like uBO Scope.

✔ **User Benefit:** Knowing which connections are stealth-blocked offers advanced insights into your content blocker's subtle behavior and real-world blocking impact.

## Why These Concepts Matter to You

1. **Clear Insight Into Third-Party Exposure:** Instead of guessing what connections your browser makes, you get concrete data on all third-party domains contacted by webpages.

2. **Truth About Block Counts:** Many users assume that higher block counts mean better protection. uBO Scope reveals that what truly matters is the number of distinct third-party domains allowed — fewer domains allowed means stronger privacy.

3. **Transparency of Blocker Behavior:** By distinguishing allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked requests, uBO Scope provides a nuanced understanding of what your blocker does behind the scenes.

4. **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Armed with accurate terminology and understanding, you can make informed decisions about web browsing privacy and blocker choices.

## How uBO Scope Uses These Terms

- The _toolbar badge count_ shows the number of distinct third-party domains _allowed_ (not blocked) on the current tab.
- The popup panel groups domains by their outcome category — allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked — giving a detailed snapshot of network activity.
- Reporting is based on the browser’s `webRequest` API, ensuring visibility across all content blockers in use.

---

## Practical Example

Imagine visiting a news website:

- uBO Scope shows `5` distinct third-party domains allowed (badge count).
- In the popup, you see:
  - Allowed: `cdn.news.com`, `fonts.net`
  - Stealth-Blocked: `tracker.ads.com`
  - Blocked: `analytics.surveillance.com`

This tells you the site uses legitimate CDN and font services but also attempts to connect to trackers — some of which are stealth-blocked and some outright blocked.

---

## Tips for Using This Terminology Effectively

- Always focus on the number and identity of _allowed third-party domains_ when assessing your privacy exposure.
- Consider _stealth-blocked_ domains as a hidden layer of blocking that may affect how well your blocker prevents tracking.
- Recognize that some third-party domains (like CDNs) are necessary for website performance, so a higher allowed count doesn’t always mean poor privacy.
- Use uBO Scope’s categorization to debunk misleading assumptions from ad blocker tests or raw block counts.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusion

<AccordionGroup title="Common Misunderstandings about Third-Party Connections and Block Outcomes">
<Accordion title="Why doesn’t the block badge equal my content blocker’s reported block count?">
The badge counts distinct third-party domains _allowed_, not the number of blocked requests. A higher block count in your content blocker may mean it allows more distinct domains, resulting in greater privacy exposure.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can stealth-blocked connections still leak data?">
Stealth-blocked connections are actively suppressed but masked from webpages. They generally do not leak data but remain hidden from simple block counts, which is why uBO Scope’s transparency is valuable.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some allowed domains seem suspicious?">
Not all third-party domains are harmful. Many provide essential services like CDNs or fonts. Assess allowed domains individually if concerned.
