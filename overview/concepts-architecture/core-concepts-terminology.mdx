# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the key terms and categories used by uBO Scope is essential to leveraging its full potential. This knowledge will ground you in how the extension detects and reports remote server connections, categorizes domains, and presents data, preparing you for more advanced features.

---

## What You Will Learn

- The meaning of a connection attempt in uBO Scope
- Differentiation between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains
- The concept of third-party remote servers
- How badge counts are derived and what they represent
- The significance of the public suffix list in domain categorization

## Connection Attempt

A **connection attempt** is every remote server connection that a webpage tries to make, regardless of whether it succeeds or is blocked. uBO Scope monitors these attempts transparently by listening to browser network requests using the `webRequest` API, capturing outcomes such as:

- **Allowed:** The connection succeeded or was permitted.
- **Blocked:** The connection was explicitly prevented.
- **Stealth-blocked:** The connection was inadvertently or discreetly blocked, often via redirections or stealthy techniques.

This comprehensive tracking allows you to see all network activity from web pages, independent of what content blockers you run.


## Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Domains

uBO Scope classifies remote server domains into three main categories:

- **Allowed domains:** These are domains for which connection attempts succeeded or were explicitly permitted. They typically include essential content providers such as your site's own domains or benign third parties like content delivery networks.

- **Blocked domains:** Domains actively prevented by blockers or network errors that stopped connection attempts. This category helps identify which servers your content blockers or network rules block.

- **Stealth domains:** Domains targeted by stealth blocking or redirects, where the blocking is not straightforward but connections are effectively prevented. This often reflects sophisticated blocking mechanisms employed to avoid detection or reduce webpage breakage.

### Real-World Implication
For example, while visiting a news site, uBO Scope might show several allowed domains such as the site's own servers and CDNs. It may also reveal blocked domains belonging to tracking or advertising services and stealth-blocked domains where the block is obfuscated by redirects.


## Third-Party Remote Servers

A **third-party remote server** is any domain that differs from the domain of the website you actively visit. For instance, if you visit `example.com` and a connection is made to `ads.tracker.net`, `ads.tracker.net` is a third-party server.

uBO Scope tracks the number of distinct third-party domains connected per page load and represents this count as the toolbar badge value. Understanding third-party connections is crucial for privacy-focused users wishing to monitor tracking and external server calls beyond the first-party scope.


## Badge Count Explained

The badge count you see on uBO Scope's toolbar icon is the **number of distinct third-party domains** with successful connection attempts (allowed domains).

### Why This Matters

- A lower badge count indicates fewer distinct third-party remote servers were contacted, which typically means better privacy and reduced tracking.

- Conversely, a higher badge count signals more third-party connections, which might enable more tracking or data leakage.

<u>Note:</u> This count is **not** a block count. It reflects connections made _after_ blockers have possibly intervened.


## Public Suffix List and Domain Categorization

uBO Scope uses the [Public Suffix List (PSL)](https://publicsuffix.org/) to accurately determine the **effective top-level domain plus one label (eTLD+1)**, commonly called the "registered domain".

### Why the Public Suffix List?

- Domains like `google.co.uk` and `bbc.co.uk` share the public suffix `co.uk`, but their registered domains are `google.co.uk` and `bbc.co.uk` respectively.

- This distinction prevents misclassification of subdomains as separate entities.

- uBO Scope relies on the PSL to group hostnames under their correct registered domain, thus providing meaningful insights on the distinct entities interacting with a site.

### Practical Scenario
When many subdomains of `example.com` are connected, they are grouped under the single `example.com` domain, reducing clutter and focusing on actual distinct organizational entities.


## Summary of Key Terms

| Term                  | Description                                                                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Connection Attempt** | Any attempt to connect to a remote server by a webpage, allowed or blocked.                    |
| **Allowed Domains**    | Domains from which connections were successfully made or permitted.                            |
| **Blocked Domains**    | Domains whose connection attempts failed due to blocking or network errors.                    |
| **Stealth Domains**    | Domains effectively blocked via redirects or stealth methods.                                  |
| **Third-Party Server** | Domains different from the main domain of the webpage being visited.                           |
| **Badge Count**        | Number on the toolbar icon showing count of distinct allowed third-party domains per page.    |
| **Public Suffix List** | An authoritative list used to identify domain boundaries and group subdomains correctly.       |

## Navigating the Popup Interface with Terms

When you open uBO Scope's popup, you'll see three main categorized sections:

- **Not Blocked:** Lists allowed domains and their connection counts.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Lists stealth blocked domains.
- **Blocked:** Lists directly blocked domains.

The badge count on the icon corresponds to the "Not Blocked" distinct third-party domains.

Each domain displays a counter badge indicating how many connection attempts were made during the session.


## Practical Tip: Why These Concepts Matter

Understanding these terms equips you to interpret what uBO Scope reports:

- Are suspicious domains allowed?
- How effective are your content blockers at blocking unwanted servers?
- Are stealth blocking techniques observed that could hide blocking from web pages?
- How many third-party companies are involved when you visit a site?

This awareness enables informed decisions about privacy, security, and filter list adjustments.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusion

<AccordionGroup title="Terminology Clarification">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count show fewer domains than I expect?">
The badge count only includes distinct third-party domains that were allowed connections. Domains that were blocked or stealth-blocked do not count.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is a public suffix and why is it important?">
A public suffix is a domain level under which Internet users can directly register domain names. For example, 'co.uk' is a public suffix. It helps distinguish the registered domain part from subdomains, preventing incorrect grouping.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope see connections blocked by external DNS or network filtering?">
uBO Scope relies on the browser's webRequest API. If a connection is blocked before the browser tries to make it at the network layer, it won't appear in uBO Scope.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
