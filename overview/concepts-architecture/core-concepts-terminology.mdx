# Core Concepts & Key Terms

Welcome to the foundational guide for understanding the terminology and key concepts used by **uBO Scope**. This page is designed to clarify essential vocabulary so you can confidently navigate the extension’s interface and correctly interpret the network data it presents.

---

## Why These Terms Matter

uBO Scope reveals detailed network activity from your browser’s active tab, focusing especially on the connections made to third-party servers. Grasping the precise meaning of common terms like *third-party server* or *badge count* enables you to interpret the extension's reporting accurately and make informed privacy and browsing decisions.

## Key Terms Explained

### Third-Party Server
A **third-party server** is any remote server used by the website you are visiting that is not part of the main website’s domain.

- **Example:** When visiting `example.com`, a request to `cdn.externalcdn.net` counts as a third-party connection because `externalcdn.net` is a separate domain from `example.com`.
- uBO Scope tracks these to reveal what external domains your browser interacts with behind the scenes.

### Badge Count
This is the number displayed on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon badge.

- It represents **the number of distinct third-party domains** your active tab connected to and that were *allowed* (i.e., successfully completed).
- A **lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, which often means a cleaner and more privacy-friendly browsing session**.

### Allowed Domains
These are domains to which your browser successfully connected.

- They represent network requests not blocked by any content blockers or filtering mechanisms.
- These allowed connections are shown in the green “not blocked” section within the popup.

### Blocked Domains
Domains where the network request was blocked by any content blocker or network filtering.

- Displayed in the red “blocked” section in the popup.
- Reflect attempts to load resources that were prevented from completing.

### Stealth Domains
Domains with network requests that underwent redirection or stealth blocking.

- These are connections that may have been stealthily redirected or blocked in ways not obvious to the webpage.
- They appear in the red “stealth-blocked” section.

### webRequest API
This is a browser-provided API used by uBO Scope to observe network requests.

- It allows uBO Scope to receive real-time details about every outgoing network request — including those blocked or redirected by content blockers.
- **Important:** Network requests outside the reach of the `webRequest` API (e.g., certain low-level or cached requests) cannot be monitored by uBO Scope.

## How These Terms Appear in uBO Scope

- The **toolbar badge** reflects the number of distinct third-party domains with successful network connections (allowed).
- The **popup interface** breaks down these third-party domains grouped by their connection outcome: *allowed*, *stealth-blocked*, and *blocked*.
- Each domain listing includes a count for how many requests to that domain were observed.

## Practical Tips for Using These Terms

- When you see a **high badge count**, consider that the active webpage loads resources from many third-party domains, reflecting potential privacy exposure.
- Use the **blocked domains** section to verify your content blockers are actively preventing requests to undesirable domains.
- The **stealth-blocked section** highlights more subtle blocking events that are not always visible to webpages.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Mistaking block counts for privacy strength:** A higher number of blocked requests does not always mean a more effective content blocker. What really matters is how many third-party servers you connect to.
- **Assuming all third-party connections are harmful:** Many legitimate services like content delivery networks (CDNs) and essential APIs reside on third-party domains and usually account for low badge counts.
- **Expecting uBO Scope to track all network activity:** Some network requests don't go through browser APIs and thus won't appear.

<AccordionGroup title="Additional Core Terms & Definitions">
<Accordion title="Public Suffix List (PSL)">
The PSL is maintained by publicsuffix.org and used by uBO Scope to accurately determine domains versus subdomains. For example, `example.co.uk` is a domain, while `shop.example.co.uk` is a subdomain.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain vs. Hostname">
- **Hostname:** The full domain or subdomain of a request (e.g., `api.google.com`).
- **Domain:** The registered domain name derived using the PSL (e.g., `google.com`).

uBO Scope aggregates requests primarily by domain for clarity.

## Summary

Understanding and accurate use of these core terms empower you to interpret uBO Scope’s data confidently. Whether you are assessing how many and which third-party services your browser contacts or verifying the effect of your content blockers, these definitions ensure you know precisely what each number and label means.

##### Example: Badge Count Explained
> When you visit `news.example.com`, uBO Scope might report:
> 
> - 5 distinct third-party domains allowed
> - 3 domains blocked
> - 1 domain stealth-blocked
>
> The badge shows '5' because it counts only allowed distinct domains. The popup lets you verify which are blocked or stealth blocked.
