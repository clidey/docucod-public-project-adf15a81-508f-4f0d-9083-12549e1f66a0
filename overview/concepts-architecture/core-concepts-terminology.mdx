# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the essential terminology and concepts in uBO Scope is critical for making the most of the extension's insights and interpreting the data it provides accurately. This page introduces you to key terms such as 'third-party remote server', 'network request', 'stealth-blocked', and 'badge count'. It also explains how uBO Scope defines and classifies connection outcomes and why not all third parties are treated equally.

## Why Shared Vocabulary Matters

When monitoring network activity in your browser with uBO Scope, encountering technical terms and classifications might feel overwhelming. This shared vocabulary ensures everyone speaks the same language and understands exactly what the extension reveals.

By grasping these core concepts, you will:

- Confidently interpret the toolbar badge numbers and popup details.
- Distinguish between types of network requests and their outcomes.
- Understand how uBO Scope classifies connections and what implications this has for your privacy.

## Key Terms and Definitions

### Third-Party Remote Server

In the context of uBO Scope, a **third-party remote server** is any remote server that your browser communicates with that is different from the domain of the website you are currently visiting (the "first party"). 

**Why does it matter?**
- Third-party connections often include resources loaded from content delivery networks (CDNs), trackers, advertising servers, analytics platforms, or other external services.
- Monitoring third-party connections helps assess your exposure to external entities beyond the site you actively chose to visit.

### Network Request

A **network request** is any attempt by your browser to retrieve or send data to a remote server. This includes requests for images, scripts, videos, or API calls.

**Important points:**
- uBO Scope listens for these requests through the browser's `webRequest` API.
- It tracks whether these requests succeed, fail, or are redirected.

### Stealth-Blocked

Requests classified as **stealth-blocked** are those that your content blocker blocks in a way that is transparent or invisible to the page. This stealthy blocking often avoids webpage breakage and prevents websites from detecting that blocking is occurring.

**How does uBO Scope treat stealth-blocked requests?**
- These requests appear in a separate category because although blocked, they might be missed or misrepresented by other tools.
- Stealth blocking is a nuanced form of content blocking that some extensions employ to maximize privacy while maintaining site functionality.

### Badge Count

The **badge count** displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon shows the number of distinct third-party remote domains that had at least one successful connection.

**Why is this useful?**
- A lower badge count signifies fewer third parties connected, which often means less exposure to trackers or unwanted servers.
- This count ignores how many individual requests are blocked or allowed; it focuses solely on the distinct domains that successfully connected.

### Domain vs. Hostname

- A **hostname** is the full hostname part of a URL, e.g., `assets.example.cdn.com`.
- A **domain** is the higher-level registered domain derived from the hostname, e.g., `cdn.com` might actually refer to `example.cdn.com` if parsed with the public suffix rules.

uBO Scope uses the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to accurately identify domains from hostnames. This is essential to avoid misclassifying subdomains as independent domains.

---

## How uBO Scope Classifies Connections

uBO Scope organizes observed network connections into three outcome categories for each third-party domain:

- **Allowed:** Requests that successfully connected.
- **Blocked:** Requests that your content blocker explicitly blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests blocked invisibly or in a stealthy manner.

This classification helps you quickly understand which third parties are currently interacting with your browser and which connections have been prevented.

### Behind the Scenes: Collection and Grouping

- Every request your browser initiates is monitored.
- The extension extracts hostnames and then deduces domains using the Public Suffix List.
- Counts are maintained for how many successful, blocked, or stealth-blocked requests occurred per domain and hosted subdomain.

You see the aggregated data in the popup UI and via the badge count, giving actionable insight at a glance.

## Why Not All Third Parties Are Created Equal

Not every third party you encounter is harmful or intrusive:

- **Legitimate third parties** include content delivery networks (CDNs) providing assets for faster page loads, essential APIs, and services you trust.
- **Suspicious or unwanted parties** often appear as trackers, advertising networks, or sites that may compromise your privacy.

uBO Scope informs you by making black-and-white distinctions explicit, but it leaves judgment to you.

<Note>
The badge count does not indicate “badness” or enable automatic blocking. It simply informs you of distinct external domains that your browser connected to.
</Note>

## Practical Examples

Consider browsing a news site. You might see:

- **Allowed:** `cdn.news-site.com` (delivers images and scripts) and `fonts.googleapis.com` (loads fonts).
- **Stealth-Blocked:** `tracking.bad-ads.net` (a tracker blocked without site breakage).
- **Blocked:** `ads.bad-ads.net` (ads explicitly blocked).

This breakdown helps you understand which external servers are active and how your content blocker is performing.

---

## Tips for Users

- Use the badge count as your privacy barometer: fewer distinct third-party domains generally suggest better privacy.
- Review the popup breakdown to see details and counts per domain, helping identify persistent or intrusive third parties.
- Remember that some allowed third parties are necessary and beneficial.

## Common Pitfalls

- Don't assume a high block count means more protection; it can indicate that more third parties are actually being contacted.
- Avoid relying on misleading "ad blocker test" sites; uBO Scope focuses on real-world network activity.
