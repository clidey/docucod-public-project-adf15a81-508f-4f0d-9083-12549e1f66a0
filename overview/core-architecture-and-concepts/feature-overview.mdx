# Key Features at a Glance

uBO Scope empowers you with real-time, detailed visibility into every remote server connection your browser makes on a per-tab basis. Through its intuitive popup interface, the extension summarizes and categorizes network requests from webpages, giving you unparalleled insight into third-party interactions without requiring complex setups or deep technical expertise.

---

## Instant Overview of Outgoing Connections

When you open the uBO Scope popup while browsing, you receive a clear snapshot of a webpage's external connectivity:

- **Summary of Third-Party Domains:** See the total number of unique third-party domains the current tab has reached or attempted to reach.
- **Categorized Request Outcomes:** Understand which connections were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked (blocked silently without alerting the webpage).
- **Live Badge Indicator:** The extension’s toolbar icon dynamically shows the count of unique remote servers contacted by the active tab.

This immediate feedback helps you assess the privacy footprint and network behavior of any webpage without interrupting your workflow.

---

## What You See in the Popup UI

The popup interface is divided into three distinct sections, each reflecting a category of network requests associated with the active browser tab:

### 1. Not Blocked (Allowed)
- Displays all third-party domains with successful or allowed network connections.
- Includes a count of connections per domain, helping you identify which external servers are actively engaged.

### 2. Stealth-Blocked
- Lists domains whose connections were stealth-blocked—these are attempts silently prevented, typically to avoid detection by the webpage.
- This section highlights the domains developers or trackers try to reach without visible blocking alerts.

### 3. Blocked
- Shows domains for which connection attempts were actively blocked and reported.
- Helps you verify that your content blockers or privacy tools are effectively preventing unwanted connections.

The distinct visualization of these categories enables quick comparison and deeper understanding of what is happening behind the scenes with network traffic.

## Real-Time Badge Count for Instant Awareness

uBO Scope’s toolbar icon displays a badge showing the number of unique third-party remote servers contacted by the current tab:

- This count updates dynamically as network requests occur.
- A lower badge count typically indicates better privacy, as fewer external servers are contacted.
- The count considers only distinct remote servers, not raw block counts, providing a meaningful privacy metric.

This feature lets you gauge a page’s external communication footprint instantly, even without opening the popup.

---

## Benefit-Focused Features Summary

- **Per-Tab Network Tracking:** Analyze connections specifically tied to the active tab for precise network visibility.
- **Domain-Level Aggregation:** View network activity grouped by domain, simplifying the complexity of raw requests.
- **Clear Outcome Distinctions:** Quickly distinguish between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.
- **Live Metrics at a Glance:** Use the badge count for continuous awareness without disrupting browsing.
- **Intuitive and Lightweight UI:** Access detailed insights through a minimal popup without clutter or confusion.

## Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Privacy Evaluation
You visit a news site and want to understand which third-party services are loaded. Opening uBO Scope reveals multiple allowed connections to advertising domains and analytics providers, but also stealth-blocked requests to tracking servers, confirming the presence of active trackers even if not obvious.

### Scenario 2: Content Blocker Validation
While troubleshooting a content blocker configuration, you can quickly verify whether certain domains are blocked or bypassed by viewing them in the blocked and stealth-blocked sections. This helps diagnose why unwanted content might still load.

### Scenario 3: Filter List Maintenance
Filter list maintainers can monitor stealth-blocked domains that evade conventional blocking techniques, using uBO Scope's classifications to identify candidates for list updates.

## How It Works Under the Hood (Simplified)

While internal details are covered elsewhere, it’s helpful to understand briefly:

- uBO Scope listens to all network requests your browser processes per tab.
- It categorizes each outgoing connection according to the outcome: allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Domains are extracted and aggregated, considering the public suffix list for accurate domain parsing.
- This data is then presented in the popup UI and reflected in the badge count.

---

## Tips for Maximizing uBO Scope Use

- Use the badge count as a quick privacy metric—if it spikes unexpectedly, investigate the popup to identify new domains.
- Cross-reference the allowed domains with known CDNs or essential services to separate legitimate from suspicious traffic.
- Watch stealth-blocked entries to uncover hidden trackers that your primary blockers might miss.
- Keep in mind that not all third-party connections are harmful; use informed judgment when assessing the data.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- If the popup shows "NO DATA" or no active connections, ensure you have navigated to a webpage that has initiated network requests.
- Badge count may not update immediately due to browser behavior; try refreshing the tab or reopening the popup.
- For persistent issues, consult the broader troubleshooting guides linked below.
