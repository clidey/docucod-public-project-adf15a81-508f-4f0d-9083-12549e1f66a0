description: "Summarizes the capabilities available to users: live network request tracking across content blockers, actionable badge feedback, insights into allowed, stealth, and blocked requests per domain, plus ongoing improvements for filter maintainers. Communicates limitations (doesn’t report DNS-blocked requests outside webRequest API) and browser support at a high level."

# Feature Overview at a Glance

## See Every Network Connection Attempt, Instantly

uBO Scope provides you with a live, transparent view into every network connection attempt your browser makes—whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked—regardless of which content blocker is active. By exposing this data directly in the extension’s popup and through actionable badge counts, uBO Scope empowers you to understand precisely how your browsing requests interact with third-party servers.

### What You Gain
- **Live Monitoring Across Content Blockers:** Watch real-time data about all connections to remote servers, independent of any filtering mechanism.
- **Categorized Request Outcomes:** Instantly differentiate which domains were allowed, stealth-blocked (redirected or hidden), or explicitly blocked.
- **Actionable Badge Feedback:** The browser toolbar icon reflects the count of distinct allowed third-party domains, helping you quickly identify exposure levels.
- **Insight for Privacy and Filter Maintainers:** Leverage the extension to audit your browsing privacy, validate content blockers’ effectiveness, or refine filter lists.
- **Ongoing Enhancement for Specialists:** The tool is evolving to deliver richer details that specifically assist filter list maintainers.

### Who This Is For
Privacy-conscious web users, filter list maintainers, ad blocker skeptics, and anyone wanting a clear, trustworthy window into browser network behavior.

## Understanding uBO Scope’s Core Capabilities

### What uBO Scope Tracks

uBO Scope complements content blockers by observing network requests through your browser’s `webRequest` API. It classifies every request into three outcome categories:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully made to remote servers.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that are redirected or blocked in ways that may not be obvious to the user or webpage.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly prevented from completing.

This granular insight is essential because neither block counts nor traditional “ad blocker test” sites provide an accurate picture of what actually gets connected.

### Live Data Presented in the Popup

Upon clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup presents a clear, organized panel showing:

- The hostname and domain of the active tab.
- A summary count of all distinct connected domains.
- Detailed lists for each outcome category (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked), with domains and their request counts.

This immediate feedback helps you assess the real-world impact of your content blockers and privacy settings.

### Technology Limitations to Be Aware Of

- uBO Scope relies exclusively on the browser `webRequest` API, so network requests blocked outside this scope (such as DNS-level blocking external to the API) are not tracked.
- Some browser or network conditions can affect completeness—but uBO Scope is designed to cover all monitored web requests within the API's reach.

## Feature Breakdown With Real User Benefits

| Feature                   | What It Does                         | Why It Matters to You                     |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Distinct Domain Badge** | Displays number of unique third-party domains successfully connected | Helps you immediately gauge your browsing privacy exposure |
| **Popup Panel with Outcomes** | Categorizes domains into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked lists, with counts | Provides actionable insight to fine-tune blocker efficacy or investigate unexpected connections |
| **Cross-Platform Support** | Supports Chromium, Firefox, Safari browsers where `webRequest` is available | Offers consistent experience across your devices |
| **Background Data Processing** | Gathers and updates connection data live to avoid manual refresh | Ensures up-to-date, hassle-free monitoring |

### Typical Scenario: Verifying New Content Blocker

Imagine you just installed a new content blocker and want to verify its effectiveness beyond block counts displayed by the blocker itself. With uBO Scope, you can click the badge to see exactly which third-party domains were still contacted, differentiate blocked vs. stealth-blocked attempts, and confirm the true impact on your web traffic.

### Practical Tip

Focus on reducing the **distinct allowed third-party domains** count in the badge as the primary privacy indicator—not the number of blocks reported by blockers.

## Why uBO Scope Matters: Practical User Benefits

### Outcomes You Can Expect

- **Greater Transparency:** Know which domains your browser contacts in real-time.
- **Smarter Decisions:** Confidently choose or modify content blockers using real data.
- **Privacy Assurance:** Detect unwanted connections regardless of how stealthily they are blocked.
- **Filter List Feedback:** Obtain practical feedback to improve filter lists effectively.

### Use Cases

1. **Privacy-Conscious Browsing Audit:** See at a glance how many and which third-party domains your browser contacts, helping identify potential leaks.
2. **Content Blocker Evaluation:** Debunk misleading block counts by testing blockers with a real-world, outcome-focused overview.
3. **Filter List Maintenance:** Use detailed request outcomes to adjust and maintain precise blocking lists.
