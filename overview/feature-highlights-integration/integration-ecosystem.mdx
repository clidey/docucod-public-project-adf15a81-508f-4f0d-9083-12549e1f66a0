# Browser Support and Privacy Ecosystem Integration

## Seamless Installation Across Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to work across all major modern browsers—Chromium-based browsers (like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge), Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari—providing consistent privacy insights wherever you browse.

- **Chromium**: Easily install uBO Scope from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp). Supports Chrome version 122 and above.
- **Firefox**: Available on [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) for Firefox 128 and later.
- **Safari**: Supported on Safari 18.5 and newer, directly installable through the App Store or developer distribution.

Each browser package includes the same core functionality and user interface, adapted to browser-specific permissions and capabilities, ensuring you get reliable network connection visibility regardless of your platform.

<Info>
The extension requires permission to observe network activity (`webRequest` API), access to active tab information, and local storage. These permissions are consistent across supported browsers but vary slightly in manifest configuration to meet platform requirements.

## Complementing Content Blockers Without Conflict

Unlike traditional content blockers that selectively block or allow web resources, uBO Scope operates strictly as a **monitoring tool**. It tracks **all connection attempts** — whether they're allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked by other content blockers.

- uBO Scope **does not interfere** with resource loading or filtering.
- It works harmoniously alongside content blockers like uBO Lite, uBlock Origin (Origin), or other DNS and extension-based blockers.
- It reports network requests regardless of how or where blocking occurs, including DNS-level blocking.

This complementary design means you can confidently install uBO Scope alongside your favorite blockers to get an independent, unfiltered view of your browser’s active network behavior.

### Why This Matters

- Other blockers often *hide* stealth-blocked connections or fail to clarify how many distinct third-party domains are actually contacted.
- uBO Scope reveals the *true* number of distinct remote servers your browser connects to, providing an unbiased, actionable privacy snapshot.
- By showcasing allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains separately in its popup interface, it delivers insights that no single blocker badge or test page can.

## Value for Filter List Maintainers and Privacy Enthusiasts

uBO Scope is uniquely valuable to those who maintain or rely on filter lists and want to verify their overall privacy stack’s effectiveness.

- **Filter List Maintainers** can observe real-world connection attempts on devices where developer tools are unavailable or limited, enabling better diagnostics.
- **Privacy-Conscious Users** get clear visibility into how well their blockers reduce third-party connections.
- The extension lays the groundwork for future enhancements that will surface additional connection details, empowering deeper filter list tuning and troubleshooting.

<u>Even in environments with multiple layers of content and privacy filtering, uBO Scope gives you transparency, building confidence in your content blocking strategy.</u>

## How uBO Scope Works in the Privacy Ecosystem

Under the hood, uBO Scope listens to the browser’s `webRequest` events, capturing:

- **Allowed**: Requests that successfully connect to third-party servers.
- **Blocked**: Requests that fail due to network errors or explicit blocking.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Requests interrupted or redirected in ways content blockers try to conceal.

This approach allows uBO Scope to present a complete picture without interfering with the blocking logic of other extensions, offering an authoritative privacy metric that complements existing solutions.

## Best Practices for Using uBO Scope in Your Privacy Stack

- **Install Alongside Your Content Blocker**: Use uBO Scope with uBO Lite or Origin for comprehensive insight.
- **Regularly Check the Badge Count**: A lower badge count signifies fewer distinct third-party connections, which is preferable.
- **Use Popup Details to Interpret Connections**: The popup classifies domains as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked for quick diagnostics.
- **Avoid Over-Reliance on Block Counts and Test Pages**: Block counts and ad blocker test sites can mislead; uBO Scope shows real-world network behavior.

<Warning>
While uBO Scope exposes connection attempts, it does not prevent them. Use it in combination with your preferred blockers for actual filtering and privacy protection.
</Warning>

## Summary

uBO Scope stands out as a monitoring extension that works smoothly across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari. It provides a transparent view of all remote server connections without disrupting your existing content blocking setup. This clear separation of concerns enhances trust in your privacy tools and offers filter list maintainers a valuable window into network behaviors on restricted platforms.
