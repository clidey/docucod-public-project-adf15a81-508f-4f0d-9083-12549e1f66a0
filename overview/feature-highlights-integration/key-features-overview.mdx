# Key Features at a Glance

## Instantly Understand Your Web Connections

uBO Scope brings immediate clarity to the complex web of remote server requests initiated by each browser tab. By displaying live, per-tab reports of connected domains—whether they were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked—this extension empowers you to instantly see what your browser talks to behind the scenes.

### What Makes This Page Essential?
This page highlights uBO Scope's headline capabilities and how its interface delivers actionable insights at a glance without requiring any specific content blocker to be enabled.

## Comprehensive Live Reporting

At the heart of uBO Scope is live monitoring of network activity in each browser tab, capturing three categories of remote servers:

- **Allowed Domains:** Servers your browser successfully connected to.
- **Blocked Domains:** Servers that were prevented from connecting.
- **Stealth Domains:** Servers blocked in a manner that is hidden or not easily detected by the web page.

This triage classification helps you distinguish the true network impact of content blocking, going beyond mere block counts.

### Example Scenario:
Imagine browsing a news site and suspecting that third-party trackers are silently allowed. uBO Scope’s live domain reports provide clarity by showing exactly which domains were accessed or blocked on that tab.

## Dynamic Toolbar Badge Updates

The extension's toolbar button badge dynamically updates to reflect the number of distinct allowed third-party domains per active tab. This badge count is pivotal:

- It reflects network exposure rather than just raw block counts.
- A lower badge number signals better containment of third-party connections.

Whenever network requests are evaluated, the badge refreshes automatically to give you instant feedback.

---

## No Dependence on Specific Content Blockers

Unlike other network monitoring tools tied to particular content blockers, uBO Scope works independently, relying solely on the browser's webRequest API:

- Accurately reports network request outcomes regardless of the active content blocker or filtering method.
- Supports visibility into connections even when DNS-based or stealth blocking methods are used.

This independence ensures uBO Scope remains effective across diverse browsing setups.

## User Interface Designed for Actionability

The UI is intentionally minimal yet powerful:

- Presents clear sections for allowed, blocked, and stealth domains.
- Uses domain counts with badges for quick quantitative insight.
- Supports internationalized domain names, converting encoded domain strings into readable Unicode.

### Practical Tip:
When viewing the popup, focus on the domain lists to quickly spot unexpected or suspicious third parties.

## How It Fits In Your Workflow

1. **Install uBO Scope** in your preferred browser.
2. **Browse normally;** uBO Scope silently logs network requests per tab.
3. Click the **extension icon** to open the popup for current tab’s network overview.
4. See the **distinct domains** contacted, categorized by allowed, blocked, and stealth.
5. Use the **badge count** as a quick indicator of your current tab’s third-party network exposure.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

- **No Data in Popup:** Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and the page is fully loaded. The tool updates data as it observes requests.
- **Badge Not Updating:** Occasionally, tab changes or browser restart might delay badge updates. Closing and reopening the popup refreshes data.
- **Interpreting Domains:** Legitimate sites often load from several known CDNs— don't overreact to small numbers of allowed domains.
