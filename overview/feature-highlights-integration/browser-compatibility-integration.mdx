# Supported Browsers & Integration

## Seamless Compatibility Across Major Browsers

uBO Scope is designed to deliver consistent functionality across the three major browser platforms used today: **Chromium-based browsers** (such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Brave), **Mozilla Firefox**, and **Apple Safari**. This broad support ensures that users of all these browsers can gain transparent insights into their web connections without compromise.

### Supported Browsers
- **Chromium browsers:** Full support from version 122.0 onwards, including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and others built on Chromium.
- **Mozilla Firefox:** Compatible with Firefox 128.0 and later, including Firefox for desktop and Firefox for Android.
- **Apple Safari:** Supported from Safari 18.5 onwards.

Each browser version supports the necessary WebExtension APIs (`webRequest`, `storage`, etc.) that uBO Scope relies on for its advanced monitoring capabilities.

## Installation Options & Distribution Channels

Installing uBO Scope is straightforward and tailored to your browser ecosystem. Access the extension through your browser’s official add-ons or extension stores using the following links:

- **Chromium browsers:** [Chrome Web Store - uBO Scope](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- **Mozilla Firefox:** [Firefox Add-ons - uBO Scope](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
- **Apple Safari:** Installation available via Safari Extensions Gallery or Apple's official channels, compatible with Safari 18.5+.

This ensures that installation is secure, trusted, and automatically updated through official update channels.

## Integration Entry Points: How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Browser

### Toolbar Icon & Dynamic Badge
Once installed, uBO Scope presents an unobtrusive toolbar icon—placed alongside your other extensions and browser controls. This icon serves two critical roles:

- **Badge Count:** The badge overlays the icon with a real-time count of distinct third-party domains contacted during your current browsing tab’s session. A lower number indicates fewer external connections, which often correlates with better privacy.
- **Quick Access:** Clicking the icon opens the popup interface, instantly offering detailed connection status and insights.

### Popup Interface: Your Window into Web Connections

The popup interface provides a live summary of network connections made by the active tab categorized into three outcomes:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which content successfully loaded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were indirectly blocked via redirects or stealthy mechanisms.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts failed due to blocking.

This interface helps you understand exactly which remote servers your browser contacted, giving you actionable insights into your web exposure.

## Complementing Your Privacy Toolkit

uBO Scope is purpose-built to *augment* your existing privacy and content-blocking solutions rather than replace them. Its unique advantage lies in revealing third-party domain connections independently of any ad blocker or privacy tool in use. This means:

- **Verifier:** Confirm what your content blockers are actually blocking or allowing.
- **Transparency:** Gain raw visibility into how many distinct third-party domains any website tries to interact with.
- **Filter List Maintenance:** Support maintainers of blocklists by identifying stealth and allowed connections in real browsing scenarios.

By combining uBO Scope with traditional blockers, VPNs, and DNS-based privacy tools, you achieve a fuller, more accurate understanding of your browsing privacy posture.

## Practical Example: From Installation to Insight

1. **Install uBO Scope** from your browser’s extension store.
2. **Navigate to any webpage.** The toolbar badge dynamically updates to show how many distinct third-party domains the page connects to.
3. **Click the uBO Scope icon** to open the popup. Review categorized connections:
   - *Allowed domains* indicate what was fetched.
   - *Blocked* and *Stealth-blocked* domains reveal what was prevented.
4. Use this insight to evaluate the effectiveness of your content blocker or adjust your privacy settings.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep your browser updated** to ensure full compatibility.
- **Combine with your content blocker** to cross-verify blocking effectiveness.
- **Use on multiple tabs** to observe differences in third-party connections per site.
- **Filter list maintainers can use uBO Scope** to observe real-world blocking and allowlist behaviors.

## Troubleshooting Installation & Integration

If uBO Scope does not appear in your browser toolbar after installation:

- Verify that your browser version meets the minimum requirements.
- Check extension permissions, especially for `webRequest` and `storage` access.
- Restart your browser to ensure the extension is correctly loaded.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](https://docs.uBO-Scope/getting-started/first-use-and-verification/troubleshooting-setup) documentation for detailed resolutions.

<u>For developers and advanced users:</u> uBO Scope leverages browser-native APIs and persists data per-tab to provide live and retrospective domain connection data efficiently and securely without requiring server-side components.
