# Who Is uBO Scope For?

uBO Scope is designed for users who demand clarity and transparency about the network connections their browsers make. It caters specifically to individuals who prioritize privacy and want a straightforward way to see the real-world impact of content blockers on third-party requests.

## Target Audience

- **Privacy-Conscious Internet Users**: If you care about which third-party servers your browser communicates with and want to understand how many and which external domains your browsing activity touches, uBO Scope gives you direct visibility. This helps you make informed decisions about your content blocker setup.

- **Filter List Maintainers and Content Blocking Enthusiasts**: Maintaining filter lists or evaluating content blockers requires precise data on network request outcomes. uBO Scope provides reliable insights into blocked, allowed, and stealth-blocked third-party domains, making it an essential tool for fine-tuning blocking rules and confirming their effectiveness.

- **Users on Limited or Specialized Devices**: When browser development tools or network monitoring capabilities are unavailable or restricted, using uBO Scope ensures continued access to network connection details. This accessibility makes it invaluable for users on constrained platforms or in managed environments.

- **Skeptics of Content Blocker Claims and Ad-Blocker Test Websites**: Many have questioned popular 'ad blocker test' sites or compared block counts across tools without clarity. uBO Scope helps debunk these myths by focusing on the fundamental metric: the number of distinct third-party servers your browser connects to, regardless of block count.

## Why This Matters

Understanding who uBO Scope is for helps clarify its unique value proposition:

- Unlike tools that only count blocked requests, uBO Scope reveals successful connections to third-party servers, which directly affects privacy.
- It delivers independent and accurate reporting even when other blocking methods or DNS-level interference are in place.
- By focusing on domains rather than individual requests, it presents a clearer picture of real tracking surfaces.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Evaluating Content Blocker Performance
Compare how different content blockers perform by observing the actual third-party domains your browser connects to, not just the number of blocked requests. uBO Scope lets you spot blockers that might have high block counts but still allow connections to multiple distinct tracking domains.

### 2. Auditing Real-World Tracking Activity
Investigate the domains contacted by your browsing activity in real time, including allowed and stealth-blocked domains, helping you understand potential privacy leaks or verify blocking effectiveness against trackers.

### 3. Assisting Filter List Development
When crafting or debugging filter lists, confirm which network requests are truly being blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed. This insight enhances list accuracy.

### 4. Access for Users Without Developer Tools
For users operating on devices or browsers where the built-in network inspector or developer tools are not accessible, uBO Scope provides an intuitive interface to monitor network connections.

## What Users Should Expect

- Transparency into the outcome of each third-party network request.
- A clear differentiation between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.
- An actionable overview to support better privacy decisions and troubleshooting.

<Tip>
Remember, uBO Scope’s badge count reflects the number of distinct third-party domains connected to, not the number of blocked requests. A lower badge count signals better privacy.
