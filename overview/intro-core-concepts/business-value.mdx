# Product Value and Key Use Cases

## Unlocking Transparency in Web Connections
Every webpage you visit initiates a number of outbound connections behind the scenes. Some of these connections are essential for content delivery, while others are third-party requests that may affect your privacy or security. uBO Scope shines a light on these network activities, providing critical transparency where browsers and content blockers fall short.

This page reveals the core user problems uBO Scope addresses and illustrates real-world scenarios where its insights are indispensable.

## Why uBO Scope Matters

### See the Invisible Connections Hiding in Your Browser
Websites often include third-party resources like ads, trackers, and content delivery networks. Many browsers and blockers count or report network requests simply by volume or blocked events without distinguishing the unique servers involved.

With uBO Scope, you gain an accurate, clear overview of *distinct third-party servers* your browser connects to — whether these connections were allowed, blocked, or stealthily filtered. This nuanced visibility translates into better understanding and control over your browsing security and privacy.

### Debunking Common Misconceptions about Content Blocking

- **Block Count Is Not a Reliability Metric**
  Block count badges on content blockers do not provide a reliable measure of blocking effectiveness. In fact, a higher block count can coincide with a *larger* number of unique third-party connections, because blockers can differ in what they block versus what they allow. uBO Scope helps you evaluate blockers based on the *number of distinct third-party servers from which resources are actually fetched* — an ultimate measure of exposure.

- **Fake Ad-Blocker Test Pages Are Misleading**
  Popular "ad blocker test" pages often execute artificial network requests to detect blocking but are not representative of real-world browsing patterns. These pages cannot detect stealthy blocking techniques used by some content blockers, leading to false positives or negatives. uBO Scope provides real-time monitoring of actual browser network activity, delivering genuine insights.

### Support for Filter List Maintainers and Network Auditing

Beyond individual users, uBO Scope is a powerful ally for filter list maintainers and auditors. It offers a clear, truthful picture of which network requests are blocked or allowed across browsing sessions, even on devices where developer tools or browser internals are inaccessible.

This transparency helps maintainers verify filter effectiveness, uncover stealth connections, and eliminate false assumptions.

## Core Use Cases and Real-World Scenarios

### 1. Understanding Third-Party Connections with Clarity

Imagine visiting a news site and wondering how many third-party servers are involved. uBO Scope shows:

- Domains that successfully loaded resources.
- Stealth blocked domains where requests were redirected or subtly blocked.
- Fully blocked domains where requests failed.

This triage helps you differentiate between legitimate third-party services (like CDNs) and potentially intrusive trackers or ads.

### 2. Debunking the 'More Blocks Means Better Protection' Myth

When comparing content blockers, you might notice one reports blocking 10,000 connections while another reports 500. uBO Scope reveals that the "higher block count" blocker may still allow connections to significantly more unique third-party servers, resulting in less real protection.

This insight refocuses evaluation from raw counts to meaningful exposure.

### 3. Exposing Stealth Network Activity

Some trackers or scripts employ methods to bypass content blockers silently, remaining hidden from regular blocking indicators. By reporting stealth-blocked domains, uBO Scope surfaces these hidden connections, enabling users and maintainers to detect and address the gaps.

### 4. Validating Content Blockers Across All Layers

Blockers may operate at various levels — browser extensions, DNS filtering, or network proxies. uBO Scope captures network request outcomes regardless of blocking method (as long as the browser’s `webRequest` API reports them), offering a unified view of network blocking effectiveness.

### 5. Supporting Filter List Development and Triage

Filter list maintainers benefit from uBO Scope's detailed reporting when debugging or improving filter sets, especially when browser tools are limited or unavailable. It accelerates audit workflows by clarifying request outcomes and domain associations.

## The uBO Scope Advantage

- **Precise Counting of Unique Third-Party Servers**
  Counts distinct server domains separately from raw request totals for meaningful insights.

- **Categorization of Connection Outcomes**
  Separates allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections for comprehensive analysis.

- **Independence from Content Blockers**
  Operates alongside any content blocker, reflecting the true network impact.

- **Real-Time Monitoring**
  Provides immediate feedback on network activity per browser tab.

- **User-Friendly Presentation**
  Summarizes complex network interactions in a simple, easy-to-understand popup.

## Example Workflow: Using uBO Scope to Validate Blocking Effectiveness

1. **Install uBO Scope** in your browser alongside your content blocker.
2. Open a website you want to analyze.
3. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the popup.
4. Review the sections listing domains by outcome:
   - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which content was fetched.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with intercepted network activity.
   - **Blocked:** Domains with outright blocked requests.
5. Identify unexpected or suspicious third-party domains.
6. Adjust your content blocker or filters accordingly.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep an Eye on Distinct Domains, Not Just Request Counts**
  Focus on reducing the unique third-party domains from which resources load to enhance privacy.

- **Use uBO Scope's Reporting as a Complement, Not Replacement**
  Combine insights with filter lists and extension settings for comprehensive blocking strategy.

- **Beware of Stealth Connections**
  Any domains showing under stealth-blocked might warrant further investigation.

- **Regularly Refresh and Validate**
  Changes to websites and filters mean periodic review using uBO Scope keeps your blocking effective.

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting uBO Scope Insights">
<Accordion title="Why do some domains appear in the stealth-blocked list?">
Stealth-blocked domains represent network requests that were intercepted or redirected in ways that aren’t visible as outright failures. They may indicate advanced blocking techniques or unexpected redirects. Investigate these domains to ensure no hidden tracking or data leaks occur.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is my extension badge count different from uBO Scope's count?">
The badge reflects the number of unique allowed third-party domains with successful connections. Other counters may include all requests or blocked ones, inflating numbers. uBO Scope focuses on actual distinct remote servers contacted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why can't uBO Scope see some network requests?">
uBO Scope depends on the browser’s webRequest API. Requests made outside this scope (e.g., certain WebSocket connections or browser APIs) might not be reported. In such cases, the network activity is outside uBO Scope’s reach.
