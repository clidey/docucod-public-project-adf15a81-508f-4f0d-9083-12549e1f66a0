## Audiences That Gain Clear Advantage from uBO Scope

### 1. Privacy-Conscious Users

If you care deeply about online privacy, uBO Scope lets you visualize the number of third-party servers your browser actually connects to while browsing. Unlike traditional ad blockers that report only the number of filtered requests, uBO Scope reveals the **distinct third-party domains you connect with in real time**.

- **Why it matters:** You can verify if your content blocker is truly limiting third-party exposure or if connections are still slipping through unnoticed.
- **Typical scenarios:** When browsing sensitive sites, checking if unexpected third parties are contacted.
- **Outcome:** Gain confidence, control, and smarter privacy decisions backed by concrete data.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers and Content Blocker Developers

Maintainers and developers who create or refine filter lists for content blockers face the challenge of validating the effectiveness of their rules. uBO Scope highlights all network connections regardless of which blocker is used, including those blocked by DNS or stealth-blocking techniques.

- **Why it matters:** It surfaces domains that bypass filters or are stealthily blocked, giving maintainers direct insight into real-world effectiveness.
- **Use case:** Confirming that new or updated rules actually reduce third-party connections on target sites.
- **Outcome:** Improved filter quality and trust in blocking strategies.

### 3. Users Evaluating Content Blockers

Many users compare content blockers by headline metrics like block counts, often misled by higher block counts suggesting better performance. uBO Scope debunks these myths by focusing on the **true measure: distinct third-party servers connected to, not just requests blocked**.

- **Why it matters:** You can objectively assess if a content blocker reduces exposure to third-party servers rather than inflating block numbers.
- **Scenario:** Choosing or switching blockers based on authentic network activity rather than misleading test webpages or block counts.
- **Outcome:** Make informed choices about blockers that truly protect your browsing.

### 4. Users on Platforms with Limited Browser Tool Access

On devices or browsers where developer tools or advanced network panels aren’t easily accessible—such as mobile browsers or restricted corporate environments—uBO Scope provides a straightforward, practical window into network activity.

- **Why it matters:** You can still audit third-party connections even without dedicated network inspection tools.
- **Example:** Quickly checking network connections on mobile without heavy technical setup.
- **Outcome:** Empowered users with more visibility, regardless of platform restrictions.

## Real-World Impact: Examples

### Example 1: Validating Content Blocker Effectiveness
A user installs a new content blocker and notices it shows a very high block count badge. Using uBO Scope, they discover that despite high blocks, the number of distinct third-party servers contacted is actually higher than before, revealing the blocker allows more third-party connections.

### Example 2: Privacy Audit on a News Website
Before visiting a news site, a privacy-conscious user activates uBO Scope. They observe a handful of third-party domains connecting directly, including some unexpected trackers, prompting them to tweak their blocker settings or consider stricter filtering.

### Example 3: Filter List Maintenance on Limited Resources
A filter list maintainer working from a mobile device, without access to browser developer tools, uses uBO Scope to analyze the domains contacted during site visits, identifying stealthy scripts that evade existing filters.

<Tip>
The badge on the uBO Scope icon indicates the number of distinct allowed third-party servers your browser connected to on the active tab. A lower number signals fewer third-party connections — which generally means better privacy protection.
