# Key Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the key terms and concepts behind uBO Scope is essential to confidently navigate the app and interpret its network insights. This page breaks down the primary definitions and ideas you'll encounter, helping you build a strong foundational knowledge from the very first interaction.

## What Is a Remote Server?

A **remote server** refers to any external server that your browser tries to communicate with when loading a webpage. These connections go beyond the website you're visiting and often include third-party services such as content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics servers, advertising platforms, or embedded widgets.

> For example, if you visit example.com, but your browser also connects to fonts.googleapis.com to fetch fonts, then fonts.googleapis.com is a remote server.

Understanding which remote servers are contacted helps you see how much your web activity depends on external entities.

## What Are Third-Party Connections?

A **third-party connection** is a network request made from the web page you visit to a remote server that is different from the site's own domain.

- **First-party**: Requests made to the domain you are visiting.
- **Third-party**: Requests made to any other domain.

These third-party connections often provide additional functionality but can also be sources of tracking or advertising.

uBO Scope focuses on surfacing these **third-party network connections** so you understand what external servers your browser is communicating with.

## Understanding Connection Status: Blocked, Allowed, and Stealth-Blocked

uBO Scope classifies network connections into three main categories based on their observed outcomes:

- **Allowed**: These are connections where network requests were successful and resources were fetched from remote servers.

- **Blocked**: These connections were actively prevented from completing. The browser or your content blocker intervened to stop the network requests from reaching the remote server.

- **Stealth-Blocked**: This unique status indicates network requests that were intercepted and blocked in a way that is hidden (stealthy) to the webpage itself. This means the blocking is done silently, often to prevent breakage or detection by the site.

### Why Does This Matter?

These statuses allow you to differentiate between connections your browser fully allowed, connections actively blocked, and those silently suppressed without alerting the website.

## The Badge Count and What It Represents

The badge count shown on the uBO Scope toolbar icon reflects **the number of distinct third-party remote servers with allowed (successful) connections** for the active tab.

- A higher badge count means more external third-party connections were made.
- A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party servers contacted, which usually suggests less exposure to third-party content (including trackers and ads).


> **Important:** This badge count does _not_ represent how many connections were blocked; it only shows those that were allowed. This distinction helps you understand the actual number of distinct external servers your browser connected to successfully.

## Summary of Terms

| Term              | Definition                                                                                         |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Remote Server     | An external server contacted by your browser when loading a webpage.                             |
| Third-Party Connection | A network request from the visited website to a different domain than the site itself.         |
| Allowed           | Connections that succeeded and fetched data from remote servers.                                |
| Blocked           | Connections that were actively prevented by your content blocker or browser.                     |
| Stealth-Blocked   | Connections blocked silently or stealthily, hidden from the webpage to avoid disruption.          |
| Badge Count       | The number of distinct third-party remote servers that had allowed connections on the current tab.|

## Real-World Scenario: Interpreting These Concepts

Imagine you're visiting a news site. While the main content loads from news.com (the first-party), your browser makes connections to analytics.com, ads.com, and fonts.cdn.com.

- **Allowed:** Fonts are fetched successfully from fonts.cdn.com, so this domain counts towards the badge number.
- **Blocked:** Requests to ads.com are prevented by your content blocker, so ads.com shows as blocked in the popup but doesn’t increase the badge.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** The analytics.com request is stealth-blocked, meaning it was blocked quietly without the site noticing.

Your uBO Scope badge might show "1" for one allowed third-party server – fonts.cdn.com – while your popup separates these domains by their statuses to give you clear insight.

## Tips to Succeed with uBO Scope

- Focus on reducing the badge count for better privacy and faster browsing by minimizing allowed third-party connections.
- Use the popup panel to see granular details and verify which domains are blocked or stealth-blocked.
- Remember stealth-blocking helps prevent webpage breakage without alerting websites; this helps maintain usability.
