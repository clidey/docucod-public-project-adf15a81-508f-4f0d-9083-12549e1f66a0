# Core Concepts and Terminology

Understanding the essential terms and concepts behind uBO Scope is critical for making sense of the data you see in the popup and interpreting what’s happening behind the scenes. This guide demystifies key terminology to ensure users of all levels—from beginners to advanced filter list maintainers—have the clarity needed to confidently analyze and act on connection data.

---

## What is a Third-Party Server?

A **third-party server** is any remote server contacted by your browser that is different from the domain of the webpage you are currently visiting. These are often external services such as content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics providers, advertising networks, or social media plugins.

- **Example:** When you visit `example.com` and your browser makes a request to `cdn.provider.net`, `cdn.provider.net` is a third-party server.

Understanding third-party servers helps identify all external connections a webpage triggers.

---

## The webRequest API

The **webRequest API** is a browser-provided interface used by uBO Scope to monitor network requests initiated by webpages. It captures detailed information about each request as it happens:

- URL requested
- Request type (e.g., main page load, image, script)
- Status of the request (allowed, blocked, redirected)
- Originating tab and frame information

uBO Scope listens to events from this API to record and categorize all network connections.

---

## What is Stealth Blocking?

**Stealth blocking** refers to a network blocking technique that prevents a resource from loading without the webpage or server detecting the block explicitly. Unlike normal blocking which often returns error responses, stealth blocking intercepts or redirects requests quietly so that the page behaves normally or cannot easily infer it was blocked.

- **In uBO Scope:** Stealth-blocked domains appear separately from explicitly blocked ones, highlighting requests where blocking was conducted discreetly.

This helps users detect subtle blocking actions that could otherwise be hidden.

---

## Badge Count Explained

The **badge count** displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon represents the **number of unique third-party domains the current tab has connected to and that were allowed** (not blocked).

- A **lower badge count** means fewer third-party servers were contacted.
- This count excludes blocked or stealth-blocked domains.

The badge helps users quickly assess the degree of exposure to third-party connections for the active webpage.

---

## Key Outcome Categories in the Popup

The popup interface categorizes and lists third-party domains by connection outcome:

- **Not blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which network requests successfully loaded.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where blocking occurred quietly without explicit error messages.
- **Blocked:** Domains where network requests were actively blocked with errors.

Each category shows domains and a count of requests made, providing a clear overview of how different third parties interacted with the page.

---

## Domain vs. Hostname

- **Hostname:** The full domain name part of a URL, including subdomains. For example, `media.example.com`.
- **Domain:** The registered base domain excluding subdomains, derived using the Public Suffix List. For example, for `media.example.com`, the domain is `example.com`.

uBO Scope aggregates data by domain whenever possible to avoid fragmentation caused by subdomains.

---

## Why the Public Suffix List Matters

uBO Scope uses the **Public Suffix List (PSL)** to accurately determine registered domains from full hostnames. PSL is a maintained list that identifies domain suffixes under which users can register domains (e.g., `.com`, `.co.uk`).

This ensures:

- Accurate grouping of network requests by meaningful domain names.
- Correct identification of third-party domains even with internationalized domain names (IDNs).

---

## Request Outcomes and Their Meaning

uBO Scope tracks three core outcomes for network requests:

- **Success:** Request completed and data loaded. Indicates allowed connections.
- **Redirect:** Request was redirected (often stealthily) before completion.
- **Error:** Request failed intentionally (blocked) or due to network issues.

These outcomes inform the categorization of domains into allowed, stealth, or blocked sections.

---

## User Context: What You See and What It Means

When you open the uBO Scope popup, here’s how the information connects to your browsing:

1. **Hostnames and Domains:** Identify the active page’s domain and any third-party servers contacted.
2. **Summary:** Total count of either unique third-party domains connected.
3. **Allowed:** Domains from which resources loaded successfully—trusted or necessary third parties.
4. **Stealth-blocked:** Domains blocked quietly by content blockers or other mechanisms.
5. **Blocked:** Domains actively blocked and prevented from loading.

By understanding these terms, you gain an accurate and actionable snapshot of your browsing’s network footprint.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Use badge count as your quick privacy metric:** A lower number means fewer third-party exposures.
- **Investigate stealth-blocked domains carefully:** They can hint at subtle content blocking or tracking evasion.
- **Remember domains vs. hostnames:** Don’t get confused by multiple subdomains belonging to the same base domain.
- **Keep PSL updated:** uBO Scope fetches and caches the latest Public Suffix List to ensure accuracy.
- **Consult other documentation pages:** For a deeper understanding, visit [Product Overview](../intro-core-concepts/product-overview) and [How uBO Scope Monitors Connections](../../getting-started/first-steps-usage-validation/how-it-works).

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Terminology Confusions">
<Accordion title="Why does a domain appear in both allowed and stealth-blocked lists?">
A domain can have different requests with different outcomes: some requests may be allowed, others stealth-blocked. uBO Scope tracks these separately to give detailed insight.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if the badge count doesn't seem to match the number of domains listed?">
The badge reflects only allowed third-party domains, not blocked or stealth-blocked ones, and counts unique base domains, not full hostnames.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why are some domains shown in Punycode format?">
Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) are often represented in Punycode internally to handle non-ASCII characters. uBO Scope converts these back to human-readable Unicode when displaying.
