# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Third-Party Connection Behind the Scenes

uBO Scope empowers you to see all attempted and successful third-party remote server connections initiated by any webpage, regardless of which content blocker or DNS-based filtering solution you use. Whether you’re a privacy-conscious user or a filter list maintainer, uBO Scope reveals the true network activity in your browser — no more guesswork, no more myths.

---

## Overview

### What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to transparently report every network connection a webpage tries to make to third-party remote servers. It tracks connections even when browsers have content blockers or DNS filtering enabled, showing what requests get through, which are stealth-blocked (redirected behind the scenes), and which are outright blocked.

By listening to the browser’s native `webRequest` API, uBO Scope provides a clear and comprehensive picture of all network interactions initiated by the page you're visiting. This visibility helps you understand exactly what external servers a page attempts to connect with, regardless of your blocking setup.

### Why does this matter?

Typical content blockers show counts of blocked requests, but these counts alone do not reflect the true effectiveness of blocking. uBO Scope shifts focus from request counts to the actual number of distinct third-party domains contacted by your browser. This distinction matters because a lower number of connected domains typically means less exposure to third-party tracking and fewer external resources loaded.

uBO Scope debunks common misconceptions about content blockers and ad blocker test pages that often misrepresent blocking effectiveness. It also assists filter list maintainers by revealing live connections without relying on browser developer tools.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Full transparency:** See all remote server connections initiated by webpages, both successful and blocked.
- **Blocker-agnostic reporting:** Works regardless of the content blocking or DNS filtering solution in use.
- **Domain-focused insights:** Focuses on distinct third-party domains rather than just raw request counts.
- **Myth busting:** Helps debunk misleading claims about blocker effectiveness and test pages.
- **Filter list support:** Assists maintainers by exposing real-world network activity on devices with limited tooling.

## Key Features & Highlights

- **Live Third-Party Domain Counting:** The toolbar badge dynamically shows the count of unique third-party domains your browser contacted on the current tab.

- **Categorized Outcomes:** Connections are grouped into three clear categories:
  - **Allowed:** Requests that successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests internally redirected or stealthily handled.
  - **Blocked:** Requests that failed due to blocking or network errors.

- **Works Across Browsers:** Compatible with Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari, provided the browser exposes network activity through the `webRequest` API.

- **Insight Without Interference:** Does not interfere with browsing or blocking behavior; only reports what happens.

- **Lightweight & Simple UI:** Presents clear summaries of connected domains in an easy-to-understand popup interface.

## How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Browsing Experience

Imagine you're browsing your favorite website. Behind the scenes, many different servers — often unknowingly — are contacted to load ads, analytics, or content delivery networks (CDNs). Blockers try to stop unwanted requests, but how do you really know which ones were blocked and which connected?

uBO Scope shines a light on this by:

- Detecting every request your browser initiates.
- Identifying the third-party domain for each request.
- Categorizing requests by their outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked).
- Presenting a real-time count of unique third-party domains.

This insight lets you make informed decisions about your privacy, blocker choices, and filter list adjustments.

## Real-World Examples

### Scenario 1: Understanding Your Privacy Exposure
You visit a news site with many ad trackers. Your content blocker claims to have a high number of blocked elements, but uBO Scope reveals that your browser is still connecting to 8 distinct third-party domains. This helps you understand the practical exposure rather than relying solely on blockers' counts.

### Scenario 2: Verifying Filter List Effectiveness
You maintain a filter list and want to confirm that your rules prevent connections to certain trackers. Using uBO Scope, you observe the blocked domains and verify your list’s effectiveness on real-world sites.

### Scenario 3: Disproving Ad Blocker Myths
When comparing two blockers, you notice one shows fewer blocked requests but connects to fewer remote domains. uBO Scope helps clarify that a higher block count can sometimes mean more connections slipped through, helping you choose the better tool.

## Tips to Make the Most of uBO Scope

- Use uBO Scope alongside any content blocker to verify real network outcomes.
- Don’t rely on block counts alone — focus on the count of distinct connected domains.
- Use the extension to cross-verify claims from ad blocker test pages and marketing.
- Filter list maintainers can glean real-world connection data to improve blocking rules.

## Common Questions & Considerations

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Asked Questions">
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope block or modify any requests?">
No. uBO Scope is a passive observer designed to report network activity. It does not block or modify any requests itself.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Will uBO Scope detect connections blocked by DNS filtering?">
Yes. As long as your browser reports the network request via its `webRequest` API, uBO Scope can detect the outcome, including blocking that happens through DNS or external content blockers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope report connections made outside the browser's webRequest API?">
No. Network requests made outside the browser’s `webRequest` API (e.g., some embedded plugins or lower-level system networking) are not visible to uBO Scope.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why does uBO Scope sometimes show stealth-blocked connections?">
Stealth-blocking refers to requests that may be internally redirected or hidden by blockers in a way that is not directly apparent. uBO Scope categorizes these separately to clarify the network activity.
