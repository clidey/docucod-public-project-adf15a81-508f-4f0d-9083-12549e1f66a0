# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Outbound Connection from Your Browser

uBO Scope is a specialized browser extension designed to unveil every outbound connection that a webpage attempts or successfully makes to remote servers. Unlike traditional content blockers that primarily focus on blocking unwanted content, uBO Scope’s mission is straightforward: to **reveal** the network behavior of webpages in real-time.

This clarity serves privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers by exposing the full landscape of remote server interactions initiated during browsing.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Transparent Insight:** See all remote servers that webpages connect to — whether connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.
- **Privacy Empowerment:** Understand the true scope of third-party connections that impact your privacy and security.
- **Filter List Support:** Gain reliable data to enhance filter lists with accurate domain connection patterns that may otherwise be hidden.
- **Independent of Blocking Efficacy:** Works alongside any content blocker, providing a clear network request outcome irrespective of the blocking technology in place.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users who want clear visibility into the third-party servers contacted by webpages.
- Filter list maintainers who need trustworthy data on network requests to improve blocking rules.
- Security researchers or auditors interested in uncovering hidden or stealthy network connections.

## What is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a **network request monitoring extension** for browsers, leveraging the powerful `webRequest` API to track and report all outgoing network calls made by pages you visit. It listens to browser-level network events and categorizes connections into:

- **Allowed connections:** Requests that successfully reached their destination.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Requests blocked invisibly by content blockers, undetectable by pages themselves.
- **Blocked connections:** Requests that failed, typically due to content blocking, errors, or filters.

## How uBO Scope Differs from Traditional Content Blockers

Most content blockers emphasize **blocking unwanted resources** like ads or trackers, and some only reveal high-level block counts. uBO Scope, instead, **focuses purely on visibility and reporting** rather than interference.

- It does **not block or filter on its own**.
- Displays outcomes of every network request transparently, regardless of which blockers are installed.
- Differentiates between genuinely allowed connections and stealth-blocked ones, clarifying misconceptions around block counts.

This makes uBO Scope a complementary tool, not a competitor, to content blockers.

## How uBO Scope Works in Brief

1. **Network Listening:** It hooks into browser network events (`onBeforeRedirect`, `onErrorOccurred`, `onResponseStarted`) for all HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket requests.
2. **Outcome Categorization:** Requests are classified into allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked by examining their response status and event types.
3. **Tab Association & Aggregation:** Network information is aggregated per browser tab, mapping hostnames and domains uniquely.
4. **User Interface Presentation:** A browser toolbar icon badge reports the count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted.

Upon clicking the extension icon, a popup reveals detailed lists of domains contacted, grouped by their connection outcome.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine browsing a news website. While reading, numerous third-party servers request data or serve content silently in the background. Some requests are allowed because they come from essential services like CDNs; others might be stealthily blocked by your content blocker without your knowledge.

uBO Scope exposes these connections to you with clear counts and categorizations, enabling you to:

- Identify unexpected or suspicious third-party domains.
- Verify whether your content blocker effectively blocks certain trackers or ads.
- Understand if stealth blocking is occurring, meaning some blocks are invisible to page scripts.

## Practical Benefits

- Gain **clarity over web tracking connections** to protect your privacy proactively.
- Avoid being misled by misleading block counts from other blockers.
- Help **improve filter lists** with accurate, observed data directly from real browsing sessions.

## Getting Started

To start using uBO Scope, simply install the extension on your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Once installed, click the toolbar icon to open the popup and begin monitoring the outbound connections on any active tab. The badge on the toolbar icon shows the current count of distinct third-party connections.

For detailed setup and steps, see [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) and the related guide pages in this documentation.

## Tips for Effective Use

- Remember that a **lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections** — generally a better privacy outcome.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your favorite content blocker; it reports independently from whatever is installed.
- Investigate unexpected domains to uncover hidden tracking or potentially malicious connections.
- Leverage uBO Scope’s detailed reporting when refining or maintaining filter lists.

## Troubleshooting and Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Asked Questions">
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope block anything by itself?">
No. uBO Scope only monitors and reports connections. It will not block or interfere with any content.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope detect all network requests?">
It detects all network requests visible to the browser's `webRequest` API, including HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket connections. However, network activity initiated outside browser scope or not exposed by the API will not be reported.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How is stealth blocking different from blocking?">
Stealth blocking means the network request was blocked invisibly, so the requesting webpage cannot detect the block. uBO Scope reveals these stealth blocks to give you a true picture of content blocking effectiveness.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is the count on the toolbar icon a block count?">
No. The badge count indicates the number of distinct third-party remote servers with allowed connections. Fewer connections generally mean better privacy.
