# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the core concepts and terminology behind uBO Scope is essential to fully grasp how it reports network activity and what the displayed data means. This page walks you through definitions and key terms such as third-party remote server, stealth blocking, allowed and blocked connection outcomes, and more. Equipped with this knowledge, users can confidently interpret uBO Scope's output, empowering privacy assessments and investigative workflows.

## Understanding Key Terms

### Third-Party Remote Server
A third-party remote server is any server that a webpage attempts to connect to that is **not part of the primary website's own domain or its subdomains**. In uBO Scope,
- These are the distinct external servers your browser contacts while loading and rendering a webpage.
- Monitoring third-party connections is crucial because they can affect your privacy and web performance.

#### Real-World Example:
If you visit `example.com`, and the page loads scripts or images from `cdn.analytics.net`, `ads.tracker.com`, or `fonts.cloud.net`, these are all third-party servers.

### Allowed vs Blocked Outcomes
uBO Scope tracks the fate of each network request to remote servers under three categories:

- **Allowed:** The request succeeded and the resource was fetched from the remote server. This means the connection was permitted.
- **Blocked:** The request did not complete because it was blocked by content blocking or network errors. The connection attempt was prevented.
- **Stealth Blocked:** Some connection attempts are redirected or prevented in a way that is not straightforwardly visible to typical web monitoring (often by the browser or the content blocker quietly intervening). uBO Scope tracks these separately to highlight potentially hidden blocking activities.

This categorization helps to clarify which servers your browser effectively communicated with and which were stopped or redirected, refining your understanding beyond generic block counts.

### Hostname vs Domain
- **Hostname:** The full host portion of a URL, e.g., `sub.example.com`.
- **Domain:** The registered (main) domain, e.g., `example.com`.

uBO Scope groups and reports by domain to reduce clutter and focus on unique server identities.

### Public Suffix List (PSL)
uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List (PSL) to identify domains accurately:
- The PSL defines domain suffixes under which Internet users can directly register names.
- By referencing the PSL, uBO Scope extracts the effective top-level domain plus one label (eTLD+1), helping it correctly classify hostnames into domains.

### Network Request Events and Outcomes
uBO Scope listens to network events via the browser’s `webRequest` API. These include:

- **Success:** The network request was completed successfully.
- **Redirect:** The request was redirected, which may indicate stealth blocking if it leads to a blocked or altered request.
- **Error:** The request failed, often due to blocking (by content blockers or DNS-level blocking).

### Stealth Blocking Explained
Stealth blocking refers to scenarios where blocking is performed invisibly or indirectly:
- Unlike explicit blocks where requests fail or are canceled visibly,
- Stealth blocking uses redirection or suppression techniques that do not raise typical network errors,
- This helps content blockers prevent detection while still blocking undesired connections.

uBO Scope distinguishes stealth blocking to keep you aware of such subtle interference.

## How These Terms Apply in uBO Scope

When you open the uBO Scope popup on a browser tab, the extension reports:

- The **hostname** and **domain** of the current active tab.
- The number of **distinct domains connected** (allowed connections).
- Lists of domains grouped into **Allowed (not blocked)**, **Stealth Blocked**, and **Blocked**.

This classification is derived from how the extension processes incoming network requests and categorizes them based on their outcomes, helping you audit your browsing activity in real time.

## Practical Tips for Interpretation

- A **lower count of allowed third-party domains** typically correlates to better privacy and fewer network connections.
- Don't equate a higher block count with more privacy — consider the **number of allowed connections** instead.
- Use the distinction between stealth blocking and blocked to understand the sophistication or subtlety of content blocking in use.
- Recognize that **not all third parties are harmful**; many serve essential functions such as content delivery (CDNs) or fonts.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Confusing hostname with domain:** Remember, uBO Scope reports mainly by domain level for clarity.
- **Misreading the badge count:** The badge shows the number of _allowed distinct third-party servers_, not blocked or total requests.
- **Relying on ad blocker test sites:** Such tests may not reflect real browsing reality and often fail to detect stealth blocking.
