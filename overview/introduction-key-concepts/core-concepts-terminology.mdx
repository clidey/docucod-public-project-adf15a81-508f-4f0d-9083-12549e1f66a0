# Core Concepts & Terminology

Welcome to the foundational guide of uBO Scope. Here, you'll find clear explanations of critical terms like *third-party remote servers*, *badge count*, and *webRequest API* that shape how uBO Scope gathers and presents data. This knowledge ensures you confidently interpret the data displayed by uBO Scope and understand its implications for tracking and privacy.

## Understanding Key Terms

### Third-Party Remote Servers

In the context of uBO Scope, a third-party remote server refers to any domain contacted by your browser that is different from the website you are currently visiting (the first party). These third-party servers may serve content such as advertisements, analytics scripts, trackers, or legitimate resources like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).

- **Why it matters**: The badge count on the uBO Scope toolbar icon displays the number of *distinct third-party remote servers* contacted during your browsing session. This metric provides a direct insight into the external connections your browser makes, highlighting potential exposure to tracking or unnecessary third-party requests.

- **Example:** When visiting example.com, if your browser contacts cdn.example.com, it’s typically considered first-party or same-domain. However, if it contacts analytics-service.com or ads.network.net, these are third-party remote servers.


### Badge Count

The badge count is a dynamic numeric indicator shown on the uBO Scope extension icon in the browser toolbar.

- **What it shows:** It counts the number of unique third-party remote servers your browser connected to for the current active tab.
- **User value:** A lower badge count generally means fewer external connections and potentially less tracking, whereas a higher count suggests more third-party interactions.

<Tip>
Keep in mind that not all third-party connections are harmful or unwanted. Content such as fonts, scripts from trusted CDNs, or necessary external resources naturally contribute to this count.
</Tip>

### webRequest API

The `webRequest API` is a powerful browser API that allows extensions to monitor, analyze, and potentially block network requests initiated by webpages.

- **Role in uBO Scope:** uBO Scope relies on this API to detect network requests, regardless of whether a content blocker is active. It listens to the lifecycle events of network requests — such as when they start, encounter errors, or get redirected — to determine how each connection was handled.
- **Key points:**
  - It reports if requests succeeded, failed, or were redirected.
  - This capability enables uBO Scope to provide accurate reporting on which third-party servers your browser contacted.
  - Requests falling outside `webRequest` visibility (e.g., some DNS-level blocks or network requests made outside the browser's context) cannot be tracked.


## Additional Concepts

### Domain and Hostname

- **Hostname:** The full network address of a resource, for example, `ads.tracker.example.com`.
- **Domain:** The registered base domain, determined using the Public Suffix List (PSL) to correctly identify boundaries. For instance, for `ads.tracker.example.com`, the domain is `example.com`.

uBO Scope resolves all hostnames to their base domains for easier interpretation and aggregation.

### Outcomes of Network Requests

uBO Scope categorizes each third-party connection based on how the request was handled:

- **Allowed:** Network requests completed successfully.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed or were prevented (due to content blockers or network errors).
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Redirected requests intercepted and silently blocked to avoid detection by webpages.

This categorization helps you precisely understand which third parties are active on your browsing tab.

---

## How These Concepts Come Together

When you open the uBO Scope popup panel, it displays a summary of connection outcomes for the active tab:

- It shows the current page's hostname and domain.
- It lists third-party domains grouped by outcome:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains whose requests were silently intercepted.
  - **Blocked:** Domains whose requests failed or were blocked.

The badge count corresponds to the total number of distinct allowed third-party domains, helping you quickly assess the breadth of external connections.

---

## Practical Implications for Tracking and Privacy

By understanding these core terms, you gain transparency into your browser's network behavior:

- Spot excessive or unexpected third-party connections that could indicate trackers or intrusive scripts.
- Verify how effective your content blocker is by comparing blocked vs allowed domains.
- Make informed decisions about your privacy settings and filter lists.

uBO Scope empowers you with direct visibility backed by these concepts to make sense of complex network traffic.

## Tips for Users

- **Interpret the badge carefully:** Remember, the badge shows unique *third-party* connections, not the total number of blocked requests.
- **Use the domain vs hostname distinction:** Focus on domains for a clearer high-level understanding of external servers.
- **Check all outcomes:** Stealth-blocked connections might be silently prevented, so review those to understand full blocker behavior.
- **Leverage Public Suffix List (PSL):** uBO Scope uses the PSL to precisely define what counts as a distinct domain, avoiding misleading splits of subdomains.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Confusions">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge go up even though I have a blocker on?">
Blocked requests can show higher counts if a blocker allows many distinct third-party servers despite blocking many requests. The badge shows allowed third-party domains, so a high count indicates many connections were established.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if I see no data or 'NO DATA' in the popup?">
This usually means uBO Scope hasn't received network data for the current tab yet. Refreshing the page, ensuring permissions are granted, or checking browser compatibility with webRequest API can resolve this.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are all third-party domains trackers or ads?">
No, some third-party domains can belong to legitimate services like CDNs, analytics, or essential resources. Use the information as a starting point to investigate further.

## Summary
- Third-party remote servers are external domains contacted that differ from the web page domain.
- The badge count reflects the number of unique allowed third-party domains per active tab.
- The webRequest API allows uBO Scope to listen and classify network requests’ outcomes.
- Domains and hostnames are normalized using the Public Suffix List for clarity.
- Request outcomes: allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked provide insights into what connections succeeded or were intercepted.

Understanding these fundamental terms arms you with the context to confidently analyze uBO Scope’s data and make privacy-conscious decisions.
