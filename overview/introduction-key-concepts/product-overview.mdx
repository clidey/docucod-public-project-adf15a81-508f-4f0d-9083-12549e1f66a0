# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Remote Connection Made by Your Browser

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to transparently reveal all connections—whether attempted or successful—that your browser makes to remote servers for each open tab. It sheds light on the often-hidden third-party network activity behind any website you visit, regardless of which content blocker you have active.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You

- **Complete Visibility:** Know exactly how many distinct third-party servers are contacted by any website.
- **Cross-Blocker Compatibility:** Works independently of any content blocker, providing consistent connection insights.
- **Informed Privacy Decisions:** Quickly identify potentially unwanted third-party domains.
- **Debunk Misconceptions:** Understand that a higher block count does not necessarily mean better blocking.

### Who Benefits from uBO Scope?
- Privacy-conscious users keen on understanding their web traffic.
- Filter list maintainers who need clear visibility of third-party connections.
- Security professionals looking to audit network connections initiated by browsers.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a companion extension built to reveal the unseen world of network requests made by web pages. Unlike traditional content blockers, which operate by preventing requests, uBO Scope's focus is purely observational and informative. It transparently tracks and reports every remote server connection your browser attempts or completes per tab.

### The Core Purpose

Many websites silently connect to numerous third-party domains, sometimes creating privacy and security concerns. Content blockers help control this, but they can't always show you what connections your browser tries behind the scenes. uBO Scope bridges that gap by providing you a detailed, real-time report of:

- Which remote servers are contacted.
- Which connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- The exact number of unique third-party domains interacting with a website.

This empowers you with clarity about the network activity that content blockers alone don't provide.

### What Sets uBO Scope Apart?

- **Transparency Over Control:** It does not block or modify network requests; it reveals their outcomes.
- **Independent Operation:** Works side-by-side with any content blocker, reporting requests regardless of the blocker’s presence or type.
- **Real-World Insight:** Debunks common misconceptions about block counts and blocker effectiveness by grounding data in distinct third-party server counts.

## How uBO Scope Works at a High Level

When you browse, your browser makes requests—some first-party (originating from the site you're visiting) and others third-party (originating from different domains). uBO Scope listens to these network requests using your browser's native `webRequest` API:

- It monitors requests initiated by webpages.
- Categorizes each request’s outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked).
- Aggregates this data per browser tab, mapping hostnames to their parent domains.
- Displays a real-time badge showing the number of unique third-party domains currently connected.

uBO Scope uses a built-in public suffix list to accurately identify the root domains from hostnames, providing clearer reports at the domain level.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### Transparent Network Connection Reporting
- Monitors every network request your browser makes from each tab.
- Shows which domains are contacted, categorized by outcome.

### Real-Time Badge Indicator
- Toolbar icon badge updates live to reflect the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- Low numbers on this badge indicate fewer external connections and a more privacy-friendly browsing session.

### Detailed Popup Panel Insight
- Breaks down connections into three categories:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains where connections succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests silently redirected or suppressed.
  - **Blocked:** Requests outright prevented from completing.
- Each domain entry includes a count of how many network requests were made.

### Works Alongside All Content Blockers
- Does not depend on or interfere with content blockers.
- Accurately reflects connections regardless of DNS-level blocking, proxy-based blockers, or browser-integrated protections.

### Accurate Domain Resolution Using Public Suffix List
- Uses an integrated database derived from Mozilla’s Public Suffix List.
- Correctly extracts registrable domains from hostnames to prevent misleading granularity.

## Real-World Scenarios

- **Privacy Auditing:** You visit an article on a news site and wonder how many third-party advertisers or trackers are contacted. uBO Scope instantly reveals all distinct domains your browser talks to, helping you decide if the site respects your privacy.

- **Evaluating Blockers:** After configuring a new content blocker, you want to verify its effect. Instead of relying solely on block counts, which can be misleading, uBO Scope shows the actual number of third-party servers contacted—enabling a more precise effectiveness check.

- **Filter List Development:** As a filter list maintainer, you need to see which domains appear during browsing and how network requests behave. uBO Scope's detailed classification of allowed, stealth, and blocked requests guides your list tuning.

## Getting Started Preview

1. **Install the Extension:** Available in Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, and Safari Extensions.
2. **Browse Normally:** uBO Scope works silently in the background, capturing connections per tab.
3. **Check the Toolbar Badge:** Observe the count of third-party domains your browser is connecting to.
4. **Open the Popup Panel:** Click the extension icon to see detailed connection categories and domain-level insights.

Check out the [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/blob/main/guides/getting-started/install-extension.md) guide for step-by-step instructions.

---

## Tips for Success

- Remember, a **lower badge count is better**, indicating fewer third-party connections.
- Use uBO Scope **alongside your favorite content blocker** for enhanced privacy awareness, not as a blocker itself.
- Explore the separation between **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** connections to understand subtle blocker behaviors.
- Be cautious when interpreting block counts from other blockers—they often don't reflect distinct servers contacted.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you see no data or incomplete data, ensure the extension has necessary permissions and the browser supports the `webRequest` API fully.
- Network requests outside the browser's awareness (like those by some sandboxed browsers or OS-level filtering) cannot be detected.
- For assistance, visit the [Support & Bug Reporting page](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope/issues).
