# Who Is uBO Scope For and When Should You Use It?

Understanding the right audience and use cases for uBO Scope is key to unlocking its full potential. Whether you're deeply concerned about privacy, conducting web research, or maintaining filter lists, knowing when and why to use uBO Scope helps you harness its insights efficiently.

## Primary Audiences

### 1. Privacy-Conscious Users

If safeguarding your online privacy matters to you, uBO Scope is your window into transparency. It shows you exactly which third-party servers your browser connects to on each tab, cutting through the noise of blocklists and allowing you to see connections regardless of your content blockers.

- **Why You Should Care:** Many users believe their privacy is protected simply because they use ad blockers or VPNs, but hidden network connections often persist. uBO Scope reveals these connections clearly.
- **What You Gain:** Real-time insights into the network tunnels your browser opens, empowering you with concrete data to refine your privacy tools and decisions.

### 2. Researchers and Analysts

For those studying web tracking, network behaviors, or internet architecture, uBO Scope is an essential investigative aid.

- **Why You Should Care:** Typical web analytics or ad blocker test pages often provide misleading or superficial data. uBO Scope bypasses these limitations by capturing actual network requests and outcomes.
- **What You Gain:** A dependable view of network connections that helps validate hypotheses, identify tracking patterns, and understand web infrastructures.

### 3. Filter List Maintainers

If you build or maintain filter lists for ad blockers or privacy extensions, having a tool like uBO Scope is invaluable, especially on devices lacking robust developer tools.

- **Why You Should Care:** Debugging or validating content blockers requires visibility into which third-party servers are contacted and blocked or allowed.
- **What You Gain:** Actionable data to refine filter lists, verify blocking effectiveness, and troubleshoot blocker behaviors without relying on complicated setup.

## Practical Use Scenarios

### Evaluating Network Privacy

Imagine wanting to ensure that a browser extension or VPN isn’t letting through any unnoticed connections. You load a website and consult uBO Scope's popup panel to instantly see:

- The domains your browser contacted.
- Which connections were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

This direct feedback demystifies what’s happening behind the scenes and helps you adjust your privacy settings or blocker choices accordingly.

### Debunking Ad Blocker Myths

Many believe that the higher the block count shown on an ad blocker’s badge, the better the blocker is. However, this is misleading. uBO Scope shifts the perspective by revealing the number of distinct third-party domains actually reached.

Using uBO Scope, you can:

- Compare blockers by assessing which prevents connections from more unique third-party domains.
- Prove that a high block count doesn’t always mean better privacy, as some blockers might block many trivial requests but still allow tracking from other domains.

### Validating Filter List Effectiveness on Limited Devices

On mobile devices or systems where browser developer tools are limited or absent, verifying filter lists is a challenge. uBO Scope provides an accessible way to:

- View blocked and allowed domains per tab.
- Identify third-party domains that slip through filter lists.
- Iteratively improve your filters with clear data from actual usage.

---

## Why uBO Scope Matters in These Situations

- It bypasses the misleading metrics from standard content blockers’ badges and fake test pages.
- It works uniformly regardless of what content blockers or DNS-based blocking you use.
- It shows results per tab for granular analysis instead of aggregate or global statistics.
- It provides quick, actionable insights within a simple popup without complex setup or external tools.

---

## Getting the Most Out of uBO Scope

- Always interpret the domain lists in context — some third parties (like CDNs) are legitimate and necessary.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your preferred blocker to confirm its effectiveness.
- Combine usage with related documentation on interpreting the badge and popup for better understanding.

  uBO Scope is a transparency tool, not a blocker itself. It shows what happens in your browser network stack so you can make informed privacy decisions.
