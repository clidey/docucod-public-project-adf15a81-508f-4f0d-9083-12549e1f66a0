# Core Concepts and Terminology

Understanding the data presented by uBO Scope's user interface starts with a clear grasp of its essential concepts and terms. This page defines critical terminology—such as third-party remote servers, network request outcomes, badge counts, and the webRequest API—to empower you to confidently interpret what you're seeing and make informed decisions.

---

## Why Core Concepts Matter

When you open uBO Scope’s popup or glance at the toolbar badge, you see data distilled from a complex flow of network activity. Knowing exactly what each term means helps you:

- Understand the nature of the connections your browser attempts or completes.
- Distinguish between requests that were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Use the badge count effectively as a privacy and performance indicator.
- Avoid common misunderstandings about the extension’s reporting.

These definitions anchor your experience, making the transparency provided by uBO Scope truly actionable.

## Third-Party Remote Server

A **third-party remote server** is any server contacted by your browser whose domain differs from the domain of the current top-level webpage you are visiting.

- **Why this matters:**
  The primary privacy and security risks often come from third-party servers, since they may track, deliver ads, or load scripts independently of the site you intentionally visit.

- **Example:**
  On a webpage `https://news.example.com`, a request to `https://cdn.analytics.com` is a third-party connection because the domains (`example.com` vs. `analytics.com`) are distinct.

uBO Scope automatically identifies and groups network requests by their domains, so you can see exactly which third-party servers are contacted.

---

## Network Request Outcomes

uBO Scope categorizes every network request made by your browser into one of three outcomes based on its observed status:

| Outcome       | Description                                                                            | User Impact                                               |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Allowed**   | The request was successfully initiated and received a response.                       | Resources loaded normally from the remote server.         |
| **Blocked**   | The request was prevented from completing, commonly by content blockers.               | The resource was not loaded; potentially fewer trackers.  |
| **Stealth**   | The blocking was applied stealthily, often via stealth techniques used by blockers.   | The request appears hidden to prevent detection or breakage. |

- **How this helps you:**
  By differentiating these outcomes, you gain insight into what your content blockers are doing behind the scenes — not just what they report publicly.

- **Common scenario:**
  When a tracker is stealth-blocked, it remains invisible to the webpage to prevent it from breaking functionality or revealing detection.

---

## Badge Count

The badge count displayed on uBO Scope's toolbar icon indicates the **number of distinct third-party remote domains that have allowed network connections in the current browser tab**.

- **Key points:**
  - Each distinct domain is counted once regardless of how many requests were made to it.
  - A lower badge count suggests fewer unique third-party connections, a potential sign of greater privacy or reduced third-party content.
  - The badge count excludes the primary domain of the visited site.

- **Usage tip:**
  Use this badge as a straightforward measure of third-party exposure on each page you visit. If the count spikes unexpectedly, it can signal increased third-party activity worth investigating.

---

## webRequest API

The **webRequest API** is a browser-provided interface that allows extensions like uBO Scope to observe, analyze, and sometimes modify network requests made by the browser.

- **How uBO Scope uses it:**
  uBO Scope listens to key events from the webRequest API—such as when requests start, get redirected, succeed, or fail—to monitor the real-time outcome of every network request.

- **Benefit to you:**
  This allows uBO Scope to provide unfiltered transparency on what your browser is connecting to, independent of the content blocking methods in place.

- **Limitations:**
  Network requests occurring outside the webRequest API’s visibility cannot be reported by uBO Scope (e.g., certain DNS-level blocks).

---

## Additional Important Terms

### Hostname and Domain

- **Hostname:** The precise address of a server in a URL (e.g., `sub.example.com`).
- **Domain:** The registered domain name derived from the hostname, excluding subdomains (e.g., `example.com`).

uBO Scope aggregates connection data primarily by **domain**, letting you understand interactions at a useful, privacy-relevant granularity.

### Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Hostnames vs. Domains

uBO Scope tracks outcomes separately for both hostnames and domains. This ensures granular tracking (at hostname level) while allowing summary views (at domain level).

---

## Interpreting the UI with Confidence

When you view the uBO Scope popup:

- **Domain lists:** Split into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked sections representing network request outcomes per domain.
- **Counts:** Each domain entry is accompanied by a count indicating the number of requests observed.
- **Summary:** The total shown reflects distinct allowed domains contacted by the tab.

Understanding these core concepts lets you make sense of this data instantly—knowing exactly what 'allowed' or 'stealth' means and how the count relates to your privacy.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Equating high block counts with better blocking:** A higher number of blocked requests does not necessarily mean that fewer third-party servers were contacted. Focus on the badge count of distinct allowed domains.
- **Misinterpreting stealth-blocked requests:** Stealth blocking is a stealthy form of blocking designed to prevent webpage breakage; it’s not a failure or an error.
- **Expecting complete network visibility:** Some network requests may be beyond the reach of the webRequest API and thus not shown.

---

## Practical Tips

- Always start by observing the badge count per tab to get a quick read on third-party interactions.
- Use the popup’s detailed domain lists to identify unexpected third-party servers.
- Remember the distinctions between outcomes to assess the effectiveness of your content blockers.
