# Quick Feature Tour of uBO Scope

Discover how uBO Scope puts transparent, real-time insights into your browser’s network activity right at your fingertips. This guide walks you through the extension’s standout features, highlighting how per-tab domain statistics, detailed traffic classification, seamless multi-browser support, and intuitive badge reporting converge to keep you informed.

---

## Per-Tab Domain Statistics

uBO Scope tracks network connections on a per-browser-tab basis, giving you a granular view of the landscape of third-party servers your current browsing session communicates with.

- **Domain and Hostname Identification**: For each tab, uBO Scope records the primary hostname and its underlying domain, clarifying exactly where network requests originate.
- **Dynamic Aggregation**: As you browse, network requests are categorized and aggregated under these domains for a clear summary.

*Real-World Scenario:* When visiting a webpage, the extension lists not only the main site’s domain but also every distinct third-party server your tab interacts with, providing counts of requests made to each.

## Traffic Breakdown: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth

uBO Scope classifies all observed network connections into three outcome categories, helping you discern which requests succeeded, which were blocked, and which were stealth-blocked (redirected to avoid detection).

- **Allowed Connections**: Network requests that completed successfully, indicating resources fetched from third parties.
- **Blocked Connections**: Requests that were explicitly blocked, often by your content blocker or security settings.
- **Stealth Connections**: Redirected requests which might bypass some blocking mechanisms but still represent traffic worth noting.

Each category is displayed within the popup interface with:

- A dedicated section listing all domains involved.
- Request count badges beside each domain for immediate context.

*Example:* After loading a site, the popup reveals some domains under "not blocked," while others show up under "blocked" or "stealth-blocked," reflecting the varied treatment of third-party connections by your browser and blockers.

## Browser-Agnostic Operation

uBO Scope operates seamlessly across major browsers including Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari.

- Utilizes browser-agnostic APIs and modular background scripts to ensure consistency.
- Supports modern manifest version 3 standards with browser-specific nuances abstracted.

This means you get the same reliable network connection insights regardless of your browser choice.

## Toolbar Badge: Instant Awareness

At a glance, the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge shows a crucial metric:

- **Badge Count**: Reflects the *number of distinct third-party domains* contacted by the active tab.
- **Interpretation**: A lower badge count generally means fewer third-party connections, which can signal enhanced privacy or lower exposure.

This dynamic badge updates automatically as you navigate, giving you immediate awareness without opening the popup.

*Tip:* Use this real-time badge count to quickly compare pages or identify tabs with unusual third-party traffic.

## Visual Interface Insights

Within the popup window, uBO Scope presents an easy-to-read summary:

- **Hostname Display**: Shows the current tab’s hostname prominently, including its subdomain and domain components.
- **Domain Counts**: The summary section displays the total number of distinct domains connected.
- **Categorized Domains**: Domains sorted into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked groups with request counts.

This structure allows users to quickly identify which third parties are active and their connection status.

## Expectation Setting

uBO Scope is designed as a transparency tool rather than a blocker. It aims to inform you about network traffic rather than alter or restrict it directly.

- The extension relies on the browser's `webRequest` API to gather data.
- Some network requests outside this API’s scope might not appear in reports.
- The badge and popup data help you understand your current third-party connection footprint.

## Summary

This quick feature tour highlights how uBO Scope delivers actionable insights with simple yet powerful mechanisms:

- Per-tab tracking for precise domain statistics
- Clear categorization of network request outcomes
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Dynamic badge reflecting distinct third-party domains
- Intuitive popup interface with detailed connection summaries

By focusing on these key features, uBO Scope empowers you to understand and evaluate your browsing network activity with clarity and confidence.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- If badge counts seem inconsistent, ensure your browser supports the `webRequest` API fully.
- Refresh tabs or restart the browser to reset session data if unexpected data appears.
- Use the popup interface to inspect detailed outcomes and verify domain counts.

**Code Example: Rendering Domains in the Popup**

Here is a simplified snippet of how domains are rendered within the popup per category:

```javascript
const allowedSection = document.querySelector('.outcome.allowed .domains');
for (const [domain, count] of allowedSorted) {
  const row = rowTemplate.content.cloneNode(true);
  row.querySelector('.domain').textContent = punycode.toUnicode(domain);
  row.querySelector('.count').textContent = count;
  allowedSection.append(row);
}
```

This approach ensures that users see real-time, readable domain representations, facilitating quick understanding.
