# Core Concepts & Key Terms

Understanding the core concepts and key terms introduced by uBO Scope is crucial to unlocking the full value of this extension. This page will guide you through the fundamental terminology and ideas that underpin how uBO Scope tracks and displays remote server connections initiated by your browser. By mastering these concepts, you'll be better equipped to interpret the data shown in the popup, comprehend the badge count on your toolbar, and use uBO Scope effectively for your privacy or filter list maintenance needs.

## What Are Third-Party Remote Servers?

At the heart of uBO Scope is the monitoring of connections your browser attempts with **remote servers**. A **third-party remote server** is any domain or host that is external to the primary domain of the webpage you are visiting. For example, if you visit `example.com` and your browser connects to `cdn.example-cdn.com`, this counts as a third-party connection because it belongs to a different domain than the site you are on.

### Why Does This Matter?

Third-party connections often involve content like ads, trackers, or external resources (such as fonts or scripts) that can impact privacy, security, or page load times. uBO Scope’s key goal is to reveal these connections so you have an accurate picture of what your browser is talking to behind the scenes.

---

## The Role of WebRequest Listeners

uBO Scope uses the browser's built-in **webRequest** API to listen to network requests initiated by web pages and browser extensions. These listeners capture detailed information about every network request’s lifecycle, including:

- **Redirects**
- **Successes (allowed connections)**
- **Errors or blockages (blocked connections)**

This deep monitoring happens regardless of the content blockers you have enabled because uBO Scope taps into the network pipeline before requests complete. It can report all observed network activity, including those filtered or blocked by your existing content blockers or DNS-based filtering.

---

## Understanding the Badge Count

The uBO Scope toolbar icon badge provides a quick, at-a-glance metric:

- It shows the **count of distinct third-party domains with which your browser successfully connected** on the current active tab.

### What Does This Mean For You?

- A **lower badge count is desirable** because it means fewer unique third-party servers have transmitted data to your browser.
- The badge reflects **distinct domains**, not just the number of network requests.
- It does **not count blocked connections** but focuses on actual allowed connections.

This count directly aligns with your privacy exposure, making it a valuable tool to measure the real-world effectiveness of content blocking.

## Key Terms Used in uBO Scope Data

When viewing uBO Scope's popup or analyzing data, you'll encounter these common terms:

| Term      | Description                                                                                                                     |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Allowed   | Connections that were successfully made to third-party domains and were not blocked.                                           |
| Stealth   | Connections that were redirected or stealthily blocked, typically representing advanced filtering or indirect blocking methods. |
| Blocked   | Connections that were explicitly blocked by content blockers or network errors prevented the connection from completing.       |
| Domain    | The registered domain name derived from a hostname, typically representing the main site (e.g., `example.com`).                 |
| Hostname  | The full hostname of a server, possibly including subdomains (e.g., `ads.example.com`).                                          |

## How uBO Scope Determines Domains from URLs

uBO Scope leverages the **Public Suffix List (PSL)** to reliably determine the registered domain for any hostname. The PSL is a widely used, community-maintained list that identifies domain name suffixes under which Internet users can directly register names.

For example, given a hostname like `subdomain.example.co.uk`, uBO Scope:

1. Uses the PSL to recognize `.co.uk` as the public suffix.
2. Identifies `example.co.uk` as the registered domain.
3. Uses this domain to group network requests at the domain level.

This approach avoids grouping by superficial segments and reflects true independently operated domains.

---

## Summary of Data Tracking Workflow

1. When a tab loads a webpage, the extension resets its internal connection data for that tab.
2. As network requests occur, uBO Scope listens via **webRequest listeners** capturing their outcome.
3. Requests are classified as `allowed`, `blocked`, or `stealth-blocked`.
4. Hostnames and domains are extracted using the Public Suffix List.
5. The count of distinct allowed domains updates the badge on the extension icon.
6. The popup interface shows detailed categorized lists for the current tab.

---

## Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- **Interpreting Badge Counts:** Remember that a high badge count means more third-party connections; not necessarily more blocked requests.
- **Blocking vs Blocking Effectiveness:** Stealth or error connections may still indicate partial blocking. Use the categorized counts to get full insights.
- **Unicode Domains:** uBO Scope converts internationalized domain names (IDNs) correctly using punycode to avoid misgrouping.
- **Session Persistence:** Data tracked is stored per browser session, meaning reloading a tab or closing a tab resets tracked stats.
