# Why Use uBO Scope?

## Unlocking True Visibility into Webpage Network Activity

In today’s complex web ecosystem, webpages communicate with numerous remote servers—some benign, others intrusive. uBO Scope provides an accurate, real-time window into this communication, empowering you to see exactly which remote servers a webpage contacts.

### What You Gain with uBO Scope

- **Trustworthy Insight**: Focus on distinct remote servers actually contacted, not misleading aggregated block counts.
- **Real-Time Transparency**: Monitor live network activity initiated by every webpage you visit.
- **Empowered Decision-Making**: Understand connection patterns to safeguard your privacy or improve filter lists.
- **Unbiased Reporting**: Look beyond flawed 'ad blocker test' pages to see real-world network requests.
- **Complementary to Content Blockers**: Measure network requests irrespective of any content blocking in place.

### Who Benefits Most?

This page is designed for browser users who want transparency, privacy advocates seeking clarity, and filter list maintainers who need precise measurement of network interactions.

## What Is uBO Scope’s Core Value?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension that tracks and reports all remote servers that webpages contact during browsing sessions. Unlike simple block counts that may misrepresent real activity, uBO Scope identifies each unique server connection regardless of whether network requests were allowed, stealth-blocked, or entirely blocked.

The extension solves the challenge of discerning actual network exposure caused by third-party connections — a key concern for privacy-conscious users and maintainers of blocking lists.

Unlike unreliable 'ad blocker test' pages that generate unrealistic requests, uBO Scope delivers meaningful visibility into connections happening in the real browsing environment.

### Why This Matters

- **Accurate Context**: Knowing the specific servers contacted clarifies your exposure and risk.
- **Avoid Misleading Indicators**: Block counts can be inflated or misleading; the connection count to distinct servers reflects true network activity.
- **Bypass Test Page Fallacies**: Websites designed to test blockers often use fabricated scenarios that don't reflect real web behavior.

## How This Insight Helps Different Users

### Browser Users

Monitor and understand which third-party domains a visited webpage reaches out to, allowing you to recognize potentially unwanted trackers or unnecessary connections.

### Privacy Advocates

Gain clear evidence of network interactions beyond surface-level block metrics, empowering you to advocate for better privacy standards based on actual data.

### Filter List Maintainers

Evaluate how well your filters reduce network connections without relying on contrived tests or questionable block counts. Use this data to hone rules targeting unique domains genuinely seen in browsing activity.

## The Problem with Common Metrics

Many content blockers show a badge with blocked request counts, tempting users to assume a higher number means better blocking. However, these counts can mislead:

- A high block count may coincide with more network requests allowed, as some unique servers remain unblocked.
- Conversely, a low block count with fewer unique third-party connections often means better privacy protection.

Furthermore, 'ad blocker test' pages create artificial test cases that don’t match real-world browsing, thus inflating or distorting perceived blocker effectiveness.

uBO Scope shifts the focus to what actually matters — tracking unique remote servers contacted by your browser on real pages.

## Practical Example: Real-World Impact

Imagine visiting a popular news website:

- Traditional blockers might show a high block badge count but fail to reveal that dozens of other third-party servers still received requests.
- uBO Scope instead counts distinct remote servers the site attempted to contact, revealing the true network footprint.

This empowers you to make informed privacy decisions, such as adjusting filters or choosing alternative solutions.

## Tips for Using uBO Scope Effectively

- **Focus on Unique Domains**: Pay attention to the number of distinct remote servers instead of raw block counts.
- **Use Alongside Other Tools**: Combine uBO Scope with content blockers to validate blocking effectiveness.
- **Ignore Ad Blocker Test Pages**: Do not rely on synthetic test sites; prefer real browsing insights.
- **Consider Stealth Blocking**: uBO Scope distinguishes between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections for deeper understanding.

## Summary

uBO Scope is essential for achieving accurate, reliable visibility into real webpage network activity. It exposes the true breadth of remote server connections, debunking myths from misleading block counts and unreliable test pages. Whether you are a privacy advocate, a casual user, or a filter list maintainer, this clarity helps you make smarter, data-driven choices.
