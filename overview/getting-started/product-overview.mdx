# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Your Browser Makes — Transparently

uBO Scope is a simple yet powerful browser extension designed to shed light on every network connection made by webpages you visit. Unlike traditional content blockers that only show what they block, uBO Scope reveals all attempted outgoing connections — whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked — giving you a clear, honest view of how your browser interacts with third-party servers.

### Why This Matters to You
Webpages today often load content from multiple remote servers, many operated by services you may not know or trust. With uBO Scope, you gain transparent insight into exactly which domains are contacted behind the scenes. This empowers you to:

- **Understand your real privacy exposure** beyond just the count of blocked requests.
- **Validate content blockers' effectiveness** by seeing what passes through, not just what is blocked.
- **Detect stealthy network requests** that might silently bypass blocking.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?
This extension is invaluable for users passionate about privacy, developers and security researchers assessing network activity, and filter list maintainers who want a clearer picture of real-world connections beyond test or synthetic environments.

## How uBO Scope Reveals Network Connections

uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network requests initiated by webpages in real-time. It listens for these requests and records their outcomes categorized into three distinct groups:

- **Allowed:** Requests that successfully connected to remote servers.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests that were silently redirected or blocked in ways designed to avoid detection.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked by content blockers or network errors.

By aggregating these results by domain and hostname, uBO Scope helps you see at a glance which remote servers your current tab has interacted with.

### Real-World Example
Imagine visiting a news website. uBO Scope will show:

- The main domain hosting the site (allowed).
- A few content delivery networks (CDNs) providing images or scripts (allowed).
- Third-party trackers or ad servers blocked by your content blocker (blocked).
- Any connections quietly redirected or stealth-blocked that would otherwise go unnoticed.

This breakdown helps you make an informed judgment about your exposure and blocker performance.

## Understanding the Badge Count

The numeric badge on the uBO Scope toolbar icon displays the number of distinct allowed third-party domains contacted by the active tab. A lower number means fewer third-party connections, which generally indicates better privacy.

> **Important:** This count reflects _allowed_ connections, not blocked ones. A high block count doesn’t imply better blocking, but often more connections upstream. uBO Scope challenges common misconceptions by making distinctions clear.

## Key Benefits at a Glance

- **Complete visibility:** See every remote server connection attempt, not just blocked ones.
- **Cross-blocker compatibility:** Works alongside any content blocker, regardless of method.
- **Truthful insights:** Avoid misleading benchmarks based on block counts alone.
- **Privacy awareness:** Make informed decisions about your web browsing exposure.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<u>Common scenarios and advice to get the most from uBO Scope:</u>

- If the badge shows zero connection when visiting active sites, verify your browser supports the necessary `webRequest` permissions.
- Remember that some network requests made outside browser control (e.g., system-level DNS or VPNs) will not be tracked.
- A large number of allowed third-party connections typically indicate many external resources; consider tightening your content blocking.
- Use the data displayed to cross-check with your content blocker’s settings and tune your filters.

<u>Tip:</u> Use uBO Scope together with established privacy tools to validate and complement your web security setup.
