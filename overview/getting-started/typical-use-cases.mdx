## Primary Audiences

### Privacy Advocates and Security-Conscious Users

If you value your online privacy and want to know exactly which third-party servers your browser connects to, uBO Scope is your indispensable ally. It shows all connection attempts, whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked, providing transparency beyond what most content blockers expose.

**Why You’ll Care:**
- Confirm that your content blocker is minimizing third-party connections effectively.
- Detect unexpected or potentially tracking servers by reviewing connection outcomes.
- Gain peace of mind with objective, browser-level evidence of network requests.

**Example Scenario:**
You visit a news website and wonder if trackers or ad servers are loading resources silently. Opening uBO Scope’s popup reveals the domains contacted, highlighting which connections were blocked or stealth-blocked by your content blocker and which were allowed.

---

### Filter List Maintainers and Developers

Crafting and refining content blocking filter lists demands a precise understanding of how network requests behave in real browsing scenarios. uBO Scope serves as a diagnostic tool revealing the real-time outcomes of network requests at the tab level.

**Why You’ll Care:**
- Analyze which third-party domains are commonly contacted and how your filters affect these connections.
- Distinguish allowed connections from stealth-blocked to optimize filter accuracy.
- Verify the impact of filter updates by observing changes in the badge count and detailed domain lists.

**Example Scenario:**
After releasing a new filter update, a list maintainer uses uBO Scope across various test websites to verify that unwanted domains are correctly blocked or stealthed without impacting essential resources.

### Power Users and Developers

Users with deeper technical knowledge and an interest in browser behavior will find uBO Scope invaluable to understand the network footprint of a website.

**Why You’ll Care:**
- Inspect the domains your browser reaches during page load and interaction.
- Validate debugging efforts related to network requests, redirects, and blocking rules.
- Use domain and hostname data to troubleshoot unexpected behavior or performance bottlenecks.

**Example Scenario:**
A developer working on privacy features wants a clear report of network connections per tab to troubleshoot issues in integration with other privacy extensions or to audit third-party analytics.

---

### Curious Users Seeking Greater Visibility

Even if you’re not a privacy expert or developer, curiosity about what happens behind the scenes when you browse can guide better-informed decisions about your web habits.

**Why You’ll Care:**
- Learn which domains your favorite websites contact.
- Understand that a lower badge count corresponds to fewer distinct third-party servers.
- Debunk misconceptions about blockers just by comparing allowed and blocked connections directly.

**Example Scenario:**
You notice different extensions show different block counts and want to know which third-party connections truly occur. uBO Scope's transparent report helps you avoid misleading conclusions based on superficial test sites or advertising metrics.

---

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Verifying Content Blockers:** Assess how effectively your content blocker minimizes third-party connections.
- **Filter List Improvement:** Fine-tune blocking lists by analyzing stealth vs. blocked connections in real user sessions.
- **Technical Audits:** Developers and security teams audit network connections during web app testing.
- **Educational Insight:** Users gain a clearer understanding of browser network activity for safer browsing decisions.

## Before and After: The uBO Scope Advantage

| Without uBO Scope                    | With uBO Scope                                         |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Rely on browser extension stats that report block counts without context. | Access clear, domain-based insights showing allowed, stealth, and blocked connections per tab.
| Confused by misleading "ad blocker test" webpages.                    | Bypass fake testing scenarios and see authentic network connection results.
| Blind to stealth-blocked connections that don’t trigger standard block notifications. | Understand stealth blocking and its effect in concealing some requests from sites.
| Uncertainty about the actual number of third-party domains accessed.   | Directly observe and count distinct remote server domains connected during browsing.
