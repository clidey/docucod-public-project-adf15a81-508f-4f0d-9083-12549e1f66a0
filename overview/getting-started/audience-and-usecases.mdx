# Who is uBO Scope For?

Understanding the right audience for uBO Scope ensures you unlock its full potential. This extension is crafted for users who demand transparency, accuracy, and insight into the often opaque world of web network requests. Whether you're a privacy advocate, a filter list maintainer, or simply an inquisitive user keen to understand the fate of network requests, uBO Scope offers clear, actionable data tailored to your needs.

## Target Audience

### 1. Privacy-Conscious Users

If you carefully manage your online footprint and want vigilance over which third-party servers your browser connects to, uBO Scope is indispensable. Unlike traditional content blockers that only indicate what was blocked, uBO Scope reveals **all** remote servers contacted by webpages — including those stealthily allowed or blocked. This level of granularity empowers you to:

- Validate the effectiveness of your content blockers
- Identify unexpected or unknown remote connections
- Gain confidence that your browsing remains as private as possible

### 2. Filter List Maintainers

Creating and maintaining filter lists that govern content blocking requires precise and comprehensive data on network requests. uBO Scope serves as a reliable observer, tracking successful, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections across all network protocols visible through the browser's `webRequest` API. It helps filter maintainers:

- Detect third-party servers that bypass current filters
- Monitor the real-world impact of newly introduced rules
- Assess the stealth mechanisms used by trackers or ads to evade blocking

### 3. Developers and Network Analysts

Developers or analysts investigating network activity of web pages need a clear, categorized summary of connection outcomes. uBO Scope provides this in real-time, visually organized to separate allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains, making troubleshooting and performance assessments straightforward.

### 4. Users Debunking Myths Around Content Blocking

Many misconceptions prevail about content blockers — such as assuming higher block counts mean better effectiveness, or trusting synthetic "ad-blocker test" websites. uBO Scope equips users with evidence-based insights to dispel these myths by:

- Showing that block counts alone don’t correlate with fewer remote connections
- Demonstrating that real-world connections differ drastically from artificial tests
- Providing transparency into stealth blocking which typical metrics ignore

## Real-World Use Scenarios

### Validating Blocker Effectiveness
Imagine you use multiple blockers and want a clear view of which third-party network connections actually occur. uBO Scope’s domain-centric summaries reveal exactly which remote servers your browser talks to, regardless of blocker employed. This direct insight helps you:

- Compare blockers based on unique third-party connection counts
- Identify false negatives where trackers slip through unnoticed
- Confirm that stealth-blocked domains never connect visibly

### Supporting Filter List Maintenance
For maintainer Jane, uBO Scope is a window into user experiences. By sharing observed connection data with the community, Jane refines her filters to intercept emerging third-party servers and combat evasive blocking techniques. She relies on uBO Scope to:

- Track new domains to target
- Validate that blocked domains no longer appear in the allowed lists
- Understand stealth blocking patterns used by questionable resources

### Debunking Popular Misconceptions
For Alex, a curious user, seeing a high block count in another extension raised the wrong impression that it is the most effective. Using uBO Scope, Alex sees the actual number of distinct third-party connections, realizing a high block count can coincide with more connections overall. This knowledge helps Alex make informed, privacy-focused choices.
