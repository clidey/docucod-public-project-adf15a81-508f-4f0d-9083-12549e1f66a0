# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlocking Web Transparency: Your Window into All Network Connections

uBO Scope is a powerful yet lightweight browser extension designed to reveal all network connections a webpage attempts or successfully establishes with remote servers. Unlike traditional ad blockers that focus primarily on blocking ads and trackers, uBO Scope shines a spotlight on every third-party domain a website interacts with, whether blocked, allowed, or stealthy. This unique visibility empowers users, privacy advocates, and filter list maintainers to understand the true scope of web activity and external communications a site is involved in.

### Why This Matters to You

When you visit a website, dozens or even hundreds of requests may be sent behind the scenes—to analytics providers, CDNs, social media platforms, ads, or other third parties. Many of these connections are often invisible to typical users or buried deep in browser developer tools. uBO Scope surfaces this data clearly, revealing exactly which domains your browser is talking to and how those requests fare:

- **See which remote servers are contacted**—including every third party, not just known ad trackers
- **Understand request outcomes**—which requests succeeded, were blocked, or handled stealthily
- **Gain insight beyond content blockers**—as it works independently of what is blocked or allowed

### Key Benefits at a Glance

- **Complete network transparency:** Track *all* network connections initiated by webpages in real time.
- **Accurate remote server count:** Toolbar icon badge shows the distinct number of third-party domains connected to.
- **Non-intrusive monitoring:** Reports on network requests without interfering with other content blockers.
- **Ideal for privacy enthusiasts and researchers:** Deep insight into web traffic beyond standard ad blocking.
- **Valuable for filter list maintainers:** Helps maintain and improve blocklists by revealing actual network interactions.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

This extension is designed for users who want to dig deeper than just blocking unwanted content:

- Privacy-conscious users wanting to understand the external domains their browser communicates with.
- Filter list maintainers who need accurate data on third-party connections to refine blocklists.
- Researchers and developers interested in web transparency and network behaviors of websites.
- Those skeptical of simplistic ad blocker metrics who want a clearer picture of third-party exposure.

## How uBO Scope Works: A High-Level View

uBO Scope relies on browser `webRequest` APIs to monitor network requests initiated in your browser. It listens to the full lifecycle of network requests—before redirect, on response, and in case of errors—to record outcomes:

- **Allowed requests:** Connections that successfully fetched resources.
- **Blocked requests:** Connections that failed or were blocked (including by other blockers or DNS).
- **Stealth blocked requests:** Redirects or subtle blocks that may not be obvious.

All observed requests are grouped and counted by their domains and hostnames, with special handling of the current tab's main domain to distinguish first-party from third-party connections. The extension keeps this data updated live and shows a badge count indicating the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected.

### Real-World Example

Consider loading a news website. Without uBO Scope, you might see the page content only, unaware of hidden connections:

- Requests to the site's CDN for images.
- Calls to analytics servers.
- Calls to advertising networks (some blocked by your content blocker).
- Calls to social media widgets.

With uBO Scope, you immediately see a categorized list in the popup interface showing each third-party domain contacted, how many times, and the connection status—helping you make informed decisions about your privacy and blocking rules.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Interpret the badge count as distinct third-party domains connected to during your current tab session.** Lower counts typically indicate fewer external connections, which can be better for privacy.

- **Not all third parties are bad.** Many sites use legitimate CDNs or essential services that require connections; understanding this helps prevent unnecessary blocking.

- **uBO Scope works alongside your existing content blockers.** It listens passively; it does not block requests itself.

- **Use uBO Scope to validate your filter lists.** The extension helps verify if your blocking rules effectively reduce third-party connections.

- **Refresh or open the popup after page load** to get the most accurate current view of network connections.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **Network requests outside the `webRequest` API scope are not monitored.** Some browser features or protocols may bypass this API, so uBO Scope cannot see those.

- **Background tabs may not report data immediately.** Activity is recorded per tab, and only active tabs will update the popup view promptly.

- **Badge count only reflects distinct domains, not total number of requests.** This helps declutter but may differ from raw request counts.

- **Requests blocked at network or DNS level outside the browser may not be detected.** uBO Scope relies on browser reporting.
