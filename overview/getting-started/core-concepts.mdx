# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding uBO Scope’s reports requires familiarity with several key terms that describe the state and outcome of network requests your browser makes. This page lays the groundwork for interpreting the connection data you see in the toolbar badge, popup panel, and detailed reports by defining pivotal terms aligned with uBO Scope’s measurement model.

---

## What These Terms Mean

### Allowed
A domain or hostname marked as **allowed** means your browser successfully established a network connection to it and fetched resources without being blocked or interfered with by any content blocker.

- This represents third-party remote servers that your browser accessed as permitted by the active content blockers.
- The badge count on the toolbar reflects the number of **distinct allowed third-party domains** currently observed.

**Example:** When visiting a news website, if resources like images or scripts load from a CDN domain (e.g., `cdn.example.com`) successfully, that CDN domain counts as allowed.

### Stealth
The **stealth** designation identifies domains or hostnames that were subject to blocking by content blockers but in a way that is stealthy—meaning the blocking is done to avoid detection or prevent webpage breakage.

- Requests might be canceled or redirected internally without the webpage being explicitly aware of the block.
- This prevents some anti-adblock scripts on websites from detecting the blocking activity.

**Example:** A tracking script’s request might be intercepted and canceled subtly so the website cannot detect it was blocked, placing its domain in the stealth category.

### Blocked
The **blocked** status is assigned to network requests which were clearly blocked and failed to connect to the remote server.

- This represents third-party servers that the content blocker actively prevented from loading.
- Unlike stealth, these blocked requests can sometimes be detected by the webpage or result in visible missing content.

**Example:** An advertisement server domain that your content blocker denies outright will be recorded as blocked.

### Third-Party Remote Servers
Third-party remote servers refer to any external domains other than the website you are currently visiting that your browser attempts to connect to.

- These domains serve resources like scripts, images, analytics, advertisements, or CDNs.
- The core purpose of uBO Scope is to measure and report connections to such third-party servers, not first-party domains (the site you directly requested).

**Important:** Not all third-party servers are inherently malicious or intrusive. Many websites rely on well-known third-party CDNs or analytics providers that are legitimate and necessary.

## Why This Terminology Matters

uBO Scope’s value lies in its ability to give you transparent insight into who your browser talks to when loading a webpage. However, the numbers and lists shown will only make sense if you understand the meaning behind “allowed,” “stealth,” and “blocked.”

- A **lower number of allowed third-party domains** generally indicates a cleaner browsing session with fewer remote connections.
- **Stealth blocking** signals that a content blocker is operating subtly to avoid detection, an advanced method that improves your privacy without breaking site functionality.
- Seeing domains listed as **blocked** tells you which connections your content blocker actively stopped.

This standardized vocabulary enables you to analyze reports critically, distinguish between outright blocks and stealth blocks, and assess the privacy and security implications accurately.

## How These Terms Are Measured

uBO Scope listens to browser network events using the `webRequest` API to classify network request outcomes:

- **Allowed**: Requests that successfully receive a response.
- **Stealth**: Requests that trigger redirects or cancellations categorized as stealth-blocking.
- **Blocked**: Requests that result in errors or fail to connect.

These classifications drive the data displayed and summarized on the popup panel and badge.

## Tips for Interpreting Reports

- Do not be alarmed if popular, trusted CDNs or analytics services appear as allowed third-party domains; these are typical and support website performance and functionality.
- Consider stealth-blocked domains as an indicator of privacy protection actively at work behind the scenes.
- Remember the badge number counts distinct allowed third-party domains, not the total blocked requests.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Misreading the badge count:** A higher badge count means more allowed third-party domains, indicating less strict blocking, which may be counterintuitive.
- **Ignoring stealth-blocked domains:** These represent significant privacy protection but might be overlooked if you expect only blocked domains to count.
- **Assuming all third-party domains are harmful:** Legitimate services (e.g., CDNs) often appear — understanding what is allowed vs blocked helps separate good from bad.

## Troubleshooting terminology confusion

If you see unexpected behavior:

- Verify you understand the difference between "stealth" (hidden blocking) and outright "blocked".
- Remember the badge does not count blocked connections, only allowed third-party domains.
- Review the [Debunking Common Myths in Content Blocking](../../guides/advanced-usage-and-best-practices/debunking-common-myths) guide for deeper insight.
