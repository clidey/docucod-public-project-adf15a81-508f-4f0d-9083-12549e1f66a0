# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

## Understand Your Web Traffic Like Never Before

When you visit any website, countless network requests are sent — many to third-party servers you never directly interact with. uBO Scope reveals these connections transparently, helping you understand which remote servers your browser is communicating with and what is being blocked or allowed.

### Who Benefits From uBO Scope?

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** If you care deeply about your online privacy, uBO Scope exposes every remote connection your browser attempts. It empowers you to see the real network activity behind webpages beyond what traditional content blockers show.

- **Filter List Maintainers:** Maintaining and improving lists for content blockers requires detailed knowledge of network request patterns and outcomes. uBO Scope provides a clear, real-time picture of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains that helps maintainers verify filter effectiveness even on constrained devices.

- **Curious Web Users and Researchers:** Whether you wish to understand if your ad blocker is effectively working or want to debunk common ad blocker myths, uBO Scope offers the transparency and data to answer these questions objectively.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Verifying Content Blocker Effectiveness

uBO Scope counts distinct third-party domains your browser connects to, not just the number of blocked requests. Seeing a smaller number of allowed remote servers confirms that your content blocker is actually reducing third-party tracking and unwanted content, not just counting blocks.

> **Example:** You suspect an ad blocker is underperforming because it shows fewer blocked items. Using uBO Scope, you discover it actually allows connections to more third-party domains compared to other blockers, revealing the illusion behind raw block counts.

### 2. Debunking Ad Blocker Myths

Popular ad blocker test pages often mislead users by making artificial network requests. uBO Scope helps expose why those tests don't reflect real browsing scenarios, highlighting the nuances of stealth blocking and real-world network interference.

### 3. Analyzing Real-Time Network Activity

By showing connections classified as **Allowed**, **Blocked**, or **Stealth-Blocked**, uBO Scope lets you observe how your browser interacts with servers in real-time. This empowers you to:

- Detect unwanted trackers and ads.
- Confirm legitimate CDN usage.
- Understand the impact of DNS-based or extension-based content blockers.

## How Users Typically Engage With uBO Scope

<u>Imagine you're opening your favorite news website.</u> Behind every article, several third-party content providers might be sending requests – some for ads, analytics, or social media widgets.

1. You open uBO Scope's popup.
2. It instantly lists all remote domains your browser connected to for that page, clearly separated into those allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
3. You notice several unexpected trackers still allowed, prompting you to update your content blocker’s filter list or policies.

This flow demonstrates how uBO Scope seamlessly fortifies your understanding and control over web connections.

## Practical Tips for Maximizing uBO Scope Benefits

- **Check the Toolbar Badge:** The badge number reflects distinct third-party domains connected. A smaller number signals fewer connections and potentially less tracking.

- **Use During Troubleshooting:** When websites behave oddly, inspect network connection outcomes to see if any essential services are inadvertently blocked.

- **Leverage for Filter List Maintenance:** Use uBO Scope on different sites and devices to confirm how filters behave outside developer tools.

- **Understand Stealth Blocking:** Some connections are stealth-blocked (hidden from the page but still attempted). Learning this behavior clarifies why some requests evade typical detection.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Don't Rely on Block Counts Alone:** High block counts don’t always mean better blocking. Count distinct allowed domains instead.

- **Avoid Ad Blocker Test Websites:** These create unnatural requests to trick or detect blockers and do not represent actual browsing.

- **Be Aware of Browser API Limitations:** uBO Scope relies on your browser’s `webRequest` API. Requests outside this scope (such as certain DNS or VPN-based blocks) may not be reported.

---

## Summary

uBO Scope is designed for users demanding transparency and precision in understanding their web connections. By reliably revealing which remote servers are contacted and the outcome of those requests, it serves privacy advocates, developers, filter maintainers, and anyone curious about the true nature of their browsing data.

## Code Snippet Example: Viewing Connection Outcomes

The extension classifies connections into three outcomes:

```js
// Each connection is categorized as follows:
const outcomes = {
  allowed: new Map(),      // Connections that succeeded
  stealth: new Map(),      // Connections stealth-blocked (redirected or hidden from pages)
  blocked: new Map()       // Connections blocked outright
};

// In the popup UI, these are displayed separately, allowing quick understanding of which domains were contacted and how.
```

This direct insight helps you identify which third-party servers remain active during your browsing session.
