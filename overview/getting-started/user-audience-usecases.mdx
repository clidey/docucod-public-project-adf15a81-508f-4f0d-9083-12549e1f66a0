# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Understanding the right audience for uBO Scope is key to unlocking its full potential. This page explains *who* benefits the most from using uBO Scope and *why* it is a valuable tool tailored to their specific needs.

---

## Purpose and Value

uBO Scope is designed **not just as an ad blocker companion but as a powerful audit and measurement tool** for network requests initiated by webpages. It delivers visibility into how third-party connections behave in the presence of content blockers, revealing subtle nuances beyond simple block counts.

---

## Primary User Audiences

### 1. Privacy-Conscious Users

If you care deeply about minimizing your digital footprint and understanding who’s connecting to your browser, uBO Scope is made for you. It:

- Shows **all distinct third-party domains** contacted by webpages, letting you verify what is allowed, blocked, or stealthily filtered.
- **Counters common misconceptions** like “more blocks equals better privacy,” by highlighting actual unblocked third-party connections.
- Helps you **audit your privacy tools** to ensure they perform as expected in the real world, not just in synthetic tests.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers and Content Blockers Developers

Beyond end users, uBO Scope serves as a **specialized instrument for filter list developers and maintainers**. It:

- Enables **precise auditing of third-party network requests**, crucial for refining blocking rules and spotting evasive tracking.
- Provides **data on stealth blocking behaviors**, helping maintainers understand how blockers act behind the scenes.
- Supplies reliable data on network outcomes **regardless of the underlying blocking mechanism**, even those outside browser extension control (e.g., DNS filters).

This is especially valuable when typical browser devtools are insufficient or unavailable.

### 3. Researchers and Technically Curious Users

uBO Scope is a tool for anyone interested in debunking myths and deep-diving into network privacy around content blockers. If you’ve ever wondered whether an ad blocker truly blocks more or less than another,

- uBO Scope **dispels misleading indicators like block counts on badges**, focusing instead on real third-party connections.
- It warns against unreliable benchmarks such as “ad blocker test” webpages that do not mimic real-world scenarios.
- It offers **transparent visibility into network behavior**, supporting informed discussions and research.

---

## Common Use Cases

- **Auditing active tab’s connections** to see all networks a site attempts to contact, separated by allowed, stealth-blocked, and fully blocked.
- **Comparing multiple content blockers** by monitoring actual third-party connections instead of simply counting blocked URLs.
- **Validating stealth blocking techniques** to ensure trackers are truly filtered without breaking webpages.
- **Supporting list maintenance workflows** by tracing domains that evade blocklists or generate unexpected connections.

---

## Why You Should Care

Most content blockers provide a block count badge — a number that can be **misleading and disconnected from real privacy outcomes**. uBO Scope shifts attention toward the **distinct third-party remote servers actually accessed or prevented**.

This insight empowers you to:

- Take control over your privacy strategy with **transparent, fact-based data**.
- Avoid fallacies based on superficial statistics or synthetic test sites.
- Contribute to community efforts by providing filter list maintainers with **detailed, reality-grounded connection data**.

---

## Practical Tips for Users

- Use uBO Scope's toolbar badge as a **meaningful signal: a lower count means fewer third-party connections**, suggesting stronger privacy.
- When you see domains listed under **stealth-blocked**, understand these are connections blocked quietly without breaking site functionality.
- Consider uBO Scope when you want **a trusted, independent measurement tool** that fact-checks content blocker claims.
- If you maintain or develop filter lists, regularly consult uBO Scope outputs to **discover and analyze unexpected third-party connections**.

## Troubleshooting Common Misunderstandings

<AccordionGroup title="Clarifying Common Misconceptions About uBO Scope">
<Accordion title="Why Doesn’t a Higher Block Count Mean Better Privacy?">
While a high block count indicates many resources *were* blocked, it doesn't reveal how many distinct third-party connections were actually prevented. A content blocker might block many subresources but still allow numerous connections from other domains, resulting in more exposure.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are ‘Ad Blocker Test’ Sites Reliable Benchmarks?">
No. These sites generate artificial network requests that rarely reflect real-world behavior, and do not detect stealth blocking, leading to misleading results.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope Depend on the Content Blocker in Use?">
No. uBO Scope captures **all network requests reported by the browser's webRequest API**, no matter which content blocker is enabled or what blocking technique is used.
</Accordion>
