# Core Concepts and Terminology

Understanding the fundamental terms used by uBO Scope is essential to interpret the detailed network connection insights this tool provides. This page explains the key concepts—such as third-party remote servers, request outcomes, and how uBO Scope categorizes these requests—to empower you with a clear lens on your browser's web traffic.

## What You Need to Know

### Third-Party Remote Server
A **third-party remote server** refers to any external server a webpage attempts to connect with that is not part of the webpage’s own domain or its immediate subdomains. These servers commonly include content delivery networks (CDNs), ad networks, analytics services, and other external resources.

Monitoring third-party connections helps you identify which external entities your browser communicates with when visiting a website—crucial information for privacy-conscious users.

### webRequest API
The **webRequest API** is a browser interface that uBO Scope uses to listen to and report all network requests initiated by web pages. Regardless of whether those requests are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked, uBO Scope receives detailed information about their status.

Because of this API, uBO Scope can transparently reveal the fate of every network connection attempt your browser makes.

### Request Outcomes: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth
uBO Scope categorizes network requests into three distinct outcomes:

- **Allowed Requests**: These are network connections to third-party servers that were permitted by your browser or content blockers. Such requests result in resources loading successfully from external servers.

- **Blocked Requests**: These occur when a network connection to a third-party server is explicitly blocked, either by a content-blocking extension, your browser, or other blocking mechanisms. The resource does not load.

- **Stealth-Blocked Requests**: These are connections that content blockers hide or mask to prevent detection by web pages but still cause the resource loading to be inhibited effectively. The term "stealth" reflects that these blocks are not plainly visible to scripts running on webpages, thus preventing anti-blocking measures.

### Domain and Hostname Definitions
- **Hostname**: The exact part of the URL that identifies the server, e.g., `cdn.example.com`.
- **Domain**: The registered domain name extracted from a hostname by stripping subdomains and using the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/). For example, from `cdn.example.com`, the domain is `example.com`.

uBO Scope uses these definitions to aggregate and report connection data at both the hostname and broader domain level, offering clarity on where your browser connects.

## How uBO Scope Uses These Concepts

When you browse a website, your browser initiates multiple network requests to remote servers to fetch everything from images and scripts to API data. uBO Scope listens in on the browser's network activities via the **webRequest API** and records details such as:

- Which third-party servers the browser tries to contact
- Whether those connections are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked
- Counts of requests per domain and hostname

This categorization creates a clear picture of your browsing footprint – including attempts to connect with known trackers, ad servers, or legitimate service providers.

The **toolbar badge** shows the count of distinct allowed third-party domains for each active tab, quickly signaling the number of unique external services your browser contacted.

---

## Practical Example: Interpreting Connection Status
Imagine visiting a news website:

- uBO Scope reports connections to the site’s own domain under **Allowed**.
- It also logs connections to an ad network domain that your content blocker **Blocked**.
- If it detects behind-the-scenes tricks to hide blockers, such as a connection suppressed quietly without outright blocking notifications, this gets logged as **Stealth**.

This level of insight helps you understand exactly which third parties are truly engaged during your browsing sessions and which are effectively blocked.

## Tips for Users

- **Focus on Third-Party Domains**: A high number of allowed third-party domains might indicate broad exposure to external entities. Use this insight to fine-tune your privacy settings or filter lists.
- **Understand Stealth Blocking**: Stealth blocked connections mean your content blocker is working quietly to prevent detection by websites. This is normal and desirable for avoiding anti-blocking techniques.
- **Not All Third Parties Are Bad**: Some third-party connections serve legitimate purposes (e.g., CDN services). A low count of distinct third-party domains typically means fewer external trackers or ads.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions About Core Concepts">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count only reflect allowed third-party domains?">
The badge count indicates the number of distinct third-party domains from which your browser successfully loaded resources. This metric shows your actual exposure after filters are applied, rather than raw counts of requests or blocked attempts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What exactly is a stealth-blocked request?">
Stealth blocking refers to subtle forms of blocking that avoid making the block obvious to the webpage’s scripts, effectively hiding the block and preventing anti-blocking detection methods.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does uBO Scope determine domain boundaries?">
uBO Scope relies on the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to accurately parse domains from hostnames, ensuring correct aggregation of requests by domain.
