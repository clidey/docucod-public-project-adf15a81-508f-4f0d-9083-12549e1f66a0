# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Your Browser Makes — Transparently and Accurately

uBO Scope is a specialized browser extension designed to reveal *all* network connections your browser attempts or completes when loading webpages. Its mission is simple yet powerful: provide full visibility into third-party connections, empowering you to understand exactly which remote servers your browsing activity touches.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You

When you browse the web, your browser interacts with numerous servers — some necessary, some less so, and some tracking or advertising networks you might prefer to avoid. Traditional content blockers focus on filtering unwanted content but often obscure what they *allow* or *block* behind the scenes. uBO Scope lifts this veil.

- **Complete Connection Visibility**: See every distinct third-party remote server contacted, regardless of whether the connection was allowed, stealthily blocked, or outright blocked.
- **Evidence-Based Privacy Insights**: Base your privacy decisions on real data—not assumptions, myths, or flawed tests.
- **Compliments Existing Content Blockers**: Works alongside your blockers, reporting what connections pass through or are blocked without interference.
- **Minimalist and Transparent**: Designed without bloat — just clear, actionable measurements of network activity.

### What Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension that tracks and reports all remote network requests initiated by the browser, using robust `webRequest` listeners. It extracts and classifies these connections by their outcomes:

- **Allowed**: Connections successfully made and data retrieved.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Connections intercepted and blocked silently.
- **Blocked**: Connections that failed due to errors or explicit blocking.

This comprehensive tracking works regardless of which content blocker you have enabled and even reveals connections blocked at the DNS or network level, as long as they are reported by the browser's API.

### Origins and Philosophy

Created by Raymond Hill, the author of the widely trusted uBlock Origin content blocker, uBO Scope stems from a need to measure rather than block — to *understand* browser network behavior without introducing further blocking complexity. It’s especially valuable for privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers who require forensic-level insights to refine blocking rules based on actual network traffic.

## Key Value Propositions

- **Unfiltered Transparency**: No filtering bias; every connection attempt is visible.
- **Myth Debunker**: Separates fact from fiction in evaluating content blockers and their effectiveness.
- **Privacy Empowerment**: Enables users to make informed choices about third-party connections.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Available for Chromium, Firefox, and Safari environments.
- **Lightweight and Non-Intrusive**: Runs quietly in the background without slowing browsing or altering content.

## How Does uBO Scope Work?

Using the powerful `webRequest` API, uBO Scope hooks into the browser’s network request flow, capturing details about each request’s outcome. It aggregates this information per browser tab, categorizing it by domain and hostname to provide both detailed and summarized views.

This approach ensures:

- **Precision**: Accurate capture of all network outcome events, such as redirects, errors, and successful responses.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Display of connections in a popup UI for quick inspection.
- **Session Persistence**: Data is saved temporarily to maintain context during your browsing session.

## Real-World Example

Imagine you load a news webpage:

- uBO Scope captures the main page request (allowed).
- It lists CDN domains allowed to load static assets like images and scripts.
- It identifies stealth-blocked tracking domains that the content blocker intercepted silently.
- Finally, it shows any explicitly blocked ad domains.

This clear breakdown provides immediate insight into which third-party sites your browser is interacting with and how your content blockers engage.

## Why Should You Care?

The digital landscape demands clear knowledge of your browser’s footprint:

- **Evaluate Blockers Effectively**: Instead of relying on misleading block counts or unreliable webpage tests, use uBO Scope to understand real connection outcomes.
- **Spot Unwanted Leakage**: Identify tracking or ad domains slipping through unnoticed.
- **Refine Privacy Practices**: Adjust your blocker settings or filter lists with data-backed confidence.
- **Gain Peace of Mind**: See the true extent of third-party exposure per site.

## Getting Started with uBO Scope

Getting uBO Scope running is straightforward:

1. **Install the Extension**: Available on Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, and Safari Extensions.
2. **Open the Popup UI**: Click the toolbar icon to see connections for the current active tab.
3. **Interpret the Data**: Domains are grouped by connection outcome — allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
4. **Make Informed Decisions**: Use this insight to assess your privacy stance or investigate network behavior.

<u>Pro Tip</u>: A lower number of allowed third-party domains generally indicates better privacy hygiene!
