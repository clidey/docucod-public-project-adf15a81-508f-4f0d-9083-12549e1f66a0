# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Remote Connection Attempted by Your Browser

Imagine having a comprehensive dashboard that unveils every connection your browser tries to make to remote servers — whether successful or blocked — independent of the content blocking tools you use. That is exactly what **uBO Scope** offers, empowering you with unparalleled visibility into your online footprint.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You

- **Complete Transparency:** See all attempted connections to third-party servers from any webpage, no matter which content blocker is active.
- **Independent Verification:** Gain an unbiased view of network requests beyond what your content blockers' block counts reveal.
- **Privacy Empowerment:** Understand which remote domains your browser truly interacts with, so you can make informed privacy decisions.
- **Cross-Blocker Compatibility:** Works alongside any content blocker or DNS blocking — uBO Scope reports connection attempts as long as the browser’s `webRequest` API catches them.
- **Simple yet Powerful:** A lightweight browser extension with a focused mission, no complexity or clutter.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users who want clear insight into what their browser connects to.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to **reveal all remote server connections your browser attempts** — whether those requests succeed, get blocked, or are stealthily redirected. It provides users with an accurate and independent snapshot of the range and diversity of third-party servers contacted during a browsing session.

### The Core Purpose:

uBO Scope’s primary goal is to monitor and display every network request initiated by webpages, offering transparency on privacy-impacting connections that standard content blockers may obscure or misrepresent. It surfaces the actual web traffic landscape behind the scenes, beyond just showing blocked or allowed requests.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

- **Not Dependent on Block Counts:** Unlike content blockers that show block counts, uBO Scope focuses on the count of **distinct third-party remote servers contacted**, which is a more meaningful privacy metric.
- **Works Regardless of Content Blocker:** uBO Scope listens to the browser’s network request API and reports connection outcomes even if the request was blocked earlier or through DNS-level blocking, as long as it’s visible in the `webRequest` event stream.
- **Debunks Common Misconceptions:** It clears up misunderstandings such as “more block counts equal better blocking” or the reliability of ad blocker test pages.
- **Designed for Practical Use:** Lightweight, with planned features targeted especially at filter list maintainers and users deeply interested in network transparency.

### How uBO Scope Works at a High Level

- It listens to the browser’s `webRequest` API for all network requests initiated by webpages.
- Each network request is classified by its outcome:
  - **Allowed** — Connection succeeded and resource was fetched.
  - **Blocked** — Connection attempt failed due to blocking.
  - **Stealth-blocked / Redirected** — Connection silently redirected or blocked stealthily, not obvious to websites.
- The extension aggregates data by domain and hostname, updating a badge on the toolbar icon showing the count of distinct third-party domains successfully connected.
- It provides a popup panel listing details for the current active tab, categorized by outcome.

## Real-World Scenario: How uBO Scope Helps You Understand Web Connections

You visit a news site that loads ads and trackers from multiple third-party domains. Your content blocker reports it blocked some requests, but a few connections sneak through unnoticed.

With uBO Scope, you instantly see every distinct third-party domain your browser contacted, including:

- The domains your blocker let through (allowed).
- Those stealth-blocked through redirects or subtle methods.
- Domains where connection attempts failed due to blocking.

This visibility helps you assess your actual exposure and tweak your privacy tools accordingly.

## Important Points to Keep in Mind

- The toolbar badge reflects the **number of distinct third-party domains connected**, not the raw number of blocked or requested connections.
- A **lower badge number indicates better privacy protection** by minimizing third-party exposure.
- Legitimate third parties like CDNs might appear and are typically low in number.
- Network requests outside the browser’s `webRequest` API (e.g., certain background processes) aren’t tracked by uBO Scope.

### Callout: Myths Dispelled by uBO Scope

<u>Myth:</u> A content blocker with a higher block count is superior.

<u>Reality:</u> High block counts can reflect more frequent fetching from many third-party servers — meaning more domains potentially reached — so the total number of unique connections (reported by uBO Scope) is the more truthful metric of privacy impact.

<u>Myth:</u> "Ad blocker test" websites are reliable benchmarks.

<u>Reality:</u> These test sites often employ fabricated requests that real websites do not use, and fail to consider stealth techniques used by content blockers. uBO Scope’s data relies solely on authentic browser network events.
