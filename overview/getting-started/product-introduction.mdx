# What is uBO Scope?

Discover the power of uBO Scope, a lightweight, privacy-focused browser extension that reveals the hidden world of network connections your browser makes on every webpage you visit. Beyond just blocking content, uBO Scope shines a spotlight on all successful or attempted connections to remote servers, giving you unprecedented transparency into third-party interactions—even those that bypass your content blocker.

## Unlocking Full Network Visibility

Webpages today often connect to many third-party servers, ranging from analytics and advertising platforms to CDN providers and essential functional services. This complexity can obscure what data might be sent or received behind the scenes. uBO Scope solves this by quietly tracking every network request your browser initiates, categorizing the outcomes, and presenting these connections in an easy-to-understand view.

By making all remote server connections visible, uBO Scope empowers you to understand and audit your browsing footprint with clarity and confidence.

## Why Transparency Matters

Imagine visiting a website you trust but remaining unaware of all the silent connections that website triggers. Some may be harmless; others might raise privacy concerns or impact performance. While many users rely solely on content blockers, these tools often focus on blocking known trackers but don't reveal allowed or stealth-blocked connections explicitly.

uBO Scope bridges this gap by delivering actionable insights about all third-party servers your browser talks to, regardless of whether those connections are allowed, blocked stealthily, or outright blocked. This transparency aids in spotting unexpected activity, evaluating filter lists, or simply understanding modern webpage complexity.

## Core Value Propositions

- **Comprehensive Connection Reporting:** See every outgoing connection your browser attempts, including allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked requests.
- **Domain and Hostname Tracking:** Connections grouped by domains and hostnames, letting you spot repeated contacts and their frequency.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Updates a badge count reflecting unique allowed domains per active tab – immediate awareness without digging deep.
- **Works Independently:** Functions alongside content blockers, exposing connections those filters don't explicitly reveal.
- **Cross-Browser Support:** Built with WebExtension standards, supporting Firefox, Chromium-based browsers, and Safari.

## How uBO Scope Works Under the Hood (Simplified)

uBO Scope listens quietly in the background to your browser's network events. It monitors when a request is redirected, succeeds, or fails, capturing the destination's hostname and domain. This data is grouped per browser tab, making it easy to see the network landscape triggered by each webpage.

The extension maintains three categories of connection outcomes:

- **Allowed:** Connections that completed successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections silently blocked or redirected by content filters.
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked with errors.

This session data is stored temporarily, and the interface presents summaries in a clear, actionable popup view.

## Seeing uBO Scope in Action

When you click the uBO Scope icon, the popup shows:

- **The current tab's domain and hostname:** Understand which site you are analyzing.
- **Count of connected domains:** Gives a high-level sense of third-party exposure.
- **Detailed lists:** Separate sections for allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains, each with their connection counts.

For example, visiting `example.com` might reveal connections to `cdn.example.com` (allowed), `tracker.example.net` (stealth-blocked), and `ads.example.org` (blocked), making your third-party relationships immediately transparent.

## Practical Benefits You Will Experience

- **Privacy Awareness:** Identify unexpected or suspicious domains contacted by websites.
- **Filter List Evaluation:** Assess how well your content blockers perform and adjust accordingly.
- **Website Analysis:** Developers and power users can audit third-party integrations and track network behavior.
- **Troubleshooting:** Quickly spot network errors tied to blocked or failed connections.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope alongside but independent of content blockers to get a fuller picture.
- Regularly review the allowed connections, especially when visiting sensitive websites.
- Pay attention to stealth-blocked connections, as these might indicate trackers that are subtle to content blockers.
- Developers can use uBO Scope data to optimize third-party resource loading.

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- **No data appears for a tab:** Ensure the webpage has loaded and initiated network activity. Reload the page if needed.
- **Badge count not updating:** Network data is processed with a short delay; wait a moment or reopen the popup.
- **Unexpected many connections:** This might reflect legitimate third-party services; investigate suspicious domains online.
