# Feature Snapshot

Discover the key capabilities that make uBO Scope an indispensable tool for anyone interested in gaining clear, actionable insights into the network activity of the webpages they visit. This snapshot highlights how the extension reports on third-party server connections, offers a domain-by-domain breakdown in its popup interface, tracks requests alongside your content blockers, and supports all major browsers.

## See Third-Party Connections at a Glance

At the heart of uBO Scope is its badge reporting system. The badge icon on your browser toolbar instantly shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers that a webpage has connected to. This count is more meaningful than conventional block counts, signaling the true scale of network exposure:

- **Distinct Third-Party Servers Counted:** The badge reports only unique remote servers, helping you quickly assess how many distinct connections occurred.
- **Focus on Privacy Impact:** Fewer distinct remote servers often mean better privacy; uBO Scope lets you monitor this metric clearly.

Imagine visiting a news website and seeing a badge number of "12"—you instantly know your browser connected to 12 separate third-party servers, whether ads, analytics, or content delivery networks.

## Domain-by-Domain Status in the Popup

Clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon opens a clean, informative popup summarizing the connection status server by server for the current page:

- **Allowed Domains:** Domains where connections succeeded without blocking.
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains:** Domains where requests were silently blocked or redirected by your content blocker.
- **Blocked Domains:** Domains explicitly blocked due to errors or blocking rules.

Each category displays all involved domains along with the number of requests made, helping you drill down into which specific servers are active, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked by your current setup.

<Info>
The domain names shown are converted to a readable format even if they use internationalized domain names (IDNs), making the information accessible and easy to interpret.

## Request Tracking Across Blockers

uBO Scope distinguishes itself by reporting network request outcomes regardless of the content blocker in use or blocking method:

- It captures successes (allowed requests), redirects or stealth blocks, and explicit blocks.
- This comprehensive approach offers transparency beyond simple block counts.

This means you understand exactly which remote servers your browser tried to contact, which were blocked silently behind the scenes, and which succeeded.

## Compatibility Across All Major Browsers

uBO Scope supports all leading browsers—including Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Edge), Mozilla Firefox, and Safari—ensuring you can rely on this powerful network visibility tool regardless of your preferred browsing environment.

## How These Features Work Together

Here is a typical workflow showcasing uBO Scope's value:

1. Browse any website with uBO Scope installed.
2. The toolbar badge updates live showing how many distinct third-party domains the page contacted.
3. Open the popup to see a clear breakdown of each domain's connection status.
4. Identify unexpected or stealth-blocked servers and better understand your privacy exposure.

This empowers you to make informed decisions about your content blockers and browsing habits.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Monitor the badge count regularly:** It offers a quick indicator of exposure level.
- **Explore the popup UI for detailed insights:** Use it to validate if your blockers are effective.
- **Refresh the page if something seems off:** uBO Scope collects data per tab session.
- **Combine with uBlock Origin for enhanced privacy settings:** uBO Scope acts as a companion, helping you measure effectiveness.

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- **Badge shows zero or no data:** Ensure the extension has active permissions and you have browsed a page with network activity.
- **Domains list empty:** The page might have no external connections or the extension couldn't intercept requests for some reason.
- **Data doesn't update live:** The popup reflects the latest tab session data on open; refresh the page and popup if needed.
