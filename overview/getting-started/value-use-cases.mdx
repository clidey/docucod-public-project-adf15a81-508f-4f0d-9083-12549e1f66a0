# Key Use Cases & Who Should Use It

uBO Scope delivers clear, actionable insights into your browsing privacy by revealing the full scope of network connections made by webpages. This page breaks down the top scenarios where uBO Scope shines—helping you identify unwanted third-party connections, validate your privacy setups, and support the challenging work of filter list maintainers.

## Uncover Hidden Third-Party Connections

One of the most critical problems for privacy-conscious users is the difficulty in knowing exactly who their browsers are talking to behind the scenes. Modern websites often load resources from numerous third-party domains, some benign and some tracking your activity.

### What uBO Scope Does

- Monitors every network request initiated by the active webpage.
- Categorizes connections into three groups:
  - **Allowed:** Successfully established connections.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Connections silently blocked by content blockers without page breakage.
  - **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked, often visible in the user interface of blockers.

By presenting these distinct categories clearly, uBO Scope empowers you to see *all* connections your browser attempts, not just the ones your blocker reports.

### Real Example Scenario

Imagine visiting a news website and seeing a badge count of "12" on uBO Scope’s icon. This means the website is connecting to 12 distinct third-party domains—some might be content delivery networks (CDNs), others may be trackers or advertisers. 

Without uBO Scope, you would only know what your blocker actively blocks, not what is stealthily allowed or silently blocked. uBO Scope reveals the *actual* contact list your browser has, closing a critical visibility gap.

## Validate Your Privacy Setup

Ensuring your privacy protections are working as intended can be challenging, especially when relying on browser extensions or network-level blocking.

### Why uBO Scope Is Essential

- **Cross-check your blockers:** See which requests actually reach third-party servers versus those stealth-blocked or flagged as errors.
- **Avoid misleading metrics:** Some content blockers report high numbers of blocked requests but still allow broad third-party access. uBO Scope focuses on distinct third-party domains connected, a more meaningful metric.
- **Detect evasive connections:** Connections that sneak past blockers remain visible in uBO Scope, allowing you to investigate and tighten controls.

### Outcome: Transparent Insight

With uBO Scope running, you no longer rely on opaque badge counts or webpage test sites with contrived scenarios. Instead, you get real-world, browser-level intelligence on your privacy stance. This reduces guesswork and supports evidence-based tuning of your blockers.

## Support for Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining filter lists—the backbone of effective content blocking—requires precise and reliable data about network requests.

### How uBO Scope Helps

- **Real data source:** Provides a clear record of third-party domains seen during browsing sessions.
- **Device-independent:** Available even on devices where devtools or advanced logging are limited.
- **Audit & Debug:** Quickly verify if recent filter updates have the expected effect on blocking or allowing connections.

### Practical Benefit

Filter list maintainers can combine uBO Scope data with blocker logs to pinpoint missed domains, false positives, or stealthy requests. This accelerates the maintenance cycle, improving blocker accuracy for all users.
