# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Discover whether uBO Scope fits your needs. Whether you are a privacy-conscious web user, a filter list maintainer, or a researcher seeking clear insights into web connections, this guide explains typical scenarios where uBO Scope delivers unmatched transparency.

## Understanding Your Privacy Landscape

uBO Scope reveals all remote server connections a webpage attempts or establishes, going beyond what conventional content blockers display. For anyone concerned about unseen or stealthy connections that threaten privacy, this tool provides definitive visibility.

Imagine visiting your favorite news site and wondering which third-party servers it truly contacts behind the scenes. uBO Scope lifts the curtain by showing the actual network destinations involved—even those masked by other content blockers or network-level DNS filters.

## Who Benefits Most from uBO Scope?

### Privacy-Conscious Web Users
- **Control Your Exposure:** Know exactly how many and which third-party domains your browser connects to on each site.
- **Avoid False Assurances:** Reject misleading metrics like block counts or synthetic ad-block tests. Instead, understand real connections.
- **Stay Informed:** Use the badge count as a simple health indicator. Fewer third-party remote servers means less unintended exposure.

### Filter List Maintainers and Researchers
- **Fine-Tune Lists:** Identify all third-party domains involved in a page load, allowing meticulous crafting and verification of filter lists.
- **Validate Effectiveness:** Confirm which third-party connections remain unblocked and which are stealth-blocked or explicitly blocked by your lists.
- **Work Beyond Browser Limitations:** Especially on devices or environments lacking full dev tools access, uBO Scope offers a streamlined way to audit network requests.

### Developers and Security Analysts
- **Map Network Dependencies:** Gain insight into every external domain a web application interacts with.
- **Debug Complex Filtering Issues:** Detect unexpected redirects, errors, or stealth-block behaviors affecting resource loading.

## Typical Scenarios Where uBO Scope Excels

**Scenario 1: Verifying Content Blocker Performance**

You suspect your content blocker might falsely claim high blocking effectiveness based on block count alone. With uBO Scope, you see the true number of distinct third-party servers your browser contacts. This grounds your evaluation in transparency rather than superficial metrics.

**Scenario 2: Investigating Unknown Connections**

After visiting a website, you notice unusual resource loads or latency. Launching uBO Scope reveals remote domains contacted, helping uncover hidden tracking or ad networks.

**Scenario 3: Supporting Filter List Updates**

As a maintainer, you need to confirm that new filters successfully block unwanted domains while avoiding false positives. uBO Scope’s categorized domain lists—allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked—assist in these validation tasks.

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions">
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope tell me which third parties are safe?">
While uBO Scope shows every remote server connection attempted, it does not judge their safety. It helps you identify the scope of connections; assessing risk remains a user or filter list maintainer task.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Will uBO Scope slow down my browsing experience?">
uBO Scope efficiently listens to network events without blocking requests itself. It does not add noticeable delay but provides real-time insights into connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope replace my content blocker?">
No. uBO Scope complements content blockers by revealing connections regardless of any blocking in place. It helps you understand what your blocker allows, blocks, or stealth blocks.
