# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

## Discover If uBO Scope Is Right for You

uBO Scope is designed with distinct audiences in mind who share a common goal: to gain transparent and accurate insight into the network connections initiated by the active browser tab. Whether you're deeply invested in privacy, developing and maintaining filter lists, or a technically inclined user diagnosing network activity, this page outlines how uBO Scope fits naturally into your workflow.

## Primary Audiences

### Privacy-Conscious Individuals

If you prioritize protecting your online privacy and want an unfiltered view of the third-party servers your browser connects to, uBO Scope is invaluable. It reveals all remote server connections, including those allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked by your content blockers, helping you:

- Understand exactly how many distinct third-party domains interact with your browsing activity.
- Identify unexpected or potentially unwanted connections that standard content blockers may obscure.
- Verify the real-world effectiveness of your content blockers beyond commonly misleading block counts.

### Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining robust filter lists requires precise, unbiased data on network requests. uBO Scope empowers filter list maintainers by providing:

- Real-time counting and classification of third-party remote servers per active tab.
- Transparent insights unaltered by content blocker stealth behaviors or browser limitations.
- The ability to assess filter effectiveness even in environments with limited browser debugging tools.

This makes uBO Scope an essential companion tool for improving and validating filter lists.

### Technical Users & Network Analysts

For developers, researchers, and advanced users, uBO Scope acts as an accurate diagnostic instrument to:

- Analyze network activity granularly per tab with clear distinctions between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.
- Debug or evaluate web requests initiated by browser tabs under various network and content blocking conditions.
- Validate the behavior of third-party content blockers and measure network exposure in real-world usage.

## Ideal Scenarios for Using uBO Scope

### Evaluating Content Blockers

uBO Scope reveals why relying on block counts or popular "ad blocker test" pages can be deceptive. By showing the true count of distinct third-party servers your browser connects to, you can:

- Compare multiple content blockers based on actual network exposure rather than misleading metrics.
- Identify stealth behaviors some blockers use that may allow connections without visible blocking indications.

### Diagnosing Suspicious or Unexpected Network Activity

If you notice abnormal network behavior or want to audit a webpage's connections, uBO Scope offers:

- A clear breakdown of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Domain-level counts and insights visible at a glance in the popup interface.

### Validating Filter Effectiveness

Filter list maintainers can use uBO Scope to verify that their filters are working as intended by observing:

- Network requests that are blocked or stealth-blocked in real-time.
- Domains bypassing filters and those properly handled.

## Integrating uBO Scope into Your Privacy or Research Workflow

Think of uBO Scope as a clear window into your browser's network behavior. It complements privacy tools by adding transparency where opaque behaviors often exist:

- Use uBO Scope alongside content blockers to audit and fine-tune protections.
- Employ it as a lightweight monitoring tool without deep invasive permissions or complex setups.
- Incorporate its data into research or reporting on web tracking or content blocking efficacy.

## Practical Tips for Users

- Launch the popup during active browsing sessions to immediately see detailed domain connection analytics.
- Focus on the badge count on the toolbar icon as a quick indicator of the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected.
- Regularly check for stealth-blocked domains to understand hidden network activities that might bypass your blocker.

<Tip>
Lower badge counts correlate with stricter third-party exposure, but be mindful of legitimate services like CDNs which naturally require network access.
