# Quick Feature Overview

Unlock immediate insights into your browser's network activity with uBO Scope’s straightforward yet powerful feature set. This page highlights the core capabilities that bring transparency and control to your browsing experience through real-time analytics and an intuitive interface.

---

## Real-Time Counting of Distinct Third-Party Servers

uBO Scope continuously monitors network connections initiated by your active browser tab, counting unique remote servers independently for each connection outcome:

- **Allowed Connections:** Servers your browser connects to successfully without interference.
- **Stealth-Blocked Connections:** Servers where network requests were rerouted or redirected stealthily to avoid detection.
- **Blocked Connections:** Servers to which your browser attempted connections but were blocked.

This live distinct count (displayed as a badge on the toolbar icon) shifts your focus from generic block counts to meaningful third-party server visibility, helping you understand exactly which remote servers are involved.

_Tip: A lower badge number means fewer distinct third-party servers connected, which usually implies reduced external exposure._

## Popup Interface Analytics Per Active Tab

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, a dedicated popup interface opens. This panel provides a clear, tab-specific snapshot:

- The **domain name** of the current active tab.
- A **total count** of distinct third-party domains connected by the page.
- Three categorized sections listing domains grouped by connection outcome:
  - **Not blocked (Allowed):** Domains your browser connected to freely.
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were intercepted or rerouted stealthily.
  - **Blocked:** Domains whose connection attempts were fully blocked.

Each section lists third-party domains alongside the number of requests made, enabling you to identify domains generating the most network traffic or potentially undesirable connections.

### Example Usage Scenario
Suppose you visit a news website. Opening the popup reveals:
- 8 allowed third-party domains, indicating content delivery networks and analytics servers.
- 3 stealth-blocked domains, likely advertising servers your blocker handled silently.
- 5 blocked domains, showing ad or tracking servers your content blocker prevented from connecting.

This clarity helps you quickly assess third-party risk and the effectiveness of your blocker setup.

## Unbiased Network Request Log

Unlike some tools limited by content blockers or DNS configurations, uBO Scope leverages the browser’s `webRequest` API to capture all network request outcomes regardless of the blocking method used. This unbiased log provides real network visibility:

- No reliance on content blocker internal metrics or heuristics.
- Clear differentiation between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked requests.
- Real-world insights reflecting what the browser truly encounters.

This empowers you to trust your network visibility data and use it confidently for privacy assessment or troubleshooting.

## Bringing It All Together

uBO Scope integrates these features in an unobtrusive interface:

1. **Network monitoring runs silently** in the background, counting connections per active tab.
2. **The toolbar icon badge updates live**, reflecting your current tab’s remote third-party server count.
3. **Popup details provide actionable insights**, enabling immediate identification of suspicious or excessive third-party domains.

By focusing on these core features, uBO Scope delivers transparency where typical content blocker metrics fail.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Regularly review popup details:** Check connections whenever visiting new or unfamiliar sites to monitor third-party exposure.
- **Interpret badge totals wisely:** Use the badge count as a privacy indicator – a rising number may suggest more third-party tracking.
- **Combine with content blockers:** Use uBO Scope alongside your existing blockers to validate their effectiveness from an independent viewpoint.
- **Be aware of network request nuances:** Some allowed connections may be essential third-party services like CDNs.

```html
<h2 id="tabHostname"><span></span><span>NO DATA</span></h2>
<main>
    <section id="summary">
        domains connected: <span>?</span>
    </section>
    <section class="outcome allowed">
        <h3>not blocked</h3>
        <div class="domains"></div>
    </section>
    <section class="outcome stealth">
        <h3>stealth-blocked</h3>
        <div class="domains"></div>
    </section>
    <section class="outcome blocked">
        <h3>blocked</h3>
        <div class="domains"></div>
    </section>
