# Browser Integration & Compatibility

## Seamless Integration Within Your Browser Ecosystem

uBO Scope is designed to fit naturally into your browser's extension environment by leveraging the powerful `webRequest` API. This integration provides deep visibility into every network connection initiated from your browser, enabling you to understand and monitor third-party connections transparently and independently of any content blockers you might have installed.

### Why This Matters

Browser extensions live in a complex ecosystem with many APIs and permissions. uBO Scope’s use of the `webRequest` API allows it to access detailed network event data directly from the browser’s networking layer. This gives you an unprecedented, real-time look at which remote servers your browser reaches out to — including requests blocked by content blockers or DNS filtering.


## Cross-Browser Compatibility: Supporting Chromium, Firefox, and Safari

uBO Scope is engineered for broad compatibility, ensuring consistent behavior and accurate reporting across major browsers:

- **Chromium (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge)**
  - Utilizes Manifest Version 3 with a `service_worker` background script.
  - Requires `webRequest` permission to monitor network traffic.
  - Supports WebSocket and HTTP(S) schemes for comprehensive tracking.
  - Minimum supported Chrome version: 122.0.

- **Firefox**
  - Uses a module-type background script.
  - Incorporates browser-specific settings such as a minimum version of 128.0 for desktop and Android.
  - Supports extensive host permissions including WebSocket schemes.

- **Safari**
  - Employs manifest and JavaScript background scripts compatible with Safari’s extension model.
  - Requires at least Safari version 18.5.
  - Supports HTTP(S) schemes; WebSocket support is limited by Safari's extension APIs.

This cross-platform support ensures that whether you prefer Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, or Safari, uBO Scope will reliably collect and report connection data without sacrificing accuracy or performance.

## Key Integration Highlights

### Use of webRequest API

The `webRequest` API is the cornerstone of uBO Scope’s integration. It listens to multiple network events (`onBeforeRedirect`, `onErrorOccurred`, `onResponseStarted`) using permissions tightly scoped to relevant URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, `wss://*/*`). This empowers the extension to provide a complete journal of network requests, including successes, errors, and redirects.

### Browser Action Interface

In all supported browsers, uBO Scope uses the toolbar icon to engage users, showing:

- A **badge** indicating the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected.
- A **popup UI** detailing connected domains categorized by their outcome: allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

The popup interface and badge update behavior are consistent across browsers, providing a familiar and intuitive experience.

### Permissions and Host Access

The extension requests a minimal but sufficient set of permissions:

- `activeTab` to interact with the current tab.
- `storage` for saving session and configuration data.
- `webRequest` for network request monitoring.

Host permissions encompass a broad range of web and WebSocket URLs to capture all potential remote connections comprehensively.

## Browser-Specific Nuances

While uBO Scope maintains feature parity across browsers, certain subtle differences influence integration:

- **Chromium:** The background script runs as a service worker due to Manifest V3 requirements, offering event-driven background processing with better resource efficiency.

- **Firefox:** Background scripts run as ES modules with full access to session APIs, enabling robust session data storage and public suffix list caching.

- **Safari:** Background scripts rely on Safari's module model and have constraints on WebSocket event capturing. Minimum version constraints ensure compatibility with required API surface.

Despite these differences, all versions deliver reliable, real-time monitoring with the same user-facing outputs.

## Real-World Example of Browser Integration Impact

Imagine browsing a news website that silently loads content from multiple ad networks, CDNs, and analytics servers. Thanks to uBO Scope’s deep integration:

1. As soon as the webpage starts loading, the extension tracks every outgoing network request via the `webRequest` listeners.
2. The toolbar badge updates dynamically, counting unique third-party servers successfully connected.
3. Opening the popup reveals detailed categorized domains, highlighting any stealth-blocked or fully blocked connections.
4. This transparency helps you audit and control your browsing privacy effectively across browsers.


## Best Practices for Using uBO Scope in Your Browser

- **Ensure Permissions Are Granted:** Confirm during installation or setup that uBO Scope has requested and received the permissions it needs (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).
- **Keep Your Browser Updated:** Minimum version requirements (e.g., Chrome 122, Firefox 128, Safari 18.5) guarantee the extension operates with supported APIs.
- **Understand Browser Limitations:** Be aware that some network events or WebSocket details may vary slightly due to browser-specific API constraints.

## Troubleshooting Common Integration Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Browser Integration Issues">
<Accordion title="Extension Not Showing Badge or Popup Updates">
- Verify the extension has the `webRequest` permission and host access.
- Reload or restart the browser to ensure extension background scripts are active.
- Check for conflicting extensions that may interfere with `webRequest` listeners.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing WebSocket Connection Data in Safari">
- Safari’s extension APIs may limit WebSocket monitoring.
- Confirm you use Safari 18.5 or newer with the latest uBO Scope build.
- Consider reporting any missing functionality on the official GitHub repository.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Incorrect Count or Data Displayed">
- The badge reflects distinct third-party domains connected, not individual requests.
- If the count appears too high, review your content blockers as they may allow more connections.
- Use the popup to categorize and identify domains to better assess connection legitimacy.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

uBO Scope seamlessly integrates into your browser’s extension landscape by leveraging the `webRequest` API, providing precise visibility into all remote server connections your browser makes. Its cross-browser compatibility across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari ensures consistent, reliable insights while honoring each browser’s capabilities and constraints.
