# Feature Overview

Discover the essential features of uBO Scope that empower you to gain clear, real-time visibility into your browser's network activity. This page walks through the core functionalities designed to enhance your understanding of which remote servers your browser connects to, how these connections are categorized, and how the extension seamlessly integrates with your browsing environment.

---

## Real-Time Badge Reporting

The toolbar icon dynamically displays a badge count reflecting the **number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser has connected to on the active tab**. This immediate visual feedback helps you quickly gauge the external connections made during your browsing session.

- **Why it matters:** A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party servers, which generally means fewer external elements potentially impacting privacy or performance.
- The badge updates continuously as your browsing activity triggers new network requests.

## Per-Tab Connection Details

uBO Scope breaks down network activity **per browser tab**, isolating data for more accurate, context-specific insights.

- Each tab tracks allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections separately.
- You can view detailed breakdowns of hostnames and their associated domains for the current tab through the popup interface.

### How This Benefits You
- Pinpoint exactly which third-party servers each website interacts with.
- Avoid noise from other tabs, enabling targeted investigation.

## Real-Time Distinction of Connection Outcomes

The extension classifies every outgoing network request into one of three clearly defined categories:

- **Allowed:** Requests that successfully reached remote servers.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests discreetly blocked to prevent webpage breakage or detection.
- **Blocked:** Requests that were outright denied by content blocking rules.

### What This Means for Your Workflow

Understanding these distinct outcomes allows you to:

- Evaluate the effectiveness of your content blocking configuration.
- Identify stealth blocking in action, which standard blockers might mask.
- Make evidence-based decisions about filter lists or privacy settings.

## Cross-Browser Integration

uBO Scope is built to **work seamlessly across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers**.

- Utilizes the browser's `webRequest` API, allowing it to catch and categorize network requests consistently across supported browsers.
- Each supported platform benefits from the same intuitive interface and real-time reporting.

### Benefits of Cross-Browser Support

- Maintain consistent privacy and network visibility regardless of your preferred browser.
- Leverage familiar features and UI, reducing learning curve when switching browsers.

## Practical User Workflow Example

Imagine you open a news website in your browser:

1. The uBO Scope badge shows “5”, indicating 5 unique third-party servers contacted.
2. Clicking the toolbar icon opens the popup, showing 3 allowed domains, 1 stealth-blocked domain, and 1 blocked domain.
3. You identify a tracker domain under stealth-blocked and decide to adjust your filter list for stricter blocking.
4. After refreshing the page, the badge number reduces to “4”, confirming the change's effectiveness.

This smooth feedback loop empowers you to manage browsing privacy interactively.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Monitor badge numbers regularly:** Use badge counts as a quick health check of your browsing privacy.
- **Explore per-tab details:** When a badge count surprises you, open the popup for a detailed breakdown.
- **Understand connection categories:** Recognize that stealth blocking is deliberate and beneficial to avoid breaking websites.
- **Cross-browser alignment:** If using multiple browsers, expect consistent reports thanks to universal integration.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t rely solely on block counts as a measure of protection—focus on distinct third-party domains connected.
- Avoid assuming all third-party domains are malicious; many are legitimate services like CDNs.
- Remember that requests outside the browser’s `webRequest` API scope (e.g., certain extensions or network layers) are not visible to uBO Scope.
