# Feature Overview

Discover the core features that make uBO Scope a powerful and insightful browser extension for monitoring your remote server connections. This page provides a clear, benefit-driven overview of what uBO Scope offers right out of the box, enabling you to understand exactly how it enhances your browsing transparency and control.

## Monitoring Remote Connections with Precision

At its heart, uBO Scope continuously tracks every network request your browser initiates to remote servers. Whether the request is allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked by other content blockers, uBO Scope reports it with clarity and accuracy using the browser's `webRequest` API.

- **Comprehensive Tracking:** All network requests are captured, including those successful, redirected, or blocked.
- **Independence from Content Blockers:** Results reflect the real network connections regardless of which content blocker is active or what blocking technique it uses.
- **Real-time Data:** Network outcomes are processed and updated rapidly to keep the information current.

This transparency gives you an honest picture of your browser’s external communications, empowering you to assess privacy exposure and connection behavior objectively.

## Toolbar Badge Reporting: At-a-Glance Insight

The extension uses a dynamic badge on its toolbar icon to communicate the number of unique third-party remote servers your browser has connected to for the current tab.

- **Clear, Count-Based Indicator:** The badge number reflects distinct remote servers connected, not just blocked or request counts.
- **A Lower Badge Count is Better:** Encourages understanding that fewer third-party connections often mean better privacy.
- **Encourages Critical Thinking:** The badge offers insights often missed by traditional block count metrics.

This persistent visual cue gives you immediate context without opening the popup, making privacy awareness effortless.

## Categorized Connection Reporting via Popup Interface

Clicking the toolbar icon expands a detailed popup that organizes observed network connections into three categories:

- **Allowed:** Third-party domains from which resources have been successfully retrieved.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were actively blocked by your content blocker.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections that were redirected or stealthily intercepted, revealing subtler blocking outcomes.

Each category lists domains with counts, enabling you to explore connection details easily and make informed decisions about your browsing environment.

## Cross-Platform and Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope is built to run seamlessly across the major browsers:

- **Chromium-based Browsers:** Full support leveraging Manifest V3 service workers.
- **Firefox:** Compatible with Firefox’s extension APIs, supporting webRequest listeners fully.
- **Safari:** Supports Safari’s latest extension model (version 18.5+).

This wide compatibility ensures you benefit from uBO Scope’s powerful features no matter your preferred browser.

## Work Regardless of Active Content Blockers

One of uBO Scope’s defining strengths is its ability to deliver accurate connection data regardless of which content blocking solution is in use:

- **Independent Network Outcome Reporting:** Uses browser APIs to detect the real fate of requests even if they’re blocked by DNS, stealth mechanisms, or other extensions.
- **Truthful Measurement:** Avoids misleading block counts by focusing on actual connections.
- **Supports Myth-Busting:** Helps users and filter list maintainers debunk common misunderstandings about content blocker effectiveness.

This objective reporting transforms how you understand the web and your browser's interaction with it.

## Example User Scenario: Real-Time Transparency

Imagine you’re a privacy-conscious user wanting to ensure your content blocker is effectively limiting third-party trackers. As you browse, you glance at uBO Scope’s badge showing "3", indicating few distinct third-party servers connected so far. Clicking the badge opens the popup, where you see those domains categorized as Allowed and Blocked, helping you validate your blocker’s coverage instantly.

In another scenario, a filter list maintainer uses uBO Scope to detect stealth redirects or unexpected allowed connections that help refine their filters more precisely.

## Practical Tips

- Monitor the badge count actively during browsing sessions for a quick privacy snapshot.
- Use the popup’s categorized lists to identify unexpected or excessive third-party connections.
- Remember that not all third-party connections are harmful; some are necessary content delivery networks.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with your content blocker settings to optimize your privacy without breaking websites.

## Common Pitfalls

- Relying solely on content blocking count metrics can be misleading; focus on third-party domain counts instead.
- The extension cannot report network requests made outside the browser’s `webRequest` API scope.
- DNS-level blocking or stealth blocking can mask actual connection attempts; uBO Scope reveals these with its categorized approach.
