# Primary Use Cases & Target Audience

## Unlocking Practical Insights with uBO Scope

Imagine visiting a website and instantly knowing exactly which external domains and servers your browser is reaching out to — not just the main site but every third-party service silently engaged behind the scenes. uBO Scope empowers you with this level of network transparency, helping you see through the complex web of connections that modern webpages generate.

This page guides you through realistic scenarios where uBO Scope shines, and profiles the users who benefit the most from its focused visibility.

## Why Use uBO Scope? Real-World Scenarios Explained

### 1. Auditing Third-Party Domains Connected by Websites

Websites today rarely operate in isolation. They communicate with multiple external servers for ads, analytics, content delivery, fonts, trackers, and more. uBO Scope reveals the full list of these connected domains, categorizing them by their outcome: whether connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.

**Benefit:** This immediate visibility enables you to gauge your true privacy exposure on any site you visit.

**Example:** When visiting an e-commerce site, you can verify if any obscure advertising or tracking domains are hidden among the expected content delivery networks (CDNs).

---

### 2. Verifying the Effectiveness of Your Content Blocker

Not all content blockers behave identically, and some may block many requests yet allow connections to a wide set of third-party servers. uBO Scope’s badge counts and detailed domain lists help you assess whether your chosen blocker minimizes external resource fetches effectively.

**Benefit:** You avoid misleading metrics based solely on block counts and focus on true network exposure, helping you choose or fine-tune your content blocking setup.

**Example:** After switching blockers, you use uBO Scope to compare which tool actually reduces the number of distinct third-party servers your browser communicates with, ensuring better privacy.

### 3. Supporting Filter List Maintenance

Filter list maintainers and privacy researchers rely on accurate data about real-world network connections. uBO Scope aggregates fine-grained connection outcomes even in environments where developer tools are limited, providing essential data to improve blocking rules and audit emerging privacy challenges.

**Benefit:** It serves as a practical, lightweight tool that complements more elaborate debugging setups for those curating or verifying blocklists.

**Example:** A blocklist maintainer uses uBO Scope on a mobile device to observe stealth-blocked connections and blocked domains, ensuring that stealthy bypass attempts are detected and addressed.

## Practical Tips to Maximize uBO Scope's Benefits

- Remember the badge's count reflects distinct connected third-party domains—not total blocked requests—making it a more accurate privacy indicator.
- Use the categorized lists (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked) to identify suspicious domains requiring closer scrutiny.
- Combine uBO Scope with your content blocker’s logs for thorough analysis, but rely on uBO Scope for clear visibility that factors in stealth blocking.
- Typical low-risk websites tend to have a small number of legitimate third-party domains, mostly well-known CDNs; unexpected or numerous third parties warrant attention.

---

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **Empty or No Data:** Ensure you have an active tab open with a webpage loaded; uBO Scope shows data per active tab.
- **Unexpected High Counts:** Some sites legitimately load resources from multiple third parties; investigate unknown domains using external tools.
- **Minimal Updates:** Network activity is monitored continuously, but data updates on slow or cached pages might be delayed.
