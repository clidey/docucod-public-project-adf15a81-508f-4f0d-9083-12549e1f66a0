## Step 1: Choose Your Browser and Download uBO Scope

</Tip>

## Step 2: Verify Basic System Requirements

Before installation, confirm your system meets the minimum requirements:

- **Browser Version:**
  - Chromium browsers: Version 122 or later for compatibility with manifest version 3 extensions.
  - Firefox: Version 128 or later.
  - Safari: Version 18.5 or later.
- **Permissions:** uBO Scope requires permissions for active tab access, storage, and network request monitoring.

<Note>
If your browser version is below these minimums, please update to the latest release before installing uBO Scope to ensure full functionality.
</Note>

---

## Step 3: Install the Extension

Install uBO Scope directly via your browser’s official add-on store:

- Click the relevant download link above for your browser.
- Follow the store prompts to add the extension.
- Accept the requested permissions to enable full functionality.

After installation, you will see the uBO Scope icon in your browser’s toolbar. This icon provides quick access to the extension’s popup interface and gives you real-time badges indicating connection activity.

## Step 4: Launch uBO Scope and Explore the Popup Interface

Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the extension’s popup window. This interface is the hub where uBO Scope presents its findings:

- **Domains Connected:** Displays the count of distinct third-party domains your current tab has communicated with.
- **Sections:**
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains where network connections succeeded.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were stealthily blocked (blocked without disrupting webpage behavior).
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly blocked.

Each domain includes a count of network requests related to it, empowering you to understand your webpage’s network footprint at a glance.

<Info>
The popup interface typically shows data for the active tab only, updating automatically as the page loads and network requests occur.
</Info>

---

## Understanding What You’re Seeing

Upon first launch, your popup may display "NO DATA" or zero counts if no network requests have been captured yet. This is normal for a newly installed extension or for tabs without active network traffic.

Open any normal webpage and watch the counts populate dynamically as uBO Scope measures connections during your browsing session.

---

## Practical Tips for a Smooth Start

- **Reload Active Tabs:** After installing, refresh your active browser tabs to allow uBO Scope to start monitoring network requests.
- **Review Permissions:** If the popup isn’t showing data, ensure the extension has necessary permissions in your browser’s settings.
- **Badge Counts:** The badge over the toolbar icon provides a quick summary — lower counts often indicate fewer third-party connections.

## Troubleshooting Installation and Initial Launch

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup Issues and How to Resolve Them">
<Accordion title="The Extension Icon Does Not Appear After Installation">
Ensure your browser has extensions enabled. In some browsers/settings, extensions may be hidden by default—check the extensions or add-ons manager and pin the uBO Scope icon to the toolbar.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup Shows 'NO DATA' or Blank Information">
- Refresh your active tab to trigger network monitoring.
- Verify that uBO Scope has permission to access tabs and storage.
- Close and reopen the popup to refresh its data display.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge Count Never Changes or Stays at Zero">
This might indicate that uBO Scope is not detecting network connections:

- Confirm your browser supports the webRequest API for extension monitoring.
- Disable conflicting extensions that might block or interfere with webRequest events.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
