# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding uBO Scope begins with clear knowledge of the terms it uses to represent network activity. This page introduces essential terminology like 'third-party remote servers', the 'webRequest API', 'badge count', 'stealth-blocked connections', and 'CDNs' — empowering you to interpret what uBO Scope tracks, how it classifies connection outcomes, and what the toolbar icon indicates.

## Third-Party Remote Servers

A core concept in uBO Scope is the distinction between first-party and third-party connections:

- **First-party connections** originate from the website you are visiting directly.
- **Third-party remote servers** are any servers outside the primary domain's control that your browser attempts to connect with as you browse.

uBO Scope tracks these third-party connections to provide transparency about what external entities are communicating with your browser behind the scenes. This insight is critical for privacy-conscious users who want to minimize exposure to unwanted or unknown domains.

The toolbar badge in uBO Scope reports the **number of distinct third-party remote servers connected** during your browsing session. A lower badge count means fewer external connections, which often correlates to better privacy.

## webRequest API

uBO Scope relies on your browser's `webRequest` API to observe network requests initiated by webpages:

- This API provides real-time visibility into outgoing network requests before they complete.
- It reports the URL, request type, and outcome (allowed, redirected, blocked, or errors).

Because uBO Scope uses this API, the extension can report the fate of every network request as long as the browser supports `webRequest`. Connections made outside this API's scope or by the browser itself independently cannot be tracked.

<Warning>
Browsers must have `webRequest` API access enabled and available for uBO Scope to function fully. Some browsers or configurations may limit this capability.
</Warning>

## Badge Count Explained

The badge count on the toolbar icon gives a snapshot overview of your active tab's third-party connection landscape:

- **Count Value:** Represents the number of unique third-party domains with allowed connections.
- **Goal:** Lower numbers are desirable as they indicate fewer external connections triggered by a page.

Importantly, the badge count is not a block count—it reflects successful connections, not the number of blocked or failed requests.

## Connection Outcomes

Every network request monitored by uBO Scope falls into one of three outcome categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Connections successfully made to third-party servers.
- **Blocked:** Requests prevented from completing, typically by your content blocker or browser security.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections silently intercepted or redirected by a blocker in a way that hides the blocking event from the page or other network layers.

These outcomes are shown in the uBO Scope popup, grouped by category, allowing you to understand not only which requests were allowed but also those that were either visibly or stealthily blocked.

<Tip>
Stealth blocking is a method used by some content blockers to prevent detection by webpages and to avoid breakage that occurs when blocking is too aggressive.
</Tip>

## Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

CDNs are third-party services that host and deliver shared web resources like scripts, images, and stylesheets from geographically distributed servers.

- While CDNs are third parties, many are legitimate and essential for website functionality and speed.
- uBO Scope helps you differentiate between high-volume CDNs and other third-party connections that might be less desirable.

<RealWorldContext>
For example, seeing domains like `cdn.cloudflare.net` or `akamai.net` typically corresponds to well-known CDNs serving content efficiently.

## What the Toolbar Icon Reveals

The uBO Scope toolbar icon dynamically indicates active network connection details for the current browser tab:

- **Badge Count:** Shows the count of distinct allowed third-party domains connected during the session.
- **Icon Color and State:** Reflects activity and can hint at the presence of blocked or stealth-blocked domains (shown in the popup, not directly by the icon).
- **Popup View:** Clicking the icon opens a detailed popup categorizing domains by outcome with counts and domain names.

This visual feedback loop helps you make informed judgments about the external network activity generated by the websites you visit.

## Practical Example: Interpreting uBO Scope Output

Imagine you visit `example.com`. uBO Scope collects network request data and reports:

- 5 distinct allowed third-party domains (e.g., analytics.example.net, cdn.examplecdn.com).
- 2 stealth-blocked domains that never completed visible connections.
- 3 blocked domains explicitly prevented by your content blocker.

The badge count on the icon will show "5" — the allowed count. Opening the popup reveals which domains were involved, separated into their outcome categories, enabling you to investigate further or adjust your content blocker settings accordingly.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open uBO Scope Popup">
Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to view connection details for the active tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Domains by Outcome">
Domains are grouped into "not blocked", "stealth-blocked", and "blocked" sections.
</Step>
<Step title="Investigate Suspicious Third Parties">
Spot check domains unfamiliar to you or frequently appearing in the stealth-blocked list.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices & Tips

- Regularly monitor the badge count to keep awareness of how many third-party servers your browsing activities involve.
- Use the detailed popup to distinguish between essential third-party CDNs and potentially risky or unwanted connections.
- Understand that the presence of stealth-blocked domains means your blocker is actively protecting you without disrupting webpage functions.
- Integrate uBO Scope insights with your regular content blocker configurations for balanced privacy and usability.

<Warning>
Do not rely solely on block counts shown by content blockers to assess privacy; focus on the distinct allowed third-party connections as shown by uBO Scope's badge count.
</Warning>
