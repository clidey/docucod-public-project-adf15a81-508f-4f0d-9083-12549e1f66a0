## Understanding the Target Audience

uBO Scope is designed for users who prioritize knowing exactly which remote servers their browser communicates with, beyond what standard content blockers reveal. This focus positions it as an indispensable companion for individuals and professionals serious about privacy, security, and content filtering integrity.

### 1. Privacy Advocates

For those who diligently guard their online privacy, uBO Scope provides an unfiltered lens into all third-party connections initiated by web pages, regardless of any content blockers or DNS filters in place. It empowers users to:

- Identify unexpected or hidden connections to third-party domains.
- Validate that their privacy controls are working effectively.
- Gain peace of mind by knowing what data paths are open from their browser.

**Scenario:** A privacy-conscious user notices a new third-party domain connection while visiting a familiar website. Using uBO Scope, they can identify and assess this connection’s legitimacy, making informed decisions about blocking or allowing it.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers

Lists that block advertisements and trackers require constant updating and validation. Filter list maintainers benefit from uBO Scope as it:

- Reports all remote server connection attempts, even those blocked stealthily.
- Provides a detailed count and enumeration of third-party domains, helping refine rules.
- Works on browsers or devices with limited access to standard developer tools.

**Scenario:** A filter maintainer uses uBO Scope to monitor real-world browsing sessions, quickly spotting new third-party connections missed by existing filters, enabling rapid updates to their lists.

### 3. Users Demanding Transparency Over Network Activity

Some users simply want to understand the true nature of network requests their browser makes. uBO Scope offers them:

- A transparent and real-time summary of all network requests attempted by websites.
- Clear categorization of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked requests.
- Insight into the effectiveness of their content blockers, independent of block counts or misleading badges.

**Scenario:** A web developer or curious user wants to verify if a content blocker is genuinely preventing connections or just hiding blocked requests. uBO Scope reveals the exact network activity for complete transparency.

## Why uBO Scope Adds Unique Value

Many network monitoring tools either restrict visibility based on the content blocker’s perspective or lack the ability to capture stealth blocking and DNS filtering effects. uBO Scope’s key differentiator is its comprehensive reporting of all connection attempts, categorized by outcome, which:

- Surpasses ordinary blockers by uncovering "stealth" blocked connections invisible to webpages.
- Helps debunk myths that block count indicates blocker reliability.
- Complements existing content blockers by providing a trustworthy view of third-party activity.

## Typical Use Cases

Here are specific scenarios showcasing how different users leverage uBO Scope:

### Evaluating Third-Party Connection Exposure

A user suspects excessive third-party tracking on a news website. Opening uBO Scope’s popup reveals all distinct third-party domains contacted, including those that were stealth-blocked. Armed with this data, the user can adjust their privacy settings or add filters to block undesired domains.

### Verifying Content Blocker Effectiveness

A filter list maintainer tests a new blocking rule on several websites. Using uBO Scope, they validate which connections are truly blocked versus those still allowed, even if the content blocker's badge suggests otherwise. This direct visibility avoids false assumptions.

### Gaining Transparency on Network Requests

A developer or security-conscious user browses a site known for embedded trackers. With uBO Scope, they instantly see a live count and listing of all connection attempts broken down by outcome. This information shines a light on what the browser is doing behind the scenes.
