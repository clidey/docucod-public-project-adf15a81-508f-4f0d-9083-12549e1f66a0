# What is uBO Scope?

## Shedding Light on Remote Connections for Privacy-Conscious Users

uBO Scope is a straightforward browser extension designed to reveal **all connections**, attempted or successful, to remote servers initiated by web pages you visit. It empowers users who care about privacy by transparently showing third-party network activity — no matter which content blocker or DNS setup you use.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Visibility into third-party connections**: Monitor exactly what external servers your browser is communicating with.
- **Complement existing blockers**: Works independently of your content blockers or DNS filters, reporting every network request that the browser sees.
- **Debunk common myths**: Helps clarify misunderstandings about ad blockers and their efficacy.
- **User-focused transparency**: Gives you a reliable count of distinct third-party connections, a deeper metric than mere block counts.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- Privacy enthusiasts wanting insight into third-party web communications.
- Filter list maintainers aiming to understand real network activity on devices with limited access to developer tools.
- Anyone curious about the actual network traffic their browser processes, beyond what a content blocker reports.

## Understanding uBO Scope: What It Is and What It Does

At its core, uBO Scope is a browser extension that listens to network requests made during your browsing sessions and categorizes their outcomes:

- **Allowed Connections:** Requests that successfully fetched resources.
- **Blocked Connections:** Requests that failed, signifying a likely block.
- **Stealth Blocked Connections:** Redirected requests that are stealthily blocked.

By utilizing the browser's `webRequest` APIs — available in Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers — uBO Scope captures network activity even when content blockers or DNS filters alter or silently block connections.

### Its Core Purpose

What problem does it solve? Content blockers often show metrics that can be misleading, especially based on block counts or artificial "ad blocker test" sites. uBO Scope cuts through these illusions by:

- **Highlighting the actual number of third-party servers contacted**, enabling you to measure the true breadth of third-party tracking.
- Reporting network requests **independently from blocking mechanisms**, so you see the real network events rather than filtered summaries.

### How uBO Scope Stands Out

- **Accurate third-party counting:** The badge icon shows the number of distinct third-party domains connected — a more meaningful privacy indicator than block counts.
- **Independence from blockers and DNS:** Works regardless of which content blocker or DNS rules you have active.
- **Myth-busting capabilities:** Challenges common misconceptions about ad blocker effectiveness and test sites designed to mimic blockers.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### 1. Comprehensive Network Request Reporting

uBO Scope monitors all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and Secure WebSocket (ws/wss) connections, reporting the fate of each network request as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

### 2. Real-Time Badge Indicator

The extension icon updates dynamically, showing you the **count of distinct third-party domains connected during your active tab session**. A lower count signals fewer third-party connections, a key metric for privacy vigilance.

### 3. Detailed Popup Panel Insights

Clicking the extension icon opens a popup showing:

- The hostname and registered domain of the active tab.
- Lists of third-party domains categorized by their connection outcome (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked), each paired with how many times they were contacted.

### 4. Robust Against Network Filtering Layers

uBO Scope reports network activity reliably even when content blockers employ stealth techniques or when DNS filtering silently blocks domains, as long as these network calls go through the browser’s `webRequest` API.

### 5. Designed for Filter List Maintainers

Helps filter list maintainers understand what third-party domains are active on sites, especially on devices without advanced dev tools.

> **Example Scenario:**
>
> You visit a news website with several embedded widgets and trackers. uBO Scope shows exactly which third-party domains the page tried to contact. Even if your content blocker blocked some resources stealthily, you can still see those redirect attempts, helping you decide if your filter list is comprehensive.

## Why Should You Care? Benefits and Use Cases

### Tangible Benefits

- **Transparency:** Gain unmatched visibility into the web’s third-party ecosystem as experienced in your browser.
- **Better privacy decisions:** Identify unexpected or excessive third-party connections slowing your browsing or invading your privacy.
- **Informed blocker assessment:** Avoid relying solely on block counts or unreliable test pages to measure ad blocker effectiveness.
- **Simple, actionable insights:** Understand at a glance which remote domains are active and how often, helping you tailor your privacy tools.

### Common Use Cases

1. **Verify real-world exposure to third-party domains** while browsing favorite websites.
2. **Evaluate content blockers in terms of domains contacted, not just block counts.**
3. **Assist filter list maintainers to discover active third-party domains across websites.**
4. **Educate users about stealth blocking and redirect behaviors on modern content blockers.**

### Before and After uBO Scope

| Without uBO Scope                             | With uBO Scope                                          |
| --------------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Blind reliance on block counts and test pages | Clear insight into distinct third-party connections.    |
| Uncertainty about stealth-blocked requests  | Visibility into stealth-blocked and blocked requests.  |
| Guesswork around privacy outcomes            | Accurate network monitoring independent of blockers.   |

### Measuring Your Privacy ROI

By tracking distinct third-party domains rather than mere counts, uBO Scope can help you quantify:

- Reduction in third-party connections after enabling blockers.
- Domains that still connect despite blockers, guiding further filter refinement.
- Eliminate false confidence from inflated block counters.

## Getting Started Preview

### Quick Start

Install uBO Scope from your browser’s extension store (available for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari). Once installed, just browse as usual. The extension icon alerts you to the number of third-party domains contacted on each tab.

Click the icon to open the popup panel for detailed domain connection information.

### Prerequisites

- Modern browsers supporting extension `webRequest` API (Chromium-based browsers version 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).

## Tips and Best Practices

- Remember that a **lower badge count means better privacy protection**; it reflects fewer distinct third-party domains connecting.
- Don't rely solely on block counts shown by other content blockers; use uBO Scope to see the actual domains contacted.
- Use uBO Scope in conjunction with your content blocker to refine your filter lists based on real-world network activity.
- Avoid "ad blocker test" sites claiming to evaluate blocker effectiveness — uBO Scope offers a more reliable metric.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If the badge count does not update as expected, ensure your browser supports the required `webRequest` API.
- Network requests made outside browser API visibility (native apps or some DNS-based blocking) may not be reported.
- In case of no data on the popup, try refreshing the tab or reinstalling the extension.

By illuminating the often invisible landscape of network connections, uBO Scope empowers you to regain control and awareness of third-party activity your browser experiences every day.

<Callout type="Note">
The extension’s badge count is never a count of blocked connections; it counts distinct third-party domains actually connected to. This design helps you focus on real network exposure rather than misleading block number metrics.
