# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Discover if uBO Scope is the right tool for your needs by understanding exactly who benefits most from its unique visibility into browser network connections. Whether protecting your privacy, maintaining content filters, or evaluating content blockers, uBO Scope offers insightful transparency into browser traffic across platforms.

## Empowering Privacy-Conscious Users

If your priority is **privacy**, uBO Scope puts you in full control by revealing every third-party server your browser attempts to connect to. This extended transparency helps answer crucial questions like:

- Which external servers see my browsing activity?
- How many unique third-party domains does a webpage contact?
- Are my browser’s content blockers effectively blocking unwanted connections?

By showing not just blocked traffic but also allowed and stealth-blocked connections, uBO Scope provides a **complete and objective picture** of your actual browser network activity — no guesswork, no reliance on misleading ad-blocker tests.


## Essential for Filter Maintainers and Content Blocking Experts

Filter list maintainers and content blocker evaluators will find uBO Scope indispensable for:

- Understanding real-world network connections and verifying filter effectiveness.
- Testing content blockers across different browsers and platforms with consistent data.
- Detecting stealth blocking behaviors that typical test pages fail to reveal.

Because uBO Scope reports **actual network request outcomes directly from browser webRequest APIs**, it enables filter maintainers to identify edge cases and ensure filter lists block undesired servers comprehensively.


## Valuable for Objective Browser Traffic Analysis Across Browsers

Whether you’re a power user, researcher, or developer interested in:

- Comparing third-party contact patterns across various browsers and extensions.
- Investigating network behaviors on restricted or limited access devices where traditional developer tools are unavailable.
- Monitoring for unexpected or hidden network activity that might impact security or performance.

uBO Scope serves as a lightweight, reliable observer of browser network events, regardless of which content blocking solution is in place.


## Common Users Who Benefit from uBO Scope

- **Privacy enthusiasts** who want full transparency on third-party connections in real-time.
- **Filter list developers and testers** needing cross-platform validation of network requests.
- **Security analysts** investigating potential trackers or malicious connections.
- **Web developers and QA teams** seeking insights into third-party resource loading and blocking behavior.
- **Anyone skeptical of conventional adblock counting metrics or ad blocker test pages.**

## Practical Scenario

Imagine you visit a news website that looks clean and private but wonder if hidden trackers or other domains are quietly accessed in the background. Upon clicking the uBO Scope toolbar badge, you see a precise count of distinct third-party domains contacted. The detailed popup then lays out which domains were allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked — providing the actionable insight you need to decide whether to tighten your filters or investigate further.

This experience is seamless in any supported browser, backed by real network data rather than artificial benchmarks.
