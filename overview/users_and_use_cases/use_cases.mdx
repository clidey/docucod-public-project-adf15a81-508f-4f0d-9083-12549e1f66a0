# Typical Use Cases for uBO Scope

Discover how uBO Scope fits seamlessly into real-world scenarios and workflows, empowering you with unprecedented transparency into your browser’s remote server connections. This page presents practical applications that illustrate why understanding your browser’s network behavior matters — from assessing content blockers to enhancing filter list maintenance on devices with limited browser tooling.

## 1. Comparing Content Blockers with Real Network Data

You want to know which content blocker truly minimizes third-party server connections, but common metrics can be misleading.

- Many content blockers boast high block counts, yet a higher block count often means your browser contacts *more* third-party servers — the opposite of what you want.
- uBO Scope cuts through this confusion by showing the **number of distinct third-party domains actually connected** per tab.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your blockers to get an **objective, consistent measurement** of network connections across different products.

> Instead of relying on raw blocked requests, focus on the distinct remote servers allowed by the blocker, as reported by uBO Scope’s toolbar badge and popup.

### Workflow Example

1. Enable multiple content blockers separately.
2. Browse a selected website.
3. Open uBO Scope popup to view distinct third-party connections.
4. Compare badge counts and domain listings across blockers.
5. Make an informed decision based on actual network exposure, not just block counts.

## 2. Debunking Unreliable Ad Blocker Test Sites

You've probably seen test webpages claiming to evaluate ad blockers by artificially loading resources.

- uBO Scope reveals that many such test sites create unrealistic network requests that do not reflect actual browsing.
- These sites cannot reliably detect stealthy or advanced blocking methods used by modern content blockers.
- Using uBO Scope, you see the **real network behavior during normal browsing** rather than fabricated benchmarks.

### Practical Tip

Avoid relying on any ad blocker test site as your sole source of evaluation. Let uBO Scope guide you by reporting real connection attempts and outcomes under your typical browsing conditions.

## 3. Supporting Filter List Maintainers on Limited Devices

Maintaining and tuning filter lists often requires granular traffic insights.

- On devices where developer tools are not accessible or limited, uBO Scope offers a lightweight way to inspect network requests.
- Filter maintainers can leverage the detailed domain-level breakdowns (allowed, blocked, stealth) to quickly identify third-party domains involved.
- This helps prioritize filter updates or troubleshoot filtering rules without deep external tooling.

### Scenario

1. Use uBO Scope on locked-down or mobile browsers.
2. Access the popup to review connected third-party domains per browsing session.
3. Identify domains that frequently evade blocking or are stealth-blocked.
4. Refine filter lists accordingly and validate effectiveness.

## 4. Monitoring Privacy and Security in Everyday Browsing

Beyond technical uses, many users simply want peace of mind.

- uBO Scope puts privacy in your hands by making third-party network connections visible at a glance.
- The badge count acts as a clear **indicator of exposure to external servers**, helping you stay aware of possible tracking or resource loading.
- Viewing domain lists allows you to familiarize yourself with common CDNs and assess surprises.

### Best Practices

- Regularly check uBO Scope while visiting new or suspicious sites.
- Use the domain outcome categories (allowed, blocked, stealth) to understand where connections succeed or fail.
- Combine insights with your content blocker settings to optimize privacy.

## 5. Educating on Content Blocker Metrics and Network Outcomes

For both users and developers, understanding network outcomes is crucial.

- uBO Scope serves as a teaching tool, exposing the reality behind traffic counting, blocking, and stealth blocking.
- By observing the extension’s reporting, you gain insight into the nuances of network request lifecycles and content blocker influence.
- This supports deeper comprehension that cannot be gained from simplistic metrics alone.

## Summary

| Typical Use Case | Benefit |
|---|---|
| Comparing Blockers | Objective, domain-based measurement rather than block counts |
| Debunking Test Sites | See real browsing network behavior instead of synthetic tests |
| Filter List Maintenance | Lightweight network visibility on limited devices |
| Privacy Awareness | Understand and control third-party network exposure |
| Education | Learn actual network request outcomes and filtering categories |
