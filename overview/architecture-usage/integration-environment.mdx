# Integration & Environment Support

## Ensuring Seamless Compatibility Across Browsers and Blocking Systems

uBO Scope is designed as a versatile and reliable companion extension that fits smoothly into your browsing environment. This page details the supported browsers, explains how uBO Scope works alongside various content blockers and system-level DNS tools, and clarifies its independence from other blocking solutions.

---

## Supported Browsers and Environment Requirements

uBO Scope supports the latest major desktop browsers that fully implement the WebExtensions API, ensuring consistent and reliable performance:

- **Chromium-Based Browsers**: Google Chrome (version 122.0 and above), Microsoft Edge, and other Chromium forks.
- **Mozilla Firefox** (version 128.0 and above), including Firefox for Android.
- **Safari** (version 18.5 and above).

Each browser-specific build includes the manifest and background scripts tailored to the respective environment:

- **Chromium** uses a service worker background script.
- **Firefox and Safari** use module-based background scripts.

This careful targeting ensures uBO Scope leverages native browser capabilities such as the `webRequest` API for accurate network monitoring.

Minimum version requirements for each browser guarantee support for essential APIs like `webRequest` and `storage`, which uBO Scope depends on for optimal function.

## How uBO Scope Integrates with Various Blocking Systems

### Independence from Content Blockers

One of uBO Scope's core strengths is its independence. It passively monitors network requests through standard browser APIs, without interfering or competing with content blockers such as uBlock Origin, AdGuard, or others.

- It **does not perform any blocking itself**.
- It **relies solely on browser-provided network request information**.
- It tracks the connection outcomes regardless of whether another blocker allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked a request.

This means uBO Scope can be installed alongside any content blocker or filtering system to provide transparency into actual network connections.

### Compatibility with Content Blockers

Because uBO Scope uses the browser's `webRequest` API and listening mechanisms:

- It captures all network requests reported by the browser, including those affected by extension-based blockers.
- It properly classes connections as **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked** according to the final observed outcome.

For example, if uBlock Origin stealth-blocks a request, uBO Scope will log it as stealth-blocked, giving you clear, actionable insight into what happened under the hood.

### Working with System-Level DNS and Network Blocking Tools

Beyond extension-based content blockers, some users utilize system-wide DNS filtering or hosts file modifications to block unwanted connections.

- uBO Scope **still reports network request outcomes accurately as long as the browser forwards network request data via the `webRequest` API**.
- It monitors connection attempts reported by the browser, including DNS failures or blocked DNS lookups.

However, if network requests are blocked or modified **outside the browser's visibility** (for example by VPNs or firewalls that do not expose blocking events to the browser), uBO Scope cannot detect these, as it does not operate at the system level.

<Note>
This means that while uBO Scope can track a vast majority of real-world blocking scenarios, certain OS- or network-level blocks remain invisible to it if they bypass the browser's reporting mechanisms.

## Summary

| Browser    | Minimum Version | Special Notes                  |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Chrome     | 122.0           | Uses Manifest V3 service worker background script
| Firefox    | 128.0           | Supports `webRequest` fully, including Firefox Android
| Safari     | 18.5            | Uses module script background


## Practical Benefits for Users

- **Cross-Browser Transparency:** Your monitoring stays consistent whether you switch browsers or use multiple.
- **Non-Intrusive:** uBO Scope never conflicts with your existing content blockers or DNS filters.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** See real connection outcomes regardless of which blocking system is active.

---

## Common Scenarios and Best Practices

- If you notice discrepancies between what uBO Scope reports and what your content blocker UI shows, consider that stealth blocking may be involved or that your blocking tool uses complex heuristics.
- When troubleshooting missing connections or unexpected blocks, verify whether network filters operate outside the browser, as these won't be visible to uBO Scope.
- Regularly update your browser to meet minimum version requirements to maintain full compatibility and accurate reporting.
