# uBO Scope in Action: Feature Overview

Discover how uBO Scope puts powerful insights right at your fingertips, helping you understand the third-party connections your browser encounters in real time. This page shows you what you can do with the extension’s core features: tracking badge counts that reflect unique third-party servers connected, examining detailed breakdowns of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections, and appreciating its seamless cross-browser compatibility.

## At a Glance: What Can You Do with uBO Scope?

- **Real-Time Badge Counts:** The badge on the browser toolbar icon displays the number of unique third-party domains that your active tab connects to. This count empowers you to instantly gauge the level of third-party exposure — the lower the count, the more privacy you maintain.

- **Connection Breakdown:** Open the popup panel to dive deep into three distinct categories:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains that the browser has successfully connected to.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were stealthily blocked (e.g., through redirects or filter evasion techniques).
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts failed due to content blocking.

- **Domain-Centric Display:** The extension groups network activity by domain (using an advanced public suffix list), making it easier to spot major third-party entities at a glance.

- **Clear Counters and Lists:** For each category, view the list of domains alongside how many connection attempts were made, helping you identify persistent third parties or aggressive trackers.

- **Cross-Browser Support:** Compatible across major browsers including Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari, ensuring consistent experience regardless of your browsing environment.

## How It Works: From Badge to Deep Insight

When visiting a website, your browser often interacts with various third-party servers — some necessary, some tracking, some blocked by your chosen content blockers. uBO Scope reveals this invisible web.

The badge count on the toolbar represents the distinct count of third-party domains the current tab has connected to without being blocked. This information is kept up-to-date by monitoring network events and aggregating connection outcomes.

Opening the popup panel transforms raw data into meaningful insight, showing all connections made by the active tab, sorted into the three categories. It displays domain names in a user-friendly punycode-decoded format, accompanied by counts of respective connections.

**Example scenario:**

You visit news.example.com, and the badge shows "5". Clicking the icon, you open the popup and see:

- **Not Blocked:** cdn.examplecdn.net (10 connections), images.cdn.net (7 connections)
- **Stealth Blocked:** tracking.adnetwork.com (3 connections)
- **Blocked:** ads.banners.com (8 connections)

This immediately reveals which third parties are silently loading resources and which have been blocked, offering clarity on your browsing privacy posture.

## Practical Tips for Leveraging uBO Scope

- **Use Badge Counts to Detect Privacy Risks:** A sudden spike in the badge count may indicate that a site is loading more third-party content than expected, alerting you to investigate further.

- **Review the Popup for Persistent Trackers:** Domains appearing repeatedly under "Not Blocked" or "Stealth-Blocked" might warrant customizing your content blocker or filter lists.

- **Cross-Reference with Content Blockers:** uBO Scope complements other content blockers by exposing what actually happens at the network level—sometimes revealing unexpected third-party connections that blockers may miss.

- **Understand “Stealth-Blocked”:** This category highlights connections blocked in ways that may evade standard detection—critical information for filter list maintainers.

- **Browser Differences:** Although the extension supports multiple browsers, keep in mind browser-specific networking behaviors might affect what is reported.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **No Badge or Data Appears:** Ensure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions and that your browser version is supported (e.g., Safari 18.5 or later). Also verify that webRequest API access is enabled.

- **Counts Seem High or Unexpected:** Remember the badge counts distinct third-party domains, not the number of blocked requests. Sites with many legitimate third-party services (like CDNs) will have naturally higher counts.

- **Stealth Blocked Domains May Be Confusing:** These are typically connections that were redirected or blocked quietly by filters — consult the Core Concepts & Terminology page for deeper understanding.

- **Popup UI Not Updating:** Reload the extension or browser tab if network events are not reflected. Cached or stale session data might delay updates.
