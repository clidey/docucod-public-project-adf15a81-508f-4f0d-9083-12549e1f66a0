# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Discover why uBO Scope is an essential tool tailored for diverse audiences who want clear visibility into the network activity of their browsers and webpages. Whether you are a privacy advocate keen on monitoring third-party connections, a filter list maintainer looking for accurate data, a developer seeking transparency into network requests, or a regular user curious about what servers a website interacts with, uBO Scope provides practical insight that fits your needs.

## Target Audience Overview

### Privacy Advocates

If you care about protecting your online privacy, understanding exactly which third-party servers your browser connects to is critical. uBO Scope offers a straightforward way to see all remote connections attempted or completed by webpages, regardless of content blocking in place. By clearly revealing the number of unique third-party servers contacted, uBO Scope empowers you to assess how much exposure your browsing has to external services and track any unexpected or stealthy connections.

### Filter List Maintainers and Extension Developers

For maintainers of content blocking filter lists or developers refining privacy tools, uBO Scope is indispensable. It captures network request outcomes (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked) across browser tabs with real-time updates and categorization. This visibility supports serious analysis beyond common block count myths and fabricated ad blocker tests. When traditional browser developer tools or network inspection is unavailable or limited, uBO Scope remains a reliable source of actionable data to diagnose and fine-tune blocking strategies.

### Developers and Security Professionals

Developers and security experts who require a clear picture of webpage network behavior can benefit from uBO Scope’s unobtrusive, detailed insights. It helps verify network request success, redirects, errors, and stealth blocking events alongside presenting clear domain-level summaries. Armed with this data, you can audit, debug, and optimize how your web applications interact with external servers, or evaluate security posture concerning third-party dependencies.

### Curious Regular Users

Even if you are not an expert, uBO Scope helps demystify what happens behind the scenes when you visit websites. It translates complex network activities into simple counts and domain lists, showing you in an easy-to-understand popup how many and which external domains your browser interacts with. If you notice unexpectedly high counts or unfamiliar domains, this extension can trigger awareness and encourage better privacy habits.

## Special Environments Where uBO Scope Shines

- **Restricted Browser Tools**: In environments where access to full browser developer tools is limited or locked down (such as managed devices or restricted user profiles), uBO Scope provides a lightweight but powerful alternative to gain transparency on network requests.

- **Cross-Browser Support**: Designed to work consistently across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) using their respective `webRequest` APIs, uBO Scope offers reliable insight no matter your browsing platform.

- **Content-Blocker Agnostic**: Regardless of which content blocker or proxy methods you use, uBO Scope reads network request outcomes independently, helping you evaluate blockers objectively.

## Why Should You Care?

- **Accurate Transparency**: See distinct third-party domains contacted, not just aggregated block counts that can be misleading.
- **Stealth Blocking Awareness**: Identify when requests are silently redirected or blocked, actions that often evade detection by websites and other tools.
- **Empowered Decision-Making**: Use real data to adjust privacy settings, filter rules, or simply understand your browsing footprint.

## Realistic User Scenario

Imagine you're a privacy-conscious user who suspects that a website loads resources from many third parties. Using uBO Scope, you open the popup to see a clear count of connected domains, separated into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories. Instantly, you identify unexpected third-party domains contacting your browser and can decide to tighten blocking rules or investigate further.

For filter list maintainers, when testing new rules, uBO Scope lets you observe connections in real-time and confirm whether your blocks behave as intended, beyond just the raw block count, reducing guesswork and improving filter quality.

## Practical Tips

- Use uBO Scope alongside your existing content blocker for complementary visibility.
- Monitor the badge count on your toolbar—it represents unique third-party domains contacted, a critical privacy indicator.
- Remember that not all third parties are malicious; some are essential services like CDNs.
- Check for stealth-blocked connections in the popup to catch subtle network behaviors.

## Getting Started

If you're ready to explore uBO Scope, start by installing it from your browser’s extension store (see [Supported Browsers & System Requirements](../getting-started/installation-and-setup/supported-platforms)). Once installed, click the toolbar icon to open the popup and immediately see your current tab’s network connection summary. For step-by-step guidance, refer to [Installing uBO Scope](../getting-started/installation-and-setup/installation) and [Understanding the Toolbar Badge & Popup](../guides/getting-started-with-ubo-scope/understanding-badge-and-popup).
