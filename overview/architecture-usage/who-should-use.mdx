# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

## Unlocking Transparency for Privacy-Conscious Users, Filter List Maintainers, and Content Blocker Evaluators

uBO Scope is a powerful and straightforward browser extension designed to lift the veil on all network connections initiated by your browser tabs. This page guides you through who benefits most from using uBO Scope and how it fits into your privacy and content-blocking workflow.

## Target Users

### 1. Privacy-Focused Users
If you care deeply about online privacy, uBO Scope gives you a clear window into exactly which third-party servers your browser connects to—whether or not your existing content blockers intervene. By identifying allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains on an active tab, it enables you to:

- Pinpoint and minimize your exposure to unwanted trackers.
- Understand the true extent of third-party network activity on any website.
- Make informed decisions about which content blockers or privacy measures to rely on.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers
Maintaining high-quality content-blocking filter lists requires real-world data on network connections and request outcomes. uBO Scope serves as an indispensable diagnostic tool providing:

- Accurate, per-tab insight into what third-party domains are contacted.
- Categorization into allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked requests.
- A means to audit websites on devices or environments where built-in developer tools or advanced browser features are unavailable.

This empowers maintainers to better tailor filter lists for effectiveness without overblocking.

### 3. Content Blocker Evaluators & Researchers
Evaluating the performance and reliability of content blockers can be misleading if relying on superficial metrics. uBO Scope helps by:

- Showing actual third-party network connections, not just superficial block counts.
- Debunking myths around block count equating to superior protection.
- Providing transparency on stealth blocking — connections blocked or redirected in ways invisible to typical webpage detection.

By focusing on network outcomes rather than facade metrics, users can make evidence-backed assessments.

## Typical Use Cases

### Auditing Website Behavior
Observe all remote connections a webpage attempts or successfully makes. This helps you understand what third-party services are active, beyond what is reported by your content blocker’s interface or browser dev tools.

### Debunking Ad Blocker Myths
Test claims about blocker performance honestly. For instance, a blocker claiming a higher block count might still expose you to more third-party servers. uBO Scope exposes such nuances.

### Supporting Privacy Decisions Where Tools Are Limited
On restricted devices or browsers with poor developer support, uBO Scope stands as a lightweight companion extension that reveals network activity details critical to making privacy choices.

## How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Workflow

1. **Install and Activate**
   Quickly add the extension to your supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

2. **Navigate to a Website**
   Browse normally; uBO Scope passively records network connections.

3. **Open uBO Scope Popup**
   Click the toolbar icon to reveal a categorized list:

    - **Not Blocked:** Connections allowed by your content blocker.
    - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections blocked with no direct traceable error but prevented through redirects or stealth means.
    - **Blocked:** Connections outright blocked and reported by the content blocker.

4. **Analyze Third-Parties**
   Review domain counts and presence to infer risk exposure or filter effectiveness.

5. **Take Action Based On Insights**
   Adjust filters, blocker settings, or browsing habits informed by uBO Scope’s transparent data.

## Best Practices for Maximizing Value

- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker rather than as a replacement — it complements by revealing network traffic.
- Consider the badge count as a meaningful privacy metric: fewer distinct allowed third-party connections indicate a stronger privacy stance.
- Use the categorized views to differentiate potentially harmless CDNs from suspicious third-party domains.
- Regularly audit privacy policies of third parties you see often to assess trustworthiness.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t equate higher block counts on other blockers to better privacy without verifying third-party exposure.
- Avoid relying on 'ad blocker test' sites to measure effectiveness; these often use unrealistic or fabricated network requests.
- Understand that network requests invisible to the browser’s `webRequest` API won’t appear, so uBO Scope’s data reflects the API’s coverage.

---

## Conclusion
Whether you are a privacy advocate, a filter list maintainer, or someone looking to demystify content blocker claims, uBO Scope provides indispensable clarity on the true nature of your browser’s network interactions. This enables smarter, evidence-based privacy and filtering decisions.

## Example Scenario

Imagine you're visiting a new news website. You suspect it might load multiple third-party trackers and data collectors, but your current blocker doesn't clarify what's allowed or stealth-blocked. Opening uBO Scope’s popup reveals:

- 3 domains categorized as "not blocked" (allowed), representing CDNs the site uses legitimately.
- 5 domains listed under "stealth-blocked," indicating trackers silently blocked.
- 7 domains under "blocked," explicitly filtered out.

This insight empowers you to make privacy choices confidently — either trusting your current blocker or adjusting filters to tighten control.

<Tip>
Remember, the badge on the toolbar icon counts allowed third-party domains per tab, serving as a quick privacy health indicator.

<Warning>
uBO Scope depends on the browser's webRequest API to monitor traffic. Network activity outside this scope won't be visible.
