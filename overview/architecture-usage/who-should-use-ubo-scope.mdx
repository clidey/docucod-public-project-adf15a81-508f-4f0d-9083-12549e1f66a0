# Target Audience & Use Cases

## Understanding Who Benefits Most from uBO Scope

uBO Scope is purpose-built to serve distinctive user groups who prioritize transparency and accuracy in understanding their browser's network behavior. By revealing the real connections your browser attempts or successfully makes with remote servers, uBO Scope empowers users to make informed decisions about privacy and security.

### Primary User Groups

- **Privacy-Conscious Users**  
  Individuals who actively seek visibility into the third-party domains their browser communicates with. These users leverage uBO Scope to identify and minimize unwanted tracking and improve their privacy posture by monitoring the exact number of distinct third-party remote servers connected during browsing.

- **Filter List Maintainers**  
  Creators and maintainers of content blocking filter lists rely on uBO Scope as a practical tool to verify how their filters perform in real-world scenarios. It provides insight into which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, assisting in refining lists where access to browser developer tools may be limited.

- **Technical Evaluators & Content Blocker Researchers**  
  Experts or enthusiasts who compare and analyze content blockers can use uBO Scope to debunk misconceptions based on block counts or misleading test results. It provides a deeper, more accurate understanding of network requests beyond simple block tally metrics.


## Real-World Scenarios Where uBO Scope Excels

### 1. Verifying Third-Party Connections Beyond Block Counts

Most content blockers display a "block count" indicating how many requests they have stopped. However, this number often misrepresents actual privacy protection:

- A **higher block count does NOT guarantee better blocking**; it can correlate with more allowed connections to diverse third-party servers.
- uBO Scope surfaces the **number of distinct third-party domains with which your browser connected**, giving meaningful, transparent insight into your real exposure.

**Benefit:** Users can evaluate their extensions based on meaningful network activity rather than misleading metrics.

### 2. Distinguishing between Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked Requests

uBO Scope categorizes connections into three outcomes:

- **Allowed:** The connection was successful and unimpeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests redirected or modified in a stealthy manner to avoid detection but effectively blocked.
- **Blocked:** Requests that were explicitly denied.

This differentiation helps users and filter list maintainers understand not just what was blocked but also subtle behaviors of content blockers in handling requests.

### 3. Making Informed Privacy Decisions on Third-Party Resource Loading

Since not all third-party connections are harmful—legitimate services like CDNs often involve third-party domains—uBO Scope helps users:

- Identify which distinct third-party domains a webpage connects to.
- Decide whether these connections are expected or potentially intrusive.
- Compare different blocking setups to understand which filters effectively restrict unwanted third parties.

### 4. Debunking Misleading "Ad Blocker Tests" and Metrics

Many webpages simulate fake ad requests to detect or test ad blockers. These tests:

- Often generate unrealistic network requests to domains unused by real sites.
- Fail to detect stealth blocking behaviors preferred by advanced content blockers.

uBO Scope transparently exposes actual network request outcomes based on browser-reported data, helping users avoid reliance on misleading test pages.

### 5. Supporting Filter List Maintenance on Limited Devices

Not all devices support rich browser developer tools. For filter list maintainers working on mobile or restricted environments, uBO Scope:

- Provides accessible, actionable insights into which domains are blocked or allowed per browsing session.
- Offers data to refine filters without deep technical overhead.


## Before and After: User Experience with uBO Scope

| Without uBO Scope | With uBO Scope |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Users see block counts that are confusing and misleading. | Users see the true number of distinct third-party domains connected, offering clear privacy transparency. |
| Misleading ad blocker test pages skew user perception. | Real network request data offers a factual baseline for content blocking performance. |
| Filter list maintainers lack accessible tools on constrained devices. | Maintainers get precise domain outcome breakdowns right in the browser extension popup. |


## Why Should You Care?

**uBO Scope transforms network request data from abstract numbers into transparent, interpretable insights.** Whether you are protecting your privacy, refining filter lists, or evaluating blockers, this extension is the keystone for understanding the true network footprint of your browsing.


## Practical Tips for Getting the Most Out of uBO Scope

- Pay attention to the **badge count** on the toolbar icon; a lower count means fewer third-party connections.
- Use the extension popup to explore allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domain lists.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with your preferred content blocker to fine-tune filter settings.
- Avoid trusting ad blocker test pages; trust the real-time data uBO Scope reports.


## Summary

uBO Scope empowers users to:

- Accurately measure distinct third-party remote server connections.
- Distinguish outcomes of network requests in an accessible UI.
- Make informed privacy and filter list maintenance decisions.

By focusing on transparency and real network data, uBO Scope fills a critical gap left by traditional content blockers and ephemeral metrics.
