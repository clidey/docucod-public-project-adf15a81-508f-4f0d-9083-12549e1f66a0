# Target Audience & Primary Use Cases

## Understanding Who Benefits from uBO Scope

uBO Scope is designed with a focused user base in mind—individuals who demand clarity and control over their web browsing privacy and security. It shines as a tool that breaks down the complexity behind seemingly invisible network connections, making it highly valuable for:

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Those who want to understand exactly which third-party servers their browsers connect to, beyond what traditional blockers reveal.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Experts who curate and refine content blocking lists need precise, reliable data on connection attempts to improve and verify their filters.
- **Users of Content Blockers Seeking Transparency:** People using ad blockers or privacy extensions who want additional, independent verification of what connections are genuinely blocked or allowed.
- **Browsers with Limited Native Tools:** On platforms with restricted development tools (e.g., mobile or certain browsers), uBO Scope fills the gap by delivering detailed connection insights.

## Real-World Scenarios Demonstrating uBO Scope’s Value

### 1. Verifying Connection Transparency
Imagine you suspect your content blocker is not catching all third-party data requests. With uBO Scope active, you get a straightforward count of distinct remote third-party servers contacted per tab. This lets you confirm if your blocker allows connections that it shouldn’t or if multiple connections are sneaking through unnoticed.

**Example:** On a news website, you notice plenty of ads visually blocked, but uBO Scope reveals connections to additional ad servers not fully blocked. This insight lets you adjust your filter lists or blocking settings accordingly.

### 2. Monitoring Browser Privacy Over Time
Privacy enthusiasts want to track how their browsing habits expose them to tracking or unwanted data sharing. uBO Scope aggregates and categorizes network connection results per browser tab, allowing users to see which domains connections succeed, silently fail (stealth block), or get fully blocked.

**Example:** After visiting a social media page, the extension’s popup shows not just the domains that loaded but also those stealth-blocked or blocked outright, painting a complete picture of third-party reach.

### 3. Validating Filter Effectiveness on Browsers With Limited Tools
Certain environments lack advanced developer consoles or network tab access. Here, uBO Scope serves as a lightweight diagnostic tool that reveals all outgoing connections independently from browser UI constraints.

**Example:** On a mobile browser or in corporate setups where traditional developer tools are disabled, filter list maintainers and users rely on uBO Scope to audit connection attempts, collecting actionable data without needing full devtools access.

### 4. Debunking Misleading Metrics
Beyond basic use cases, uBO Scope helps dispel misconceptions tied to common privacy tools.

- **Block Count vs Connection Count:** Instead of focusing on block counts reported by blockers (which can be misleading), uBO Scope emphasizes the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected. This metric directly correlates with user exposure and privacy.
- **Avoiding Fake Ad Blocker Tests:** It also clarifies that many 'ad blocker test' sites don’t provide reliable data because they simulate unnatural network activity not reflective of real browsing.

## How Users Benefit from These Use Cases

- **Empowered Decision-Making:** Easily identify which third-party domains your browser interacts with, empowering you to adjust blocking strategies.
- **Improved Filter Quality:** Filter list maintainers receive actionable data to maintain lists accurately and confidently.
- **Enhanced Privacy Awareness:** Real-time visibility into connection outcomes fosters smarter browsing behavior.
- **Accessible Diagnostics:** Provides critical insights on any supported browser regardless of native tooling limitations.

## Best Practices for Using uBO Scope in These Contexts

- Regularly check the badge count and popup to monitor current tab connections.
- Use the detailed domain lists (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked) to identify suspicious or unexpected third parties.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with your primary content blocker to verify and enhance blocking effectiveness.
- Consider uBO Scope as a verification tool rather than a replacement blocker; it’s about measurement, not intervention.

## Troubleshooting Common Challenges

- **Badge Count Does Not Update:** Ensure uBO Scope is enabled and has necessary permissions; the extension relies on `webRequest` API which must be supported by your browser.
- **No Data on Tab:** Some network requests might occur outside the `webRequest` API scope; private browsing or certain browser optimizations can limit visibility.
- **Unexpected High Counts:** Remember legitimate services like CDNs may increase domain counts; use the categorized lists to differentiate.
