# Feature Overview at a Glance

Discover the essential features that make uBO Scope your go-to extension for transparent insight into your browser's network connections. This page gives a sharp, straightforward view of uBO Scope’s key functionalities so you can quickly understand its value and start monitoring your third-party connections effectively.

## uBO Scope in a Nutshell

uBO Scope reveals every attempted or successful connection your browser makes to third-party remote servers, categorizing them in real time to paint an accurate picture of your network exposure. Its prominent features—such as the toolbar badge count, detailed per-tab connection stats, and compatibility across content blockers—are designed to empower your privacy decisions with clarity and precision.

## Key Features at a Glance

- **Toolbar Badge with Real-Time Count**  
  The badge on the browser toolbar icon dynamically shows the number of *distinct third-party domains* contacted by the active tab. This count updates live, providing immediate insight into your exposure and helping you identify tabs with unexpectedly high third-party connections.

- **Per-Tab Detailed Statistics**  
  When you open the popup interface, uBO Scope breaks down connections for the current browser tab into three categories: `not blocked`, `stealth-blocked`, and `blocked`. Each category lists the domains contacted along with connection counts, letting you see exactly which servers are involved and how frequently.

- **Clear Outcome Categorization**  
  The extension distinguishes between allowed connections, stealth-blocked connections (those blocked invisibly by other mechanisms), and outright blocked connections. This nuanced view helps you understand not just if requests were blocked, but how and when.

- **Cross-Content-Blocker Compatibility**  
  uBO Scope monitors network requests at the browser level through the webRequest API, independent of the content blocker in use. Whether you run uBlock Origin, other blockers, or none at all, the extension captures real network events accurately—even when blocking is done via DNS or stealth methods.

- **Unicode-Friendly Domain Display**  
  Internationalized domain names (IDNs) are converted to readable Unicode, allowing you to easily recognize familiar or suspicious domains without grappling with encoded hostnames.

- **Lightweight and Responsive UI**  
  The popup interface renders connection information swiftly, utilizing a minimal and direct layout that focuses on actionable details. It adapts to viewport sizes for seamless usage across different screen widths.

## Real-World User Flow

1. **Monitor Your Tabs with Confidence**  
   Focused on privacy and performance, users glance at the toolbar badge to quickly assess third-party network activity for the tab they’re browsing.

2. **Dive Deeper Anytime**  
   Clicking the toolbar icon opens the popup. Here, users instantly identify which domains connected, what was blocked stealthily (showing potential hidden activity), and what was outright blocked.

3. **Make Informed Decisions**  
   With clear information on connection outcomes, users can fine-tune their blocking rules, verify filter list effectiveness, or detect potentially unwanted connections.

4. **Maintain Transparency Across Blockers**  
   Regardless of content blockers or DNS-level filters in place, confident users trust uBO Scope to provide consistent, accurate reporting.

## Practical Tips to Maximize Use

- Regularly check the badge count to identify unexpected spikes in third-party connections.
- Use the popup’s domain lists to investigate unfamiliar domains — lower counts often signal a leaner, safer browsing experience.
- Remember that not all third-party connections are harmful; select use of CDNs and legitimate services is typical.
- Leverage the distinction between stealth-blocked and blocked connections to understand how your content blocker or network is interacting with requests.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

- **Misinterpreting the Badge Count**  
  The badge counts distinct third-party domains with allowed connections, not total requests or blocked connections. A lower badge number means fewer distinct third-party servers were connected to, which is preferable for privacy.

- **Assuming Block Counts Indicate Better Blocking**  
  A higher block count (not shown directly here but relevant elsewhere) may coincide with more remote servers contacted, indicating less effective blocking. Focus on distinct allowed connections instead.

- **Ignoring Cross-Blocker Effects**  
  Since blocking can happen outside the browser extension (like DNS filtering), uBO Scope’s ability to see through these layers provides a more truthful picture—never rely solely on your content blocker’s UI.
