# Quick Feature Overview

Discover the essential features of uBO Scope in one place. This guide gives you a clear and concise insight into its session-based tracking system, domain categorization mechanisms, and the intuitive real-time popup UI and toolbar badge. Understand how network events translate into immediate user-facing data and why this streamlined workflow is both minimal and powerful.

## At a Glance: What uBO Scope Tracks

uBO Scope focuses on uncovering all remote connections initiated by webpages you visit. It organizes these connections per browser tab, giving you a detailed picture of third-party domains, categorized and counted as they occur within your browsing session.

### Session-Based Tracking
- **Per-Tab Isolation:** Each browser tab maintains its own session data, tracking domains contacted during its lifetime.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Connections are logged in real time, ensuring the most current status whenever you view the popup.
- **Persistence Within Session:** Data persists as long as the tab remains open, making it easy to monitor page activity.

This focused approach ensures that you see relevant data scoped cleanly to each tab, avoiding noise from other browsing sessions.

## Intelligent Domain Categorization

uBO Scope classifies each contacted domain into one of three clear categories, enabling rapid understanding of network behavior:

- **Allowed Domains:** These are domains that the browser connected to successfully without interference. They represent network requests that loaded normally.
- **Blocked Domains:** Domains that the browser attempted to connect to but were prevented due to errors or content blocking rules.
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains:** Special cases where redirects or stealth blocking techniques hide the actual connection outcome, tracked separately.

Every domain is counted by the number of connections observed, offering you quantitative insights into how much interaction each domain engages in.

### How It Works
Every network event—success, error, or redirect—is reviewed and appropriately categorized per tab. The use of the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) ensures accurate domain extraction, so you receive meaningful domain groupings rather than confusing hostnames.

## Real-Time Popup UI & Toolbar Badge

### Popup User Interface

When you click the uBO Scope extension icon, the popup displays a summary of domains connected by the active tab:

- **Hostname Header:** Shows the full hostname and the corresponding registered domain for context.
- **Summary Section:** Displays the total number of distinct domains involved in this tab's network activity.
- **Domain Lists by Category:** Each of the three domain categories (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked) is presented in its own section.
  - Domains are listed with counts indicating connection frequency.
  - Domains are shown using their Unicode (human-readable) names, thanks to punycode decoding.

This UI enables you to quickly spot which third parties are involved, whether they were blocked or allowed, and the degree of their activity.

### Toolbar Badge

The extension icon's badge reflects the count of distinct allowed domains for the active tab. This immediate, unobtrusive indicator helps you track network activity without opening the popup.

## Data Flow: From Network Events to User Insights

The real power of uBO Scope lies in its clean data pipeline:

1. **Network Event Capture:** The background service worker listens for all network requests (including redirects and errors).
2. **Session Update:** Requests are attributed to their respective tab sessions and categorized into allowed, blocked, or stealth.
3. **State Persistence:** Session data is saved and managed per tab to ensure consistency across UI views.
4. **User Presentation:** When asked, the popup fetches the processed data and renders it in an easy-to-read format with counts and domain grouping.
5. **Badge Update:** The badge count updates in near real-time to reflect the current state.

This smooth and efficient workflow prioritizes your immediate understanding of the network connections relevant to your browsing.

## What Sets This Workflow Apart?

- **Minimal Yet Powerful:** uBO Scope avoids overwhelming you with raw network logs. Instead, it distills connections into meaningful domain groupings and outcomes.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Combined popup and badge provide layered information access suited for both quick glances and detailed investigation.
- **Accurate Domain Logic:** Leveraging the Public Suffix List ensures domains are grouped correctly, avoiding confusion caused by subdomains.
- **Session Contextualization:** By isolating data per browser tab, you gain focused insights that correspond exactly to your browsing experience.

## Practical Example

Imagine you open a new tab and visit your favorite news website. uBO Scope begins logging all outbound connections:

- The popup badge shows “12,” indicating 12 allowed third-party domains.
- Opening the popup, you see three lists:
  - **Allowed:** Advertising networks and analytics providers that were allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains potentially attempting to load via redirects but blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Domains your content blocker stopped due to filter rules.

You immediately understand the network footprint of this single tab, empowering privacy evaluation or debugging without sifting through complex logs.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Quick Feature Overview">
<Accordion title="Popup displays ‘NO DATA’ or is empty">
This can occur if the active tab has no recorded network connections or uBO Scope’s session data has not yet synchronized.

- Ensure the tab has loaded content that initiates network requests.
- Give the extension a moment to process network events (usually within 1 second).
- Refresh the tab if needed.
- Refer to the troubleshooting guide if issues persist.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Badge count does not update">
The badge updates on network events processed in batches.

- Wait a few seconds for updates.
- Confirm that the tab is active and that network activity is occurring.
- Verify the extension permission settings are intact.
- Review the [Troubleshooting Installation & First Run Issues](https://path.to/getting-started/first-steps-usage-validation/troubleshooting) documentation for advanced help.
