# Quick Feature Overview

Get a concise rundown of uBO Scope’s primary features and understand how each empowers you to gain unparalleled visibility into network activity with clarity and precision.

---

## Instant and Accurate Network Activity Reporting

uBO Scope monitors your browser’s network requests in real time, providing precise insight into all remote server connections initiated by webpages you visit. This reporting works transparently regardless of which content blocking solutions you use, ensuring you see the true scope of third-party connections.

- **Tracks every network request event** including successes, redirects, and failures to give you a comprehensive picture.
- **Accurately categorizes outcomes** into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked, reflecting exactly what happened to each network request.

This detail enables you to: understand privacy exposure on a site-by-site basis, validate the effectiveness of your blockers, and get empirical data to inform your browsing choices.

## Clear Badge Count Explanation

The toolbar icon badge number provides a quick, meaningful metric:

- It shows **the number of distinct third-party remote servers that were successfully connected to** on the active tab.
- A **lower badge count is desirable**, indicating fewer third parties connected, which often correlates with better privacy.

<u>Why is this important?</u>

- Many misconceptions exist around content blocker efficacy — a high block count does not always mean better blocking.
- uBO Scope helps cut through confusion by focusing on the actual distinct third-party connections rather than block counts alone.

With uBO Scope, you gain a reliable, quantifiable understanding that directly reflects connection exposure.

## Domain-Level Statistics for Deeper Insights

Beyond simple counts, uBO Scope organizes network activity by domain, presenting:

- **Allowed** domains: Third-party servers your browser connected to without being blocked.
- **Blocked** domains: Those that were prevented due to content blocking.
- **Stealth-blocked** domains: Domains involved in hidden redirects or filtered in ways that minimize webpage breakage or detection.

This domain-level view helps you quickly identify which services are loading resources, spot potential privacy concerns, and evaluate how stealth techniques affect network behavior.

## Cross-Browser Compatibility and Integration

uBO Scope is designed to work consistently across popular browsers including Chromium-based browsers (like Chrome and Edge), Firefox, and Safari, adapting to their respective extension APIs.

- It works harmoniously with any content blocking solutions you use, regardless of whether blocking is done via extensions, DNS servers, or other means.
- Utilizes each browser’s `webRequest` API to capture all network request outcomes accurately.

This assures you of reliable data in your environment without adding friction or requiring special configuration.

## Summary of Key Features

- **Comprehensive network event tracking:** Records successes, redirects, failures.
- **Outcome categorization:** Differentiates allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked connections.
- **Badge count reflecting distinct third-party domains:** Quick privacy exposure indicator.
- **Clear popup UI with domain names and counts:** Easily digestible data at a glance.

## Real-World Scenario: Using uBO Scope to Validate Privacy

Imagine you visit an e-commerce site. Without uBO Scope, you might be unaware that dozens of third-party servers are contacted behind the scenes. This could include trackers, CDNs, or ad networks.

With uBO Scope open:

1. You immediately see a badge count showing how many distinct third-party domains were contacted.
2. Opening the extension popup, you get a breakdown by domain and whether the connection was allowed or blocked.
3. This empowers you to adjust your content blocking setup or browsing habits based on real data — not assumptions.

You gain confidence your blockers are effective, or discover gaps you can take steps to close.

## Getting Started Preview

Unlocking uBO Scope’s benefits is straightforward:

1. **Install the extension** for your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
2. **Observe the toolbar badge** as you browse to get an immediate sense of third-party connections.
3. **Open the popup panel** to explore detailed domain-level stats and connection outcomes.

<Tip>
Start simple: Use the badge count as a quick thermometer of third-party exposure, then dive into the popup for details only when you want deeper insight.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Remember, lower badge counts usually mean better privacy—but consider the context: some third-party domains, like content delivery networks (CDNs), are generally legitimate and expected.
