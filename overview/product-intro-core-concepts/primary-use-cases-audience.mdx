# Primary Use Cases & Target Audience

## Unlocking Insight into Your Browser’s Network Behavior

Imagine you're a privacy-conscious internet user, carefully selecting privacy tools and blockers, yet still wondering: how many third-party servers is my browser actually contacting?

uBO Scope answers this essential question by unveiling every remote server connection initiated by your browser — whether those connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked. This page explores the primary scenarios where uBO Scope adds value, helping you understand why this extension is indispensable for particular audiences.

## Who Benefits from uBO Scope?

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Discover the real scope of third-party connections from the websites you visit, giving you an honest measure of your exposure.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Gain actionable data to refine and validate content blocking rules, especially beneficial when browser developer tools are unavailable or limited.
- **Content Blocker Evaluators:** Accurately compare efficacy of content blocking tools by focusing on distinct third-party connections rather than simple block counts.
- **Users on Restrictive Platforms:** Leverage uBO Scope where conventional network inspection tools or APIs are limited or inaccessible.

## Primary Use Cases in Detail

### 1. Seeing Beyond the Block Count

Most content blockers report blocking activity simply as the number of blocked requests, but this metric can be misleading. uBO Scope shows the number of **distinct third-party remote servers** your browser connects to, providing clarity on actual exposure.

**Example Scenario:**

You switch blockers and see one reports a higher block count. Intuitively, you assume it’s better. But when you check with uBO Scope, you find it actually allows connections to *more* unique third parties, meaning more exposure despite higher blocks. This insight helps you make informed decisions about your digital privacy.

### 2. Debunking Ad Blocker Myths

There are common misconceptions around content blocker performance benchmarks, especially from "ad blocker test" webpages evoking unrealistic network behaviors.

uBO Scope offers real-world measurement—reporting network events as observed by the browser itself, even under stealthy blocking techniques. This makes it a trustworthy tool to verify claims about blockers, bypassing fake test scenarios.

### 3. Supporting Filter List Development

Filter list maintainers often lack access to detailed network request logs, especially on devices with limited developer tools.

uBO Scope’s precise reporting of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains provides valuable feedback to refine filters, enabling maintainers to:

- Identify third-party domains still reaching the browser
- Detect stealth blocking activity that may go unnoticed
- Prioritize filter updates based on actual network behaviors

### 4. Enhancing Transparency on Limited Platforms

On some browsers or devices, network inspection APIs and developer tools are minimal or unavailable.

uBO Scope fills this gap by capturing network request outcomes using browser `webRequest` listeners, making this information accessible through a simple popup interface. This democratizes the visibility of third-party connections for all users.

## Why uBO Scope Matters for These Users

- **Accurate Privacy Measurement:** Counting distinct third-party servers across allowed and stealth-blocked connections gives users a factual privacy snapshot.
- **Actionable Feedback:** Filter maintainers and power users receive clear data to tune content blockers effectively.
- **Trustworthy Insights:** By working directly with browser-reported network events, uBO Scope avoids misleading test page results.
- **Lightweight & Focused:** It’s a specialized companion tool to uBlock Origin, intentionally simple and precise without overwhelming users with irrelevant data.

## Typical User Journeys

### Journey 1: Privacy-Conscious User Curious About Exposure

1. Install uBO Scope alongside your main content blocker.
2. Browse as usual, then click the toolbar icon to view the count of third-party servers connected.
3. Use the popup to see detailed lists of domains allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
4. Adjust blocking preferences or filter lists based on this information to reduce exposure.

### Journey 2: Filter List Maintainer Validating Effectiveness

1. Use uBO Scope to monitor connections while testing new filter rules.
2. Observe if known unwanted domains appear in allowed or stealth-blocked lists.
3. Update filters and re-validate until exposure is minimized.
4. Share findings with the community for better collective privacy.

## Best Practices

- Interpret the badge count as the number of *unique* third-party remote servers connected, not as a block count.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your chosen content blocker for complementary insights.
- Regularly review the detailed popup data to understand the mix of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.
- Combine insights from uBO Scope with browser developer tools when available to deepen analysis.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Misusing block counts as the sole privacy metric:** Without understanding distinct domains connected, you can misunderstand true exposure.
- **Relying on 'ad blocker test' pages:** These can provide misleading results that uBO Scope is designed to bypass.
- **Assuming all third parties are malicious:** Low counts could be legitimate third-party services such as CDNs; uBO Scope encourages informed awareness, not paranoia.

---

## Summary

uBO Scope empowers users and filter list maintainers with a clear, accurate view of the browser’s remote server connections. Its focused approach complements traditional blockers and evaluation methods by emphasizing distinct third-party exposures across allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked states.

By integrating with your browser seamlessly, uBO Scope democratizes network visibility, making privacy validation approachable for a broad audience.
