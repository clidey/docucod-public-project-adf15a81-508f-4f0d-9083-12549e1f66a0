# Core Concepts & Terminology

## Understanding How uBO Scope Counts and Categorizes Connections

To make the most of uBO Scope, it's important to grasp the key terms and concepts that underpin how it measures browser connections. This section clarifies terminology and demonstrates how uBO Scope's unique counting method provides a clearer picture of your privacy exposure than conventional content blockers.

## Key Terms

### Network Request
A *network request* refers to any attempt made by your browser to fetch a resource or communicate with a server over the internet. This includes loading images, scripts, fetching data over WebSocket connections, and more.

### Domain and Hostname
- **Hostname:** The full address of a remote server your browser contacts, e.g., `sub.example.com`.
- **Domain:** The registered portion of a hostname, typically the main site name and public suffix, e.g., `example.com`. uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List to accurately determine the domain for each hostname.

### Third-Party Server
A *third-party server* is any external server different from the primary domain of the webpage you are visiting. For instance, if you visit `news.example.com` and your browser connects to `cdn.contentdelivery.net`, the latter is a third-party server.

### Outcomes of Network Requests
uBO Scope classifies network requests into three outcomes:

- **Allowed:** Requests that successfully connect and load resources without interference.
- **Blocked:** Requests that fail due to content blocking or network errors.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests that were redirected or suppressed stealthily by content blockers, remaining invisible to the webpage and thus not detectable by standard methods.

### Badge Count
The badge on uBO Scope's browser toolbar icon displays the number of distinct third-party domains that your browser has connected to during browsing.

## Why uBO Scope’s Counting Method Matters

Unlike many content blockers that focus on the raw count of blocked requests, uBO Scope tracks the **unique number of third-party domains your browser connects to**, regardless of whether those requests were blocked, redirected, or allowed. This approach offers several valuable advantages:

- **More Accurate Privacy Assessment:** By focusing on distinct third-party servers rather than just blocked requests, it reveals your true privacy exposure.

- **Clarity on Network Activity:** It differentiates between servers from which resources were successfully fetched, those stealthily blocked, and those outright blocked.

- **Insight Beyond Block Counts:** High block counts may not mean better privacy. uBO Scope shows if your browser is still connecting to many third-party domains despite blocks.

---

## How uBO Scope Categorizes Connections

When you browse, uBO Scope listens to your browser's network activity through the `webRequest` API. It captures all remote server connections and classifies them:

- **Allowed Domains:** These are third-party domains from which resources were successfully loaded. For example, legitimate Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) often appear here.

- **Stealth-Blocked Domains:** These are connections that content blockers suppressed or redirected without the webpage's knowledge. Such stealth blocking is useful to block trackers without causing webpage breakage.

- **Blocked Domains:** These correspond to connections explicitly blocked or failed due to errors.

This classification helps you understand exactly what’s happening behind the scenes.

## Distinction From Standard Content Blockers

Most content blockers report how many requests they blocked but don’t show how many distinct servers your browser actually contacted. This can be misleading because:

- A blocker might report many blocked requests yet your browser still connects to many third-party servers.
- Some blockers use stealth techniques that don't show up in traditional block counts.

uBO Scope exposes these nuances by focusing on the distinct third-party domains tied to network requests, not just the requests themselves.

---

## Practical Example

Imagine visiting a news website:

- Your browser initiates connections to the main site domain (first-party).
- It also connects to several external servers:
  - A CDN provider loading images (allowed).
  - A tracker server stealthily redirected and blocked (stealth-blocked).
  - An ad network server explicitly blocked (blocked).

With uBO Scope, you will see all these categories distinctly, along with the actual third-party domains involved. The toolbar badge updates to reflect the number of unique allowed third-party domains, giving you honest feedback about your exposure.

---

## Tips for Understanding Metrics

- A **lower badge count is better**, indicating fewer unique third-party connections.
- Recognize that some third parties, like CDNs, are generally benign and common.
- Use uBO Scope's detailed popup UI to see a breakdown by category and specific domains.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring stealth blocking:** Some trackers are stealth-blocked and won’t appear in traditional block counts but are revealed here.
- **Misinterpreting badge as block count:** The badge count shows allowed unique domains, not number of blocked requests.
- **Assuming all third parties are bad:** Legitimate services can appear as third parties; use contextual judgment.

## How uBO Scope Determines Domains

uBO Scope uses the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to isolate the public suffix and registered domain portion of hostnames. This ensures subdomains (e.g., `ads.example.com` and `cdn.example.com`) are correctly grouped under their root domain (`example.com`) for accurate counting.

## Summary

By mastering these core concepts, you empower yourself to interpret uBO Scope’s reports correctly, extracting meaningful insights into your browser’s third-party connections and privacy exposure.

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Asked Questions">
<Accordion title="What counts as a third-party domain?">
Any domain different from the domain of the webpage you are visiting. For example, if you browse https://example.com and your browser requests resources from cdn.example.net, `example.net` is third-party.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does 'stealth-blocked' mean?">
Stealth-blocked requests are ones blocked or redirected by content blockers in a way that the webpage cannot detect, ensuring the content blocker works invisibly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why doesn't the badge show blocked request count?">
The badge focuses on the number of distinct allowed third-party domains to give a clearer measurement of actual exposures, as block count alone can be misleading.
