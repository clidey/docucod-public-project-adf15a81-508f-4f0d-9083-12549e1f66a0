# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlock Transparency Into Your Browser’s Network Connections

uBO Scope is a lightweight, precision-focused browser extension designed to reveal all outgoing network connections initiated by your browser, including which remote servers your webpages attempt or succeed to connect with. By shining a light on these connections, uBO Scope empowers users and filter list maintainers with clear, actionable insights into real web traffic—regardless of whichever content blocker or network filtering you have in place.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

Most content blockers display what they block, but this only tells part of the story. uBO Scope reports the **distinct third-party remote servers that your browser actually connects to**, an essential metric for understanding privacy exposure and overall network footprint. It measures *what gets through*, not just *what is blocked* — ultimately offering a more reliable indicator of content blocker effectiveness and actual data flow.

### Key Benefits

- **Full Visibility:** See every unique third-party remote server connection your browser initiates.
- **Content Blocker Agnostic:** Accurately reports connections regardless of the content blocking tool or setup you use.
- **Ground Truth Measurement:** Counts distinct connected servers rather than total requests or block counts, reducing common misconceptions.
- **Ideal for Filter List Maintainers:** Offers critical data to evaluate and refine blocklists based on real-world network behavior.
- **Transparent and Lightweight:** Minimal overhead with straightforward reporting directly in your browser toolbar.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Gain clarity on who your browser talks to, beyond what your ad blocker reports.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Get trustworthy metrics about which servers are actually accessed.
- **Security Analysts:** Detect suspicious or unexpected network activity easily.

## What is uBO Scope?

In simple terms, uBO Scope is a browser extension that listens to all network requests initiated by loaded webpages and reports on their destination servers. Unlike traditional content blockers that focus on blocking or filtering requests, uBO Scope’s core function is to measure and report the outcome of these requests — whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked — offering an unparalleled view into the network activity of your browser.

### Core Purpose

- **Reveal Real Browser Connections:** uBO Scope answers the critical question — what remote servers is my browser truly connecting to?
- **Clarify Content Blocker Results:** It cuts through misleading block counts or self-reported statistics by instead showing unique third-party domains involved.
- **Empower Informed Decisions:** Helps users and filter maintainers evaluate the effectiveness and privacy impact of their configurations.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

- **Distinct Count Reporting:** The badge on the toolbar icon counts distinct third-party remote servers, not simply total requests or blocks.
- **Robust Network Reporting:** Uses browser `webRequest` API listeners capturing connection attempts regardless of DNS-level or stealthy content blocking.
- **Supports Multiple Browsers:** Implemented with manifest version 3, compatible with Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari.
- **Focused and Minimalistic:** Delivers targeted insights without unnecessary features or bloat.

## How uBO Scope Works at a High Level

uBO Scope hooks into the browser's network layer through the `webRequest` API to monitor live HTTP(s) and WebSocket requests. It processes each network event to categorize remote servers by whether their connection was allowed, blocked explicitly, or stealth-blocked (redirected quietly). This data is aggregated per browser tab and summarized in a simple popup interface.

### User Interaction Flow

1. **Browse Normally:** As you navigate, uBO Scope silently logs network events behind the scenes.
2. **Toolbar Badge Updates:** The toolbar icon badge number reflects the count of distinct third-party servers connected.
3. **Popup Report:** Clicking the icon opens a detailed panel categorizing remote domains by connection outcomes.

### Reporting Categories

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Connections successfully established.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were redirected stealthily in ways that content blockers often take.
- **Blocked:** Connections that failed or were canceled by content blockers.

## Why Should I Care?

### Real-World Benefits

- **Accurate Privacy Gauge:** Instead of guessing based on block counts, see the true landscape of third-party connections.
- **Better Blocker Evaluation:** Assess if a content blocker is effective by measuring the eventual connections, not just reported blocks.
- **Debunk Misleading Metrics:** Avoid relying on superficial tests or block counts that don't reveal what's genuinely connected.
- **Tangible Efficiency Gains:** Quickly identify if too many unwanted third parties are loaded, enabling tuning and optimization.

### Common Scenarios

- You suspect your content blocker is missing trackers — uBO Scope confirms the actual connected remote servers.
- You're testing new filter lists — this tool verifies if they effectively reduce third-party connections.
- You want to audit a website’s network footprint comprehensively.
- You're a filter list maintainer needing precise data on connections to improve blocklists.

### Before and After Example

| Without uBO Scope                                | With uBO Scope                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Only see a block count badge — unclear what it means. | See exactly how many distinct third-party servers your browser connects to. |
| Trust dubious "block test" sites for blocker effectiveness. | Use real connection data to assess true privacy exposure. |
| Guess which third parties are active.            | Know precisely which domains to focus on in filter maintenance. |
