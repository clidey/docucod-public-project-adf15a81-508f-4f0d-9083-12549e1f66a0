title: "Why Use uBO Scope?"
description: "Explains how uBO Scope provides visibility into third-party network requests, allowing users and filter list maintainers to assess privacy, diagnose filter effectiveness, and better understand what happens behind the scenes as webpages load. Underlines the value of focusing on remote server counts, not just traditional ad block tallies."

# Why Use uBO Scope?

## Reveal Hidden Third-Party Connections for Greater Insight

When you browse the web, your browser communicates with many servers beyond the site you're visiting. Some of these connections are essential, like fetching images or scripts from Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), while others may be less obvious or even intrusive. uBO Scope empowers you with clear visibility into **all** these remote server connections, helping you understand what really happens behind the scenes.

### What Does uBO Scope Show You?

- **Distinct Third-Party Remote Servers:** See exactly how many and which different servers your browser connects to.
- **Connection Outcomes:** Understand whether each request was allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.
- **Detailed Domain Information:** Identify connections by domain and hostname clusters for clearer context.

### Why This Matters

Many users judge content blockers by how many requests they block or rely on synthetic "ad blocker test" pages. Both approaches can be misleading. uBO Scope shifts the focus to a critical metric: **the number of distinct third-party servers your browser communicates with.**

This metric better reflects actual privacy and security exposure:

- A **lower count of remote servers contacted means less third-party tracking and resource loading.**
- High block counts can sometimes correlate with **more connections**, suggesting blocker inefficiencies or ineffective filtering.
- Avoids confusion from fabricated test sites that do not represent real-world browsing.


## Real-World Benefits for Users and Maintainers

### For Privacy-Conscious Users

Instead of guessing or trusting questionable test reports, uBO Scope lets you:

- Verify how many third parties websites contact in real time.
- Detect stealthy redirects and understand blocked versus allowed connections.
- Get actionable insights for making informed decisions about your content blocking setup.

### For Filter List Maintainers

uBO Scope provides an accurate data source to:

- Validate the real impact of filter lists beyond block metrics.
- Analyze how network requests behave under various filters your list applies.
- Identify edge cases where requests are intercepted or blocked in unexpected ways.


## What Sets uBO Scope Apart?

### Accurate, Browser-Level Visibility

- Works regardless of which content blocker is active, or even when blocking occurs outside the browser extension realm as long as the browser emits `webRequest` events.
- Operates transparently with minimal performance impact.

### Badge and Popup Reflections

- The toolbar badge succinctly shows the **number of third-party servers currently contacted** — a powerful, at-a-glance privacy indicator.
- The popup interface organizes connections into **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** groups, helping you quickly grasp the network activity details.


## Use Case Example: Evaluating a Website’s Third-Party Connections

Imagine you want to assess how much a news site relies on third-party services:

1. With uBO Scope enabled, load the site.
2. Observe the toolbar badge — say it shows "7".
3. Open the popup to see all domains connected under allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
4. Quickly notice if unfamiliar or suspicious domains are contacted.
5. Use this insight to tweak filters or decide whether to proceed visiting the site.

Without uBO Scope, you might rely on opaque block counts or incomplete browser developer tools, missing stealth connections or the big picture.


## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Focus on the badge count, not just block statistics.**
  - The fewer unique third-party domains connected, the better your privacy.
- **Use the popup to explore connection details.**
  - This segregation helps identify which requests your content blocker triggers stealth blocking on.
- **Interpret blocked connections carefully.**
  - Not all blocks guarantee privacy; some sites may still leak data before blocking.
- **Remember limitations:**
  - Requests outside the browser’s `webRequest` API (like those made by proprietary native apps or some WebSockets) might not be reported.


## Common Misconceptions Addressed

- **"A higher block count means better blocking."
  - Not true. A higher block count can correlate with more connections and less effective blocking overall. uBO Scope focuses on distinct third-party connection counts instead.

- **"Ad blocker test pages reflect reality."
  - These test pages often simulate unrealistic scenarios and do not account for stealthy or nuanced behaviors. Real-world network activity is better assessed with tools like uBO Scope.

<Note>
The value of uBO Scope centers on **visibility into network connections**, not just blocking counts. Use it as a factual lens to assess both your browsing privacy and the effectiveness of filters.
</Note>

<Info>
Keep in mind that some content blockers employ stealth techniques making direct block counts misleading; uBO Scope provides an independent and accurate view.
</Info>

<Warning>
uBO Scope only reports network requests observable via the browser's `webRequest` API; some requests made through other methods may not be captured.
