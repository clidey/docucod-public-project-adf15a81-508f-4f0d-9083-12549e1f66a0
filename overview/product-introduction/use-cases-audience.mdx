# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Discover if uBO Scope is the right tool for you by understanding who benefits most from it and why. This page profiles the key user groups and use cases, helping you decide how uBO Scope fits into your privacy, research, or filter maintenance workflows.

## Unlock Transparency into Browser Connections

In an online world where nearly every webpage loads resources from multiple remote servers, it’s vital to see and understand exactly which connections your browser is making — especially those to third-party servers.

uBO Scope fills this transparency gap by revealing:  
- Which third-party domains are contacted  
- Which connections are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked  
- How many distinct third-party domains a page reaches

This insight empowers informed privacy decisions and smarter filter list maintenance.

## Who Benefits from Using uBO Scope?

### 1. Privacy-Conscious Everyday Users

If you want to understand and control your online privacy in a straightforward way, uBO Scope shows you the real picture behind network requests. It helps:

- Visualize which third-party domains your browser actually connects to during browsing
- Detect unexpected or suspicious connections that might compromise privacy
- Verify how effective your content blocker or DNS-based protections truly are

> _Example Use Case:_ You visit a news site and use uBO Scope’s popup panel to see just a handful of third-party domains connected, confirming minimal third-party exposure. Or, spot unexpected connections, prompting action.


### 2. Filter List Authors and Maintenance Experts

Filter list maintainers need accurate, current data on network connections to craft rules that block unwanted servers without breaking site functionality. uBO Scope offers:

- Detailed, real-time reporting of domains contacted, regardless of current content blocker configurations
- Visibility into stealth-blocked connections that evade typical logging and could degrade blocker precision
- Support for filter testing on devices or browsers that lack comprehensive developer tools

> _Example Use Case:_ A filter list author uses uBO Scope to confirm that stealth-blocked domains are properly identified before updating their list, ensuring blockers keep pace with evolving tracking practices.


### 3. Users Skeptical of Ad-Blocker Effectiveness Claims

Not all content blockers are created equal, and common metrics like block count badges can be misleading. uBO Scope helps:

- Debunk myths caused by naive block count comparisons that ignore distinct third-party domain connections
- Expose situations where higher block counts actually mean more connections allowed, not less
- Avoid reliance on unreliable "ad blocker test" web pages that simulate unrealistic conditions

> _Example Use Case:_ You suspect your current blocker isn’t performing as advertised. uBO Scope confirms whether the number of distinct third-party connections is truly low, revealing the blocker’s real-world effectiveness.

## Key Use Cases

- **Everyday browsing transparency:** Quickly check the number and identity of third-party domains your current webpage connects to.
- **Content blocker validation:** Verify that your content blocker is working as expected by comparing allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.
- **Filter list development:** Gather indispensable raw data for crafting and refining filter lists under real browsing conditions.
- **Technical research & diagnostics:** Professionals investigating privacy risks or blocker evasion tactics can leverage precise connection profiles.

## Is uBO Scope Right for You?

Consider these questions to decide:

- Do I want a clear and reliable view into my browser’s third-party connections?
- Am I involved in developing or maintaining content blocking filter lists?

## Practical Tips for New Users

- Focus on the badge count on the toolbar icon; it conveys the total number of distinct third-party domains contacted during browsing.
- Use the popup panel to explore which domains were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- Remember that not all third parties are malicious; typically, CDN domains are legitimate.
- For filter list authors, look closely at the stealth-blocked category to catch elusive connections.

<Note>
Stealth-blocked domains are those blocked silently without notifying the page or user; spotting them requires tools like uBO Scope.
