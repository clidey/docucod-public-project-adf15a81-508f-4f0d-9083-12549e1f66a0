# Value Proposition and Why It Matters

Understanding the true impact of content blockers goes beyond simply counting how many requests get blocked. This page reveals why using the number of blocked requests as a metric is misleading and how uBO Scope empowers you to focus on what really affects your privacy and browsing experience: the number of unique third-party connections your browser exposes.

## Why Counting Blocked Requests Fails as a Reliable Metric

When evaluating content blockers, many users and developers scrutinize the block count shown on toolbar icons or reports. It’s a common misconception that a higher block count means better protection. However, this is not only inaccurate but can be completely misleading:

- **Block count does not reflect exposure:** A blocker reporting blocking many requests might still allow connections to more distinct third-party servers, increasing your overall exposure.
- **More blocks, more connections:** Sometimes, a high block count correlates with greater total connections because the browser still fetches content from numerous third parties — negating the privacy advantage.
- **False sense of security:** Relying on block numbers can lead users to trust blockers that are less effective at limiting distinct third-party connections.

By debunking this myth, uBO Scope highlights the pitfalls of traditional metrics and guides users toward truly meaningful insights.

## What Really Matters: Distinct Third-Party Connections

The primary concern for privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers is minimizing the number of *distinct* third-party domains your browser communicates with, rather than just the sheer number of blocked HTTP requests. Each distinct third-party connection represents a unique external entity potentially tracking or profiling your online behavior.

### How uBO Scope Helps

- **Focus on unique domains:** Instead of inflated block counts, uBO Scope reports the exact number of unique third-party domains your browser connects to.
- **Accurate visibility regardless of blocker:** uBO Scope monitors network requests at the browser level, meaning it reports connections regardless of which content blocker is active.
- **True measurement of exposure:** A lower count of distinct third-party connections reflects a tighter, more privacy-preserving browsing experience.

## Key Business & User Benefits

### Privacy Enthusiasts
Gain clarity on what websites and third parties your browser truly connects to. Stop chasing unreliable block metrics and instead measure the real privacy impact of your chosen blockers and filters.

### Developers
Use uBO Scope to benchmark content blockers effectively, ensuring development focuses on reducing unique third-party exposures rather than maximizing block counts.

### Filter List Maintainers
Benefit from detailed domain connection data that help maintain accurate and effective filter lists — especially on devices that cannot access developer tools easily.

## Common Misconceptions Addressed

<u>"This content blocker reports more blocks, so it must be better."</u> 

uBO Scope demonstrates that block counts alone are insufficient and can mask poor blockers’ true behavior. 

<u>"Ad blocker test webpages offer reliable effectiveness measurements."</u> 

These test pages often use unreal network request patterns and cannot detect stealth blocking techniques. uBO Scope encourages avoiding these as benchmarks and relying on real network connection data.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine two blockers — Blocker A and Blocker B:

- Blocker A reports blocking 1000 requests but still allows connections to 50 distinct third-party domains.
- Blocker B reports blocking 600 requests but only allows connections to 20 unique third-party domains.

Traditional metrics might favor Blocker A for the high block count, but uBO Scope reveals Blocker B offers superior privacy protection by limiting third-party exposure.

## Next Steps

To maximize your understanding and use of uBO Scope:

- **Install the extension:** Available for Chromium and Firefox browsers via their respective stores.
- **Explore the popup interface:** See live counts of distinct connected domains for your current tab.
- **Learn practical use cases:** Monitor your real-world browsing exposure and compare blockers with confidence.

<Tip>
Always focus on the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connects to rather than raw block counts for a true measure of content blocker effectiveness.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Avoid relying on ad blocker test webpages as benchmarks since they do not represent typical web traffic patterns and fail to detect stealth blocking.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup title="FAQs about Counting Blocked Requests and uBO Scope">
<Accordion title="Why isn’t the block count reliable for comparing content blockers?">
The block count can be misleading because a blocker that blocks more requests might actually allow connections to more distinct third-party domains. These connections represent actual data exposures, making the number of unique third-party connections a more accurate privacy metric.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does uBO Scope count connections differently?">
uBO Scope tracks the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser actually connects to, regardless of whether requests are blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed. This approach provides a clearer picture of your real exposure.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope detect stealth blocking used by other blockers?">
Yes. Because uBO Scope listens to the browser’s `webRequest` API, it reports all network request outcomes regardless of the filtering method, including stealth techniques.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why should filter list maintainers care about uBO Scope?">
uBO Scope provides detailed domain-level connection data even on devices where browser developer tools may not be accessible, assisting in maintaining effective blocklists.
