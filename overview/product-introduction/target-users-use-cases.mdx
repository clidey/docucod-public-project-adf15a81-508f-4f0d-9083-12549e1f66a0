# Who Is uBO Scope For?

Understanding who benefits most from uBO Scope enables you to decide if this extension aligns with your privacy, security, or filter-maintenance needs. This page clearly defines the primary audiences and reveals relatable real-world use cases where uBO Scope offers unique value.

## A Dedicated Tool for Privacy-Conscious Users and Filter List Maintainers

uBO Scope is specifically designed for two key groups:

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Individuals seeking clear and accurate insight into which remote servers their browser communicates with, beyond common metrics such as block counts.

- **Filter List Maintainers:** Those who create or maintain lists that block unwanted content and need reliable tools to validate the effectiveness of these filters, especially on devices or environments with restricted browser tools.

By focusing on real network connections instead of surface-level indicators, uBO Scope empowers these users with transparency and actionable data.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Checking Third-Party Connections on Any Website

When you visit a website, numerous external domains may be contacted to load ads, analytics, fonts, or other content. uBO Scope reveals these connections precisely by counting distinct remote servers contacted rather than just blocking events. This gives you an exact measure of your exposure to third parties, helping you:

- Identify unexpected or undesired third-party domains involved.
- Understand the true privacy impact of your current content blocking setup.
- Avoid being misled by block counts that do not reflect actual third-party exposure.

### 2. Validating Filter Lists on Locked-Down Devices

Filter list maintainers often face challenges in environments where developer tools are unavailable or limited (e.g., on locked-down workstations or testing devices). uBO Scope offers a reliable way to monitor:

- Which network requests are actually being blocked, allowed, or stealth-blocked.
- The domains associated with each state, helping validate the filter list's scope and coverage.

This results in more effective maintenance and confidence in the filter lists deployed.

### 3. Debunking Common Myths Around Ad Blocking

uBO Scope is invaluable for dispelling widespread misunderstandings such as:

- **Myth:** Higher block counts mean better ad blockers.
  - **Reality**: uBO Scope focuses on counting distinct third-party servers contacted. A lower number indicates fewer external connections, which is a more accurate privacy measure.

- **Myth:** Ad blocker test websites effectively measure blocker reliability.
  - **Reality**: Such test pages use contrived network requests and cannot detect stealthy blocking behaviors. uBO Scope uses real browsing network data for trustworthy insights.

By clarifying these misconceptions, users and filter maintainers can make grounded decisions.
