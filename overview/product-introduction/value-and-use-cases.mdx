# Product Value & Use Cases

Discover how uBO Scope empowers end-users, privacy advocates, and filter list maintainers by exposing the truth behind web page connections. This page explores practical scenarios where uBO Scope’s unique insight into network request outcomes provides transparency, debunks common content blocker myths, and supports maintaining effective filter lists, even in restricted environments.

---

## Why uBO Scope Matters to You

When you load a webpage, it often communicates with numerous remote servers — some essential, some unwanted. Understanding which connections succeed, which are blocked, and which are stealth-blocked is critical for ensuring your privacy and security online.

uBO Scope lifts the veil on these connections, giving you a clear, unbiased view that traditional content blockers or test pages cannot provide.

### Who Benefits Most?
- **End-Users:** Gain confidence about what third-party domains your browser really talks to, avoiding trackers and unwanted connections.
- **Privacy Advocates:** Validate the effectiveness of content blockers and cultivate stronger web privacy practices.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Monitor actual network requests on devices with limited access to browser developer tools, enabling better rule creation and maintenance.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Validating Content Blocker Efficacy
Assessing a content blocker by its block count alone can be misleading. Some blockers report blocking more requests but still permit connections to a greater number of third-party domains, diluting protection.

**With uBO Scope, you see:**
- The exact number of distinct third-party domains connected to (badge count).
- Classification of networks requests into `allowed`, `blocked`, and `stealth-blocked`.

This helps you evaluate which content blocker truly minimizes exposure to third parties, focusing on *what remains connected* rather than *what is blocked*.

### 2. Debunking Industry Myths About Blockers
uBO Scope exposes flawed assumptions such as:
- **Myth:** 'A higher block count means a better blocker.'
  - **Fact:** High block counts can indicate a blocker that blocks some requests but lets more distinct domains through.
- **Myth:** 'Ad blocker test sites give reliable results.'
  - **Fact:** Such sites simulate unrealistic scenarios often detectable by blockers, giving skewed, unreliable feedback.

By providing raw network outcome data directly from the browser, uBO Scope bypasses these misleading metrics.

### 3. Monitoring Third-Party Domains in Restricted Browsing Environments
On locked-down devices or in environments where advanced browser tools are unavailable, uBO Scope offers:
- Clear audit trails of all remote connections attempted by webpages.
- A helpful interface (popup) that categorizes domains by outcome (allowed, stealth, blocked).
- Easy detection of suspicious or unexpected third parties.

This capability helps maintain filter lists and privacy assurances without deep technical access.

## Typical User Flow

When you open the uBO Scope popup by clicking the extension icon, you immediately see:

1. **Summary:** The total number of distinct third-party domains your current tab connected to.
2. **Detailed Sections:**
   - **Not Blocked:** Domains that were connected to without interference.
   - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were silently redirected or blocked without alerting the requesting page.
   - **Blocked:** Domains where network requests failed due to blocking.

Each section lists domains and the number of connection attempts, presenting a transparent picture of your browsing session's network behavior.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Use the badge count as a real-time indicator.** A higher badge count means more third-party domains reached during page load — often an indicator to inspect for trackers or unwanted connections.
- **Review stealth-blocked domains carefully.** These represent connections silently altered by content blockers.
- **Combine uBO Scope with your preferred blocker.** This gives layered insight — blocker activity plus raw network outcomes.
- **Filter list maintainers should use uBO Scope on devices without developer tools.** The popup’s domain breakdown helps identify new or missed domains.

### Common Pitfalls

- Relying on generic block counts rather than examining the actual set of connected domains can provide a false sense of security.
- Using synthetic 'ad blocker test' pages as measures can produce misleading conclusions about blocker efficiency.
