# Core Features at a Glance

Discover uBO Scope’s essential capabilities that empower you to visually track and understand web page network activity with precision and clarity. This page highlights the main features designed for transparency, quick insight, and cross-browser reliability.

---

## Real-Time Badge Display: Monitor Third-Party Connection Counts Instantly

From the moment you load a webpage, uBO Scope provides an immediate visual cue via its toolbar icon badge. The badge prominently displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted during your browsing session.

- **Why it matters:** Instead of tracking total network requests or block counts, which can be misleading, the badge focuses on unique third-party domains. A lower badge number reflects fewer third-party connections, signaling cleaner or more privacy-conscious network activity.
- **Scenario:** You visit a news website and glance at the badge. It shows "5" — indicating 5 unique third-party domains connected, helping you quickly assess the degree of external tracking or resource loading.

The badge updates dynamically, giving you confidence that the count reflects the current state of the active tab’s network traffic.

## Popup Reports: Deep-Dive into Network Activity per Page

Clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon opens an intuitive popup that breaks down the network connections made by the current page into three clear categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains from which network requests succeeded and data was received.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with requests redirected or suppressed silently by content blockers.
- **Blocked:** Domains whose network requests failed or were actively blocked.

Each category lists the connected domains alongside the count of requests made to them, enabling you to:

- Identify which third parties have successfully loaded resources.
- Understand what connections were stealthily blocked, invisible to the page.
- Spot domains outright blocked by your content blocker or network rules.

### Example User Flow

1. Load a webpage.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon.
3. See summary: “domains connected: 7”.
4. Review lists to find suspicious or unexpected third-party domains.

This organized reporting transforms raw network data into actionable insights, empowering privacy-conscious users and content blocker evaluators alike.

## Cross-Browser Support: Reliable Functionality across Major Browsers

uBO Scope is built to seamlessly support the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, ensuring that you can:

- Use the extension consistently regardless of browser choice.
- Rely on standard browser APIs (`webRequest`) that these browsers implement to observe network activity.
- Benefit from synchronized experience including badge updates and popup reporting.

Cross-browser support is essential for users and filter list maintainers who operate in mixed environments or who want consistent tool behavior no matter their platform.

## How These Features Support Clear Decision Making & Reliable Network Analysis

By combining a simple, at-a-glance badge count with detailed popup breakdowns, uBO Scope:

- Moves beyond misleading block counts to prioritize **distinct third-party domain counts**, which are more meaningful privacy indicators.
- Reveals stealthy network activity invisible to webpages and many traditional tools.
- Helps you validate the actual effectiveness of content blockers without relying on unreliable ad test pages or raw block numbers.

These features make it easier to evaluate, audit, and improve your privacy stance with concrete data.

---

## Practical Tips for Using Core Features

- **Quickly spot spikes:** If the badge count spikes unexpectedly on a familiar site, open the popup to investigate new or hidden third-party domains.
- **Use with content blockers:** Combine uBO Scope’s stats with blockers like uBlock Origin to validate what’s allowed or stealth-blocked.
- **Filter list maintainers:** Utilize the domain breakdowns to spot which third-party domains might require new filters or adjustments.
