# Key Features and Value of uBO Scope

Explore the essential capabilities that make uBO Scope an indispensable tool for anyone wanting transparent, reliable insights into third-party network connections initiated by webpages. This page highlights uBO Scope's top features, emphasizing its unique advantages and practical value.

---

## An Unmatched View into Domain Connection Outcomes

At its core, uBO Scope records the fate of every network request a webpage attempts, categorizing connections into **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked**. This nuanced breakdown is presented by domain, offering an accurate account of third-party resources connected to — not just block counts.

### What You Achieve:

- **Complete domain-level insights**: See exactly which distinct domains your browser connected to successfully, which attempts were silently blocked, and which were outright blocked by content blockers.
- **Transparent categorization**: Understand the *why* behind each connection outcome rather than guessing from raw network logs.

This clarity empowers users to assess their web privacy with precision and confidence.

## Support for All Content Blockers and Network Layers

Unlike tools tied to a specific blocker or blocking technique, uBO Scope functions independently of the content blocking method in operation. Whether blocking occurs inside the browser via extensions like uBlock Origin, or upstream via DNS-level filters, uBO Scope still reports all network requests the browser is aware of through its `webRequest` API.

### Why It Matters:

- **Unbiased measurement**: Get objective results unaffected by any particular content blocker’s internal metrics.
- **Complements existing blockers**: Use alongside your current tools for verification without interference.
- **Broad compatibility**: Works with multiple browsers and blocking layers that surface network request data.

## Detailed Badge Reporting for Immediate At-a-Glance Awareness

uBO Scope prominently displays a badge on the browser toolbar icon that shows the count of **distinct third-party domains** attempted or made connections on the active tab.

### Benefits of This Feature:

- **Instant feedback**: Instantly gauge the reach of third-party content on any webpage.
- **Focus on distinct domains**: Badge count reflects unique domains, not just raw request numbers, helping you better assess exposure.
- **Encourages smarter blocking choices**: Lower domain counts indicate fewer third-party connections, typically correlating with tighter privacy.

## A Powerful Myth-Busting Tool for Content Blocking Claims

uBO Scope exposes common misconceptions and misleading metrics often encountered in the ad-blocking and content blocking ecosystem.

### Revealed Insights:

- Content blockers reporting high block counts are not necessarily better; they might be triggering connections to *more* third parties.
- Ad blocker test sites often produce unreliable benchmarks since they involve fabricated requests that do not reflect real-world web usage.

### Practical Impact:

With uBO Scope, filter list maintainers, privacy-conscious users, and security auditors can accurately verify the true effectiveness of content blockers, improving decision-making and reducing false assumptions.

## Unique Advantages: Independence and Transparency

### Independence from Content Blocking Techniques

uBO Scope lets you see network outcomes without bias toward any blocking technology. It can detect blocking regardless if performed by browser extensions, DNS filters, or stealth methods.

### Transparency in Reporting

Every network request is logged and categorized clearly with domain associations, avoiding opaque or confusing summaries. This provides ultimate clarity for both novice and expert users alike.

## Real-World Example: How uBO Scope Works

1. You browse a website.
2. uBO Scope records each network request the page initiates.
3. Connections are classified as "allowed/not blocked," "stealth-blocked," or "blocked" based on observed outcomes.
4. Domains for each category are grouped and displayed in the popup.
5. The toolbar badge updates with the number of distinct domains successfully contacted.

Imagine visiting a news site: you might see content fetched from the site's own domain (allowed), requests blocked by uBlock Origin extension (blocked), and stealth blocks where your DNS-based filters silently stopped connections without notifying the page (stealth-blocked). This detailed view reveals your true network exposure.

---

## Practical Tips for Maximizing uBO Scope's Value

- Use the toolbar badge counts to quickly compare privacy levels across sites or browsing sessions.
- Regularly inspect the popup's domain reports to discover unexpected or suspicious third-party connections.
- Leverage uBO Scope results to benchmark new or updated content blocking lists.
- Remember that lower domain counts generally translate to reduced tracking and better privacy.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

- **No data shown in popup:** Ensure the browser permissions are granted, and the extension is active on the tab.
- **Badge count does not update:** Data updates with a slight delay; try refreshing the tab.
- **App does not detect DNS-level blocking:** uBO Scope relies on webRequest API; blocking methods fully outside the browser may not be reported.

---

## Summary

uBO Scope’s key features deliver precise, transparent tracking of all third-party network requests and their outcomes. Its unbiased, comprehensive approach and instant badge reporting provide immediate, actionable insights into your browsing privacy. By exposing common myths and incompatible metrics, uBO Scope empowers users to make informed choices about content blockers and network exposure.
