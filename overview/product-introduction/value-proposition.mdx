# Why Use uBO Scope?

Understanding the true privacy impact of your web browsing requires more than just seeing how many requests are blocked. uBO Scope offers a unique, clear perspective by focusing on the count of distinct third-party servers your browser connects to — not just on the raw number of blocked requests. This page explains why uBO Scope’s approach delivers a reliable, trustworthy metric for assessing content blockers and privacy tools.

## The Core Value of Counting Distinct Third-Party Servers

Unlike traditional content blockers that measure blocked requests, uBO Scope highlights the number of different third-party domains your browser actually talks to while visiting a webpage. This distinction is crucial because it:

- Reveals the **scope of exposure** to external servers, a key privacy indicator.
- Shows **successful connections** that bypass blocking, providing a more honest picture of privacy leakage.
- Helps users evaluate **the effectiveness of various content blockers** on a meaningful basis—whether they reduce the number of distinct remote servers, not just individual blocked calls.

<u>**Example:**</u> If Content Blocker A shows it blocked 100 requests but your browser still connects to 20 different third-party servers, and Content Blocker B blocks only 50 requests but your browser connects to 10 fewer servers, uBO Scope lets you see that Content Blocker B might actually be more effective in limiting exposure.


## Debunking Common Content Blocking Myths

uBO Scope empowers users to cut through misinformation and false assumptions prevalent in the content blocking world.

### Myth 1: "Block Count = Better Blocking"

Many assume a higher block count means a better blocker. uBO Scope demonstrates that this isn’t the case. A blocker might block many individual requests but still allow connections to many distinct third-party servers, which means more potential privacy exposure. Conversely, a lower block count with fewer connected third-party servers often means tighter privacy.

### Myth 2: "Ad Blocker Test Pages Are Accurate Indicators"

Common online tests that claim to measure ad blocker reliability often perform unrealistic network requests that don't reflect how real websites load resources. These tests fail to detect stealthy blocking techniques used by many effective content blockers and should be avoided. uBO Scope instead bases its measurements on actual browsing activity and the network requests your browser reaches out to.


## How uBO Scope Builds Trust in Privacy Tools

By turning the spotlight from requests blocked to remote servers connected, uBO Scope establishes a transparent, data-driven way to:

- **Trust the real performance** of content blockers without being misled by superficial metrics.
- **Make informed decisions** about which filters and tools to use for protecting your privacy.
- **Verify blocker behavior** consistently across browsing sessions and browser configurations.


## Practical Insights for Everyday Users

- **Lower badge numbers on the toolbar icon mean fewer third-party servers contacted, which generally translates to better privacy.**
- Legitimate third-party servers (e.g., content delivery networks) usually have a low count, so exposure can be realistically assessed.
- uBO Scope tracks all connection attempts — successful, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked — aggregated by domain.


## Beyond the Basics: Supporting Privacy Advocates & Filter List Maintainers

While everyday users gain insights into their privacy exposure, uBO Scope also serves as a robust tool for filter list maintainers. It helps:

- Identify connections that evade blocking unexpectedly.
- Understand real-world network request patterns that might influence filter design.
- Evaluate content blocker implementations on devices with limited access to browser development tools.


## Summary

Using uBO Scope means seeing privacy from a holistic perspective — not just what is blocked but what can still communicate with your browser. This approach ensures that your trust in privacy technologies is well-founded and supported by transparent evidence.
