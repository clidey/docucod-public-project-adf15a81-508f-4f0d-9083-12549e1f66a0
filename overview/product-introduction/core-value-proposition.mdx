# Core Value Proposition

Discover why uBO Scope stands out as the essential tool for privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers who want accurate and unbiased insight into browser network activity.

---

## Unveiling True Network Exposure

When you browse the web, your browser silently connects to numerous remote servers — some first-party, many third-party — as websites load resources and services. Understanding these connections is crucial to grasp your real network exposure and to evaluate your privacy stance.

**uBO Scope** acts as your trusted companion, revealing exactly how many _distinct third-party remote servers_ your browser contacts, regardless of any content blocker you use or blocking technology employed.

### Why This Matters

- **Accurate Reporting of Third-Party Connections:** Unlike conventional tools that only count blocked or allowed requests based on extension-specific rules, uBO Scope counts distinct domains contacted by your browser. This count reflects real third-party connections, exposing your true online footprint.

- **Agnostic Monitoring Across Blocking Methods:** Whether you're using uBlock Origin, another content blocker, DNS blocking, or any blocking technology recognized by your browser’s WebRequest API, uBO Scope measures network outcomes consistently and impartially.

- **Debunking Common Web Privacy Myths:** By clearly showing network behavior, uBO Scope dispels misconceptions, such as assuming a blocker that reports a higher block count is more effective. It also reveals the limitations of so-called "ad blocker test" sites that produce misleading results.

### The Value You Receive

- **Unbiased insight into your browser's external communication,** independent of the content blockers installed.
- **Clarity on which third-party domains your browser contacts,** helping you make informed privacy decisions.
- **A powerful verification tool to evaluate content blockers and filter lists** based on actual network connections, not misleading block counts or unreliable web tests.

## What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

Many tools track network requests, but uBO Scope's innovation lies in how it aggregates and reports data:

- It reports the number of **distinct third-party domains** the browser connects with, rather than simply counting requests filtered through a single extension.
- It differentiates connections into _allowed_ (not blocked), _blocked_, and _stealth-blocked_ (redirected or intervened) categories, providing nuanced insight.
- It complements **any content blocker or blocker configuration** without interference or dependency.

This is especially useful because the total number of network requests can be large and noisy, while the number of unique third-party domains better reflects third-party tracking surfaces and exposure.

---

## Illustrative Scenario

Imagine you are visiting an online news website. Your privacy tools might show you many blocked requests, but leveraging uBO Scope you see exactly how many third-party domains your browser actually attempted and succeeded to connect with:

- **Allowed:** Domains from which the browser successfully retrieved resources.
- **Blocked:** Domains for which requests were blocked or errored.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains subject to redirection or stealthy blocking.

Understanding this helps you judge your true exposure: a content blocker that blocks many requests but still allows connections to numerous third-party domains is less effective privacy-wise than one that reduces third-party domain connections.

---

## Practical Benefits & Use Cases

- **Privacy Enthusiasts:** Visualize and quantify your exposure to third-party tracking and data collection.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Access raw data about actual network connections to refine and validate block lists.
- **Content Blocker Evaluators:** Go beyond superficial block counts and unreliable test pages to assess efficacy.

---

## How uBO Scope Fits in Your Workflow

1. **Install uBO Scope alongside your content blocker.**
2. **Browse websites naturally.**
3. **Open uBO Scope’s popup to review summarized outcomes, including unique third-party domains connected.**
4. **Use this data to understand real-world network behavior or guide filter list tuning.**

### Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope data _in conjunction_ with your primary blocker’s UI and block lists for holistic understanding.
- Avoid relying on block counts alone; focus on distinct third-party connections for an accurate view.
- Treat "ad blocker test" pages skeptically—they don’t represent realistic browsing scenarios.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Misinterpreting higher block counts as strictly better blocking.
- Assuming that blocker test pages reflect real-world protection.
- Overlooking stealth or redirect-based blocking, which uBO Scope identifies explicitly.

## Summary

uBO Scope empowers you with transparent, reliable visibility into your browser’s network connections, cutting through misleading metrics and myths about content blockers. It’s the first step to truly understanding and controlling your online privacy.
