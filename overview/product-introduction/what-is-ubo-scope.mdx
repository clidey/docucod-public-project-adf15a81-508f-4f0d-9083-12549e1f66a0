# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Your Browser Makes

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension that gives you an unprecedented, transparent view of all network connections your browser attempts or successfully makes while you browse the web. It goes beyond traditional content blockers by revealing not just what was blocked but also what managed to connect—even stealthily—and reports every third-party server interaction regardless of how it was filtered.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You

- **Total Visibility:** See every remote server your browser talks to, including allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.
- **Informed Privacy Decisions:** Identify which third-party domains are interacting with your browser, helping you decide which connections you trust.
- **Clear Network Insights:** Understand the real network footprint of a webpage beyond what content blockers normally show.
- **Beyond Block Lists:** Operates independently of filtering methods, surfacing connections blocked at the DNS or browser-extension level, or even by stealth.
- **Lightweight and Transparent:** Minimal overhead extension that works quietly in the background to provide clear, actionable data.

### Who Benefits from uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users who want to know exactly who's connecting behind the scenes.
- Security researchers and enthusiasts monitoring third-party content behaviors.
- Filter list maintainers verifying the effectiveness and reality of network blocking.
- Anyone curious about the hidden network activities triggered by webpages.

## What Exactly is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a browser extension companion to content blockers like uBlock Origin. Its primary function is to measure and report every network request your browser attempts, categorizing those requests based on their final handling:

- **Allowed:** Requests that reached their destination and loaded resources.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests that were intercepted and suppressed in a way that webpages cannot easily detect.
- **Blocked:** Requests that were explicitly blocked and failed to reach their targets.

These three categories provide a comprehensive picture of your browser's network activity on a per-tab basis.

Unlike conventional blockers that only log what they explicitly block, uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to capture data on all requests processed by the browser, regardless of which content blocker is active or how blocking is implemented. This makes it a unique tool for verifying real-world connection outcomes.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Comprehensive Request Tracking:** Captures all outgoing HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket connections initiated by webpages.
- **Categorization of Outcomes:** Organizes connections into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories for clear analysis.
- **Domain and Hostname Aggregation:** Summarizes network activity grouped by domain and hostname, including counts of requests.
- **Real-Time Tab Insight:** Provides immediate tab-specific reporting, showing exactly which domains each tab connected to.
- **Badge Count Display:** Toolbar icon badge indicates the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted — the lower, the better.
- **Punycode Support:** Displays Unicode domain names for internationalized domains, improving readability.

### Example Scenario:

Imagine you visit a news website. Most blockers will show you ads blocked or scripts stopped. uBO Scope, however, reveals exactly which third-party domains were contacted by the page even if the requests were stealth-blocked or allowed. This insight helps you understand the site's real network footprint and privacy implications.

## Why Should You Care?

Understanding network requests is crucial for privacy and security:

- **Gain Transparency:** Webpages often connect to many third-party servers invisibly. With uBO Scope, you see all of them.
- **Make Privacy Decisions with Data:** Knowing which servers connect helps you fine-tune your content blocker or adjust your browsing habits.
- **Expose Stealth Techniques:** Some content blockers silently block requests to avoid detection by the site. uBO Scope reveals these stealth-blocked connections.
- **Avoid Misleading Metrics:** Many users mistakenly rely on block counts to measure blocker effectiveness. uBO Scope clarifies what really matters — the number of distinct third-party connections.

### Typical Use Cases

- **Privacy Monitoring:** Track all third-party domains contacted by the current tab.
- **Filter List Testing:** Validate what is blocked, allowed, or stealth-blocked to optimize your filter lists.
- **Educating Users:** Help non-technical users understand the hidden connections their browser makes.

## Getting Started Preview

Starting with uBO Scope is straightforward—after installing the extension, simply browse as usual:

- Click the uBO Scope icon to open its popup panel.
- View a categorized list of all connected domains for the current tab.
- Check the toolbar badge to see a snapshot count of unique third-party servers contacted.

No complex setup or configuration is required.

<Tip>
To maximize uBO Scope's value, consider pairing it with uBlock Origin, so you can both block unwanted content and simultaneously monitor how effective your filters are in real-time.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

- **Requests Not Appearing?** Make sure you have granted necessary permissions, including the `webRequest` API.
- **Badge Count Confusing?** Remember the badge reflects distinct third-party domains connected, not individual requests blocked.
- **Filter Evasion Techniques?** Use uBO Scope to expose stealth-blocked requests which may be bypassing your usual blockers.
