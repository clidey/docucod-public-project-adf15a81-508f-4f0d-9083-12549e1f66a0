# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Your Browser Makes — Transparently and Accurately

uBO Scope is a lightweight, browser extension designed to unveil every connection a webpage attempts or successfully makes to remote servers. Unlike typical content blockers that count blocked requests or filter hits, uBO Scope focuses on reporting the **distinct third-party servers your browser communicates with**, regardless of which blockers are active. This transparency helps you understand your privacy exposure and network activity in real time, revealing the true third-party connections behind any website.

## Introduction to uBO Scope

uBO Scope is not just another content blocker; it’s a companion tool that reveals what happens under the hood when you browse the web. By leveraging your browser’s native `webRequest` API, it monitors and reports all network requests, including those allowed, stealthily blocked, or outright denied.

### Why uBO Scope?

- **Complete Visibility:** See **all** remote server connection attempts, including those hidden or obfuscated by other blockers.
- **Content-Blocker Agnostic:** Operates independently of content blockers, reporting network outcomes regardless of which filters or DNS blockers are used.
- **Focus on Third-Party Domains:** Reports connections based on actual third-party domains, giving clear insight into external resources your browser contacts.

In essence, uBO Scope empowers you to assess network activity accurately, providing the knowledge to evaluate privacy and filter effectiveness based on meaningful third-party connection counts.

### What Problem Does It Solve?

Many users rely on content blockers to manage tracking and ads, but evaluating their effectiveness is tricky because:

- Toolbar block counts can be misleading; a high block count doesn’t always mean fewer third-party connections.
- Webpages can manipulate test results, hiding real network activity from simplistic 'ad blocker tests'.

uBO Scope cuts through this confusion by showing you which distinct third-party servers your browser actually attempts or successfully connects to, regardless of blocking outcomes or tricks.

### How Does uBO Scope Work?

Operating as a browser extension, uBO Scope intercepts network requests as they occur, using the browser's `webRequest` API to:

- Monitor each request's URL and outcome (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked).
- Aggregate connection data by domain and hostname.
- Present a summary of all distinct third-party servers contacted per tab.

It then surfaces this information directly through its toolbar badge count and an intuitive popup panel.

<Tip>
The toolbar icon’s badge shows the **number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted**, so a lower number means fewer external connections.

## Key Differentiators

| Feature                      | Why It Matters                             |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Full Network Request Visibility | Unlike traditional blockers, uBO Scope captures every connection attempt, not just blocked requests, ensuring no data is missed. |
| Independent from Filters       | Works alongside any content blocker or DNS filtering — your view is unbiased and complete.|
| Focus on Domains, Not Requests | Aggregates by third-party domain to spotlight meaningful external connections, reducing noise. |

## Real-World Example

Imagine browsing a news site with multiple ads and trackers:

- Your regular ad blocker hides many ads, but some trackers still connect invisibly.
- uBO Scope reveals all connections, showing you domains that might not have been blocked or were stealthily handled.
- By comparing badge counts and connection lists, you identify unexpected third-party servers.

This clarity helps you understand actual network exposure, refine filter lists, or choose more effective privacy tools.

## Summary

uBO Scope is your go-to browser extension for honest, complete visibility into the network requests your browser makes. It highlights all third-party server contacts transparently, helps debunk blocker myths, and supports privacy-conscious users in mastering their web footprints.

### Code Snippet: Retrieving Tab Connection Data

This snippet shows how uBO Scope fetches and renders connection data for the current browser tab:

```javascript
(async () => {
    const [ tab ] = await browser.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true });
    if (!tab) return;

    sendMessage({
        what: 'getTabData',
        tabId: tab.id,
    }).then(response => {
        const data = deserialize(response);
        renderPanel(data); // Populate the popup UI with connection info
    });
})();
```

This workflow powers the popup display, presenting actionable domain-level insights instantly.
