# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Remote Connection Your Browser Makes

uBO Scope is a lightweight, browser extension built with a clear mission: to reveal every connection your browser either attempts or successfully establishes with remote servers. Designed for privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers alike, it provides unrivaled visibility into what happens behind the scenes as you browse the internet.

- **Complete Transparency:** See all third-party remote servers contacted by your browser in real-time.
- **Accurate Connection Reporting:** Know exactly how many distinct third-party domains your browser communicates with.
- **Independent of Content Blockers:** Understand network activity regardless of which content blocker you use.
- **Supports Multiple Browsers:** Compatible with Chromium, Firefox, and Safari based on WebExtension APIs.

## Who Should Use This?

- Privacy enthusiasts wanting clear insight into their browser’s external communications.
- Filter list maintainers needing a reliable tool to validate network requests without full browser dev tools.
- Anyone curious about the true network footprint of visited websites beyond block counts or simple indicators.

## Introducing uBO Scope: Your Browser Connection Detective

uBO Scope is a no-frills extension that focuses solely on one core goal: reporting every network connection your browser makes to remote servers. It achieves this by leveraging the browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor network requests, tracking their outcomes—whether they are allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked. 

Where many tools or content blockers highlight counts of blocked requests, uBO Scope shifts the focus to the bigger picture: the distinct remote servers your browser ends up communicating with, which matters most for privacy. 

Unlike metrics that may falsely praise a content blocker simply for blocking more requests (which can ironically mean more distinct third-party connections), uBO Scope shows the real impact on your privacy by counting unique external servers contacted.

### Why uBO Scope Is Different

- **Neutral Observer:** It reports connectivity without influence or filtering bias.
- **Blocks Are Not the Goal:** Instead of block counts, it focuses on distinct external server counts.
- **Works Regardless of Blocking Method:** Passive DNS-level blocking or active browser extension blocking—uBO Scope reports whenever the browser recognizes these requests.
- **Debunks Common Myths:** Clarifies misconceptions about ad blocker effectiveness and unreliable ‘ad blocker test’ websites.

## Key Features of uBO Scope

### 1. Real-Time Tracking of Network Requests

The extension listens to network requests across all tabs and records the outcome:

- **Allowed:** Successful connections to servers.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Redirected or quietly blocked connections without overt failure.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed due to explicit blocking.

This gives a clear snapshot of your browser’s interaction with the web.

### 2. Counts Distinct Third-Party Remote Servers

By resolving hostnames and domains with precise logic using a Public Suffix List, the extension aggregates connections by registered domain, providing an exact count of external entities your browser talks to.

### 3. Cross-Browser Compatibility

Available for major browsers supporting WebExtension APIs:

- Chrome and Chromium-based browsers
- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari

### 4. Privacy-Centric Reporting

The toolbar badge number always displays the count of distinct third-party domains contacted, where a lower number signifies a better privacy state.

### 5. Valuable for Filter List Maintainers

When you manage or build filter lists, uBO Scope lets you see which third parties actually connect, including on devices or environments where full developer tools aren't available.

## Why Does uBO Scope Matter?

### Concrete Benefits for Users

- **True Privacy Insight:** See which domains your browser communicates with, beyond mere request counts.
- **Evaluate Content Blockers Properly:** Avoid common pitfalls in judging blockers based on block counts alone.
- **Real-World Validation:** Bypass unreliable third-party test pages by observing real network connections.

### Common Usage Scenarios

- **Browsing Sessions:** Understand which third parties websites connect to during your normal browsing.
- **Privacy Audits:** Monitor and compare distinct third-party counts before and after enabling blockers.
- **Filter List Development:** Identify domains that slip through filters or require additional blocking rules.

### Transform Your Understanding

Before uBO Scope, users often assumed that more blocked requests = better privacy. With uBO Scope, you see that it’s the fewer distinct remote servers contacted that truly matters. This changes how you assess your content blocking setup.

## Additional Notes and Best Practices

- Remember, not all third-party connections are harmful—content delivery networks (CDNs) and essential services often fall in this category.
- The badge count aims to help you reduce unnecessary connections, rather than eliminate all third-party traffic.
- Network requests generated outside the browser's `webRequest` API scope aren't reported (e.g., native DNS lookups).

## Mythbusting with uBO Scope

### Myth 1: Higher Block Count Means Better Blocking

More blocked requests don’t mean less third-party communication. Sometimes, more blocking triggers more unique connections elsewhere.

### Myth 2: Ad Blocker Test Pages Are Accurate

These test pages use artificial requests and don't reflect realistic browsing traffic. uBO Scope reports actual network behavior.
