# What is uBO Scope?

## Unveiling All Remote Connections Your Browser Attempts

**uBO Scope** is a straightforward yet powerful browser extension designed to reveal every connection your browser tries to make to remote servers. By exposing and categorizing these network requests, it helps you understand exactly which third-party domains your browsing interacts with – cutting through the noise of typical content-blocking metrics and misconceptions.

---

### Why uBO Scope Matters

In today’s web, many pages load resources from multiple third parties—advertisers, content delivery networks, analytics servers, and more. Not all of these connections are beneficial or privacy-friendly. uBO Scope acts like a lens, showing you the complete picture of remote server connections that your browser attempts, regardless of whether they were allowed, blocked, or stealthily handled by your content blocker.

- **Clear Visibility**: See every distinct third-party origin your browser tries to reach.
- **Accurate Metrics**: Understand the real impact of content blocking — it's about domains connected, not just the number of blocked requests.
- **Myth Busting**: Get facts, not assumptions, about content blocker effectiveness and the meaning of block counts.

### Who Should Care?
This page is for privacy-conscious users, web developers, security enthusiasts, and filter list maintainers who want to:

- Understand what external servers a website calls in real-time.
- Evaluate how effective their content blockers really are.
- Avoid misleading metrics and false assumptions around blocking behavior.

## What Is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension that:

- Monitors all outgoing network requests your browser makes when visiting web pages.
- Categorizes these connections into three groups:
  - **Allowed**: Requests that successfully connected and were not blocked.
  - **Blocked**: Requests that were explicitly blocked.
  - **Stealth-blocked**: Requests that were blocked in a way that hides their blocking from the page.

Despite being a companion to uBlock Origin, uBO Scope itself is independent and focuses purely on measuring and reporting, not on blocking.

### The Problem It Solves

Most content blockers report how many requests they block. However, a high block count can be misleading—you might be blocking many requests from multiple servers or a few requests from many servers. What ultimately matters is the number of distinct third-party servers your browser ends up connecting to, because each connection could expose you to tracking or unwanted content.

Many users wrongly assume that a blocker with a higher block count is better. uBO Scope dispels this by showing the actual number of unique third-party connections attempted, a more meaningful privacy metric.

### How It Works at a Glance

- Uses browser `webRequest` API listeners to intercept network request events.
- Maintains data on the current active tab about every remote server connection attempt.
- Aggregates this data into allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked categories.
- Presents a simple popup UI for immediate visibility.

There’s no complex setup. Once installed, the extension instantly reveals all third-party connections behind the scenes as you browse.

## Key Features & Capabilities of uBO Scope

- **Comprehensive Connection Reporting**: Shows every third-party remote server your browser attempts to connect to, regardless of blocking or success.

- **Categorized Outcomes**:
  - *Allowed*: Confirmed successful network connections.
  - *Blocked*: Requests blocked by filters or network errors.
  - *Stealth-blocked*: Requests blocked but hidden from the originating webpage.

- **Real-Time Updates**: Connection data updates dynamically as you browse different tabs.

- **Domain Aggregation**: Groups connection counts by domain and hostname, simplifying the overview.

- **Readable Interface**: Displays domain names and counts in an easy-to-scan popup.

- **Badge Icon Indicator**: Toolbar icon badge reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains per tab for quick reference.

- **Cross-Compatibility**: Works with Chromium, Firefox, Safari with relevant permissions and uses standard WebExtension APIs.

## Why Should You Care?

### Understand Your Network Exposure

By showing the full picture of remote connections, uBO Scope lets you:

- Recognize which third parties are actively connected while you browse.
- Detect if a content blocker silently allows unwanted domains.
- Identify stealthy behaviors by blockers that hide the fact they are blocking.

### Debunk Common Myths Around Content Blocking

- Block count badges on other blockers don’t always indicate better privacy.
- Synthetic ad-blocker test pages give misleading results.
- uBO Scope uses actual network request data from your browser’s API, so insights are based on real-world browsing behavior, not contrived tests.

### Improve Your Privacy Setup

With accurate metrics, you can tune filtering lists, switch configurations, or pick blockers that lower your actual remote exposure, not just boost block counters.

### Real-World Scenario

Picture visiting a news website. Without uBO Scope, you only see some blocks happening but have no clue of the total third-party connections actually made. With uBO Scope, you instantly see all the distinct domains, how many requests succeeded, were blocked, or stealth blocked — illuminating what’s truly happening behind the scenes.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Check multiple sites** to understand baseline third-party exposure.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to compare allowed domains.
- Don’t rely on block counts alone; focus on domain counts shown by uBO Scope.
- Keep uBO Scope updated to benefit from future feature enhancements.


<Tip>
Keep in mind that network requests originating outside browser APIs (e.g., some OS-level DNS or proxy requests) are not reported by uBO Scope.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If connection data is missing or incomplete:

- Ensure the extension has necessary permissions (`webRequest`, `activeTab`).
- Confirm you are clicking the toolbar icon on an active tab with valid browsing activity.
- Some connections may happen in sub-frames or through secure websockets—these might appear differently.
- If the badge count doesn’t update, refresh the tab or restart the browser.
