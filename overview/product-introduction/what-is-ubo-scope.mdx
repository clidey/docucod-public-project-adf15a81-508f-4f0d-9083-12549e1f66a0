# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlocking the Truth Behind Every Connection

When you browse the web, countless connections happen behind the scenes—some expected, others hidden. **uBO Scope** is the companion extension for uBlock Origin that lifts the veil on these network connections, revealing every attempt a webpage makes to reach out to remote servers.

By exposing these connections, uBO Scope empowers you with transparency, enabling you to truly understand what resources your browser talks to and why it matters.

---

## Why This Matters

Modern web pages load content from numerous sources. While some third-party connections are necessary and benign—like content delivery networks (CDNs)—others can track, profile, or even compromise your privacy.

uBO Scope's unique focus is on reporting **all** connection attempts, whether successful or blocked. This insight is crucial for:

- Knowing exactly which servers your browser communicates with.
- Understanding the real effects of your content blocker beyond simplistic block counts.
- Detecting stealth connections that some blockers hide.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to monitor and report network requests initiated by webpages. It uses your browser's `webRequest` API to track these requests in real time, sorting them by their outcome:

- **Allowed connections:** Requests that completed successfully.
- **Blocked connections:** Requests that were prevented by your content blocker.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Requests silently redirected or blocked without obvious indicators.

This insightful classification provides a clear view into your browser's network activity at the domain and hostname level.

---

## What Makes uBO Scope Stand Out?

- **Comprehensive visibility:** Unlike tools that only show what was blocked or allowed, uBO Scope reports all attempted network connections.
- **Third-party focus with clarity:** The badge icon shows a count of distinct third-party remote servers connected, helping quantify your exposure.
- **Content blocker independent:** Reports network request outcomes regardless of the content blocker or DNS-based blocking methods, as long as the `webRequest` API surface is available.
- **Designed for transparency:** Helps debunk common myths like “more blocks mean better blocking” or relying on unreliable ad blocker test pages.

## How uBO Scope Works (At a Glance)

1. When you visit a webpage, uBO Scope listens to all outgoing network requests.
2. It categorizes these requests based on their fate (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked).
3. The toolbar icon updates with the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
4. Clicking the icon opens a popup with detailed domain lists segmented by request outcome.

This flow transforms the invisible network activity into actionable intelligence.

## Why Should You Care?

### Know Your Real Exposure
See exactly which third-party servers your browser contacted, not just what your blocker prevented. This knowledge helps you assess privacy risks accurately.

### Avoid Misleading Metrics
Avoid being misled by raw block counts of content blockers. uBO Scope shows that fewer third-party connections reveal better containment than just a high block number.

### Enhance Your Privacy and Security Awareness
Use uBO Scope as a diagnostic tool to validate your content blocker’s effectiveness, or to understand new privacy concerns emerging from stealthy web behavior.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine you visit a news website. Your content blocker might show it has blocked hundreds of requests. But how many distinct third-party servers were actually contacted?

uBO Scope reveals that only a handful of third-party domains were connected, mostly from trusted CDNs. This insight shifts focus from volume to actual exposure, guiding smarter privacy decisions.

## Getting Started Preview

- **Install uBO Scope** from your browser's extension store.
- **Visit any website** and observe the badge count on the toolbar icon.
- **Click the icon** to open the popup view, showing detailed domains categorized by connection outcome.
- **Use this information** to better understand and optimize your content blocking and browsing privacy.
