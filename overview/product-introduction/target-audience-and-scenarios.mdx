## Understanding the Ideal User Profiles

### Privacy-Conscious Individuals

You are attentive to your online privacy and want to understand exactly which third-party servers your browser connects to when loading websites. uBO Scope reveals these connections clearly, showing you the count and details of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains. This empowers you to make informed decisions about your browsing habits and the content blockers you use.

### Content Blocker Evaluators

If you develop, maintain, or assess content blockers, you need an objective measurement tool that goes beyond simple block counts. uBO Scope provides insights focused on the number of distinct third-party domains connected during browsing sessions. This helps you:

- Validate blocker effectiveness properly.
- Avoid misleading conclusions based on block count alone.
- Analyze how many third-party servers are truly contacted, refining your filter lists.

### Filter List Maintainers

When curating filter lists, you need accurate data on network requests, including those covertly allowed or blocked. uBO Scope's detailed reporting allows you to:

- Identify domains that evade typical ad-blocking mechanisms.
- Support audits especially on devices that lack extensive browser debugging tools.
- Make informed improvements to filter lists, ensuring reliability.

### Users Seeking Network Transparency Without Technical Overhead

Not everyone is interested in or capable of digging into complex debugging tools or browser developer consoles. uBO Scope offers:

- A simple browser extension interface.
- Immediate visual feedback via badge counts and a summary popup.
- Breakdown of connections categorized as allowed (not blocked), stealth-blocked (blocked silently), or explicitly blocked.

## Real-Life Scenarios Where uBO Scope Brings Value

### Validating Privacy Claims

You visit a privacy-focused website or use a content blocker that claims to protect you from third-party tracking. By using uBO Scope, you can verify if the number of third-party connections is indeed low, confirming those claims with concrete data.

On some devices or browsers, you might not have access to developer tools or advanced networking features. uBO Scope offers a lightweight solution to audit all remote connections effectively, aiding compliance or security audits.

### Supporting Debate and Analysis in the Content Blocking Community

Debunk common myths such as block count equaling blocker quality or trusting simple 'ad blocker test' sites. uBO Scope provides reliable data, refuting misleading assumptions with tangible network connection evidence.
