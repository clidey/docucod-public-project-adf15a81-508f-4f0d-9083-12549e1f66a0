# Key Features at a Glance

uBO Scope exposes the inner workings of your browser's network activity, offering unparalleled transparency about connections to remote servers. This page summarizes the core capabilities that define uBO Scope's value and distinguishes it from other tools.

## Real-Time Third-Party Connection Tracking

At its heart, uBO Scope continuously monitors network requests made by your browser, organizing them into three distinct categories to provide you detailed insight:

- **Allowed connections:** Requests that successfully reached remote servers and were not blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Requests interrupted through redirects or indirect blocking mechanisms.
- **Blocked connections:** Requests that were outright blocked by content blockers or the network.

The extension captures this information live as you browse, delivering immediate feedback on the domains involved.

## Compatibility With Any Content Blocker

uBO Scope operates independently of any content blocking solution you have installed:

- It detects network request outcomes even when blocked at DNS level or by external services.
- It leverages the browser’s native `webRequest` API, ensuring precise reporting regardless of your chosen content blocker.

This guarantees authentic visibility into which third-party domains your browser contacts or prevents reaching.

## Badge Status Reporting

The toolbar icon badge dynamically reflects the **number of unique third-party domains allowed** on the current active tab.

- A **higher count signals more third-party contacts**, which may indicate lower privacy.
- A **lower count indicates fewer third-party connections**, highlighting better privacy control.

Keep in mind, however, that legitimate third parties (like content delivery networks) usually amount to a low number.

## Debunking Common Ad Blocker Myths

uBO Scope aids in clarifying prevalent misconceptions surrounding ad blockers, such as:

- **Block Count Misinterpretation:** High block counts don't necessarily mean better blocking; sometimes higher block counts correlate with more unique connections passed.
- **Fake Test Pages:** Ad blocker test pages often generate unrealistic network requests that do not reflect real-world browsing behavior.

Understanding these myths helps users make better privacy and content blocker evaluations.

## Empowering Filter List Maintainers

Filter list authors and privacy enthusiasts benefit from uBO Scope's detailed, real-time network insights to:

- Validate filter effectiveness across multiple scenarios.
- Analyze the presence and behavior of stealth-blocked requests.
- Optimize filter lists based on observed domain connection trends.

### Common Pitfalls

- Do not rely solely on badge block counts to gauge blocker strength.
- Avoid basing privacy assumptions on curated ad blocker test sites.

### Getting Started

Once familiar with these features, use the popup panel to observe current tab connection data live and gain instant privacy insight.
