# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

## Understand Your Web Interactions Like Never Before

The web connects you to countless servers behind every page you visit. Many of these servers belong to third parties — advertisers, trackers, analytics services — which may impact your privacy and browsing experience. **uBO Scope** is designed for everyone intrigued by these hidden connections and who want transparency and control.

## Primary User Groups

### 1. Everyday Users Concerned About Privacy

- **Curious about who your browser talks to?**
- **Wondering how many third-party servers are involved in loading your favorite sites?**
- **Seeking an easy way to see and count real network connections beyond just blocking popup ads?**

uBO Scope shines here by revealing all remote server connections your browser makes in real-time. It empowers you to visualize which third-party domains are active, helping you make informed decisions about your browsing habits and privacy.

### 2. Privacy Advocates and Researchers

- **Need a reliable tool to audit network connections without relying solely on blocklist counts?**
- **Want to debunk myths that block counts correlate directly to blocker effectiveness?**
- **Looking to monitor stealthy connections that standard tools might miss?**

Through comprehensive tracking and reporting, uBO Scope helps experts and advocates validate content blockers objectively, revealing the true breadth of active third-party connections regardless of blocking method.

### 3. Filter List Maintainers and Advanced Users

- **Maintain blocklists or filter lists and need concrete evidence of network behavior?**
- **Operate in environments with restricted access to developer tools or limited browser functionality?**
- **Require a lightweight, low-maintenance extension to aid in refining and testing lists across browsers?**

uBO Scope is an indispensable tool to assist maintainers by providing transparent outcomes of network requests, including subtle categories like "stealth blocking." Its minimal footprint and broad compatibility allow it to serve as an objective lens for filter refinement.

### 4. Users Without Access to Advanced Browser Tools

- **Work on devices or browsers with limited developer consoles or network monitoring features?**
- **Need an easy, consistent way to audit network requests beyond what the browser or other extensions expose?**

uBO Scope fills this gap by leveraging browser APIs available in major browsers, offering a clear and accessible report on network activity directly through a toolbar badge and popup.

## Practical User Scenarios

### Scenario: Everyday User

You're visiting a news website, and you want to know how many external sites it contacts. Upon clicking the uBO Scope icon, you see a breakdown of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains. Knowing that only a few allowed domains appear reassures you about your privacy.

### Scenario: Privacy Advocate

You suspect your content blocker may be letting through more trackers than it blocks. uBO Scope helps you reveal all third-party connections, allowing you to compare block statistics versus actual network activity to assess your blocker’s effectiveness.

### Scenario: Filter List Maintainer

You maintain a list designed to block aggressive trackers but rely on feedback from complex environments with limited dev tools. uBO Scope’s detailed and categorized connection reports help you understand what your list catches and misses, even in stealth blocking cases.

### Scenario: User on Restricted Device

Your work device restricts most developer tools, but you need insight into network connections your browser establishes. Installing uBO Scope gives you a lightweight, easy-to-use overview of connections without requiring advanced permissions or tools.
