# Target Audience & Use Cases

## Who Benefits Most from uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is the definitive tool for anyone who values transparency and control in their web browsing experience. It is designed especially for the following groups:

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Individuals who want to clearly see which third-party domains their browser is connecting to while browsing, revealing hidden network activity without needing to dive into complex developer tools.

- **Content Filter Maintainers:** Filter list developers and maintainers who need an easy, reliable way to verify the real-world effectiveness of their lists, especially where access to in-depth browser debugging tools may be limited.

- **Web Transparency Seekers:** Anyone who demands clarity and truth about what connections occur on visited websites, particularly to debunk misleading or oversimplified claims made by popular ad blocker test sites or block count metrics.


## Primary Use Cases

### 1. Monitor Browser Network Behavior Without Developer Tools

Modern websites often connect to multiple third-party servers, some necessary and others used for advertising or tracking. uBO Scope provides a straightforward, accessible interface that shows:

- All network connection attempts made by your browser, successful or blocked.
- Aggregated counts of connected third-party domains.
- Categorization of connections as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

This lets users instantly understand the network footprint of any site without opening complex developer consoles.

> **Example:** A privacy-conscious user visiting a news website can quickly see how many distinct third-party servers their browser connects to, spotting potentially suspicious connections.


### 2. Evaluate Content Blockers by Actual Connection Metrics

Many users and reviewers rely on the raw number of blocked requests shown in an ad blocker’s UI as a measure of effectiveness, which can be misleading. uBO Scope changes the game by focusing on the number of distinct third-party domains your browser actually connects to, which is the true measure of privacy and blocking efficiency.

- See exactly how many and which third parties are allowed after blocking.
- Detect cases where blockers show high block counts but still allow connections to many distinct third-party domains.

> **Example:** A user comparing two content blockers can use uBO Scope to reveal which one truly reduces third-party connections, rather than trusting superficial block counts.


### 3. Debunk Misleading Ad Blocker Test Pages

Many so-called "ad blocker test" websites create artificial network conditions that do not represent real-world browsing. Because content blockers often operate stealthily, blocking these artificial requests can be both unnecessary and unrepresentative.

uBO Scope exposes the real network connection activity under typical browsing scenarios, helping users and developers understand blocker reliability beyond misleading benchmarks.

> **Example:** A filter maintainer testing their list on a problematic ad blocker test site can use uBO Scope to identify what connections truly appear under normal browsing conditions.


## Beyond These Core Users

While the groups above are the primary audience, uBO Scope’s design and focus also benefit:

- **Security Analysts:** Who need visibility into remote connection attempts.
- **Web Developers:** Interested in external domain dependencies of their sites.
- **Educators & Trainers:** Teaching about privacy, network security, or content blocking.


## Practical Benefits and Workflow

Users can install uBO Scope in their browser (supporting Chromium, Firefox, and Safari) and, with a simple click on the extension icon, see a clean, categorized summary of network connections for the active tab:

- A badge count displays the number of distinct third-party domains connected.
- The popup details which domains were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Users gain immediate insights into their browsing activity and the efficacy of their blockers.


## Tips for Users

- Focus on the badge count for a quick privacy indicator: fewer connected third-party domains mean better privacy.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your favorite content blocker to monitor its real effectiveness.
- Avoid relying on block counts or ad blocker tests on webpages as the sole indicator of privacy protection.


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Do not confuse blocked request counts with actual connections made — uBO Scope highlights why the distinction matters.
- Be wary of “ad blocker test” websites; uBO Scope helps you see what truly occurs.
