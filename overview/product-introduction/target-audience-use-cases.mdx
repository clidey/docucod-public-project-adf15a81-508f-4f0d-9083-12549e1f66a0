# Target Audience & Use Cases

## Who Benefits from uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is thoughtfully designed to serve a diverse range of users who share a common need: transparency and insight into the network connections originating from their browser. Understanding who benefits most will help you decide if uBO Scope fits your goals.

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Individuals who prioritize their online privacy and want clear visibility into all remote third-party servers their browser contacts. These users seek assurance that they are not unknowingly leaking data to unwanted trackers or advertisers.

- **Filter List Maintainers:** Maintainers of content-blocking filter lists who need to validate the real-world impact of their rules across different websites and devices, especially where developer tools or debugging options are restricted.

- **Browser Security Evaluators & Researchers:** Professionals and enthusiasts evaluating the security and privacy posture of browsers, including how browsers handle network requests under various blockers.

- **Users Questioning Ad-Blocker Test Results:** Anyone skeptical about the reliability of popular ad-blocker test pages and looking for a definitive way to understand true network connection outcomes beyond synthetic tests.

- **Web Developers & Privacy Auditors:** Developers who want to audit the external domains their websites contact, analyzing indirect third-party content delivery or tracking through actual connection data.

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. Evaluating Browser Security & Privacy Posture

Imagine you want to confirm how effectively your browser and content blocking setup prevents unwanted third-party network connections. By installing uBO Scope, you gain real-time visibility into every remote server your browser attempts or successfully connects to. This empowers you to:

- Detect unexpected or stealthy network requests.
- Validate the effectiveness of your content blocker without relying on block counts alone.
- Save time by seeing consolidated domains in an easy-to-understand popup.

### 2. Verifying Filter List Effectiveness

Filter list maintainers face the challenge of ensuring their rules work well across many sites and different environments. uBO Scope acts as a lightweight network monitoring companion that:

- Measures actual connections by domain and categorizes them as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- Helps identify domains that bypass filtering silently (stealth-blocked).
- Provides a reliable metric—the number of distinct third-party domains connected—helping maintainers fine-tune lists.

### 3. Diagnosing Site Privacy & Network Issues

You visit a website and suspect it's loading resources from unexpected sources, potentially exposing your data. Using uBO Scope, you can:

- Quickly review all third-party domains contacted during your browsing session.
- Identify whether requests are genuinely blocked or silently intercepted.
- Take informed action, such as adjusting settings or reporting suspicious domain activity.

### 4. Debunking Misleading Ad-Blocker Test Page Results

Many users are misled by ad-blocker test sites that generate artificial conditions. uBO Scope provides accurate real-time browsing data, enabling users to:

- See the true network behavior of blocking extensions.
- Avoid incorrect assumptions based on misleading ad-block test pages.

## Seeing uBO Scope in Action

On any active browser tab, uBO Scope’s popup provides a live summary of domains contacted, divided into three categories:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains for which requests were allowed.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where the network requests were silently intercepted or redirected without explicit blocking notification.
- **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked by content blocking rules.

This categorization equips users to understand their browsing footprint at a glance.

## Best Practices for Users

- **Use uBO Scope Alongside Content Blockers:** It complements blockers like uBlock Origin by revealing what is actually allowed or blocked on the network level.

- **Regularly Check Active Tabs:** Because the network connections can change per site, check different tabs to explore various browsing contexts.

- **Interpret Counts Carefully:** A lower number of connected third-party domains generally indicates better privacy, but consider legitimate origins like CDNs separately.

- **Combine with Other Tools for Deeper Insight:** While uBO Scope shows domain-level visibility, combining it with network analysis tools can provide additional protocol-level details if needed.

## Troubleshooting and Limitations

- **Browser API Dependencies:** uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor network connections. Requests outside this scope may not be reported.

- **Connection Counts Reflect Domains, Not Individual Requests:** The extension counts distinct third-party domains, not the total number of requests. This is intentional for accurate privacy assessment.

- **Stealth Blocks Are Subtle:** Sometimes stealth-blocked domains are not visible in other tools, which may cause confusion. uBO Scope clarifies these silently intercepted requests.

If you encounter unexpected behavior, ensure your browser version supports the required APIs and that uBO Scope is properly installed and enabled.
