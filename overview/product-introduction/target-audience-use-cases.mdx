# Target Audience & Use Cases

## Understanding Who Benefits Most from uBO Scope

uBO Scope is more than a simple browser tool: it serves a specific and distinct set of users who demand transparent, actionable data about their browser’s remote connections. Understanding its core audience will help you grasp how uBO Scope fits seamlessly into workflows dedicated to privacy, filter list maintenance, and rigorous network auditing.

### Primary Beneficiaries

- **Privacy Advocates:** Users committed to controlling their online footprint gain clear visibility into which third-party domains their browsers connect to, regardless of content blockers used. uBO Scope reveals every remote server contact attempt, empowering informed decisions about privacy and security.

- **Filter List Maintainers:** Those who curate and maintain filter lists can leverage uBO Scope to monitor real-world effectiveness of their lists, especially on devices where direct browser debugging tools are limited or unavailable. By exposing actual network requests and their outcomes, maintainers can fine-tune filtering rules with concrete evidence.

- **Users on Restricted or Limited Devices:** In contexts where device tools are limited—such as managed corporate environments, mobile devices, or browsers lacking robust debugging features—uBO Scope offers an accessible, lightweight insight into network behavior.


## How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Workflow

The extension’s capabilities become particularly valuable in specific workflows related to privacy auditing, content blocking, and ad/tracker assessment.

### Workflow Scenarios

#### 1. Performing Server-Tracking Audits

Privacy-conscious users and auditors often want to know precisely which third-party servers a website connects to—both allowed and blocked. uBO Scope collects and categorizes these connections in real-time:

- **Allowed:** Servers contacted successfully
- **Blocked:** Servers where requests failed or were blocked
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Those that were redirected or silently handled

This clear categorization supports thorough server-tracking investigations, beyond superficial block counts or unreliable test pages.

#### 2. Evaluating Content Blocker Effectiveness

uBO Scope helps debunk false indicators of content blocker effectiveness. Instead of relying on generic block metrics or synthetic ad blocker test pages, the extension reports unique third-party domains contacted. This helps users and developers identify whether a content blocker truly reduces exposure by limiting distinct connections.

#### 3. Filter List Development & Validation

Filter list maintainers rely on uBO Scope to validate the impact of their rules on actual web traffic:

- It enables monitoring of remote server connections filtered or allowed under real browsing conditions.
- Allows evaluation on devices where browser developer tools are limited or unavailable.
- Supports iterative improvement of rules based on live data rather than assumptions or artificial test setups.


## Real-World Examples

- **A privacy advocate visits a news website:** Using uBO Scope’s popup, they see the exact domains contacted, including third-party ad providers allowed through the blocker, revealing hidden tracking vectors.

- **A filter list maintainer previews new rules:** They use uBO Scope on pages with complex ad delivery infrastructure to confirm that unwanted domains are blocked as expected.

- **A user on a managed corporate laptop:** Unable to install developer tools, the user deploys uBO Scope to audit remote connections during browsing without needing elevated permissions.


## Why This Matters

Without a tool like uBO Scope, many users and developers remain unaware of the actual network connections their browsers establish. Traditional metrics like block counts or synthetic test pages do not reveal the full picture — uBO Scope exposes the distinct third-party servers involved, delivering clarity and control.

This insight leads to:

- **Improved privacy awareness and protection**
- **Better filter list quality and maintenance**
- **Accurate assessments of blocker performance**


## Tips for Maximizing uBO Scope Value

- Use uBO Scope alongside your primary content blockers to compare real connection counts.
- Regularly check the popup UI to identify new or unexpected third-party domains.
- Leverage it during filter list testing phases to validate rule changes.
- Keep in mind that fewer distinct third-party domains generally indicate better privacy.


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t rely on toolbar badge block counts alone; the number of distinct servers contacted matters more.
- Avoid using synthetic ‘ad blocker test’ sites for blocker validation — they do not reflect real-world traffic.
- Do not assume no blocked connections means no privacy risk — uBO Scope reveals stealth blocks and redirects that traditional tools may miss.
