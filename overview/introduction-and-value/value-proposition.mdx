# Why Use uBO Scope?

## Unveil the True Picture of Your Web Connections

Browsing the internet today means interacting with a complex ecosystem of servers and services. While your browser loads the website in front of you, dozens—sometimes hundreds—of other connections secretly work behind the scenes. uBO Scope gives you the power to see these connections clearly, so you never have to wonder what’s happening when you visit a page.

### What uBO Scope Reveals
- **Complete visibility into all outgoing connections:** see every remote server your browser talks to, including those hidden behind content blockers or stealth tracking techniques.
- **Accurate connection counts:** provides an honest assessment of network connections, avoiding misleading block counts displayed by other blockers.
- **Informed privacy decisions:** with transparency on third-party connections, you can evaluate how websites affect your privacy.
- **Smarter filter-list evaluation:** analyze which connections are truly blocked or allowed, helping you fine-tune your blocking strategy.
- **Real-time insights:** get immediate feedback on network activity for the site you’re visiting.

## What Problem Does uBO Scope Solve?

Many users rely on ad-blockers or content blockers to protect their privacy, but these tools often disguise or misrepresent the actual network activity happening in the background. Block counts can be opaque or misleading, causing users to misjudge both their exposure and the effectiveness of their blockers.

uBO Scope fills this critical gap by transparently exposing all network connections —
including those stealthily redirected, blocked, or allowed — so you hold the true picture of how your browser interacts with the internet.

## How uBO Scope Enhances Your Browsing Privacy

Imagine visiting a news site you trust but then discovering dozens of unrecognized external domains communicating from your browser. Some may be ad networks; others might be trackers or analytics providers masking behind redirects or stealth techniques.

With uBO Scope, you’ll see each domain broken down by whether it was allowed, blocked, or stealth blocked. This clarity empowers you to:
- Understand which third parties have access to your browsing data
- Detect unexpected or suspicious external connections
- Make informed choices to adjust your blocker or privacy tools accordingly

## Breaking the Misconception About Block Counts

Many users glance at a blocker’s badge count and assume it reflects the number of all blocked connections, but this is not the case. These counts often only represent the number of *explicitly* blocked *requests*, not the full spectrum of connections initiated by the website.

uBO Scope's badge count reflects the number of *allowed* network domains, giving you a direct view of connections that are not being blocked. This shift in perspective encourages a deeper understanding:

- **Higher blocker count doesn’t always mean better protection.**
- **Allowed connections shown by uBO Scope indicate potential privacy exposures.**

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Assess Your Privacy Exposure
Every time you open uBO Scope's popup for a tab, you see a categorized list:
- Domains that your blocker allowed
- Domains that were stealth blocked (requests hidden or rerouted)
- Domains that were blocked

This lets you instantly evaluate if your current blocker settings are sufficient or if adjustments are needed.

### 2. Tune Filter Lists More Effectively
Filter-list maintainers and privacy-focused users can use uBO Scope to validate how their lists behave in practice. It reveals domains missed by filters or stealth domains that evade detection.

### 3. Investigate Unexpected Network Activity
When a web page behaves strangely or loads content you'd prefer it not to, uBO Scope helps you pinpoint which external domains are involved, assisting in troubleshooting or customized blocking.

## What Happens Without uBO Scope?
- You see only generic blocker statistics that might mislead your understanding of privacy threats.
- You miss stealth connections or redirects that could compromise your data.
- Adjusting blockers or filter lists remains a blind guess.
