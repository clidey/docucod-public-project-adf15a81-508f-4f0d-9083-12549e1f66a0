# Product Value Proposition

## Unlocking Accurate and Insightful Measurements of Third-Party Connections

When browsing the web, unseen connections to third-party servers occur constantly—advertisers, trackers, content delivery networks, and many other entities contact your browser in the background. Understanding these connections is crucial for users who care about privacy, security, and transparent web interactions. That's exactly where **uBO Scope** transforms your browsing experience.

uBO Scope is not just another tool that counts network requests or lists random third-party domains. It delivers **precise, actionable insights** into what your browser interacts with, exposing truths hidden from typical content blockers and common online 'ad blocker check' websites.

---

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Accurate Counting, Not Guesswork:** Many solutions overcount or mischaracterize third-party connections. uBO Scope provides exact tallies of remote domains and hostnames your browser contacts, distinguishing between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.

- **Separating Myth from Reality:** It debunks common myths in the ad-blocking space, especially around how connection counts are presented and what they imply about privacy or blocking effectiveness.

- **A Complement to Any Content Blocker:** Whether you use uBlock Origin or another content blocker type, uBO Scope supplies supplemental visibility that content blockers alone cannot provide.

- **Unique Insights Beyond Online Tests:** Unlike typical 'ad blocker check' websites, which often give misleading or incomplete information, uBO Scope measures connections directly in your browser session for accurate in-context reporting.

- **Empowering Informed Decisions:** By profiling third-party connections elegantly, you gain the power to truly understand what happens behind the scenes, so you can adjust your privacy tools or browsing habits accordingly.

## What uBO Scope Brings to You

### 1. Precision in Third-Party Connection Reporting

uBO Scope meticulously records each remote server your browser contacts during page loads, categorizing them by whether requests get blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed. This granular data helps you:

- See the **exact count** of distinct domains and subdomains connected.
- Understand the **blocking outcome** for each connection.

#### Example Scenario
Imagine visiting a news website. The site loads content from its main domain, but also connects to ad networks and trackers invisible to normal browsing. uBO Scope shows you precisely which of those domains made requests, which requests your blocker allowed, and which it silently blocked.

### 2. Debunking Common Misconceptions

Many users rely on online checkers claiming to detect if ad blockers are active or counting blocking statistics. These sites sometimes:

- Inflate third-party connection numbers.
- Misinterpret connection types.
- Fail to differentiate between blocked and stealth-blocked connections.

uBO Scope cuts through this noise, providing facts from *your own browser's perspective.* This transparency exposes inaccuracies and helps you trust what you see.

### 3. Supplements Content Blockers Effectively

No content blocker is perfect. They have limitations in what they can detect or block, especially with stealth blocking and modern tracking techniques. uBO Scope fills this gap by:

- Tracking outcomes regardless of the content blocker's internal methods.
- Highlighting stealth-blocked connections that typical UIs might hide.

This empowers advanced users, filter list maintainers, and privacy advocates to fine-tune blocking strategies based on precise data.

### 4. Insights Inaccessible from Web-Based Ad Blocker Checks

Most external 'ad blocker check' websites operate remotely and lack full visibility into a user’s browser state or extension behaviors. uBO Scope works **locally**, harnessing real-time data directly from network events, enabling:

- Access to detailed hostnames and domains contacted.
- Accurate tallying reflective of your current browser session.
- Understanding of dynamic connection outcomes in true context.

---

## How uBO Scope Fits Into the Privacy Toolkit

Whether you're a privacy-conscious user, a developer, a filter list maintainer, or simply curious about your online footprint, uBO Scope complements existing content blocking and privacy controls. It enhances your ability to:

- Audit the real impact of your blockers.
- Identify previously unseen third-party connections.
- Take control of your browsing data awareness.

You no longer have to trust vague statistics or rely on incomplete external tests. With uBO Scope, empowerment comes from clear, precise visibility.
