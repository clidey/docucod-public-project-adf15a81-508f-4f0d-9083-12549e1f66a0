# Key Benefits & Use Cases of uBO Scope

uBO Scope offers unparalleled transparency into your browser's remote server connections, empowering you to understand and control your web experience better than ever. By revealing all network interactions, independent of any content blocker, it unearths hidden tracking attempts and provides clear insights into what your browser is really doing behind the scenes.

---

## Why uBO Scope Matters

When you visit a webpage, countless remote connections may be silently attempted—some necessary, others invasive. Most blockers report only their own actions, but what if you want a complete, honest picture? uBO Scope fills this gap by monitoring **all** remote server connections your browser tries to make, regardless of which blocker or network-level blocking is in place.

This independence makes uBO Scope an essential tool for anyone serious about web privacy, security, and control.

---

## Main Benefits

- **Complete Transparency:** See every third-party remote server your browser reaches out to, not just those intercepted by a particular blocker.

- **Independent of Blocking Mechanisms:** Works alongside any content blocker or DNS-level filter, reporting the actual network request outcomes.

- **Insight into Tracking and Stealth Blocking:** Differentiate between connections allowed, stealth-blocked (quietly blocked by stealthy content blockers), or outright blocked.

- **Accurate Measurement of Web Requests:** Know the true number of distinct third-party domains connected per tab, indicating your real exposure.

- **Powerful for Filter List Maintainers and Researchers:** Offers actionable data to fine-tune filter lists and study tracking behaviors across sites.

## Who Benefits Most?

### Privacy-Conscious Users

For users vigilant about online privacy, uBO Scope is a watchdog. It exposes all third-party connections, letting you verify if trackers are sneaking through your blockers or if your browser is unnecessarily connecting to an unexpected party. You gain:

- Real-time awareness of hidden tracking attempts.
- Confidence in your content blocker’s effectiveness or the realization you may need to adjust settings.
- Ability to separate legitimate third-party connections (like CDNs) from suspicious ones.

### Filter List Maintainers and Developers

Maintainers of ad/tracker blocking lists or network filtering rules gain a precision tool to:

- Debug which network requests are allowed or blocked across various extensions and filters.
- Detect stealth-blocked requests that might evade conventional detection.
- Improve filter list rules based on concrete data rather than assumptions.

### Power Users and Researchers

Technical users, journalists, and researchers can:

- Monitor network outcomes without bias from any specific blocker.
- Analyze browsing sessions to detect tracking persistence and network anomalies.
- Measure and compare the effectiveness of different content blockers transparently.

## Real-World Scenarios

### 1. Verifying Blocking Effectiveness

Imagine you use a popular ad blocker with a high block count. uBO Scope shows that your browser still connects to many distinct third-party domains. This reveals that a high block count alone does not guarantee fewer third-party connections—insight that lets you adjust your privacy setup intelligently.

### 2. Investigating Stealth Tracking

Some trackers employ stealth techniques to avoid detection by content blockers. uBO Scope reports "stealth-blocked" domains, highlighting these covert attempts. Privacy advocates and researchers can spot these and deepen their understanding or report evasive behavior.

### 3. Supporting Filter List Refinement

Filter list maintainers can review connection logs provided by uBO Scope, pinpoint domains that need blocking or exceptions, and validate how changes impact actual network traffic—ensuring higher quality and reliability of blocking rules.

### 4. Navigating Complex Web Environments

Power users browsing data-intensive or third-party-heavy sites can identify unexpected remote connections in real time, enabling them to troubleshoot performance or privacy-related issues more effectively.

## Outcomes Provided by uBO Scope

The uBO Scope popup interface categorizes connections into three clear outcomes:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains your browser connected to successfully.
- **Stealth Blocked:** Domains silently blocked by stealthy content blockers, invisible to web pages.
- **Blocked:** Domains outright blocked by any blocking mechanism.

This classification helps users quickly grasp the nature of each remote connection.

## Before and After Using uBO Scope

| Scenario                 | Without uBO Scope                                          | With uBO Scope                                            |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Understanding Connections | Limited or blocker-specific data; partial visibility      | Complete visibility into **all** network connections     |
| Evaluating Blockers      | Confusing block counts that don't reflect real exposure   | Clear insights into distinct third-party domains         |
| Detecting Trackers       | Hard to spot stealth tracking                              | Explicit reporting of stealth-blocked domains              |
| Filter List Development  | Rely on guesswork and test pages                           | Data-driven decisions based on actual network activity    |

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions & Issues">
<Accordion title="Why is the badge count important?">
The badge count shows the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to during the current tab session. A lower count means fewer third-party connections, which usually indicates better privacy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope block anything?">
No. uBO Scope only monitors and reports network connections. It does not block connections itself but works independently alongside any existing blockers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does 'stealth-blocked' mean?">
'Stealth-blocked' refers to network requests that are silently blocked by stealthy content blockers designed to prevent detection by the web page or other blockers. uBO Scope reports these to reveal hidden blocking.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Will uBO Scope work with all browsers?">
It supports major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari as a browser extension, relying on the browser's webRequest API availability.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use uBO Scope on devices with limited developer tools?">
Yes, especially useful on such devices because it exposes network connection details that are otherwise difficult to access.
