## Target Audiences

### Privacy Enthusiasts

If maintaining control over your digital footprint is a priority, uBO Scope provides clear insights into all network connections your browser attempts. It reveals the full panorama of third-party domains accessed, highlighting what is allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked behind the scenes. Whether you’re an everyday user cautious about trackers or someone managing sensitive data, this tool empowers you to audit and understand external connections.

### Power Users and Developers

Developers and technical users wanting to inspect network activity beyond what standard browser tools show will find uBO Scope indispensable. It uncovers the true behavior of web pages, including requests obscured by stealth blocking mechanisms, enabling precise diagnosis and auditing.

### Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining or creating filter lists for content blockers requires accurate data about what third-party connections occur in real web scenarios. uBO Scope offers detailed, aggregated data about network request outcomes by domain, supporting data-driven improvements to filter rules and helping assess their real-world effectiveness.

### Advocates Debunking Myths About Content Blocking

Many misconceptions persist about content blockers and how to evaluate them. uBO Scope debunks common myths—such as trustworthiness based on block counts or the validity of ad blocker test sites—by exposing the actual network connections happening regardless of content blocker's stealth tactics. This helps advocates, reviewers, and curious users evaluate blockers based on what truly matters: the number and nature of distinct third-party connections.

## Common Use Cases

### Auditing Web Trackers and Third-Party Connections

uBO Scope lists every third-party domain a webpage attempts to contact, with clear indicators of whether those connections were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked. This transparency helps you audit the presence and behavior of trackers, advertisements, and other external resources, enhancing your privacy controls.

### Evaluating Effectiveness of Content Blockers

Rather than relying on misleading metrics like raw block counts, uBO Scope focuses on the count of distinct remote servers connected. This reveals whether a content blocker genuinely reduces exposure to third-party connections or only creates an illusion of blocking.

### Supporting Filter List Curation

Filter list maintainers can use uBO Scope’s session-level aggregated data to monitor which domains are consistently allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked. This insight is crucial for refining filters to achieve a better balance of privacy and site functionality.

### Troubleshooting Complex Network Behaviors

Sometimes network requests fail silently or redirect through stealth techniques. uBO Scope captures and categorizes those events, helping diagnose issues related to content blockers, site breakage, or unexpected resource loading.

## Practical Tips for Users

- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to verify that your privacy expectations align with reality.
- Filter maintainers: examine repeated patterns of stealth-blocked connections for potential improvements.
- Power users: interpret badge counts as an indicator of exposure to third-party domains — lower counts meaning fewer external connections.
- Don’t rely on block counts alone to judge a filter's effectiveness; focus on distinct server counts.
