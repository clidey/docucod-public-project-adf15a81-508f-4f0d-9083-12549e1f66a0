# Who Is uBO Scope For?

---

uBO Scope is crafted for users who seek clear, truthful insight into the network connections initiated by their web browsers. Whether you're deeply privacy-conscious, a researcher investigating web connectivity, a filter list maintainer developing more effective content blocking rules, or simply someone curious about the true picture of content blocking, this tool delivers straightforward, reliable data—even in challenging environments.

## Ideal Users and Their Needs

- **Privacy-Conscious Individuals:**
  Understand all third-party domains your browser connects to, beyond what traditional blockers report. Gain peace of mind knowing exactly which remote servers are contacted when you browse.

- **Researchers and Analysts:**
  Audit and verify the effectiveness of content blocking in real browsing scenarios rather than relying on artificial test sites. uBO Scope exposes real connection attempts, including stealth or blocked requests.

- **Filter List Maintainers and Developers:**
  Easily observe network requests on devices with limited access to browser developer tools, helping to validate and refine blocking rules.

- **Users on Restricted or Locked-Down Devices:**
  Assess what connections are allowed or blocked even when you cannot install developer-focused debugging software.

- **Educators and Security Enthusiasts:**
  Use uBO Scope to demystify common browser security and monitoring myths by observing the true behavior of network requests.

## Why This Matters

Most users only see a simplified 'block count' from their content blockers, which can be misleading. uBO Scope reveals the reality behind those counts by reporting the number of unique third-party servers contacted, including those that were blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed. This comprehensive transparency helps users make informed decisions, improve privacy, and debunk common misconceptions about content blockers and privacy tools.

## Real Scenarios for uBO Scope Users

- After browsing your favorite news website, you open uBO Scope's popup panel to see a detailed list of connected domains, discovering 3rd party connections that may surprise you.

- As a filter list maintainer, you test your latest rules on a locked-down corporate device by checking which remote servers are still contacted despite blocking.

- A researcher uses uBO Scope to systematically measure how different browsers or content blockers handle remote server connections, contrasting real network data with badge counts.

- A privacy advocate shares data from uBO Scope with friends and family to explain browser tracking and debunk aggressive advertising metrics.

## Tips to Maximize Your Use of uBO Scope

- Use uBO Scope in conjunction with your existing content blocker to visualize the precise domains contacted during a browsing session.
- Look beyond the toolbar badge count; investigate the detailed allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domain lists shown in the popup.
- Regularly review the connections on frequently visited sites to identify new or unexpected third-party domains.
- For filter list maintainers, use uBO Scope to pinpoint domains that evade your current rules for further refinement.

## Avoid Common Pitfalls

- Do not rely solely on badge counts from any extension to gauge privacy; uBO Scope clarifies why these are insufficient measures.
- Avoid using unreliable 'ad blocker test' websites that generate artificial requests; uBO Scope delivers real-world connection data.
- Expect some legitimate content delivery networks (CDNs) to be included in allowed connections – a low distinct third-party count is normal and desirable.

## Next Steps

To experience the benefits uBO Scope offers, install the extension on your preferred supported browser, open the popup panel after browsing a site, and review the comprehensive connection reports. This empowers you with the knowledge to audit your privacy, fine-tune blocking configurations, and dispel misleading claims about ad-blocking efficacy.
