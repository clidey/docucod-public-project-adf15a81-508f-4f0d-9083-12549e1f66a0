## A Clear Fit for Three Main Audiences

### 1. Privacy-Conscious Users

If safeguarding your online privacy is a priority, uBO Scope is your trusted ally. It illuminates all attempted and successful connections from your active webpage to remote servers, making visible what is otherwise hidden behind the scenes.

- **What you achieve:** Clear awareness of every third-party server interacting with your browsing session.
- **Real scenario:** You visit a news site and wonder which trackers or advertisers are connecting behind the scenes. uBO Scope reveals these connections, helping you make informed decisions about your content blockers or browse settings.
- **Benefit:** Gain peace of mind by verifying the effectiveness of your protection tools, knowing exactly which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers

If you curate or maintain content-blocking filter lists, especially on devices lacking robust developer tools, uBO Scope delivers unique insights.

- **What you achieve:** In-depth, real-world data on network requests—as seen through all content blockers and DNS-based blocking combined.
- **Real scenario:** You're updating a filter list and need to know which third-party servers are still accessible through various blocking configurations on diverse devices. uBO Scope provides precise reporting to guide your filter refinements.
- **Benefit:** Save time and effort with reliable, aggregated data on network outcomes, helping you improve filter efficacy across platforms.

### 3. Technically Savvy Individuals and Developers

For users who want a granular view of their web traffic, including those testing the integrity of content blockers or web applications, uBO Scope offers unmatched transparency.

- **What you achieve:** Visibility into all network requests' fate—allowed, stealth-blocked (hidden from the webpage but blocked by filters), and blocked.
- **Real scenario:** You’re a developer evaluating an ad blocker’s behavior or investigating unreliable third-party 'ad blocker test' pages—pages known to produce misleading data. uBO Scope helps you cut through such myths by displaying actual network connections regardless of the illusion created by test pages.
- **Benefit:** Validate content blocker reliability beyond superficial measures, debunk misconceptions, and deepen your understanding of web request flows.

## Why uBO Scope Matters for These Users

- **Unparalleled transparency:** Unlike typical content blockers or browsers, uBO Scope reveals the true outcomes of network requests independent of the blocking method.
- **Myth-busting capabilities:** It exposes flaws in common assumptions, such as equating block count with blocker quality or trusting unreliable test pages.
- **Cross-platform insight:** Provides consistent data regardless of browser or device limitations, critical for filter maintainers and power users.

## Tips for Each Audience

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Watch the badge count on the toolbar icon—it indicates distinct allowed third-party connections. Aim for a lower number to minimize external tracking.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Use uBO Scope alongside your filter editing workflow to monitor changes live, ensuring newly introduced rules effectively block intended domains.
- **Technical Users:** Compare uBO Scope’s reports against what your browser or other tools report to uncover stealthy network activity or subtle blocking discrepancies.
