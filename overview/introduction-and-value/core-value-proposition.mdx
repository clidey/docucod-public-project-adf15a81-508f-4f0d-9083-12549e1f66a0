# Value Proposition & Target Users

## Unlock Clarity on Web Connections with uBO Scope

uBO Scope empowers privacy-conscious users, researchers, and filter list maintainers by shining an unfiltered light on every remote connection attempt that a webpage makes — whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked. This direct insight helps users take control of their web experience by revealing the true landscape of third-party network requests happening behind the scenes.

### Why This Matters to You

Modern websites often connect silently to multiple third-party servers, complicating efforts to protect privacy or understand blocking effectiveness. uBO Scope exposes these connections clearly, introducing transparency where users traditionally see only obscurity or misleading statistics.

### What You Gain by Using uBO Scope

- **Comprehensive Visibility:** See all connection attempts a webpage makes, including those your blockers stealthily intercept.
- **Independent Accuracy:** Evaluate connection outcomes regardless of which content blockers or DNS filtering you use.
- **Myth Busting:** Validate claims about ad blockers or content blocking by observing real connection data, not just block counts.
- **Filter List Insight:** Assist filter list maintainers in identifying domains involved in actual web connections for better list curation.
- **Simplified Interpretation:** Gain easy-to-understand breakdowns organized by outcome — allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.

## What Is This Page About?

This documentation details why uBO Scope stands apart in its ability to deliver unbiased, actionable insights into browser network activity. It explains the primary use cases and user benefits of the extension's core visibility features — focusing on connecting the dots between network request data and practical privacy outcomes.

With focus on real user intents like auditing connections on any webpage or dispelling misleading blocker stats, this page provides context on who will find uBO Scope invaluable and the scenarios where it transforms web security understanding.

## How uBO Scope Delivers Unique Value

### True Transparency in Network Activity
uBO Scope listens to network requests and reports the exact outcome independently of other blockers. This independence makes it a trusted companion to any content blocking setup — providing clarity over the real connections your browser establishes.

### Auditing & Myth Busting
Many users rely on toolbar block counts or synthetic test sites to judge blockers. uBO Scope reveals why these methods mislead by showing real connection attempts, blocking outcomes, and stealth interceptions, helping users and maintainers make data-driven decisions.

### Helping Those Who Protect Privacy
Whether you want to audit a webpage’s third-party connections to verify your privacy posture or you maintain filter lists that require precise domain data, uBO Scope brings mission-critical insights to your fingertips.

## Core Use Cases for uBO Scope

### 1. Auditing Third-Party Connections on Any Webpage
Knowing which domains and servers your browser contacts is the foundation for solid privacy management. With uBO Scope, you instantly see:

- All domains contacted (allowed connections).
- Domains stealth-blocked by other blockers or network settings.
- Domains explicitly blocked.

This comprehensive picture helps you evaluate how exposed you are and adjust your blocking accordingly.

### 2. Validating Content Blockers Beyond Block Counts
Toolbars and test pages often report block numbers but fail to reveal the distinct third-party domains contacted. uBO Scope shows the true metric — the count of unique third-party remote servers your browser actually connected to — clarifying which blockers genuinely reduce exposure.

### 3. Debunking Misleading Ad Blocker Test Websites
Many ad blocker test sites simulate network requests unrealistically. uBO Scope makes clear that these tests don’t reflect real-world blocking efficacy by showing actual connection data, encouraging users to rely on practical measurement rather than artificial benchmarks.

### 4. Supporting Filter List Maintainers
Filter list authors require accurate data on which domains are contacted in real conditions. uBO Scope provides domain counts broken down by status, enabling maintainers to prioritize and tune rules more effectively — especially useful on devices with limited tooling access.

## Before and After Using uBO Scope

| Without uBO Scope                               | With uBO Scope                                       |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Blind trust in block counts and test results   | See exact domains contacted and blocking outcomes   |
| Confusion over stealth blocking                  | Clear visibility into stealth-blocked connections   |
| Difficulty assessing privacy exposure            | Data-driven evaluation of third-party connections  |
| Filter list tuning guesswork                      | Precise domain metrics for list maintenance          |

### Practical Tips for Users

- Always interpret lower distinct connected domain counts as better privacy protection.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your regular blockers for an independent measure, not as a blocker replacement.
- Rely on real connection data rather than synthetic tests or badge block counts to evaluate filter lists.

<Tip>
Remember, uBO Scope surfaces raw connection attempts and outcomes. It does not block by itself but augments your awareness to make better-informed blocking decisions.
</Tip>

<Note>
Filter list maintainers should pay attention to how uBO Scope categorizes domains into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked groups to refine list precision.
