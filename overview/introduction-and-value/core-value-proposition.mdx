# Core Value Proposition

## Unparalleled Transparency into Browser Network Connections

uBO Scope is designed to **expose every connection your browser attempts or completes with remote servers**, delivering a level of transparency unmatched by typical content blockers or network monitors. Instead of focusing on simplistic block counts, it reveals exactly where your browser talks to — whether those connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or actively blocked.

### Why This Transparency Matters

- **See All Connections:** Gain direct insight into *every* third-party server your browser interacts with during your browsing session.
- **Independent of Content Blockers:** uBO Scope reports on network requests *regardless* of which content blocker you use, or even if none is active.
- **Real-Time and Reliable Session Data:** Because it taps directly into the browser's `webRequest` API, you see an accurate picture of your browsing session’s network landscape.
- **Understand Privacy Risks:** Discover which third-party domains your browsing touches, helping you demystify how websites may be tracking or sharing your data.

## Reliable Session Data Across Content Blockers

Many users struggle to understand if their content blocker truly protects their privacy or blocks unwanted traffic effectively. Block counts on toolbar icons are misleading—more blocks don’t always mean better protection. uBO Scope addresses this confusion by:

- Reporting **distinct third-party remote servers** connected to, rather than just blocked requests.
- Showing connections **allowed by your current setup**, giving insight into what really gets through.
- Detecting connections even if external DNS-based or stealth blocking mechanisms are in use.

With this approach, users and filter list maintainers get an **accurate and comprehensive picture** of network connections, independent of the mechanism used to block or allow them.

## Actionable Insights into Third-Party Server Interactions

uBO Scope surfaces actionable intelligence that empowers users and privacy advocates:

- **Break down complex sessions** into categories—allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked—to understand the true effect of content blocking.
- **Identify legitimate third-party servers** (like trusted CDNs) separate from unexpected or suspicious connections.
- Help debunk common misconceptions around content blockers’ effectiveness by focusing on distinct connection counts over block metrics.

## Practical Example: Understanding Your Network Exposure

Imagine visiting a news website. uBO Scope reveals the following:

- The news site itself and its CDN servers are **allowed** connections.
- Several analytics and advertising domains are **stealth-blocked**.
- A known malicious domain is **actively blocked**.

This granular visibility lets you confidently assess what traffic your browser really generates and what your blockers achieve behind the scenes.

## Tips for Maximizing Value

- Always consult the uBO Scope badge alongside its popup, which breaks down connection categories for clarity.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blocker to cross-verify blocking behavior without assumptions.
- Remember that **a lower count on uBO Scope’s badge means fewer third-party connections**, a desirable privacy indicator.

## Common Pitfalls

- uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API; requests invisible to this API (e.g., some isolated processes) will not be reported.
- The extension does not block connections itself; it reports outcomes, so complement it with a blocker for protection.
