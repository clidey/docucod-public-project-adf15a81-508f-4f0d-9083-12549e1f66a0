# Value for Users & Maintainers

uBO Scope serves two distinct but complementary audiences: privacy-minded users who want to validate the nature and scope of third-party connections from websites they visit, and filter list maintainers who require accurate, real-world data to tune and improve content blocking rules. This page explains the tangible value uBO Scope delivers for each group, illustrating practical use cases and addressing common misconceptions around content blocking metrics.

## Unlocking Transparency for Users

Privacy-conscious users confront a complex landscape of third-party trackers, CDNs, and other remote servers each time they load a webpage. uBO Scope puts this complexity into clear, actionable perspective by revealing **every third-party domain contacted — whether allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked** — so you know exactly what your browser connects to.

### What You Gain:

- **Full visibility** beyond what typical content blockers show, including stealth-blocked connections hidden from webpage scripts.
- **Clear categorization** of connection outcomes into "not blocked", "blocked", and "stealth-blocked", with domain-level granularity and request counts.
- **Toolbar badge counts** that reflect distinct third-party domains contacted, providing an immediate sense of exposure level.

### Real Scenarios:

- You visit a news site and see a high third-party count badge. uBO Scope quickly identifies which domains are truly allowed versus blocked, helping you understand what trackers or CDNs are active.
- Doubting if your content blocker is effective? uBO Scope tells you exactly how many distinct third-party domains are contacted, cutting through misleading block count numbers.

<Tip>
A lower badge count signals fewer third-party connections, which typically means better privacy. However, some necessary third parties (like CDN providers) are normal; focus on unexpected or unknown domains.

## Empowering Filter List Maintainers

Maintainers of filter lists face a critical challenge: validating that their rules block the right domains without breaking websites, and understanding the real-world behavior of diverse browsers under various blockers.

uBO Scope offers unparalleled insights by revealing **actual network requests observed at the browser level**, categorized meticulously by their outcomes. It serves as a reliable ground truth to:

- Validate the efficacy of filter lists in real browsing conditions.
- Detect stealth blocking events that might affect user experience indirectly.
- Collect aggregated data on domains contacted across multiple sessions for analysis or refinement.

### Practical Use Cases:

- Comparing filter list performance: Filter maintainers can analyze how many domains remain allowed versus those blocked or stealth-blocked, independent of browser- or webpage-level obfuscations.
- Detecting false positives or gaps in blocking by monitoring domains that persist as "allowed" when they should be blocked.
- Filtering noise from test environments by focusing on real-world tab data rather than synthetic ad blocker test pages.

<Warning>
Beware of relying on "ad blocker test" webpages or block counts alone, as these often present misleading or fabricated scenarios. uBO Scope captures real user browsing data, which is far more accurate for evaluation.
</Warning>

## Addressing Common Myths

uBO Scope also plays a key role in debunking prevalent misconceptions about content blocking:

### Myth: "More blocked requests means a better blocker"

Block count is a misleading metric. A blocker showing many blocked requests might actually allow more distinct third-party connections because sites may load resources from a wider array of domains to compensate. Ultimately, the **number of distinct third-party domains contacted is the better privacy indicator**, which uBO Scope visualizes clearly.

### Myth: "Ad blocker test pages prove blocker reliability"

Such test pages generate unrealistic network requests that don't resemble typical web traffic, are often detectable and styled to trick blockers, and fail to reveal stealth blocking. uBO Scope provides authentic insights based on **actual browsing sessions**, making it a far superior tool for evaluation.

## In Summary

uBO Scope delivers **unfiltered, transparent insight into all network connections on a per-tab basis**, illuminating privacy exposure for users and supplying critical data for filter list maintainers. Its straightforward UI differentiates allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains, turning complex network behavior into clear facts.

Whether you're validating your personal privacy stance or maintaining filter lists that millions rely on, uBO Scope offers the trustworthy, real-world data you need.
