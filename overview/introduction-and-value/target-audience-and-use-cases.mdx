# Target Audience and Use Cases

uBO Scope is uniquely valuable for a specific set of users who prioritize transparency, privacy, and control over their web browsing environment. This page outlines exactly who benefits most from uBO Scope and provides practical scenarios where its insights become indispensable.

---

## Who Gets the Most Value from uBO Scope?

### 1. Privacy-Conscious Users

- **What They Want:** To understand which third-party servers their browser connects to, beyond what any content blocker reports.
- **How uBO Scope Helps:** It reveals all attempted and successful network connections irrespective of blocking tools in place, helping users detect unexpected or unwanted data sharing.
- **Example:** A user suspects a website leaks information to multiple trackers hidden behind layers of redirects or stealth blocking. uBO Scope surfaces these connections clearly, empowering informed privacy decisions.

### 2. Content Filter List Maintainers

- **What They Want:** Accurate, broad visibility into remote server connections for tuning filterlists and blocking rules.
- **How uBO Scope Helps:** By providing real network outcomes (success, stealth-blocked, fully blocked), maintainers gain real-time confirmation or debunking of filterlist effectiveness.
- **Example:** While developing rules for uBlock Origin, maintainers can monitor whether certain domains remain accessible, stealthily blocked, or outright blocked, enabling precise filter refinement.

### 3. Users Interested in Web Connection Monitoring

- **What They Want:** To audit and understand web page behavior by tracking every remote server connection.
- **How uBO Scope Helps:** Offers a comprehensive view of domains contacted, including allowed, stealth blocked, and fully blocked connections, enabling analysis of web resource delivery.
- **Example:** An analyst comparing two browsers or content blockers can use uBO Scope to quantify distinct server connections, seeing true connection footprints rather than incomplete metrics.

## Practical Scenarios and Tasks Where uBO Scope Excels

### Scenario 1: Comprehensive Privacy Audits

You visit a news website and want to uncover all external servers your browser talks to during page load — including those hidden through complex redirection or stealth blocking. uBO Scope provides a real-time report of these connections in its popup, categorizing them as "not blocked", "stealth-blocked" (blocked without typical fail signals), or "blocked".

**Outcome:** You gain a full and accurate understanding of third-party tracking domains in play and can take informed action such as adjusting privacy settings or applying custom filters.

### Scenario 2: Evaluating Filterlist Performance

As a filterlist maintainer, you release a new set of blocking rules and want to verify their effectiveness. Using uBO Scope:

- You observe which domains are still allowed and which are stealth or fully blocked.
- You identify stealth blocking situations that may need rule tightening.
- You monitor the total count of distinct domains connected to via the toolbar badge.

**Outcome:** You achieve data-driven refinement of filters, leading to stronger blocking without breaking legitimate content.

### Scenario 3: Cross-Browser or Extension Comparison

You suspect different browsers or content blockers behave differently on a popular site. You install uBO Scope in each environment and navigate the same page, then:

- Observe the number and identity of connected domains.
- Compare blocked, stealth-blocked, and allowed domains.
- Detect overblocking or underblocking issues that block counts alone can't reveal.

**Outcome:** You make objective, factual comparisons beyond misleading badges or artificial test sites.

### Scenario 4: Verifying Real-World Blocking vs. Artificial Tests

Ad blocker test websites often use fabricated domains or tactics that don’t reflect real browsing. uBO Scope tracks real browser network activity as it happens, helping users avoid these misleading benchmarks.

**Outcome:** You base your trust on real-world data and behavior rather than unreliable test pages.

## Why This Matters

- **Transparent Exposure:** Unlike simple block counters, uBO Scope reveals the true landscape of third-party connections.
- **Insight into Stealth Blocking:** Some blockers hide their blocking activity. uBO Scope distinguishes stealth-blocked from allowed and fully blocked.
- **Supports Smarter Decisions:** Whether the goal is protecting privacy or improving blocking rules, uBO Scope informs your next steps with clear, actionable data.

## Getting Started with Your Use Case

1. Install uBO Scope from your browser's extension/add-on store.
2. Open the popup on a website tab to view the domains connected during browsing.
3. Use the domain lists and counts to evaluate network activity.
4. For maintainers, combine these observations with filterlist edits to improve blocking.

<Check>
Remember, the badge count represents the number of *distinct third-party domains your browser connected to*, so a *lower* badge count generally indicates better blocking or privacy.
