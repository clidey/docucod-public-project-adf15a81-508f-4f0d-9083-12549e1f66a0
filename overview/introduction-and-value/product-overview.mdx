# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover What Happens Behind the Scenes of Web Browsing

uBO Scope is a lightweight, powerful browser extension designed to reveal every network connection that web pages attempt or successfully establish. By transparently reporting all remote server connections—whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked—it puts you in control of understanding exactly what your browser is communicating with as you navigate the web.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

Browsers and content blockers often hide the complexity and volume of network requests that occur invisibly. uBO Scope lifts this veil by capturing and exposing detailed connection information that reflects the real-world behavior of websites. Knowing what third-party remote servers are involved is essential for privacy-conscious users, filter list maintainers, and anyone seeking transparent, accurate insights into web traffic.

### Key Benefits at a Glance

- **Comprehensive Connection Visibility**: See all third-party domains your browser connects to, not just the blocked or allowed requests.
- **Accurate Outcome Reporting**: Understand which domains are allowed, stealthily blocked, or fully blocked by your content blockers or network.
- **Real-Time Badge Feedback**: Instantly monitor the number of distinct third-party domains connected right from your browser toolbar.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works uniformly on Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers.

### Who is uBO Scope For?

- **Privacy Advocates** wanting to audit and verify network connections made by websites.
- **Filter List Maintainers** who need empirical data to refine blocking lists.
- **Power Users and Developers** looking to debug network requests and content blocker behaviors.

## What is uBO Scope? A Clear Definition

At its core, uBO Scope is a companion browser extension for content blockers like uBlock Origin. It taps into the browser's webRequest API to observe and catalog all network requests triggered by any webpage you visit. Importantly, it reports the *results* of these requests—whether they succeeded, failed, or were redirected—regardless of the blocking mechanism in place.

Unlike generic network debuggers, uBO Scope focuses on exposing *third-party remote servers* behind the scenes, emphasizing domains that matter most to privacy and security.


## How Does uBO Scope Work?

uBO Scope listens to web request events through the browser's API, gathering data about each network connection:

- When a page initiates a network request, the extension records the hostname and domain.
- It tracks whether connections were allowed, silently blocked (stealth mode), or explicitly blocked.
- The extension maintains session data for each tab, enabling clear distinction of connections per browsing session.
- A badge icon on the browser toolbar dynamically reflects the number of unique connected third-party domains, giving an immediate, actionable overview.


## Unique Value that Sets uBO Scope Apart

- **Transparent Network Request Outcomes**: Rather than just indicating a block or allow status, uBO Scope provides a nuanced view, including stealth blocking states often hidden from users.
- **Independence From Content Blockers**: It captures results even if blocking happens outside the extension, for example, via DNS or external filters.
- **No Intrusive Filtering**: uBO Scope does not block or modify traffic—it is purely observational, ensuring it never interferes with your browsing.


## Practical Example: Using uBO Scope in Your Browser

Imagine visiting a popular news website. Behind the scenes, dozens of third-party servers are contacted—analytics, ads, CDNs. uBO Scope captures and categorizes these connections, letting you:

- See exactly which domains your browser talked to.
- Identify unexpected or unknown third parties.
- Verify if your content blocker successfully blocked or allowed connections.
- Understand stealth blocking events that might otherwise go unnoticed.


## How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Workflow

- **Installation**: Install from your browser's extension store and activate it.
- **Browsing**: As you browse, uBO Scope logs connections in real time.
- **Reviewing Data**: Click the toolbar icon to open a popup showing a categorized summary:
  - Not blocked
  - Stealth-blocked
  - Blocked
- **Analysis**: Use this data to investigate privacy, tuning your content blockers or filter lists accordingly.


## Next Steps

- **Install and Activate uBO Scope**: Visit the [Installation Guide](/getting_started/installation_and_setup/installing_on_your_browser) to get started.
- **View Your First Domain Connections**: Learn how to interpret the popup in [Viewing Your First Domain Connections](/getting_started/first_use_and_troubleshooting/viewing_your_first_domain_connections).
