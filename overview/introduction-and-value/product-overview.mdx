# What is uBO Scope?

## Discovering the Hidden Connections of Every Website

When you browse the web, countless requests are quietly made behind the scenes to various remote servers. Some of these connections are necessary and legitimate, while others may track you, serve ads, or compromise your privacy. But how can you know exactly what connections occur?

**uBO Scope** peels back the curtain and displays all connection attempts by the websites you visit — whether those connections succeed, fail, or get silently redirected. Unlike typical content blockers that focus on blocking requests, uBO Scope shines a light on the full network activity, independent of any content blocking.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **See all connections clearly** — Understand which remote servers your browser tries to talk to, even those efforts hidden by stealth techniques.
- **Independent of content blockers** — Reports connection outcomes regardless of what other blockers or DNS-based protection you use.
- **Unveil stealth-blocked requests** — Detect connections silently redirected or canceled without obvious notice.
- **Verify content blockers' real impact** — Assess the true number of third-party connections your browser allows, key to understanding privacy risks.

### Who Should Use This?

- Users seeking transparency over web tracking and third-party connections.
- Filter list maintainers and content blocker developers needing detailed insights.
- Privacy advocates wanting to quantify exposure beyond blocklists.
- Anyone curious how many third parties a website actually contacts.

## Understanding uBO Scope

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to observe and report on every network request initiated by the webpages you visit. Its core function is to reveal all remote server connections, regardless of whether a content blocker allows or denies them.

### The Key Problem It Solves

Most content blockers and browser tools only show the requests they block or allow, with limited visibility into requests blocked elsewhere or silently handled by the browser. Many connections remain invisible, especially those silently redirected or blocked at DNS or network layers without typical browser feedback.

uBO Scope addresses this by:

- Listening to the browser's `webRequest` events that inform about every network request lifecycle.
- Distinguishing among allowed, stealth-blocked (redirected before final connection), and outright blocked requests.
- Reporting on the number of *distinct third-party domains* contacted, giving a reliable measure of exposure.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique

- **Content blocker agnostic:** Whether you use uBlock Origin, another extension, or DNS-based blocking, uBO Scope independently captures the browser's network request events.
- **Focus on third-party connections:** It highlights the number of different third-party domains contacted, which more accurately reflects privacy risk than raw block counts.
- **Simple, dedicated interface:** Displays the categorized remote domains contacted by the current browser tab, offering clear transparency in real-time.

## How uBO Scope Works at a High Level

uBO Scope acts as an observer within your browser:

1. It listens for network requests initiated by a webpage.
2. For each request, it records if it was successful, blocked, or redirected stealthily.
3. It groups connection attempts by their outcome and aggregates the domains contacted.
4. It updates the browser toolbar badge with the count of distinct allowed third-party domains.
5. The popup UI displays detailed domain lists for allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories.

By tracking at this level, uBO Scope exposes behavior that is otherwise inaccessible or hidden from users.

## Real-World Example

Imagine visiting a news website:

- The main article content loads from `news-site.com`.
- Images are served from a CDN at `cdn.news-site.com`.
- Advertisements come from various third-party ad servers.
- Tracking pixels attempt invisible requests to analytics providers.
- Some ad/tracker requests are stealthily redirected or blocked by your content blocker.

With uBO Scope, you'll see:

- The main site domain under “not blocked.”
- CDN domains also under “not blocked” if allowed.
- Additional third-party domains contacted, categorized by whether their connections succeeded, were stealth-blocked via redirects, or outright blocked.
- The toolbar badge showing total distinct third-party connections that succeeded.

This visibility enables you to truly understand your web exposure unlike generic block counts or logs.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Interpret badge counts carefully:** A lower number means fewer third-party remote servers contacted, generally better for privacy.
- **Remember legitimate third parties:** Some are critical, such as content delivery networks saving bandwidth and speeding load times.
- **Stealth-blocked connections are important:** They represent network requests that were stopped early but may not be visible in normal logs.
- **Use alongside content blockers:** uBO Scope complements blockers by reporting network activity irrespective of blocking strategy.

## What You Will See on the uBO Scope Page

- **Domain breakdown:** Domains contacted categorized as “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” or “blocked.”
- **Count of connections:** The number of times your browser requested resources from each domain.
- **Toolbar badge:** Displays the count of distinct allowed third-party domains per tab.

This focused page empowers you to audit and monitor your browsing footprint with clarity.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If uBO Scope does not seem to report connections:

- Ensure you have granted the necessary permissions (webRequest, storage).
- Confirm your browser supports webRequest API and that uBO Scope version matches browser requirements.
- Check that no other extensions interfere with network event reporting.
