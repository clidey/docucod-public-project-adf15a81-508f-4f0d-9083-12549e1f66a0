# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Your Browser Makes

Imagine browsing the web and instantly knowing every network connection the site attempts — including those hidden behind content blockers or stealth techniques. That's exactly what uBO Scope delivers: an insightful browser extension that reveals all connections websites make to remote servers, giving you transparency and control no matter what blocking software is at play.

## Quick Product Introduction

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to expose the full extent of network connections initiated by webpages. It tracks successful, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections to third-party domains, reporting in real-time which remote servers your browser talks to.

With so many websites embedding third-party scripts, trackers, CDNs, and ads, a simple count of blocked requests or visible page elements doesn't tell the whole story. uBO Scope shifts the focus to the *number of distinct remote servers* contacted beyond the first-party site — a key indicator of privacy exposure and third-party involvement.

## How uBO Scope Works for You

- **Transparent Connection Reporting:** It listens to your browser’s network requests, catching all outgoing calls to remote servers even when other blockers intercept or obscure them.
- **Content Blocker Independent:** Whether you use uBlock Origin, DNS-level blockers, or stealth blocking, uBO Scope transparently reports connections across all these scenarios.
- **Badge Count Insight:** The icon badge shows how many unique third-party domains successfully connected. Fewer connections mean better privacy and less exposure.
- **Debunking Myths:** uBO Scope clarifies misconceptions such as “more blocked requests means a better blocker”, focusing you on meaningful metrics — actual third-party connections.

## Why It Matters

The web is nothing without servers communicating continuously. But when websites secretly connect to dozens of third-party servers, your privacy, security, and browsing speed can suffer. Existing blockers hide these connections, making it hard to assess true exposure.

uBO Scope empowers you by lifting the veil:

- Understand exactly how many and which third parties your browser connects to.
- Evaluate your content blocking tools by actual network outcomes, rather than misleading test pages or block counts.
- Identify overreaching trackers or unexpected third parties lurking invisibly around the websites you visit.

## Real-World Scenario

Picture visiting a news article on example.com. Behind the scenes, the page loads its content but also silently connects to ad networks, analytics servers, social media domains, and CDNs.

- Typical content blockers might report blocking certain ads but do not disclose all underlying connection attempts.
- uBO Scope will present a detailed list of all these domains, categorizing them as:
    - **Allowed (not blocked):** Third parties your browser connected with.
    - **Blocked:** Requests blocked outright.
    - **Stealth-blocked:** Connections obscured or masqueraded by blocking techniques.

You get a granular, complete picture in seconds via uBO Scope's popup, helping you decide if your privacy setup really meets your expectations.

## Key Facts About uBO Scope

- **Independent Connectivity Monitoring:** Works alongside any content blocker without interference.
- **Network Request Listening:** Uses browser's `webRequest` API to catch all HTTP(S) and WebSocket network traffic.
- **Cross-Browser Support:** Available for major browsers supporting modern extension APIs.
- **Minimal Setup:** Installs as a lightweight extension, actively monitoring only the current active tab.
- **Privacy-first:** Does not block or alter traffic; strictly observes and reports.

## Summary

uBO Scope is your window into the browser’s network activity, exposing every attempted and successful server connection beyond the surface view. Its focus on transparency over impression-based metrics provides an honest, reliable way to assess third-party network traffic and understand your browsing privacy environment.

## Additional Details

### How Network Requests Are Monitored

uBO Scope listens to all web requests originating from the active browser tab and groups them by outcome:

- **Allowed:** Requests that succeeded in connecting.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed or were explicitly denied.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that were redirected or blocked invisibly, such as by stealth mechanisms to avoid detection.

This categorization ensures you see a true representation of external connections, even from trackers trying to hide.

### Badge Count Explained

The number displayed on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon communicates the count of *unique third-party domains* your browser has connected with on the current page.

- This is *not* a list of blocked requests or ads prevented; it focuses solely on the remote servers ultimately contacted.
- A lower count here means better privacy and fewer third-party exposures.

### User Interface Overview

The popup window demonstrates the domains connected, grouped by their request outcome, with counts per domain. This concise summary empowers you to quickly assess the network footprint of the current webpage.
