# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

## Understanding the Audience

uBO Scope is designed for anyone deeply concerned about online privacy and eager to gain clear insights into the third-party network requests their browser makes. This includes a spectrum of users from privacy-conscious individuals to filter list maintainers, as well as those evaluating the true effectiveness of browser content blockers.

By knowing exactly which third-party servers your browser connects to—whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked—you acquire a real and actionable understanding of your browsing exposure.

## Primary User Groups

### 1. Privacy-Conscious Users

If you aim to control and minimize data exposure during web browsing, uBO Scope acts as your window into the real network activity happening behind the scenes.

- **Why You Should Care:** Traditional block counts and extension icons often mislead. uBO Scope reveals the actual distinct third-party servers contacted, showing what really happens no matter what content blocker you use.
- **Use Case:** Quickly assess if a website is accessing multiple unexpected third-party domains, helping you decide whether to tweak blockers or avoid certain sites.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers

Building and maintaining effective filter lists requires visibility into real-world third-party requests and blocker performance.

- **Why You Should Care:** uBO Scope offers reliable, granular data about network requests, including stealth and blocked outcomes, even on devices lacking advanced browser developer tools.
- **Use Case:** Identify changes in third-party domains used by websites and validate filter list rules by inspecting live network outcomes.

### 3. Evaluators of Browser Content Blockers

If you want to know which content blocker truly reduces third-party exposure instead of relying on misleading badge counts or synthetic 'ad blocker test' sites, uBO Scope is your objective reference.

- **Why You Should Care:** It debunks common misconceptions by showing the distinct third-party connections rather than just the number of blocked requests.
- **Use Case:** Compare different content blockers’ effectiveness on your browsing habits by monitoring actual third-party network connections.

## Scenarios Where uBO Scope Adds Most Value

- **Limited Browser Tooling Environments:** Devices or browsers that offer little to no visibility into actual network connections can greatly benefit from uBO Scope as a lightweight, straightforward insight tool.
- **Stealth Blocking Validation:** When content blockers work invisibly to avoid detection, uBO Scope reveals stealth-blocked third-party requests that might otherwise be missed.
- **Assessing Real-World Web Exposure:** In contrast to artificial test pages, you get a clear, real-time view of domains your browser touches during typical usage sessions.

## Practical Example

Imagine you visit an online news site and want to ensure you’re not tracked by multiple advertising or analytics servers hidden behind the scenes, despite your content blocker showing minimal block counts.

Opening uBO Scope's popup for the active tab reveals:

- **Allowed domains:** Only a couple of well-known CDNs delivering content.
- **Stealth-blocked domains:** A handful of advertising servers quietly prevented from loading.
- **Blocked domains:** Additional trackers that content blockers prevented outright.

This real-time profile empowers you to adjust your privacy settings or filter lists confidently.

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of uBO Scope

- Regularly check the popup while browsing to track changes in third-party domains.
- Use the distinct domain counts as a privacy score: fewer distinct domains connected equals greater privacy.
- Combine insights with your content blocker settings for optimal customization.

<Info>
Because uBO Scope uses the browser's `webRequest` API, it reports network requests regardless of which content blockers are active, including those deploying stealth techniques, giving you a trustworthy privacy snapshot.
