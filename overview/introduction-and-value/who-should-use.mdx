# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

## Discover If uBO Scope Is Right for You

In today’s web landscape, third-party connections are everywhere—some benign, others potentially invasive of your privacy. uBO Scope equips you with clear, transparent insight into any remote servers your browser interacts with, helping you understand exactly what’s happening behind the scenes. But who exactly benefits most from this transparency? This page helps you identify if you belong to uBO Scope’s ideal audience, from everyday users to technical experts.

## Who Is uBO Scope For?

### 1. Everyday Users Concerned About Web Tracking

If you worry about how websites track your online behavior, uBO Scope gives you a window into the third parties your browser connects to. Seeing these domains in real-time empowers you to:

- Identify unexpected or suspicious connections.
- Understand the extent of third-party involvement on your favorite sites.
- Make informed decisions on which content blockers or privacy tools suit you best.

_Example Scenario:_ Sarah wants peace of mind that her browser isn’t silently leaking data to hidden trackers. With uBO Scope, she sees and counts the distinct third-party servers on each page, giving her confidence in her privacy setup.

### 2. Privacy Enthusiasts and Tech-Savvy Individuals

For users who dig deeper into privacy and want precise data beyond standard blockers’ block counts, uBO Scope fills the gap by exposing not just what is blocked, but what connections are actually allowed or stealth-blocked. This transparency helps you:

- Debunk misleading block count metrics from other blockers.
- Analyze real-world network requests versus artificial ad blocker test pages.
- Gain a nuanced understanding of actual third-party exposure.

_Example Scenario:_ David is a privacy aficionado who experiments with multiple content blockers. He uses uBO Scope to compare which blocker truly limits connections to third-party servers, rather than relying on potentially deceptive block counts.

### 3. Filter List Maintainers

If you maintain or develop filter lists for content blockers, uBO Scope is an invaluable tool on devices with limited access to developer tools or where browsers restrict network debugging. It allows you to:

- Monitor all attempted and successful connections to remote servers.
- Access accurate outcomes regardless of the content blockers and DNS-level filtering active.
- Identify unexpected network behaviors requiring filter updates.

_Example Scenario:_ Maria maintains a popular filter list and uses uBO Scope during her testing phase to ensure the list effectively blocks unwanted third parties, especially on mobile devices without full browser debugging.

### 4. Anyone Seeking Transparent Insight Into Their Browser’s Third-Party Connections

Whether you’re a curious user or a professional needing to audit network activity, uBO Scope delivers unbiased data:

- View counts of distinct third-party servers connected.
- Understand which requests were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- Trust data reported directly from browser network APIs.

_Example Scenario:_ Jordan works in IT and regularly audits web browsing on company machines. uBO Scope helps him get accurate network connection data irrespective of installed blockers.

## Why These Audiences Need uBO Scope

Many content blockers report block counts that can be misleading. A higher block count can sometimes mean more third-party connections are actually allowed, defeating the goal of privacy. uBO Scope shifts focus from block counts to precise domain connections, enabling:

- Transparency beyond the limitations of block count metrics.
- Real-world data on network requests, unaffected by browser tricks or DNS-level filtering.
- Empowered decision-making for privacy and filter development.


## Practical Tips for Evaluating If You Should Use uBO Scope

- If you want to see the domains your browser is connecting to and understand the network flow, uBO Scope is indispensable.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your existing content blockers to get a true picture of residual connections.
- Privacy concern? Start with uBO Scope to spot unexpected third-party connections.
- Developer or filter maintainer? Utilize uBO Scope’s detailed insights to refine your tools.

> Remember, uBO Scope’s badge count shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected to. A smaller number indicates fewer such connections, reflecting better privacy.
