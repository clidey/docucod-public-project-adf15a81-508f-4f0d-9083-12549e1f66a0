## Key User Groups

### 1. Privacy-Conscious Individuals

If you care deeply about your online privacy, uBO Scope empowers you to:

- **Visualize every third-party connection** your browser attempts or completes, regardless of content blockers.
- **Identify unexpected or stealthy network requests**, so you can investigate and manage your exposure.
- **Use the toolbar badge as a real-time indicator** of how many distinct third-party servers are contacted, helping you maintain tighter control over your digital footprint.

This clarity eliminates guesswork and false assumptions about what content blockers are actually blocking, enabling educated decisions about your online safety.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining and improving filter lists requires precise knowledge of what remote servers web pages attempt to contact. uBO Scope offers:

- **Real-time tracking of all network request outcomes,** including those blocked, allowed, or stealthily redirected.
- **Detailed domain and hostname data** to verify and refine filter rules.
- **A dependable tool to validate content blocker effectiveness,** especially on restricted devices where browser development tools may be limited or unavailable.

By leveraging uBO Scope, maintainers gain trustworthy insights unattainable by conventional tools alone.

### 3. Technical and Privacy Researchers

For users deeply interested in understanding network behavior under various content blocking scenarios, this extension:

- **Reports network requests independent of the content blocker's internal mechanisms,** ensuring raw and accurate data.
- **Provides comprehensive tracking of third-party connections,** including stealth-blocked attempts often hidden from ordinary views.
- **Facilitates auditing, testing, and analysis** of browser-network interactions useful in developing new blocking strategies or privacy workflows.

This functionality equips technical users to conduct detailed investigations without interference or bias.
