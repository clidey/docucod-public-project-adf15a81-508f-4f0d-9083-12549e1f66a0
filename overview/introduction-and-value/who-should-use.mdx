# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Discover who benefits most from uBO Scope and why this extension offers unparalleled clarity into the network connections your browser attempts and completes. Whether you're a privacy-conscious user, a developer maintaining filter lists, or someone comparing content blockers, uBO Scope delivers transparency like no other.

## Privacy-Conscious Users

If you care deeply about your online privacy and want to know exactly where your browser is connecting, uBO Scope is designed for you. It tracks all remote server connections — whether allowed, stealthily blocked, or outright blocked — providing clear insight into third-party domains contacted during your browsing session.

- **See every remote server contact:** Know which third-party domains your current site interacts with, helping you understand potential tracking or data sharing.
- **Gauge your content blocker effectiveness:** Unlike traditional block counters, uBO Scope reveals the true number of distinct third-party connections permitted, empowering informed privacy decisions.
- **Badge indicator for quick assessment:** The toolbar icon shows a count of unique connected domains, offering an at-a-glance privacy measure.

### Example Scenario
You visit a news website but want to check if it is allowing third-party trackers. Open uBO Scope's popup and instantly see all domains contacted by the page, categorized by allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked, revealing what your blocker permits or blocks behind the scenes.

## Filter List Maintainers and Content Blocker Developers

As a filter list maintainer or developer, understanding the real-world impact of your filters is crucial. uBO Scope gives you precise network request outcomes as observed in the browser, enabling you to:

- **Identify domains that slip through your filters:** Detect allowed third-party connections to refine your filter rules.
- **Validate stealth blocking efficiency:** See which requests are hidden but still attempted, supporting subtle enforcement without breaking websites.
- **Compare outcomes across different filter lists and blockers:** Accurately assess how different configurations affect network connections, beyond misleading block counts.

### Real-World Application
When updating your filter list, verify whether the changes successfully reduce connections to unwanted domains. Use uBO Scope to measure before-and-after connection counts and confirm stealth blocking effectiveness.

## Users Comparing Content Blockers

If you evaluate multiple content blockers or browser privacy features, uBO Scope provides an unbiased, accurate view of network interactions that any content blocker allows or blocks.

- **Avoid relying on block counts alone:** Block badges can be deceptive; a blocker that reports many blocks might still allow more distinct connections.
- **Uncover artificial test page effects:** Many ad blocker test pages simulate unrealistic scenarios; uBO Scope observes actual browser network behavior.
- **Make better deployment decisions:** Understand how blockers impact real browsing by measuring third-party connections directly.

### Use Case
When switching between content blockers, use uBO Scope to check which extension truly reduces third-party connections, rather than simply showing higher block scores.

## Practical Tips for Users

- **Open the popup while browsing:** Instantly see domains contacted by the active tab.
- **Monitor the badge count:** Lower numbers indicate fewer third-party connections — generally preferable for privacy.
- **Use alongside your content blocker:** uBO Scope complements blockers by showing what truly happens beyond visual indications.

<Check>
Always remember: a low badge count isn't about blocking more connections arbitrarily but about minimizing your exposure to distinct third-party domains.
</Check>

<Note>
Not all third-party connections are harmful; some are legitimate CDN or service domains necessary for website functionality.
</Note>
