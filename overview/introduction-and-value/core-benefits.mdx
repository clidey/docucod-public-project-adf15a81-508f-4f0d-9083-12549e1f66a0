# Core Benefits & Use Cases

uBO Scope is a uniquely powerful browser extension designed to lay bare the true nature of your web browsing network activity. Unlike typical content blockers that focus primarily on blocking content, uBO Scope shines by reporting on _all_ third-party connections — both those allowed and those blocked — providing unparalleled insight into the actual network behavior of websites you visit.

## Why uBO Scope Matters

Imagine browsing the web and being able to see, in real time, every third-party server your browser attempts to connect to. This transparency not only empowers you to understand what is truly happening behind the scenes but also enables you to gauge the actual effectiveness of your content blockers.

uBO Scope’s badge number is more than a count — it represents the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser communicated with through network requests. The extension reports on connections regardless of the blocking or filtering mechanism, including DNS-based or stealth blocking methods, as long as they pass through the browser's network stack.

### Break the Myths

- **High block counts don't mean better blocking:** Some blockers show a high number of blocked requests but still allow connections to many third parties. uBO Scope reveals the real picture by focusing on successful connections rather than just blocked requests.

- **Ad blocker test sites lie:** These test pages often employ artificial network patterns that don’t reflect real-world browsing, misleading users about blocker quality. uBO Scope analyzes genuine traffic, cutting through these deceptive benchmarks.

## Key Benefits

- **Comprehensive monitoring:** Track all attempted and successful network connections initiated by a webpage, not just those that are blocked or allowed.

- **Reveal stealth blocking:** Identify network requests silently blocked by content blockers, helping users and filter maintainers understand the real network impact.

- **Filter list verification:** Validate and improve filter lists by exposing connections unnoticed by traditional debugging tools, especially useful on devices without access to detailed developer tools.

- **Privacy empowerment:** Gain clarity on how many and which third-party domains your browser communicates with, enabling more informed privacy decisions.

- **Cross-blocker transparency:** Works alongside any content blocker or DNS-based filtering system, reporting outcomes regardless of the blocking method.

## How Users Benefit in Practice

### 1. Assess Actual Server Connections

A user concerned about tracking can instantly see how many unique third-party domains a website contacts. For example, when visiting a news site, uBO Scope displays whether the third-party connections are limited to well-known CDNs or if unexpected tracking domains are active.

### 2. Debunk Ad-Blocking Misconceptions

After installing a new content blocker, users can compare the numbers on uBO Scope’s badge and popup to understand if the blocker truly reduces third-party connections or merely blocks certain requests while allowing others that matter.

### 3. Maximize Browsing Privacy

Privacy advocates and regular users alike can identify hidden connections made by stealthy web elements, enabling them to tighten their filters or reconsider which sites and extensions to trust.

### 4. Aid Filter Maintainers

Filter list authors can utilize uBO Scope to confirm their lists’ effectiveness on real browsing activity, especially on devices with limited developer tools. By seeing which domains remain after filtering, maintainers can fine-tune rules to improve overall protection.

## Typical User Flow

1. Install uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blocker.
2. Browse as usual, observing the extension's badge that counts distinct third-party domains connected.
3. Click the extension icon to open the popup and review detailed lists:
   - **Not blocked:** Domains that were successfully connected.
   - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where connection attempts were silently blocked.
   - **Blocked:** Domains explicitly blocked.
4. Use this insight to verify your filter list’s effectiveness, adjust your content blocker if necessary, or simply better understand your network footprint.

## Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope in tandem with your main content blocker to get a full picture of network filtering effectiveness.
- Regularly review the third-party domains connected to sites you frequent to monitor for unexpected tracking or data handling.
- Filter list maintainers should leverage uBO Scope data to identify gaps and improve blocking rules.
- Treat a lower badge count as a positive sign of reduced third-party exposure.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t rely solely on blocked request counts shown by standard content blockers; they often mask hidden connections.
- Avoid trusting ad-block test webpages — they simulate unrealistic scenarios that do not reflect your true browsing experience.
- Remember that not all third-party domains are malicious; some deliver essential content (e.g., CDNs), so context matters.

## Quick Example Scenario

_Alice installs uBO Scope to understand why her privacy-focused browser setup feels slow._

- She visits a streaming site and notices uBO Scope reports connections to 15 third-party domains.
- Upon opening the popup, she sees 8 domains listed as blocked, 4 stealth-blocked, and 3 allowed.
- By investigating these allowed domains, Alice finds some unexpected tracking domains that her main blocker missed.
- She updates her filter lists accordingly.
- Next visit, uBO Scope’s badge shows a reduced count of 8—reflecting her improved privacy.

## Additional Information

- The extension badge shows **the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected**, not blocked requests.
- Works across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers supporting the webRequest API.
- Measures outcomes even when multiple content blockers or DNS filters are applied.

## Troubleshooting

If you notice the badge count is unexpectedly high or low:

- Ensure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions, including access to `webRequest` API.
- Remember some network requests may happen outside the browser’s webRequest scope and will not be reported.
- Confirm that your content blocker and uBO Scope are compatible with your browser version.
