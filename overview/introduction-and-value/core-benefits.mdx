# Why Use uBO Scope?

Discover the unparalleled insights and clarity you gain by using uBO Scope, a tool designed to illuminate the true network activity behind your browsing experience. Whether you’re a privacy-conscious user, filter list maintainer, or simply curious about what your browser connects to, uBO Scope provides accurate, independent reporting that empowers smarter decisions.

## Understand Actual Network Traffic with Precision

uBO Scope reveals every third-party server connection initiated by the websites you visit. Unlike typical content blockers or DNS-based blockers, it operates independently — relying on the browser's own `webRequest` API to capture real network events. This means:

- **No reliance on other blockers**: You get a clear picture of connections irrespective of your configured content blockers.
- **True status of connections**: See which connections were allowed, which were stealth-blocked (redirected), and which were outright blocked.
- **Accurate domain reporting**: Thanks to integration with the Public Suffix List, domains are correctly and consistently identified.

Imagine browsing a news website and wondering what third-party services are involved behind the scenes. uBO Scope records this transparently, exposing all remote servers contacted, helping you truly understand where your data flows.

## Independence from Other Blocking Solutions

Many users assume their ad blocker or DNS blocker reveals the full truth about blocked connections. uBO Scope challenges this assumption by working independently:

- It monitors the actual network requests reported by the browser.
- It accounts even for network requests that other blockers influence invisibly or stealthily.
- It reports results regardless of DNS-level blocking, provided the browser’s `webRequest` API receives the event.

This independence provides a reliable baseline for evaluating real web traffic, uncolored by the nuances or limitations of other blockers.


## Debunking Common Misconceptions About Ad Blockers

uBO Scope is a powerful tool to address and clarify widespread misunderstandings:

### Myth: "A Blocker with a Higher Block Count is Better"

- The extension’s badge shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers **allowed** (connected to), not just blocked.
- A higher block count can paradoxically mean your browser is connecting to more third-party servers — because different blockers report events differently.
- Real effectiveness is measured by the **number of third-party domains connected to, not the block count**.

### Myth: "Ad Blocker Test Pages are Reliable"

- Popular "ad blocker test" web pages are often unrealistic and fabricate network requests that do not occur in real-world surfing.
- These pages cannot detect stealthy blocking techniques employed by extension-based blockers.
- uBO Scope’s direct, network-level monitoring provides a much more factual perspective.

## Real-World Scenarios Where uBO Scope Excels

1. **Privacy Investigation:** Confirm whether any unexpected or suspicious third-party domains are contacted while browsing.
2. **Filter List Maintenance:** Assess the genuine impact of filtering rules by observing actual connection results.
3. **Troubleshooting:** Understand if and how different blockers affect network requests during website load.
4. **Educating Users:** Demonstrate the real complexities behind content blocking, moving beyond misleading block counts.


## How uBO Scope Works in Practice

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup summarizes all detected domains involved in connecting to the currently active tab’s page:

- Domains categorized as **Allowed**, **Stealth-Blocked**, or **Blocked**
- Counts of requests per domain to highlight the volume of activity
- Clear domain and hostname separation, allowing granular inspection

For example, when visiting an online retailer, you might see connections to several analytics, payment, or advertising domains — some allowed, some blocked — giving you a detailed breakdown of third-party interactions.


## Benefits Summary

- **Accurate transparency:** Real network connections reported, not estimates or assumptions.
- **Independent from other blockers:** Works no matter what your existing content blocking setup is.
- **Supports troubleshooting myths:** Clarifies misunderstandings about block counts and test pages.
- **Practical insights:** Valuable for both end-users and maintainers of privacy tools.
- **Easy access:** Quick popup view with sortable domains and counts.
