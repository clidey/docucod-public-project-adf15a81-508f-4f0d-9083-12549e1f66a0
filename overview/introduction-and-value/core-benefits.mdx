# Core Benefits and Use Cases

Discover practical real-world scenarios for using **uBO Scope**, the trusted companion extension that sheds light on your browser’s invisible network activity. This guide breaks down why understanding the destinations your browser connects to matters, compares content blocker behaviors, debunks misleading blockers' test results, and empowers you to investigate all third-party connections your browser makes during everyday internet use.

---

## Why uBO Scope Matters

Every webpage you visit silently communicates with numerous remote servers — some essential, some intrusive, and others unnecessary. These background connections often impact your privacy, security, and browsing speed, yet they remain hidden by default. **uBO Scope reveals these connections in detail, enabling you to see exactly who your browser talks to and how content blockers affect those interactions.**

Knowing these network details helps you make informed decisions about your content blockers and online privacy practices.

## What You Can Achieve with uBO Scope

- **Comprehend Your Browser's Network Behavior:** Get transparency on all attempted and successful network requests initiated by webpages, including those stealthily allowed or blocked by your content blockers.

- **Direct Comparisons Between Content Blockers:** Understand how different blockers perform in real-world browsing instead of relying on deceptive badge counts or superficial test results.

- **Validate Blocking Effectiveness Beyond Fake Tests:** Debunk common myths propagated by “ad blocker test” pages, which do not reflect genuine browsing scenarios.

- **Identify Third-Party Connections:** Examine which remote domains and servers your browser connects to for each tab you have open.

- **Support Filter List Maintenance:** Provide data to help filter list maintainers optimize and verify blocking rules, especially on devices with limited debugging tools.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Comparing Content Blockers in Actual Browsing

Instead of trusting the number on a block count badge, uBO Scope lets you see the **distinct third-party domains** contacted during your browsing sessions and how each blocker affects those connections.

- **Before uBO Scope:** You might believe that a blocker with a higher block count is superior.
- **After uBO Scope:** You discover that the blocker with a higher block count actually allows more distinct third-party connections, meaning it may be less effective overall.

#### Tip:
Focus on the number of unique allowed third-party domains rather than the simple tally of blocked requests for a true assessment.

### 2. Debunking the Reliability of ‘Ad Blocker Test’ Pages

Many websites create artificial scenarios to test ad blockers, but these do not represent real network behavior:

- Such pages use fabricated URLs and request patterns unseen in typical browsing.
- Blockers may operate stealthily, hiding blocking behavior from these tests.

**uBO Scope overcomes this by observing actual network requests triggered by normal browsing, giving you actionable insights into real blocking effectiveness.**

### 3. Investigating Network Connections of Any Tab

Whether you're a privacy-conscious user or a developer, you can inspect all **remote servers contacted by the active tab**:

- View which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or explicitly blocked by your content blocker.
- Gain visibility into stealth blocking mechanisms often invisible to ordinary tools.

#### Example Workflow:
1. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon when active in a tab.
2. The popup panel lists:
   - Domain names of allowed connections
   - Domains stealth-blocked (not fully blocked but hidden)
   - Domains blocked outright
3. Use this data to adjust your filter lists, improve blocker configurations, or verify privacy effectiveness.

## Understanding Connection Outcomes

uBO Scope classifies network requests into three outcomes to clarify blocker effects:

- **Allowed:** Connections that succeeded and were permitted.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests manipulated or redirected by blockers to avoid detection but effectively blocked.
- **Blocked:** Requests denied or failed due to blocking rules.

This granular breakdown empowers precise analysis of network behavior beyond simple allow/block counts.

## How uBO Scope Fits Your Workflow

Inspired by your needs for clarity and control, uBO Scope complements your primary content blocker by providing a transparent audit of all third-party connections across your browsing:

- It confirms what resources get fetched despite blocker presence.
- Reveals untold stealth-block tactics your other tools might not disclose.
- Helps prioritize filter list updates by showcasing domains actually contacted.

> In practice, uBO Scope acts as your personal network detective, keeping you informed about the invisible connections that modern websites initiate.

---

## Best Practices and Tips for Success

- **Regularly Review Allowed Domains:** Monitor which third-party domains are allowed to ensure no unwanted tracking slips through.
- **Observe Stealth Blocking:** Pay special attention to stealth-blocked domains as they indicate sophisticated blocking methods.
- **Validate After Changes:** After updating your content blocker or filter lists, check uBO Scope’s report to confirm the intended effect.
- **Avoid Fake Benchmarks:** Use data from uBO Scope for real-world insights rather than relying on misleading ‘ad blocker test’ websites.

### Common Pitfalls

- Confusing block counts with actual blocking effectiveness.
- Ignoring stealth-blocked domains which may require tuning of block lists.
- Relying solely on blocker UI metrics without network transparency.
