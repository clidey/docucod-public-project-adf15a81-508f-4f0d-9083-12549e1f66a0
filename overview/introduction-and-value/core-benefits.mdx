# Core Benefits & Use Cases

## Unlock Transparency Into Remote Server Connections

uBO Scope empowers you with a clear, unbiased view of every unique remote third-party server your browser connects to as you surf the web. Unlike other tools that might focus simply on blocked requests or filtered content, uBO Scope highlights the essential metric of distinct remote servers contacted — a critical insight into your real footprint across the internet.

### Why This Matters
- **Badge Count Reflects Real Exposure:** The toolbar icon displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers your current tab connected to. A *lower* count means fewer external servers accessed, signaling better privacy and tighter control.
- **Content Blocker Agnostic:** uBO Scope reports all network connection outcomes regardless of which content blocker or DNS filtering is active. It reveals the ground truth of what your browser attempts and achieves on the network.
- **Mythbusting False Metrics:** It debunks popular misconceptions that equate high block counts with better privacy and that favor misleading "ad blocker test" sites as benchmarks.


## What You Gain From Using uBO Scope

### Reliable Insight into Third-Party Connections
Every browsing session, uBO Scope monitors all network requests and provides an organized report of which domains your browser connected to, categorized by:
- **Allowed:** Domains where requests successfully connected.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were silently redirected or stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked:** Domains from which requests were explicitly blocked by content blocking rules or errors.

This distinct categorization helps you see beyond raw block counts to evaluate your overall exposure.

### Informed Decisions on Content Filtering
By isolating the number of unique third-party domains contacted, you can:
- Determine if your current content blockers or filter lists are effectively limiting unwanted connections.
- Reduce unnecessary external requests by identifying hidden or poorly controlled third parties.
- Optimize privacy and performance by focusing on domains actually contacted rather than the volume of blocked requests alone.

### Validate Filter List Effectiveness
Filter list maintainers and privacy enthusiasts use uBO Scope for accurate measurement:
- It shows how many unique domains were contacted with any given filter set.
- This data lets maintainers refine filter lists to block problematic domains without over-blocking, reducing false positives and improving user experience.


## Real-World Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Privacy-Conscious Web Browsing
You want to track how many third-party domains your favorite news site connects to beyond what your blocker reveals. Using uBO Scope, you see clearly how many unique domains loaded resources successfully, helping you decide if additional blocking is required.

### Scenario 2: Filter List Optimization
As a filter list maintainer, you upload new filter rules and use uBO Scope to validate whether your changes effectively reduce distinct third-party connections without breaking essential site functions.

### Scenario 3: Debunking Misleading Block Counts
You notice another extension displays a high block count and touts itself as superior. uBO Scope clarifies that despite high blocks, the other blocker allowed many distinct third parties, exposing gaps in privacy coverage.


## Before & After: The uBO Scope Difference
| Without uBO Scope                        | With uBO Scope                                      |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Rely on block count metrics that may mislead about protection. | View the real number of distinct third-party connections. |
| Trust noisy, fabricated "ad blocker test" page results.       | Get accurate, real-world data on networks actually contacted.    |
| Unsure which third parties remain allowed unnoticed.            | Identify stealth or successful connections clearly categorized. |


## Practical Tips for Success
- Prioritize lowering the badge count as a key privacy metric.
- Use the categorized domain lists in the popup to investigate allowed vs. blocked domains.
- Combine uBO Scope with your content blocker to fine-tune privacy without excessive blocking.
- Avoid misleading comparison based solely on block counts from other tools.
