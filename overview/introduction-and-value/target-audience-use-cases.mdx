## Unlock Transparency for Privacy-Conscious Users

If your priority is protecting your privacy while browsing, uBO Scope offers unparalleled insights by revealing every network connection your browser attempts. Many users rely on content blockers to limit third-party tracking, but without visibility into what connections are actually attempted, it can be difficult to assess how effective these blockers really are. 

With uBO Scope, privacy-conscious individuals can:
- Confirm which third-party domains their browser is contacting, including those connections silently blocked or stealth-blocked.
- Understand the true impact of additional extensions or DNS-based blocking tools.
- Detect unexpected or suspicious connections leaving their browser, exposing potential privacy leaks.

**Example scenario:** You install a content blocker, but want to verify that it is preventing connections to trackers as claimed. uBO Scope will show a comprehensive list of all contacted domains and whether they were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked, giving you objective proof.

## Empower Filter List Maintainers

Filter list maintainers are the unsung heroes who create and update the blocklists used by popular content blockers. Their work ensures users have effective protection against undesirable content and tracking.

uBO Scope serves as a powerful companion tool for maintainers by:
- Showing all network connections attempted within a browsing session, regardless of which content blocker or filtering mechanism is active.
- Helping identify new or missed third-party domains that should be included or excluded from filter lists.
- Offering data on stealth-blocked connections, assisting in refining filters for stealthy blocking techniques.

**Example scenario:** On a device with limited browser developer tools, a filter list maintainer uses uBO Scope to capture and analyze active third-party connections during site testing to discover domains not yet covered in existing lists.

## Ideal for Anyone Interested in Network Transparency

Beyond privacy advocates and filter list experts, uBO Scope appeals to a wider audience intrigued by what their browser does under the hood:
- Developers curious about networking behavior of web apps.
- Security researchers investigating how websites load resources from multiple servers.
- Technical users who want a clear view of all connections and their outcomes in real-time.

Through this tool, users can debunk common misconceptions such as:
- Misjudging content blocker effectiveness based on block counts alone.
- Trusting so-called ‘ad blocker test’ pages that artificially simulate network requests.

<u>uBO Scope exposes the reality of browser network activity in a straightforward, browser-native way.</u>

## Key Use Cases

### Verify Content Blocker Effectiveness

Use uBO Scope to see precisely which third-party domains are contacted during browsing, irrespective of stealth blocking. This clarity helps users make informed decisions about their privacy setups.

### Debunk Misleading Claims About Ad Blockers

Avoid falling for unreliable metrics like block counts or fake test pages. uBO Scope’s raw connection data reveals the truth behind content blocking in practice.

### Assist Filter List Updates and Testing

Filter list maintainers can track real-world connection attempts to improve the accuracy and coverage of their blocking rules, especially for stealth tactics.

### Explore Network Activity with Transparency

Learn how web pages connect to multiple servers, including CDNs and analytics, gaining a deeper understanding of digital footprints.

## When uBO Scope is Especially Valuable

- When you want to trust your blocker's performance but need verifiable data.
- When facing devices or environments where browser developer tools are restricted.
- When you need to differentiate between normal allowed domains and those silently blocked behind the scenes.
- When you want to avoid being misled by conventional network or ad blocker testing tools.

---

## Tips for Success

- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to compare results and get a full picture.
- Focus on the number of distinct third-party domains contacted, not just raw block counts.
- Check stealth-blocked domains to understand blocking nuances hidden from normal tools.

<Note>
The badge count on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct third-party domains allowed, so a lower number indicates better filtering in context.
