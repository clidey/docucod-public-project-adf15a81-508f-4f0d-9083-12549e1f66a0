# Who is uBO Scope for?

Understanding your audience helps unlock the full potential of uBO Scope. This page defines the primary user groups who benefit most from uBO Scope and highlights practical scenarios where this extension proves invaluable.

## Target Audiences

### Privacy-Conscious Users
If you are concerned with online privacy, uBO Scope empowers you to uncover all third-party connections initiated by the websites you visit. It exposes every attempted or successful remote server connection, giving you transparent insight into how your browsing data might flow beyond the sites you directly visit.

### Filter List Maintainers
Maintaining accurate and effective filter lists is a demanding task. uBO Scope's comprehensive network connection data serves as a vital tool to validate, refine, and understand the real-world effects of filter rules. This extension aids maintainers by providing raw visibility into which domains are being contacted, blocked, or stealthily interfered with, helping to improve the quality and precision of filters.

### Skeptics of Content Blocker Effectiveness
Ad-blockers and content blockers often claim superiority through metrics like block counts, but these can be misleading. uBO Scope allows you to see the bigger picture: the number of distinct third-party remote servers reached. This enables you to debunk common misconceptions such as:

- **"Higher block count means better blocking."** Actually, a higher block count may correspond to more connections allowed to distinct servers.

- **"Ad blocker test pages accurately measure blocking."** Such test pages manufacture unrealistic requests that don't reflect real browsing.

### Web Developers and Security Analysts
For professionals who troubleshoot content blocking issues or investigate suspicious network activity during web development or security audits, uBO Scope provides clear, detailed outcomes of network requests that aid in diagnosis and validation.

## Core Use Cases

### Troubleshooting Content Blocking Behavior
When a website or web app misbehaves due to content blocking, uBO Scope helps identify which third-party servers are blocked, allowed, or stealthily modified. By presenting categorized domain lists, users can better understand and adjust their blocker settings or filter lists accordingly.

### Debunking Common Myths about Ad Blocking
Many users rely on simplistic metrics that don’t tell the full story. With uBO Scope, you gain a fact-based comprehension of how content blockers operate in the real world by focusing on unique third-party domains rather than just request counts.

### Investigating Third-Party Connections
Whether for privacy auditing or curiosity, uBO Scope reveals the full spectrum of third-party domains contacted during browsing. This helps users recognize legitimate third parties (like CDNs) that contribute minimal risk versus potentially unwanted trackers or advertisers.

### Filter List Verification and Improvement
Filter list developers can use the detailed data from uBO Scope to ensure their lists are not overly permissive or aggressive. It provides objective evidence to support filter tuning and validating stealth blocking effectiveness.

## Practical Scenarios

- You visit a news website and wonder which trackers or ad servers your browser actually connects to. Opening uBO Scope’s popup instantly presents a digestible list sorted by connectivity outcome.

- As a filter list maintainer, you deploy new rules and want to verify their impact across different domains during browsing sessions. The extension’s data logs provide concrete feedback.

- You find conflicting block counts between content blockers and want to understand the root causes. uBO Scope clarifies discrepancies by showing the distinct third-party domains rather than total request blocks.

- Your content blocker sometimes stealthily blocks requests, making some sites appear functional but with hidden filtering. uBO Scope surfaces these stealth blocks clearly.

---

## Why This Matters

Users need reliable, transparent tools that cut through confusing metrics and opaque blocker behaviors. uBO Scope is tailored to meet this need by focusing on what truly matters:

- Visibility: Reveal all remote server connections in real-time
- Clarity: Distinguish allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains
- Accuracy: Work independently from the browser’s content blockers
- Empowerment: Inform better privacy decisions and filter tuning

Armed with uBO Scope, users move beyond assumptions and myths to a grounded understanding of their browsing network activity.

<Note>
While uBO Scope provides detailed connection data, remember that not all third-party connections are harmful. Legitimate services like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) often contribute to site performance without compromising privacy.
</Note>

<Warning>
The extension relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API. Network requests made outside this API scope (e.g., some WebSocket or browser internals) may not be reported.
</Warning>
