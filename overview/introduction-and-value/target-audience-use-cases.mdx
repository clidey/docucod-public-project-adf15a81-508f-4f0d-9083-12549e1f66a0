# Who is it for and What are the Key Use Cases?

uBO Scope is designed specifically for users who value transparency, privacy, and a deeper understanding of their web browsing's network behavior. This page identifies the core audience who benefit most from uBO Scope and highlights the key real-world scenarios where the extension delivers meaningful insights.

## Target Audience

### Privacy Enthusiasts
Individuals passionate about protecting their online privacy find uBO Scope indispensable. The extension exposes every network connection initiated by web pages, including those that evade detection due to stealth techniques or content blocking at different layers. Privacy-focused users gain a more truthful picture of their browsing footprint across third-party domains.

### Filter List Maintainers
Developers and curators of filter lists for content blockers rely on precise empirical data to identify and categorize potential third-party trackers or unwanted domains. uBO Scope offers these maintainers an audit tool that works independently of the blocking mechanism itself and can reveal all request outcomes, helping refine filter lists more effectively.

### Users Seeking Transparency
General users curious about what their browser is connecting to, especially to remote third-party servers, benefit from the clear and concise reporting uBO Scope provides. This transparency helps users make informed decisions regarding which third parties are active on sites they visit.

## Key Use Cases

### 1. Evaluating Third-Party Network Exposure
Privacy enthusiasts can use uBO Scope to reveal the full extent of third-party connections made by visited websites. By showing both allowed and blocked requests alongside stealth-blocked ones, users no longer rely on incomplete or misleading ad blocker counts. This empowers users to truly understand their exposure and take meaningful action.

### 2. Debunking Myths Around Content Blocking
Many users assume a higher block count means better protection, but uBO Scope makes clear the distinction between count metrics and effective third-party connection minimization. It reveals scenarios where an extension might block many requests but still allow connections to numerous distinct third-party domains—a critical insight for evaluating content blockers.

### 3. Filter List Development and Tuning
Filter maintainers can run uBO Scope alongside different blockers or settings, capturing all network request outcomes regardless of the blocking implementation. This comprehensive data lets maintainers identify stealth-blocked or otherwise hidden requests, tune filter rules accordingly, and validate their effectiveness in real-world browsing.

### 4. Troubleshooting Network Request Behavior
By providing detailed breakdowns of the domains contacted, grouped by allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked requests, uBO Scope enables advanced users and developers to troubleshoot network issues or unexpected third-party activities on webpages.

### 5. Educational Transparency for All Users
Casual users benefit by easily seeing the domains connected on a given tab through the extension's popup interface, helping them understand the invisible third-party ecosystem that exists behind seemingly simple websites.

## Before and After Using uBO Scope

| Without uBO Scope | With uBO Scope |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Users rely on ad blocker statistics that may be inaccurate or incomplete | Complete visibility into all third-party server connections, including stealth and blocked requests |
| Uncertainty about actual third-party exposure while browsing | Clarity about domains that are contacted, allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked |
| Filter maintainers lack comprehensive data to improve rules | Full audit capability to capture and refine filter lists based on real network data |

---

## Practical Tips and Best Practices
- Regularly check the badge count to understand the distinct number of third-party domains active on each tab; a lower count signals reduced exposure.
- Use uBO Scope in conjunction with your preferred content blocker to get a complementary layer of network transparency.
- For filter maintainers, review stealth-blocked domains frequently to detect potentially missed tracking or to optimize filter rules.
- Consider uBO Scope a diagnostic companion rather than a blocker—it provides insight, but actual blocking is handled by other extensions.

## Summary
Understanding your web browsing's network interactions is crucial in an age of pervasive tracking and data collection. uBO Scope is crafted for those who demand complete transparency, effective filter list management, and reliable insight into all network request outcomes. Whether you're a privacy advocate, a developer maintaining filters, or a curious user, uBO Scope brings clarity to the invisible web connections your browser makes.
