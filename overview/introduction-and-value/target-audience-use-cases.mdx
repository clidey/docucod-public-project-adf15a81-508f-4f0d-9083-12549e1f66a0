# Who Should Use It & Why?

Understanding uBO Scope’s value begins with recognizing who benefits most from its real-time insights into browser connections.

## Who Is uBO Scope For?

### Privacy-Conscious Individuals
If you care about your online footprint, uBO Scope lets you *see* exactly which third-party servers your browser connects to during web browsing. This visibility empowers you to make informed decisions about sites you visit and trackers you block, beyond just relying on blocklists.

### Filter List Maintainers
Maintainers of adblock or content blocking lists gain a powerful observational tool in uBO Scope. When developing or refining filter lists, the extension provides invaluable data on actual network requests on diverse sites, helping confirm what third parties are contacted — even on systems where traditional developer tools are unavailable.

### Curious Users and Researchers
For anyone intrigued by the complexity of website connectivity, uBO Scope reveals the often-hidden network activity of browsers with clarity and immediacy. It is especially useful for debunking unreliable claims made by ad blocker tests or misinformation about content blockers’ effectiveness.

## Why Users Care: Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Evaluating Website Connectivity
uBO Scope displays all remote servers your browser attempts to reach, categorized by outcome (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked). This enables users to discover unexpected third-party connections on any website and assess whether they align with their privacy expectations.

### 2. Debunking Ad Blocker Myths
Many users base their ad blocker choices on misleading metrics like block counts or results from so-called 'ad blocker test' pages. uBO Scope exposes the flaws in these assessments by focusing on the *number of distinct third-party servers contacted*, which directly correlates to true exposure.

### 3. Supporting Filter List Development
Filter list maintainers need accurate, real-world metrics, often on devices or environments with limited tooling. uBO Scope fills this gap by reporting network requests independent of other content blockers, providing a clear picture of the connections occurring behind the scenes.

### 4. Cross-Browser and Limited Dev Tools Scenarios
On browsers that limit developer tools or lack comprehensive network inspection, uBO Scope provides an accessible interface to monitor third-party communications, making advanced analysis possible without technical overhead.

### Practical Insight, No Setup Overhead
uBO Scope works out of the box, requiring no configuration or filter list changes. For privacy-conscious users, this lowers barriers to understanding their browser’s network activity.

### Consistent Benefit Regardless of Other Content Blockers
Whether or not you use a content blocker like uBlock Origin, uBO Scope reports the network traffic outcomes as recognized by the browser, making it a reliable companion for all users interested in connection transparency.
