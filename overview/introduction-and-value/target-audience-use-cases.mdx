# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is designed to serve users who want comprehensive insights into the network connections their browsers make. Whether your goal is enhanced privacy, deeper technical understanding, or improving filter lists, this extension offers clear, actionable data.

## Understanding Your Audience: Who Benefits Most?

### Privacy-Minded Users

If you care about your online privacy, uBO Scope equips you with unparalleled visibility into what’s happening behind the scenes each time you visit a webpage. Instead of relying on promises about trackers being blocked, you see exactly which third-party servers your browser connects to—whether those connections were blocked or allowed.

- **What you gain:** Transparency and confidence about your web traffic.
- **Real scenario:** Before visiting a news site, you check the popup to see if many unexpected domains are contacted. A high count or presence of stealthy connections might prompt you to tighten your content blocker rules or avoid the site.

### Power Users and Security Enthusiasts

For those who want control and detailed awareness, uBO Scope goes beyond standard browser tools by showing outcomes of all network requests, including redirects and stealth-blocked connections. You can detect subtle behaviors such as hidden redirects or network errors tied to specific domains.

- **What you gain:** Diagnostic insights and a deeper understanding of web traffic on a per-tab basis.
- **Real scenario:** You test a website with suspected tracking behavior. Using uBO Scope, you identify the domains contacted silently or those connections your content blocker failed to prevent, enabling precise adjustments.

### Content Filter Maintainers

If you maintain or create filter lists for content blockers, uBO Scope offers essential metrics on how many distinct third-party servers a page tries to reach and which are actually blocked or allowed.

- **What you gain:** A practical tool to verify blocking efficacy and to identify domains that require additional filter rules.
- **Real scenario:** While tuning a filter list, you load test sites and check the extension’s popup. The reported domain counts and stealth-blocked sections help you iterate your list to reduce unwanted third-party connections.

## Common Workflows and Use Cases

### 1. Monitoring Network Connections During Browsing

With uBO Scope active, glance at the browser toolbar badge to see the count of distinct third-party domains connected in the current tab. A lower number means fewer external connections.

Open the popup for a detailed breakdown of domains categorized as:
- **Not blocked:** Resources successfully loaded.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections silently blocked or redirected.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly prevented.

This helps you assess if a page complies with your privacy expectations.

### 2. Diagnosing Unexpected Network Activity

When you notice performance issues or suspect hidden tracking, uBO Scope’s per-tab report can reveal unexpected connections or errors.

By reviewing the domains and counts shown, you can correlate suspicious network activity to specific third parties, then adjust blocking rules or investigate further.

### 3. Evaluating Content Blocker Effectiveness

Rather than relying on block counts alone, use uBO Scope to understand the true breadth of third-party connections allowed or blocked.

This enables:
- Meaningful comparisons between different content blockers.
- Avoiding common myths about blocker reliability.

### 4. Supporting Filter List Updates

Filter list maintainers can leverage uBO Scope data to identify:
- Domains that should be included to reduce unwanted connections.
- Stealth connections that are harder to detect with conventional methods.

By iterating based on uBO Scope insights, filter lists become more robust in real browsing scenarios.

## Why Should You Care?

## Practical Tips for These Users

- Keep the extension visible in your toolbar to monitor counts as you browse.
- Regularly open the popup on sites you trust less to inspect connection details.
- For maintainers, combine uBO Scope data with automated testing scripts for richer analysis.
- Remember that a lower domain count is generally better—it means fewer third parties involved.
