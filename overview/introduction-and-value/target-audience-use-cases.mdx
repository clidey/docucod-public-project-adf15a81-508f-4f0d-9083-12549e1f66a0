## Who Is uBO Scope For?

Whether you're seeking a deeper understanding of the hidden network connections a webpage makes, maintaining filter lists for content blockers, or analyzing real-world browsing traffic under strict privacy settings, uBO Scope is tailored to deliver clear, actionable insights.

### Privacy-Conscious Web Users

If you care about protecting your browsing habits and understanding where your data is sent, uBO Scope exposes every network connection a website attempts, giving you full visibility into third-party contact points—whether those connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or explicitly blocked.

### Filter List Maintainers

For those who create or refine filter lists used by content blocking tools, uBO Scope serves as an indispensable aid. It provides exact counts and outcomes of third-party network requests, directly informed by actual browser activity rather than artificial tests or simulations. This helps maintainers validate the real-world impact of their rules.

### Web Researchers and Analysts

Researchers studying online tracking, privacy leaks, and network behaviors will find uBO Scope uniquely capable of capturing authentic browser traffic patterns. It enables examination of requests in live browsing contexts, including environments locked down by multiple layers of content blockers or network controls.

## Typical Use Cases Where uBO Scope Excels

### Diagnosing Third-Party Requests on Websites

Imagine you're wondering how many distinct third-party servers a news site contacts and which of these requests are allowed or blocked by your content blocker. uBO Scope provides a detailed breakdown, showing exact counts per domain and differentiating outcomes—allowing you to pinpoint potential privacy risks with confidence.

### Validating Content Block Efficiency

Many users are misled by block count badges that inflate blocking claims. uBO Scope helps debunk these misconceptions by revealing the actual distinct third-party domains contacted and which requests ultimately succeeded. This empowers you to assess blockers on meaningful, privacy-centric metrics.

### Examining Real Browser Traffic in Restricted Environments

Whether you use DNS filtering, stealth blocking, or multiple layers of content blockers, uBO Scope collects and displays network connection data as reported by the browser's native APIs. This real-time capture enables auditing under conditions where typical testing sites or tools fail to deliver accurate data.

### Supplementing Privacy Tools in Everyday Browsing

By integrating uBO Scope alongside your favorite content blocker, you gain transparency into your privacy state without compromise. Quickly access counts of allowed, stealth, and blocked domains directly from your browser toolbar and within the extension popup interface.
