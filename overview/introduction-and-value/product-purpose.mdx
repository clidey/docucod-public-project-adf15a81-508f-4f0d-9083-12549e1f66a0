# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover the True Picture of Your Browser's Remote Connections

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to reveal the real network activity of your browser. It tracks and reports every connection attempt—successful or blocked—to remote servers, exposing which third-party domains your browser communicates with, regardless of your content blocker configuration.

### Why This Matters
Understanding which third-party servers your browser is reaching out to is critical for privacy awareness, transparency in web behavior, and evaluating the effectiveness of content blocking tools. uBO Scope sheds light on this often hidden network activity, helping you make informed decisions about your browsing environment.

### Key Value Propositions
- **Complete Remote Connection Visibility:** See all remote servers your browser attempts to contact, including those connections stealth-blocked or blocked by content blockers.
- **Accurate Badge Count:** The toolbar icon displays the number of distinct third-party servers connected per tab, helping you quickly gauge third-party exposure.
- **Independent of Content Blockers:** Reports connection outcomes regardless of other content blockers or DNS-level filtering, provided network requests pass through the browser's WebRequest API.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Available for Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari, using consistent reporting strategies across platforms.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?
- Privacy-conscious users wanting transparency on network activity.
- Filter list maintainers and content blocking researchers validating remote server connections.
- Developers and testers looking to understand network requests made by webpages under various blocking conditions.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a companion extension to uBlock Origin (and similar blockers) that focuses solely on the measurement and reporting of network connection activity from your browser. Rather than blocking or filtering, it listens to browser network events and provides insights about outgoing connections.

It taps into the browser's `webRequest` API to log network requests, categorizing outcomes as allowed, stealth-blocked (requests silently blocked by a content blocker), or fully blocked.

### Core Purpose
- To reveal the *actual* interactions your browser has with remote servers.
- To count and report the number of unique third-party domains connected during a browsing session.
- To provide a neutral, evidence-based view of network requests beyond what typical content blockers report.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?
- It reports the final outcome of network requests using robust browser events like onBeforeRedirect, onErrorOccurred, and onResponseStarted.
- It is designed to be minimally invasive, without impacting browser performance or interfering with existing content blockers.
- Uses an intelligent domain and hostname parsing mechanism backed by the Public Suffix List to accurately categorize connections.

## How uBO Scope Works: A User-Centric View

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Monitoring Network Requests:** As you browse, the extension listens to every network request your browser initiates.
2. **Outcome Categorization:** Each request is evaluated for its outcome—whether it succeeded, was redirected, or blocked.
3. **Domain Grouping:** Hostnames from URLs are analyzed against the Public Suffix List, enabling grouping by registrable domains.
4. **Tab-Specific Tracking:** These connection data are associated with the tab where the request originated.
5. **Badge Update:** The badge on the browser toolbar icon updates dynamically to show the count of distinct third-party domains connected.
6. **Popup Presentation:** Clicking the icon opens a popup that displays detailed counts and lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains, providing a clear snapshot of network activity.

### Real-World Scenario
Imagine visiting a news website that loads various ads and embedded content from multiple third-party sources. uBO Scope will track connections to each external server — showing you exactly which ones were allowed through, which were blocked outright, and which were stealth-blocked without your knowledge. This empowers you to understand your actual network exposure.

<Tip>
The badge number represents **distinct third-party domains** connected to, not total requests. A lower badge count means fewer third-party exposures.

## Key Features of uBO Scope

| Feature                             | User Benefit                                                   | Description                                          |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Comprehensive Connection Tracking** | Full visibility into every network connection attempt across all tabs | Listens to all HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS requests via browser WebRequest API. |
| **Domain-based Aggregation**       | Understand network exposure by domain rather than individual URLs | Uses Public Suffix List parsing to group hostnames into registrable domains. |
| **Outcome Classification**         | Distinguish allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections | Helps identify stealth blocking and possible network leaks. |
| **Dynamic Browser Action Badge**   | Immediately see the number of third-party connections per tab | Updates badge count to reflect live browsing activity. |
| **Popup Dashboard**                 | Get detailed, tab-specific connection summaries and counts    | Breaks down connections by category with clear counts and domain names. |
| **Cross Browser Support**           | Works in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari for consistent experience | Supports browser-specific APIs and permissions. |

## Why Use uBO Scope? Benefits & Use Cases

### Primary Benefits
- **Gain Transparent Insight:** No more guessing which third-party servers are contacted behind the scenes.
- **Evaluate Content Blocker Effectiveness:** See if your blocker is effectively reducing connections or just hiding requests.
- **Privacy Awareness:** Identify excessive third-party connections on visited websites.
- **Filter List Testing:** By observing which servers are stealth-blocked or blocked, filter list maintainers can verify their impact.

### Common Use Cases
1. **Privacy Auditing:** Confirm that sensitive browsing does not leak connections to unwanted third parties.
2. **Content Blocker Comparison:** Understand that a higher block count does not necessarily mean better blocking — lower third-party domain count is more meaningful.
3. **Website Analysis:** Analyze network reach of legitimate sites, separating necessary CDNs from tracking domains.
4. **Technical Troubleshooting:** Diagnose unexpected network connections during web development or testing.

### Before and After Example
| Without uBO Scope                           | With uBO Scope                              |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Blind to network requests and origins      | Know exactly which remote servers are contacted by each tab |
| Rely on unreliable block count indicators  | Visual badge count indicating unique third-party domains connected |
| Misinformation from ad blocker test pages  | Facts backed by the browser's official WebRequest API events |

<Tip>
Remember that stealth-blocked requests are connections blocked by content blockers without being publicly apparent to websites or some test pages.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

<Tip>
If you do not see a badge count or popup data:
- Ensure your browser grants the extension permission to use the WebRequest API.
- Verify you have active network activity in the tab—no data will show for pages without outgoing requests.
- Some requests outside browser scope (e.g., DNS-level blocking) will not be visible.
</Tip>

<Warning>
uBO Scope accuracy depends on your browser exposing network requests via WebRequest API. Requests made from outside (e.g., native apps, OS-level DNS blocks) are not captured.
</Warning>
