# What is uBO Scope?

Discover the hidden network activity behind the websites you visit with uBO Scope — a straightforward extension that unveils every connection attempt your browser makes to remote servers. Whether these connections are allowed, blocked by content blockers, or stealth-blocked, uBO Scope provides unparalleled transparency into your browser's network behavior.

## Understanding uBO Scope's Purpose

At its core, uBO Scope is designed to reveal all network connections initiated by web pages, offering a clear picture of the numerous third-party servers your browser interacts with while you surf the web. This insight is crucial because many tracking and advertising systems rely on third-party connections that happen silently in the background.

Unlike regular browser tools or content blockers, uBO Scope reports all connection attempts—successful or not—helping you understand not just what is ultimately loaded, but what has been blocked or stealthily handled by your content blockers or DNS filters.

### Why This Transparency Matters

Websites today often load resources and scripts from multiple third-party domains, some of which may affect your privacy or compromise security. Seeing the full scope of network requests puts you in control and allows informed decisions about content blocking strategies.

Furthermore, uBO Scope debunks common misconceptions about content blockers and ad blocker tests, shedding light on what really determines network privacy.

## How uBO Scope Works for You

• **Real-Time Network Request Insights:** uBO Scope taps into your browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network requests generated by the page you're viewing.

• **Comprehensive Reach:** It includes connections whether they're allowed, blocked explicitly by your content blocker, or stealth-blocked (hidden to prevent web page breakage or detection).

• **Third-Party Server Focus:** The toolbar badge count reflects the number of **distinct third-party remote servers contacted**, making it easy to track how many unique external domains your browser is engaging with.

### Important Notes:

- A **lower badge count** means fewer distinct third-party connections, which typically signals better privacy.
- Not all third-party servers are harmful; legitimate services like CDN providers might be included.
- Network requests outside the `webRequest` API scope cannot be detected by uBO Scope.

## Tackling Myths Around Content Blocking

### Myth 1: "Higher Block Count Means Better Blocking"

uBO Scope reveals that a higher block count badge on a content blocker does not necessarily mean better protection. Sometimes, content blockers that allow connections to more distinct third-party servers may have a higher block count yet provide less privacy.

### Myth 2: "Ad Blocker Test Webpages Are Reliable"

Many so-called ad blocker test sites create artificial network requests that don't resemble real-world browsing scenarios and can't see stealth-blocked connections. uBO Scope exposes these tests as unreliable benchmarks.

## Real-World Scenarios

Imagine browsing a news website:

1. The site loads its main content domain.
2. Several third-party services are contacted, including ad networks, analytics, social media widgets, and CDN providers.
3. Your content blocker might block or stealth-block some connections, but others get through.
4. uBO Scope shows you the full list of these third-party domains, categorized by allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

Using this information, you can fine-tune your blocking rules, verify your privacy posture, or simply understand the complexity of modern web browsing.

- **How uBO Scope Works (Architecture Overview):** Understand the underlying mechanisms.

## Quick Start:

- Install uBO Scope from your browser's extension store.
- Visit a website.
- Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to view all remote server connections.
- See the badge count update dynamically reflecting distinct third-party domains contacted.

## Practical Tips

- Use uBO Scope to monitor new websites or services you're exploring.
- Pay attention to 'stealth-blocked' domains for subtle trackers that evade detection.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with your content blocker for custom rule creation.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your browser version supports the `webRequest` API fully (uBO Scope requires recent Chromium, Firefox, or Safari versions).
- If the badge is not updating, check that the extension has the necessary permissions.
- Remember, some network connections initiated outside standard webRequest monitoring (e.g., certain WebSocket connections in some browsers) may not be visible.

## Summary

uBO Scope empowers you by exposing the full network connection footprint of your browsing activity. By understanding every remote server your browser interacts with, you gain transparency, debunk misconceptions, and improve your content-blocking approach for better privacy.
