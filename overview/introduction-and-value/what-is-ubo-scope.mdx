# What is uBO Scope?

## Unveiling Every Connection Your Browser Makes

When you browse the web, countless invisible connections happen behind the scenes — your browser attempts to reach remote servers that serve images, scripts, videos, and other resources. But how much do you really know about those connections? _uBO Scope_ is a simple yet powerful extension designed to expose every attempted and successful network connection to third-party servers in your browser.

By bringing this network activity to light, uBO Scope empowers you to understand who your browser is talking to and why controlling these connections matters for your privacy and web browsing performance.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **See every remote connection:** Discover all servers your browser tries to contact, not just the blocked ones.
- **Understand third-party involvement:** View distinct third-party servers making network requests on the pages you visit.
- **Gauge content blocker effectiveness:** Identify which third parties are truly allowed or blocked, beyond mere block counts.
- **Get usable insights in real time:** Toolbar badge and popup provide clear visibility for each active tab.
- **Aid filter list maintainers:** Helps improve content blocker lists by providing accurate connection data.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

This tool is invaluable for privacy-conscious users, web developers, and filter list maintainers aiming to track and control third-party content loaded by websites.

## What is uBO Scope?

### A Transparent Network Monitor for Your Browser

_uBO Scope_ is a lightweight browser extension that reveals every connection attempt to remote servers made by web pages you visit. Unlike generic content blockers which show only blocked or counted requests, uBO Scope reports the **exact outcome** of these network requests — whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

It provides context by focusing on **third-party remote servers**, i.e., servers different from the main website’s domain. The extension leverages browser's `webRequest` API to listen to all network traffic events, regardless of which content blocker or DNS-based blocker is in effect.

### The Core Problem It Solves

Users often face opaque scenarios where content blockers report varying block counts or webpages show inconsistent behaviors. Many believe that a higher block count means better protection, but uBO Scope unravels this myth by showing the _number of distinct third-party servers actually reached_, which is the crucial metric for privacy and tracking exposure.

Moreover, typical "ad blocker test" webpages fail to evaluate blocker reliability properly due to fabricated network activity. uBO Scope provides factual network insights from **actual browsing activity**, helping users and developers separate valid blocking from illusions.

### What Makes It Unique?

- **Real-time third-party server visibility:** Shows exact third-party domains contacted on a per-tab basis.
- **Independent of content blocker details:** Works alongside any content blocker or DNS blocking mechanism.
- **Focus on server distinctness, not raw block counts:** Highlights privacy exposure more reliably.
- **Simple, non-intrusive interface:** Badge count and popup layout focus on actionable information.
- **Open-source with filter list improvement in mind:** Designed with minimal updates but extended future features for maintainers.

## How uBO Scope Works

At its core, uBO Scope listens to network request events such as:

- Request redirections
- Connection errors or blocked requests
- Successful requests

For each active browser tab, the extension tracks the hostnames and maps them to their base domains using the Public Suffix List. It categorizes these third-party requests into:

- **Allowed:** Requests that succeeded
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that were redirected in subtle ways
- **Blocked:** Requests that encountered errors or explicit blocking

The distinct count of allowed third-party domains is displayed as a badge on the toolbar icon. Clicking it reveals a popup listing all connected domains in categorized sections.

<Tip>
_For privacy, a lower badge count is more desirable; it means fewer third-party remote servers have been contacted._
</Tip>

- Displays the count of **distinct allowed third-party domains** per active tab as a subtle visual cue.

### Popup View
- Detailed categorized lists of domains contacted, showing counts of requests per domain.

### Compatibility
- Works across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers.
- Independent of any content blockers active on your browser.

### Public Suffix List Integration
- Uses an up-to-date Public Suffix List to correctly identify base domains despite complex subdomains.

### Persistent Session Storage

## Why Should You Care?

### Deliverable Benefits

- **Improve Privacy Awareness:** Understand which third parties your browser connects to and evaluate if these connections align with your privacy goals.
- **Verify Content Blocker Effectiveness:** Measure the real impact of content blockers by number of unique connections blocked vs allowed.
- **Boost Web Performance Insight:** Fewer third-party connections typically mean faster page load times and better browsing experience.
- **Filter List Validation:** If you maintain or follow filter lists, uBO Scope helps validate their impact on network requests.

### Real-World Use Cases

- Developers auditing their sites to identify unexpected or unnecessary third-party calls.
- Privacy enthusiasts actively monitoring trackers and reducing exposure.
- Filter list maintainers confirming rules behavior without relying on unreliable test websites.

## Getting Started Preview

### Quick Start

1. Install uBO Scope from your browser's official extension store:
   - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
   - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)
   - Safari (from official sources supporting WebExtensions)

2. After installation, click the uBO Scope icon in your toolbar while browsing.
3. Observe the badge count showing distinct allowed third-party domains.
4. Click the icon to open the popup panel and explore detailed connection outcomes.

### Prerequisites

- Compatible with modern versions of Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers.
- Browser must support the `webRequest` API for capturing all network requests.

### Next Steps

- Dive deeper into understanding the UI elements and workflows on the [Understanding the UI: Badge & Popup Explained](#) page.
- Learn how to monitor network requests on any page through the [Monitoring Network Requests on Any Webpage](#) guide.
- Explore advanced usage and troubleshooting techniques to maximize your uBO Scope experience.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Badge count doesn't update?** Ensure your browser supports and allows the `webRequest` API and uBO Scope has appropriate permissions.
- **Not seeing expected domains?** Some network requests outside `webRequest` API reach (such as from browser internals or older APIs) cannot be captured.
- **Interpreting stealth-blocked items:** Stealth-blocked requests are often redirected silently; this could indicate subtle blocking or filtering.

Use uBO Scope not just as a blocker verifier but as a privacy and performance educator — know who your browser calls and why.
