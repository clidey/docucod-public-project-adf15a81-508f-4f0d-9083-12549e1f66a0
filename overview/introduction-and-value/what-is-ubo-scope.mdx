title: "What is uBO Scope?"
description: "Introduce uBO Scope as a simple browser extension that reveals all connections, attempted or established, to remote servers by the active webpage. Emphasize its role in helping users assess web privacy, understand third-party server involvement, and evaluate the real effectiveness of content blockers. Highlight its independence from specific blockers and use of the webRequest API to offer deep visibility."

# What is uBO Scope?

## See Every Connection Your Browser Makes

When you browse the web, countless network connections happen behind the scenes—some necessary, others potentially invasive. **uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to shine a spotlight on all these connections, revealing every remote server your active webpage attempts to contact, whether the connection succeeds, is stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.**

### Why This Matters

While many content blockers focus on blocking unwanted ads or trackers, they rarely give you a clear picture of what's truly happening on the network level. uBO Scope empowers you to understand **how many distinct third-party servers your browser actually connects to**, helping you assess the privacy impact of websites you visit and evaluate the real effectiveness of your content blockers.

### What You'll Gain by Using uBO Scope

- **Transparent Visibility:** See all remote servers your active browser tab connects with—including allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** The browser toolbar icon badge counts distinct third-party domains contacted, providing immediate insight.
- **Independent Insight:** Operates independently of any particular content blocker and content-blocking methods like DNS filtering.
- **Accurate Measurement:** Uses the browser’s `webRequest` API to reliably monitor network requests, offering an unbiased measurement of network activity.

### Who Benefits from uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users wanting deep visibility into network connections triggered by webpages.
- Researchers and filter list maintainers seeking objective insights beyond typical block counters.
- Anyone curious about the real influence of third-party servers in their browsing experience.

## Understanding uBO Scope in Simple Terms

At its core, uBO Scope is a companion to content blockers like uBlock Origin. Unlike traditional blockers, it does not block or filter content itself. Instead, it:

1. **Monitors Network Requests:** It listens to network events within your browser using the `webRequest` API, capturing every attempt to connect to remote servers.

2. **Categorizes Outcomes:** Network requests are categorized based on their outcome:
    - **Allowed:** Requests that succeeded in connecting.
    - **Stealth-blocked:** Requests silently prevented or redirected.
    - **Blocked:** Requests failed or explicitly blocked.

3. **Aggregates Server Data:** It organizes these connections by domain and hostname to give you a meaningful summary.

4. **Displays Insights:** Through a popup user interface, it shows detailed lists of connected domains, clearly grouped by their status.

By using publicly available domain lists and intelligent hostname parsing, uBO Scope groups network requests for clarity, helping you see the *real* network landscape of any webpage.

## Key Features & How They Help You

### 1. Distinct Third-Party Server Counting
uBO Scope’s toolbar badge number reflects **unique third-party domains contacted** from the active tab. This metric quickly informs you if a page reaches out to more external servers than expected—or fewer, meaning tighter control.

### 2. Outcome Breakdown of Connections
The popup interface categorizes connections into:
- **Not Blocked:** Successful, allowed connections.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections invisibly redirected or otherwise stealthily prevented.
- **Blocked:** Known blocked attempts.

This breakdown helps clarify if your content blocker is actually preventing connections or if requests are silently slipping through.

### 3. Independent Measurement
Because uBO Scope relies strictly on the browser’s `webRequest` API rather than any content-blocking engine, it offers an unbiased, consistent view regardless of:
- Browser content blockers used,
- DNS-level blocking,
- Custom or network-wide filters.

### 4. Real-Time Updates & Persistence
The extension tracks requests per tab and updates badge counts dynamically. This lets you instantly see connection changes as you navigate or reload.

### Example Scenario
Imagine visiting an online news article. With uBO Scope, you discover:
- Your browser contacted **only 3 third-party domains**, all allowed.
- A stealth-blocked connection to an advertising domain was silently prevented.
- No connections were outright blocked by your content blocker.

Without uBO Scope, you’d be left guessing whether your blocker worked well. Now you see exactly what happened.

## Why Should You Care?

### Gain True Awareness of Web Privacy
Understanding the number and nature of third-party connections made on a page is crucial for privacy-conscious browsing. Many trackers and data collectors operate through these connections.

### See Beyond Misleading Metrics
uBO Scope helps debunk common misconceptions:
- **High block counts don’t equal better protection.** Blocking more requests might mean more requests are getting made in the first place.
- **Ad blocker test pages are unreliable.** They often generate artificial requests unseen in real browsing.

### Make Informed Decisions on Content Blockers
By revealing the actual distinct remote servers contacted, uBO Scope lets you objectively compare content blockers or filter lists, focusing on **end results** rather than metrics that can be gamed.

### Empower Filter List Maintenance
Filter list authors can use uBO Scope’s data to audit lists for efficiency, spotting redundant or ineffective rules.

## Getting Started Preview

### Quick Start
After installing uBO Scope from your browser’s official extension store, click the toolbar icon whenever you want a snapshot of network activity for your current tab. The badge shows how many third-party domains your browser connected to.

### Prerequisites
- Compatible with major browsers supporting the `webRequest` API (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Requires appropriate permissions to monitor network requests (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).

### Next Steps
- Explore the popup panel to see connection categorizations and domain counts.
- For installation guidance, review the [Install uBO Scope](../getting-started/installation-basics/install-extension) documentation.
- Dig deeper into network request tracking in [How uBO Scope Works: Architecture & Data Flow](../overview/core-concepts-and-architecture/how-it-works-architecture).

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **No badge or data visible?** Ensure the extension has necessary permissions and is active in your browser.
- **Unexpected high domain counts?** Remember legitimate pages often load content from CDNs or trusted third parties.
- **Data not updating?** Reload the page or refresh the popup panel to sync recent network events.
