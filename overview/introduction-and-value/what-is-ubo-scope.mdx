description: "uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension that reveals all network connections—attempted or successful—to remote servers made by web pages. Unlike block counters, it reports the number of distinct third-party servers contacted, empowering users to better assess their browser's exposure and the effectiveness of content blockers. The extension thus provides clear, actionable visibility over what external parties your browser contacts while you browse."

# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Network Connection Your Browser Makes, Clearly and Simply

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to reveal every network connection—whether attempted or successful—that a web page makes to remote servers. Unlike typical block counters that only show how many requests were blocked, uBO Scope reports the exact count of distinct third-party servers contacted. This transparency empowers you to assess your browser’s exposure in real time and evaluate the true effectiveness of content blockers with clarity.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Clear Visibility:** Understand precisely which and how many third-party servers your browser interacts with on each page visit.
- **Beyond Block Counts:** Unlike generic blockers, get granular insight into distinct remote servers contacted, not just blocked requests.
- **Effective Content Blocking Insight:** Validate whether your content blockers are truly limiting exposure to third-parties or if some connections still slip through.
- **Lightweight and Efficient:** Runs with minimal footprint, no heavy resource usage while delivering actionable insight.
- **Supports Multiple Browsers:** Compatible with Chromium, Firefox, and Safari, making it broadly accessible.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users seeking transparency over web trackers and third-party connections.
- Content blocker users wanting to verify the effectiveness of their installed filters.
- Developers and security professionals analyzing network behavior of web pages.
- Filter list maintainers who need precise feedback on network activity.

## What Is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a browser extension that passively monitors all network requests initiated by web pages. Its primary function is to identify and report the distinct third-party servers touched by these requests, regardless of whether the requests succeed or are blocked.

This solves a critical gap: while many blockers count how many requests they stop, they often don’t clarify how many unique servers a browser contacts—which is a more meaningful metric when assessing privacy exposure. uBO Scope enables users to "see the forest, not just the trees."

### How It Works

uBO Scope uses your browser’s built-in `webRequest` API to listen to all network requests as they occur. It keeps track of three categories of network requests:

- **Allowed:** Requests that completed successfully
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked or that failed
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that are silently redirected or suppressed by content blockers without user-visible blocking

By maintaining a tally of domains contacted in each category, uBO Scope presents a clear picture of your browsing exposure.

### What Sets It Apart

- **Distinct Third-party Domain Focus:** Unlike generic block counters, it counts unique third-party domains contacted rather than sheer volume of requests.
- **Independent of Content Blockers’ Own Counts:** It reports connections regardless of what content blocker you use or how they report their blocking.
- **Network Transparency:** Shows actual network exposure instead of just filtering statistics.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### Real-Time Network Request Reporting
Monitors in real time all network requests made while browsing, giving you an up-to-date snapshot of third-party connections.

### Third-Party Domain Distinction
Groups network activities by distinct domains instead of individual requests, delivering a meaningful count of remote servers contacted.

### Outcome Categorization
Shows summary breakdown of connections in three clear buckets:
- Not Blocked (allowed)
- Stealth-Blocked (silently suppressed by blockers)
- Blocked (failed or prevented)

### Tab-Specific Analysis
Tracks network connections on a per-tab basis, allowing you to see exposure for the web page currently open.

### Toolbar Badge with Meaningful Count
Displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted in the browser toolbar icon badge. Lower counts mean less exposure.

### User-Friendly Popup Interface
A simple popup presents the list of contacted domains categorized by outcome, making complex network data accessible immediately.

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
Available on Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers ensuring consistent experience and capability.

## Why Should You Care?

### Understand Your Browser's Exposure Like Never Before
Commonly, users focus on block counts shown by content blockers without knowing how many distinct servers a browser still makes connections to. uBO Scope closes this blind spot by reporting unique remote servers contacted, so you can make informed decisions about your privacy.

### Reality Check for Content Blockers
By comparing the number of distinct allowed servers versus blocked ones, users can easily verify if their content blockers are truly effective or if some connections might be bypassing filters.

### Debunk Common Misconceptions
Many believe higher block counts imply better blocking. uBO Scope reveals this myth by showing that more blocked requests don’t necessarily mean fewer connections to distinct third-party servers.

### Empower Third-Party Filter List Maintainers
The detailed insights help filter list authors identify potential leaks or gaps in blocking, especially when traditional metrics fall short.

### Minimal Overhead for Maximum Transparency
Unlike heavy diagnostic tools, uBO Scope runs smoothly and unobtrusively, giving you powerful network intelligence without slowing down your browsing.

## Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- Remember, a lower badge count means fewer distinct third-party servers contacted, which is better for privacy.
- Not all third-party connections are harmful; for example, legitimate CDNs often count as third parties.
- Content blockers can be stealthy and may redirect requests silently—uBO Scope helps you spot these.
- Some network requests might not be visible due to limitations outside the `webRequest` API's reach.

<Tip>
Check your extension’s status and permissions if no network connections appear; ensure uBO Scope is enabled and has network access.

## Example Walkthrough: Using uBO Scope on a News Website

1. Open your browser, and navigate to a popular news site.
2. Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. The popup shows the site’s hostname and domain at the top.
4. Below, the 'not blocked' section lists legitimate third-party CDNs used to deliver content.
5. The 'stealth-blocked' section reveals any silently suppressed tracking servers.
6. The 'blocked' section displays any servers that were prevented from connecting.
7. Observe the badge count on the extension icon updating as you navigate.

This hands-on insight demystifies what your browser connects to and how your blockers perform.
