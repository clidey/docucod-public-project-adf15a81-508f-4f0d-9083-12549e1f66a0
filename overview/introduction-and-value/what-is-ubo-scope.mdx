# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlocking Transparency in Web Connections

uBO Scope is a lightweight companion browser extension designed to reveal every network connection a webpage attempts — whether successful or blocked — providing unmatched insight into third-party server communications during your browsing sessions.

By illuminating these underlying connections, uBO Scope empowers you to deeply understand which remote servers websites interact with, regardless of your active content blockers or DNS filters.

### Why Use uBO Scope?
- **Comprehensive Visibility:** See all remote server connections—both allowed and blocked—across every open tab.
- **Third-Party Detection:** Quickly identify and quantify the distinct third-party servers contacted by webpages.
- **Content Blocker Independent:** Tracks network requests irrespective of which content blocking or DNS filtering solutions you use.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Instantly updates connection counts and details to reflect current browsing activity.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?
- Privacy-conscious users seeking transparency into web tracking and content delivery.
- Web developers and security analysts monitoring network traffic.
- Filter list maintainers assessing real-world third-party connections.

## What Is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a browser extension that listens to your browser's webRequest events to measure and report network activity triggered by webpages. Unlike conventional content blockers focused on filtering, uBO Scope's unique mission is to *expose* the connections themselves.

It captures both:

- Requests that *successfully* reach remote servers.
- Requests that are *blocked* either silently (stealth-blocked) or outright.

This holistic measurement ensures you get a full picture of what the browser tries to do during page loads and interactions.

## How Does uBO Scope Work?

Without delving into internal implementation, uBO Scope:

- Monitors network requests as your browser attempts to load resources.
- Aggregates these requests by domain and categorizes them as Allowed, Blocked, or Stealth-Blocked.
- Displays summarized data via its popup interface, showing counts and domain lists for the current active tab.
- Updates the extension’s toolbar badge to count the distinct third-party domains contacted, highlighting how many external connections a page initiates.

Its independence from any particular content blocker or DNS filtering method means it remains a faithful observer, regardless of how your browser environment is configured.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Real-Time Network Connection Reporting:** Immediately presents the domains contacted by each webpage tab, organized into:
  - **Allowed:** Connections permitted to remote servers.
  - **Blocked:** Requests blocked by some content blocker or network error.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests silently blocked without typical error signals.

- **Detailed Domain Breakdown:** Lists detailed counts for each domain contacted, revealing frequency and scope of connections.

- **Toolbar Badge Indicator:** Shows the number of distinct third-party domains contacted, providing an at-a-glance privacy and performance metric.

- **Unicode Domain Support:** Converts internationalized domain names to readable Unicode using Punycode, making analysis accessible.

- **Session Persistence:** Retains network connection data for tabs throughout browsing sessions, helping you track activity over time.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Available and optimized for Chromium, Firefox, and Safari-based browsers.

## Why Should You Care?

Using uBO Scope transforms your browsing from a black-box experience into an informed journey.

- **Gain Clarity on 3rd-Party Connections:** Identify all external servers your browser talks to, including those that content blockers may silently block or allow.

- **Evaluate Content Blockers Effectively:** Instead of relying on block counts alone, use uBO Scope to see distinct third-party connections allowed which more accurately reflects privacy impact.

- **Detect Anomalies & Unexpected Connections:** Spot unfamiliar or suspicious servers contacted by webpages.

- **Filter List Insight:** Supports filter list maintainers by showing the real-world effect of blocking rules.

- **Myth Busting:** Dispels misconceptions about ad blocker test pages and block counts, encouraging evidence-based privacy decisions.

### Typical Use Cases

- While browsing, invoke uBO Scope’s popup to instantly view connections made by the active page.
- Compare the badge counts before and after enabling a content blocker to assess its impact.
- As a developer, analyze network requests to debug or audit third-party resource usage on a site.
- Monitor stealth-blocked requests to understand silent filtering happening under the hood.

## Getting Started Preview

Getting started with uBO Scope is straightforward:

1. **Install the extension** from your browser’s official addon store.
2. **Click the toolbar icon** to open the popup which automatically displays network connection data for the current tab.
3. **Review the categorized domain lists** to analyze allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.
4. Observe the **badge count** on the toolbar icon to gauge overall third-party connection volume.

For detailed installation steps and interpreting the badge and popup, please refer to [Installing uBO Scope](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installing-ubo-scope) and [Interpreting the Badge and Popup Data](/getting-started/first-run-setup/interpreting-badge-popup).

## Quick Snapshot of uBO Scope’s Popup

Upon clicking the extension’s icon, you will see a panel summarizing network connections for the current active tab:

- **Hostname Header:** Displays the active tab’s hostname and domain in human-readable form.
- **Total Domains Connected:** Shows a count of unique domains contacted.
- **Sections:** Separate lists for ‘not blocked’, ‘stealth-blocked’, and ‘blocked’ domains along with their connection counts.

Each domain entry includes the Unicode domain name and the number of requests made.

This instantly actionable breakdown helps you evaluate the level of external communication triggered by the webpage.

## Pro Tips for Users

- Remember that a lower badge count generally indicates fewer third-party connections, usually signifying better privacy.
- Always consider the context; some third-party domains like CDNs are often necessary and benign.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker for complementary transparency.
- Explore the lists to spot stealth-blocked domains, which often indicate underlying silent filtering.

If you notice unexpected connections, consider reviewing your filtering rules or extensions.

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- **No Data Visible in Popup:** Confirm that you have an active tab open to a webpage and network requests are occurring.
- **Badge Count Not Updating:** Ensure your browser supports webRequest API and permissions are granted.
- **Unexpected High Domain Count:** Verify if multiple tabs or frames could contribute to the aggregate counts.
