# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Network Connection Made by Webpages

uBO Scope is an indispensable browser extension designed to shed light on all network connections — both blocked and successful — initiated by webpages you visit. Unlike traditional content blockers that primarily focus on blocking ads or trackers, uBO Scope reveals the full network activity spectrum, ensuring you understand exactly which remote servers your browser contacts.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Complete Visibility:** See every distinct third-party server your browser connects to, not just those blocked.
- **Accurate Privacy Insights:** Understand your real browsing privacy by knowing what connections are allowed or stealth-blocked.
- **Debunk Common Myths:** Challenge misleading assumptions about content blocking effectiveness.
- **Independent of Content Blockers:** Works seamlessly regardless of which content blocker or DNS filtering you use, as long as your browser reports network requests.
- **Streamlined Interface:** A clear badge count and categorized details to help you interpret network activity at a glance.

### Who Benefit Most from uBO Scope?

- Privacy-focused users curious about all remote servers contacted during browsing.
- Security enthusiasts seeking transparency beyond what content blockers reveal.
- Filter list maintainers who want to validate the effectiveness of rules in real-world scenarios.
- Researchers and analysts debunking claims about blocker performance.

## Understanding uBO Scope: Revealing Browser Network Connections

### What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight companion extension to uBlock Origin that captures and reveals *every* network request your browser attempts while loading webpages. It reports on connections that are successfully made, those stealthily blocked by content blockers, and those actively blocked or failed.

Its core goal is to give users unparalleled transparency into what happens behind the scenes on the web, exposing connections that might otherwise go unnoticed. This clarity empowers you to make informed decisions about privacy and security.

### What Problem Does uBO Scope Solve?

Standard browser tools and content blockers often provide partial or misleading views of network activity. Many users assume that a low block count or the results of “ad blocker test” sites accurately reflect the effectiveness of blocking — but these are flawed indicators.

uBO Scope fills this gap by:

- Tracking *all* network requests via the browser's `webRequest` API, including those blocked invisibly by content blockers.
- Distinguishing between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.
- Displaying the actual number of unique third-party domains contacted per tab.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

- **Comprehensive Connection Reporting:** Unlike other extensions, it reveals *all* network activity regardless of blocking technique.
- **Real-time Badge Updates:** The toolbar icon shows the number of distinct third-party servers connected, providing a clear indicator of your exposure.
- **Myth Busting:** Helps disprove common misconceptions about block counts and test pages.
- **Content Blocker Agnostic:** Works alongside any content blocker, including those using DNS filtering or stealth blocking.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Monitoring Every Network Request

uBO Scope listens to browser network events (`onBeforeRedirect`, `onErrorOccurred`, and `onResponseStarted`) to track the outcome of each request:

- **Success:** Requests completed and connections allowed.
- **Redirect:** Requests that resulted in URL redirection.
- **Error:** Requests blocked or failed.

These are continuously logged and processed per browser tab.


### 2. Categorizing Connections

Each network request is associated with its remote hostname and domain, then classified into one of three categories:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully established.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections that were redirected to prevent access (often hidden by stealth blocking).
- **Blocked:** Connections that failed or were explicitly blocked.

### 3. Badge Count Reflecting Distinct Third-Party Connections

The toolbar icon dynamically updates to display the count of unique third-party domains for which connections were successfully allowed within the active tab. This helps quantify your browsing exposure at a glance.

> **Note:** A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, which is typically more desirable for privacy.

### 4. Popup Panel for Detailed Inspection

Clicking the icon opens a popup with a clear, categorized list of domains:

- **Not blocked:** Domains from which resources were loaded.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where blocking occurred quietly.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections failed or were actively blocked.

Counts beside each domain show how many requests were made.

## Why You Should Care

### Real Benefits

- **Full Transparency:** Know every remote destination your browsing session touches.
- **Accurate Privacy Assessment:** Identify genuine exposure levels beyond mere block counts.
- **Filtering Validation:** For filter maintainers, verify which connections persist despite blocking.
- **Informed Decisions:** Better understand and choose content blockers based on real network behavior.

### Common Use Cases

- Evaluating if a content blocker truly limits your exposure to trackers and ads.
- Debunking the idea that a higher block count means better privacy.
- Investigating stealth techniques used by some blockers or web services.
- Filtering and refining your blocking rules to improve effectiveness.

### Typical Scenarios

**Without uBO Scope:** You rely on block counts or ad-block tests, risking misunderstanding the true network footprint of your browsing.

**With uBO Scope:** You gain crystal-clear visibility into all connections attempted, including those hidden or obscured by stealth blocking. Your privacy decisions are evidence-based.

## Technical Insight (Optional)

uBO Scope hooks into the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network requests. It parses request URLs to extract domains and hostnames, categorizes outcomes, and maintains session state per tab. This architecture ensures accurate tracking regardless of blocking mechanisms employed by other extensions or DNS filters.

The extension also uses the Public Suffix List to correctly identify registrable domains, enabling precise third-party distinction.
