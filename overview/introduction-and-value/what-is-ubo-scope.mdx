# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Your Browser Makes with uBO Scope

In the complex world of the web, your browser often reaches out to numerous remote servers, some you expect, many you do not. uBO Scope is a lightweight, privacy-focused browser extension designed to reveal all these remote server connections — whether attempted or successful — for any webpage you visit.

If you've ever wondered exactly which third-party servers a webpage connects to, or if you want to understand the real impact of content blockers, uBO Scope provides clear, actionable insight by breaking down this network activity right at your fingertips.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a simple browser extension created by Raymond Hill, the author of uBlock Origin. It traces and reports every remote server connection a webpage makes, offering a transparent view of network requests in real time.

Unlike typical ad blockers or content blockers that aim to block unwanted content, uBO Scope's sole purpose is to *reveal* the network activity underneath, exposing which connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked — all aggregated per domain.

With support for major browsers such as Firefox, Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave), and Safari (albeit with some permissions limitations), uBO Scope helps users and filter list maintainers alike to analyze network behaviors accurately.

## Why Does uBO Scope Matter?

When you load a webpage, it isn't just the site itself that your browser connects to. It often communicates with numerous third-party domains — advertising networks, analytics providers, content delivery networks (CDNs), and more.

Some of these connections are harmless or even necessary. However, others may compromise privacy or degrade performance. uBO Scope surfaces the reality behind these connections, enabling you to:

- **See the exact domains your browser connects to, even beyond what traditional content blockers display.**
- **Evaluate the effectiveness of content blockers based on distinct server connections rather than simplistic block counts.**
- **Debunk misleading assumptions created by artificial "ad blocker test" pages.
- **Identify stealth blocking where connections are silently redirected or interfered with.**

By focusing on the *server connections themselves* rather than the *content* of those connections, uBO Scope offers a unique and valuable perspective.

## How uBO Scope Works at a Glance

uBO Scope uses the browser's webRequest API to monitor all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and secure WebSocket connections initiated by the active tab. It tracks their status as one of three outcomes:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** Connection succeeded.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connection was redirected or handled by stealth content blockers.
- **Blocked:** Connection failed or was prevented by the browser or addons.

The extension aggregates these outcomes by domain and updates a real-time badge count on the browser toolbar icon. This badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected to, giving instant feedback on your exposure footprint.

<u>Note:</u> A lower badge count is preferable, indicating fewer third-party connections.

## Key Characteristics

- **Browser Support:** Compatible with Firefox (min version 128), Chromium browsers (min version 122), and Safari.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal permissions focused on webRequest and active tabs.
- **Real-Time Insights:** Updates network connection data live as you browse.
- **Open Source:** Transparent code you can audit and contribute to.

## Real-World Example: Understanding the Badge Count

Imagine you visit a news website. Without any content blockers, your browser connects to the main news domain plus 12 additional third-party servers (ad networks, trackers, CDN nodes).

With uBO Scope installed, you observe the badge shows "13" — representing all unique remote domains contacted.

Now, if you enable a content blocker, the badge may drop to "4" — indicating only 4 distinct third-party domains were successfully connected to. This instant quantification helps you measure the blocker's real-world effectiveness.

## Installing and Positioning uBO Scope

You can install uBO Scope directly from popular browser extension stores:

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

Once installed, uBO Scope runs in the background as a companion to your existing content blockers and security tools — offering transparency rather than intervention.

---

## Why Choose uBO Scope Over Other Tools?

Many web privacy tools focus on blocking content and rely on block counts as their performance metric. uBO Scope flips this approach:

- **Focus on distinct connected domains instead of raw block counts, avoiding misleading assumptions about blocker efficiency.**
- **Debunks popular but flawed evaluation methods, such as "ad blocker test" webpages, by showing real network effects instead of synthetic tests.**
- **Accessible for filter list maintainers needing clear visibility on which servers their lists actually block or allow.**

---

## Summary

uBO Scope is the essential extension for anyone who wants a clear, data-driven view of all third-party remote server connections made by their browser. It provides unmatched transparency and helps users truly understand the network activity underlying their online experience.

Start with uBO Scope to *see* everything before you decide what to block.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your browser meets the minimum version requirements (Firefox 128+, Chrome 122+).
- uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API, so some network requests outside its reach might not be visible.
- Badge counts reflect distinct third-party domains *connected to*, not a count of blocked connections—interpret accordingly.
