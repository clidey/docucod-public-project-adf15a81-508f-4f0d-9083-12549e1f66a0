# What Is uBO Scope?

## Unlocking Full Transparency for Your Browser's Connections

Imagine browsing the web but being invisible to third-party trackers. Now, what if you could see every behind-the-scenes connection your browser attempts—revealing every third-party server it talks to? This is the mission of **uBO Scope**, a companion extension designed to shine a light on the often invisible network activities initiated by your browser.

### Why uBO Scope Matters
When you visit a website, your browser loads content not only from that site but often from many third-party servers—some legitimate, some tracking your behavior. These hidden connections shape your online privacy and experience, yet are rarely visible or understood.

uBO Scope reveals exactly which remote servers your browser is connecting to, whether those connections are allowed, stealthily redirected, or blocked. This transparency empowers you to understand real-world third-party tracking, assess content blockers effectively, and dispel common myths about blocking efficacy.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?
- **Privacy-conscious users** who want a clear, no-nonsense view of which external servers a webpage communicates with.
- **Filter list maintainers** seeking reliable data to tune and improve content blocking rules.
- **Web developers and security researchers** investigating network behaviors and privacy implications.

## What Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed exclusively to measure and report *all* remote server connections attempted by your browser during page loads. Acting alongside content blockers like uBlock Origin, it provides a detailed, real-time breakdown of outbound network requests categorized by their outcomes.

### Core Purpose
Web browsers routinely fetch data from multiple remote servers, many belonging to third parties that track or profile users. However, users have little insight into these connections, making it hard to verify whether content blockers are truly protecting their privacy.

uBO Scope solves this by:
- **Detecting every network request** your browser makes to remote servers (HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket).
- **Reporting whether those requests were allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked**.
- **Displaying clear summaries of unique domains contacted, enabling assessment of third-party exposure.**

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?
Unlike typical content blockers or ‘ad blocker test’ pages, which may provide misleading statistics or rely on artificial test cases, uBO Scope is:
- **Comprehensive:** It leverages the browser's `webRequest` API for real network data, catching successes, redirects, and errors.
- **Content Blocker Agnostic:** It shows accurate data regardless of which content blocker is active or which blocking method is used (browser extension or DNS-level block).
- **Myth-busting:** It exposes common misconceptions about block counts and ad blocker performance by focusing on distinct server connections rather than block event tallies.

### At a Glance: How uBO Scope Operates
When you open a webpage:
1. The extension monitors all outbound network requests targeting remote servers matching the host permissions.
2. Requests are classified as **allowed** (successful), **stealth-blocked** (redirected or silently handled), or **blocked** (hard failures).
3. Domains involved in these requests are aggregated and counted.
4. A badge on the extension icon reflects the number of unique third-party domains contacted, helping you quickly assess exposure.
5. The popup interface displays an organized list of these domains grouped by outcome.

This real-world data offers you unprecedented clarity on your browsing footprint.

## Key Features & Capabilities of the Popup Interface

The popup UI is your window into uBO Scope's power, providing instant snapshots of connections related to the active browser tab.

- **Hostname Display:** Shows the current page’s hostname and domain at the top, ensuring context.

- **Summary Section:** Highlights the total count of unique connected domains in the active tab session, allowing you to measure privacy footprint at a glance.

- **Outcome Sections:** Three clearly segmented areas categorize domains into:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains your browser successfully contacted.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains with requests that were redirected silently, a subtle blocking technique often used to avoid detection.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed due to blocking.

- **Domain Counts:** Each domain entry shows the number of requests made, helping you spot high-traffic connections or suspicious behavior.

- **Dynamic Rendering:** The interface adapts to the active tab and updates live based on dynamic data.

<Info>
The popup is designed for clarity and ease of use, relying on simple lists and badges rather than complex graphs—because immediate insight is more valuable than overwhelming detail.

## Why Should You Care?

### Real Transparency into Third-Party Tracking
By revealing every distinct third-party server your browser connects to, uBO Scope lets you see privacy leaks and potential tracking in action, not just blocked statistics.

### Debunk Myths Around Content Blockers
uBO Scope proves that block counts alone don't measure a content blocker’s effectiveness. An extension might block many individual resources but still allow connections to numerous third-party servers, which means tracking can still occur.

### Validate Content Blockers and Filter Lists
Filter list maintainers can use uBO Scope to assess if their block lists reduce the number of unique third-party domains effectively, leading to better optimized and privacy-preserving rules.

### Accessibility
The popup UI is accessible with no setup required beyond installation, providing immediate value in a friendly, interpretable layout.

<Warning>
Note that the extension can only report requests visible to the browser's `webRequest` API. Requests made outside this scope (e.g., some system-level DNS blocks or entirely externals apps) will not appear.
</Warning>

## Practical Tips for Users

- Regularly check the popup to monitor your browsing exposure.
- Pay attention to the **badge count** on the extension icon; a lower number indicates fewer third-party domains contacted.
- Use this data alongside your content blocker to identify if additional rules or filters may be needed.
- Understand that some third-party connections (e.g., commonly used content delivery networks) are legitimate and often necessary.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common FAQs About uBO Scope">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge show a high number of connected domains?">
This indicates your browser contacted many distinct third-party servers, often due to trackers, ads, or included external resources. Not all are harmful, but a higher count usually suggests more privacy exposure.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope block anything itself?">
No, uBO Scope only reports on network requests. It does not block or modify browser activity but works with any blocker you have installed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why are some blocked domains shown as 'stealth-blocked'?">
Stealth-blocking often happens via silent redirects instead of outright blocking to remain undetected by websites, providing a subtle method of denying unwanted connections.
