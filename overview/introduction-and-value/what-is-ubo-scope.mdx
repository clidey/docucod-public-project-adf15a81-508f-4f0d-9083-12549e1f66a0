# What is uBO Scope?

## Instantly See Every Remote Connection Your Browser Makes

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to give you complete transparency into every network connection your browser attempts or successfully completes—across all websites you visit. Unlike typical content blockers that only report blocked network requests, uBO Scope captures and reveals **all** third-party connections, even those allowed past content blockers.

### Why This Matters
Often, privacy tools claim to block numerous requests, but this number alone says little about actual effectiveness. What truly impacts your privacy is the number of distinct third-party servers your browser connects to. uBO Scope empowers you to:

- Understand exactly which remote servers your browser contacts in real time.
- Evaluate if a content blocker is truly minimizing third-party reach by showing connections allowed to go through.
- Debunk common misconceptions such as “higher block count means better privacy” or the reliability of misleading ad blocker test pages.

This extension is your window into the network activity hidden beneath webpage loading, helping you make informed decisions about your privacy tools.

## What Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a simple, browser-native extension that uses the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network requests your browser performs. It shows you **all** attempted and successful connections to remote servers, regardless of whether these connections were blocked or allowed by other privacy tools.

### Core Purpose
The core goal of uBO Scope is to surface the truth about third-party network activity:

- It counts distinct third-party remote servers your browser connects to.
- It shows which requests are allowed, blocked outright, or stealth-blocked (silently blocked or redirected).
- It updates toolbar badges to help you instantly gauge third-party exposure on a page.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique

- **Completeness**: Reports connections even if blocked by DNS-level or stealth techniques, so long as the browser reports them.
- **Clarity**: Focuses on distinct third-party servers—giving a better privacy exposure metric than raw block counts.
- **Simple Design**: No frills, no complicated settings. Just see your browser's network activity clearly.

Unlike ad blocker tests that use unrealistic scenarios or block count metrics that mislead, uBO Scope places real, actionable information in your hands.

## How uBO Scope Works

uBO Scope hooks into the browser's `webRequest` API to listen for network request lifecycle events:

- **On response started:** Indicates a successful connection.
- **On redirect:** Tracks requests that change URL mid-flight (often stealthy).
- **On error:** Captures failed or blocked requests.

It aggregates this data per browser tab, grouping requests by hostname and domain, then categorizes:

- **Allowed requests:** Requests allowed to complete.
- **Blocked requests:** Requests explicitly blocked.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Redirected or silently intercepted requests.

The extension's popup interface displays these grouped outcomes, providing counts of connected domains. The toolbar badge shows the total number of distinct third-party domains connected on the current tab.

## Real-World Example

Imagine browsing a news site with uBO Scope installed:

1. You load the page, uBO Scope's badge shows "12" indicating 12 distinct third-party servers connected.
2. Opening the popup reveals these servers, with labels showing which connections were blocked by your content blocker and which were allowed.
3. You notice that some trackers slipped through your blocker; the extension gives you the evidence you need to tweak your blocker or lists.

## Key User Benefits & Best Practices

- **Transparency over false metrics:** Stop relying on block counts from blockers and start evaluating real network exposure.

- **Evaluate privacy tools rigorously:** Use uBO Scope to compare the effectiveness of different blockers based on actual connections, not just blocked counts.

- **Filter list development:** For filter list maintainers, uBO Scope offers a reliable way to observe network requests when developer tools are limited.

- **Quick assessment:** The toolbar badge provides an at-a-glance tally of third-party connections per page without digging into complex logs.

## Getting Started with uBO Scope

1. **Install the Extension**
   - Available for Chromium browsers on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
   - Available for Firefox on [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

2. **Browse Websites**
   - Observe the badge count on the extension icon representing distinct third-party host connections.

3. **Open the Popup**
   - Click the extension icon to see detailed lists of hosts:
     - Not blocked (allowed connections)
     - Stealth-blocked (redirected or silently blocked requests)
     - Blocked

4. **Interpret the Results**
   - A lower distinct third-party connection count means fewer external servers reached, implying better privacy protection.
   - Review which connections succeed even when a blocker is active and consider adjusting your settings if needed.

## Troubleshooting & Limitations

- **Network requests outside `webRequest` API scope cannot be detected.**
- **Not all third-party servers are malicious or must be blocked.** Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and legitimate services typically have low distinct server counts.
- The extension does not actively block connections; it monitors and reports only.
