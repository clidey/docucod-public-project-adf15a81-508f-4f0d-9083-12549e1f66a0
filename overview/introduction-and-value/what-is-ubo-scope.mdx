# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlocking Full Visibility Into Your Browser's Network Connections

uBO Scope is a lightweight, powerful browser extension designed to reveal every network connection your active browser tab attempts or successfully makes — including all third-party and direct connections — regardless of any content blocking technology you use. Unlike traditional content blockers that focus on blocking ads or trackers, uBO Scope’s essential mission is to shed light on what is really communicating behind the scenes in your browsing experience.

## Why uBO Scope Matters — Your Network Connections, Fully Exposed

When browsing the web, countless requests reach out behind the scenes to remote servers. Some are essential to loading the webpage, others may be trackers, ads, or third-party services. While content blockers often interfere with or hide these connections, uBO Scope surfaces **all** these network activities in real time.

By displaying every third-party and first-party connection regardless of blocking technology — including network requests blocked by DNS or other means — uBO Scope empowers you with an unprecedented, transparent view of exactly what servers your browser interacts with. This provides a new layer of insight and control beyond traditional blocklists and filters.

## What Makes uBO Scope Different?

- **All-Inclusive Connection Visibility:** It observes every unique remote server your browser contacts, whether those connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or completely blocked.
- **Content Blocker Agnostic:** It works alongside any other content blocker or filtering tool without interfering or competing.
- **Real-Time Network Monitoring:** It continuously tracks the active browser tab, updating you live as connections come and go.
- **Insight Into Stealth Blocking:** It identifies requests silently blocked (stealth-blocked) by content blockers, which some tools do not reveal.

## How uBO Scope Works at a Glance

uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network requests initiated by web pages in your active tab. It categorizes these network requests into three outcomes:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully completed.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests silently blocked or redirected without explicit failure.
- **Blocked:** Requests that were stopped outright or resulted in errors.

It then surfaces this information in a concise, accessible popup interface, showing you summarized counts and detailed domains involved in each category.

## Practical Example: Using uBO Scope While Browsing

Imagine you’re visiting your favorite news site. You suspect multiple tracking domains are connecting without your knowledge, despite having a content blocker enabled. Opening uBO Scope’s popup reveals:

- A clear count of all distinct third-party domains contacted.
- The exact list of domains your browser fetched resources from.
- Which requests were allowed through, which were stealth-blocked, and which were fully blocked.

This immediate clarity helps you understand the real effectiveness of your content control tools and identify unexpected third-party connections.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Interpret the Badge Count Correctly:** The number shown on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon represents the total distinct third-party domains connected. A lower badge count means fewer third-party connections, which typically indicates a cleaner browsing session.
- **Understand Third Parties:** Not all third-party connections are bad. Many legitimate sites load resources from Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) with low privacy risk.
- **Use in Conjunction:** uBO Scope does not block anything itself; use it alongside your preferred content blockers for best results.
- **Beware of Myths:** Don’t rely on ad block test pages or block counts alone to judge content blocker effectiveness — uBO Scope provides unfiltered insight.

## Troubleshooting & Limitations

- uBO Scope’s data relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API. Network requests not accessible to this API (e.g., some DNS layers or browser-internal requests) won’t appear.
- It does not block connections or change browser behavior; this is a monitoring and reporting tool only.

## Example: What You See In The Popup

The popup is structured to show your current tab's domain and host, followed by three sections:

```plaintext
Domains connected: [total count]

Not Blocked:
    - domain1.example.com (count)
    - domain2.example.org (count)

Stealth-Blocked:
    - domain3.tracker.net (count)

Blocked:
    - domain4.adserver.com (count)
```

Each entry lists the domain and the number of requests observed.
