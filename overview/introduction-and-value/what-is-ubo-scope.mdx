# What is uBO Scope?

## Bringing Full Transparency to Your Browser's Network Connections

When you browse the web, countless connections happen behind the scenes—some essential, some optional, others potentially intrusive. Understanding exactly which remote servers your browser tries to communicate with helps safeguard your privacy and gives you control over your digital footprint. This is where **uBO Scope** steps in.

uBO Scope is a lightweight, companion extension designed to deliver **total visibility** of your browser's network activity. It shows you every attempted or successful connection to remote servers, regardless of which content blocker or privacy settings are in effect.

### Why Does Total Network Visibility Matter?

- **Uncover hidden connections:** See all domains your browser connects to, not just the ones your content blocker blocks or allows.
- **Measure true privacy exposure:** Understanding distinct third-party servers contacted is key to knowing your real privacy risk.
- **Debunk misleading assumptions:** Block counts and 'ad blocker tests' don’t tell the full story. uBO Scope reveals what really happens.
- **Empower filter list maintainers and privacy advocates:** Get accurate network connection data even when browser dev tools are inaccessible.

By providing an unfiltered, comprehensive report on network requests, uBO Scope equips **privacy-conscious users, researchers, and tech enthusiasts** with the clarity to make informed decisions.

## What is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a **browser extension** that listens to network requests initiated by web pages and tracks their outcomes:

- **Allowed connections:** Requests that successfully reached remote servers.
- **Blocked connections:** Requests prevented from completing.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Redirects or filtered requests that don't make it to their target but are not outright blocked visibly.

This data is aggregated per browser tab and displayed in a simple popup interface, showing you all domains contacted during your browsing session.

### How uBO Scope Works in Your Browser

uBO Scope uses the browser’s `webRequest` API to capture real-time network activity across HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and WSS protocols (as permitted by browser and extension manifests). This lets it independently record connection attempts, regardless of which filters or DNS-level blocking mechanisms are active. 

Because it taps directly into browser network events rather than relying on heuristic or content-side detection, uBO Scope presents an accurate picture of your browser's network interactions.

## Core Benefits of Using uBO Scope

- **Accurate Third-Party Server Visibility:** Instead of just counting blocked requests, uBO Scope counts distinct third-party servers contacted. This is a more meaningful metric for privacy.
- **Content-Blocker Independent Reporting:** Works alongside any content blocker or settings, revealing network requests that bypass or slip through filters.
- **Real-Time Insight with Tab-Specific Data:** Browser badge icon shows the count of distinct domains connected by the active tab, helping you monitor privacy on a per-website basis.
- **Clear Categorization:** Identifies allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked network connections for better understanding.
- **Ideal for Privacy Audits and Filter List Maintenance:** Useful for developers, filter list creators, and privacy enthusiasts to verify network activity.

## Seeing uBO Scope in Action

When you activate uBO Scope during your browsing, you can open its popup to see a detailed summary:

- The **hostname** and **domain** of the current tab.
- A count of all distinct connected domains.
- Three sections listing domains for each outcome category: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

This breakdown helps you quickly grasp the scope of external communications your browser made for the page.

#### Example Use Case

Imagine you visit a news site and see unexpectedly high counts of connected third-party domains in the uBO Scope badge. You open the popup to discover many connections to advertisement servers or tracking networks. This makes it clear why you may want to adjust your content-blocking settings or take further privacy steps.

## Common Misconceptions Addressed by uBO Scope

<ul>
<li><strong>Block count is not the full indicator of privacy:</strong> A content blocker showing many blocked requests might still allow more distinct tracking domains than another with fewer blocks. uBO Scope clarifies this difference.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability of ad-blocker tests:</strong> Simulated ad-blocker test sites do not reflect real-world browsing and cannot see stealth blocking or nuanced behaviors. uBO Scope observes actual network traffic without such limitations.</li>
</ul>

## How to Get Started with uBO Scope

To start using uBO Scope, install the extension from your browser’s official add-ons store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari Extensions Gallery). Once installed:

1. **Browse websites as usual.** 
2. **Look at the uBO Scope toolbar icon badge:** it displays the number of distinct third-party domains your current tab connected with.
3. **Click the icon to open the popup:** review the categorized sets of domains contacted.

<u>Note:</u> A lower badge count generally indicates better privacy — fewer external connections mean less data exposure.

For detailed installation and first-time usage guidance, please refer to the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope).

## Practical Tips

- Use uBO Scope to supplement your content blocker; it does not block connections itself but reveals what happens under the hood.
- Regularly audit network activity on sites where privacy is critical.
- Combine insights from uBO Scope with your filter list settings to optimize privacy.

## Troubleshooting

- If the badge does not update or data is missing, verify that your browser allows the extension access to the required permissions (`webRequest`, `storage`).
- Remember uBO Scope can only report network requests visible to the browser’s `webRequest` API. Network activity outside this scope (e.g., in other apps or non-standard protocols) will not appear.

## Summary

uBO Scope pioneers a new level of transparency for network connections in your browser. By cataloging every third-party remote server your browser interacts with, it helps you cut through misleading metrics and truly understand your online privacy.

Explore how your browsing exposes you, and take charge with the clear, factual visibility uBO Scope provides.

<AccordionGroup title="Additional Details & FAQs">
<Accordion title="What does the badge count represent?">
The badge shows the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected to by the active browser tab. A lower number means fewer external connections and typically better privacy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope block any content?">
No, uBO Scope only monitors and reports network activity. It does not block or modify requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Which browsers support uBO Scope?">
uBO Scope supports Chromium-based browsers (like Google Chrome), Firefox, and Safari, with permissions set accordingly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope detect connections blocked by DNS-level filtering?">
As long as the browser reports the network request events through the `webRequest` API, uBO Scope can detect them, even if blocked at DNS level or by other content blockers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why shouldn't I trust 'ad blocker test' websites?">
These test sites often use synthetic requests that do not reflect actual web browsing. They also cannot detect stealth blocking techniques, making their results unreliable.

## Example: Viewing Network Connections for a Specific Tab

```javascript
// Request tab data from uBO Scope
browser.runtime.sendMessage({
    what: 'getTabData',
    tabId: currentTabId
}).then(serializedData => {
    const tabData = deserialize(serializedData);
    console.log('Domains connected:', Object.keys(tabData.allowed.domains));
    // Process and display data in your UI
});
```

This simple interaction fetches connection details tracked by uBO Scope for a specific browser tab, useful for programmatic analysis or integration.
