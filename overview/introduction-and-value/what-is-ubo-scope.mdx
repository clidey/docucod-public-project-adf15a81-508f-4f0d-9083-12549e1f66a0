# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection: See What Your Browser Really Does

uBO Scope is a powerful yet straightforward browser extension that reveals every network connection your browser attempts or successfully makes to remote servers. Unlike traditional content blockers that may obscure or stealthily block some requests, uBO Scope provides a crystal-clear view of all third-party network activity on any web page — regardless of existing content blockers or DNS-level filtering.

### Why This Matters to You

Modern websites often interact with numerous third-party services — for ads, analytics, content delivery, and more. Understanding which external servers your browser talks to is crucial for privacy-conscious users, security analysts, and filter list maintainers alike. uBO Scope puts this visibility in your hands, empowering you to audit and grasp the true network behavior behind what you see.

### Key Benefits at a Glance

- **Comprehensive Visibility:** Reveals *every* attempted or successful connection to remote servers — no matter what content blockers or DNS filters are active.
- **Independent Reporting:** Works alongside other blockers without interference, offering an unbiased audit of network activity.
- **Third-Party Focus:** Highlights distinct third-party domains your browser communicates with, helping you understand the external footprint of any webpage.
- **Easy Monitoring:** Toolbar badge instantly shows how many unique third-party domains were contacted on the current tab.
- **Insightful Analysis:** Differentiates between connections allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked for precise understanding.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

This extension is designed for anyone who needs clarity about network connections behind web pages, including:

- Privacy and security enthusiasts wanting transparency beyond mere blocking
- Developers and analysts auditing third-party resource requests
- Filter list maintainers seeking real-world testing of content blocking rules
- Users curious about what external domains a website connects to during browsing

## What Exactly is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension that acts as your personal network microphone, listening to all network requests your browser makes and reporting their outcomes. It does this by leveraging the browser's `webRequest` API to track remote server connections attempted by web pages.

Its mission is simple: show you every remote connection your browser attempts, whether these connections succeed, are stealth-blocked (blocked quietly without alerting the page), or fail outright. It achieves this independently of any other content blocker — so you get a true picture of network activity, unfiltered by other blocking tools.

### Core Purpose

- To **audit network connections** transparently
- To **enable better understanding** of third-party tracking and resource fetching
- To **debunk common misconceptions** about content blockers and block counts

### What Sets uBO Scope Apart?

- It reports **all connections**, not just those recognized or blocked by content blocking rules.
- It **counts distinct third-party domains**, giving a clear metric on external dependencies.
- It provides a **real-time badge** on the browser toolbar to keep you informed at a glance.
- Designed as a **complementary tool** to content blockers, not a replacement.

### How it Operates

Behind the scenes, uBO Scope monitors all outgoing HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and WSS requests via the browser's `webRequest` mechanism. It captures events like request success, redirects, and errors. It organizes the connections by tab and classifies them into:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully established
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests silently redirected or concealed by blockers
- **Blocked:** Requests that encountered errors or were explicitly blocked

Each connection is analyzed to extract hostnames and their registered domains, and tallied accordingly.

By doing this, uBO Scope unearths the true network communication landscape of every page, including the invisible parts other tools may not reveal.

## What Can You Do with uBO Scope?

Imagine you're loading a news website and suspect it loads many trackers from hidden servers. With uBO Scope:

- You open the extension popup to instantly see a summary of all third-party domains contacted.
- You observe the badge on the toolbar increasing or decreasing as you navigate.
- You compare the lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains to understand which tracking domains are active or silently blocked.
- You gain confidence about which connections are truly reaching their destinations.

This insight helps you make informed decisions about which filters to enable or adjust and educates you on the behavior of content blockers.

## Practical Tips for Using uBO Scope

- **Lower Badge Counts Are Better:** The badge indicates the number of distinct third-party domains connected. Aim for fewer connections to enhance privacy.
- **Don't Rely on Block Counts Alone:** High block counts do not necessarily mean better blocking. uBO Scope helps you focus on allowed connections.
- **Use Alongside a Blocker:** This tool complements blockers like uBlock Origin by showing what those blockers are (or aren’t) blocking.
- **Beware of Testing Myths:** Avoid relying on "ad blocker test" pages as they do not simulate real-world network connections properly.

## Troubleshooting and Next Steps

If you don’t see connection data after installing uBO Scope:

- Ensure your browser’s permissions allow the extension to monitor web requests.
- Refresh active tabs or open new tabs to trigger network requests.
- Check browser or extension error messages in the developer console.
