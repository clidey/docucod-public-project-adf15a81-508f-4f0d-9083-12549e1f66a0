title: "What is uBO Scope?"
description: "uBO Scope is a browser extension that surfaces all outgoing network connections attempted by web pages—both those that succeed and those that are blocked. Its primary goal is to empower users and filter list maintainers with clear visibility into which third-party servers are contacted by web content, regardless of the active content blockers. By providing an accurate count of unique remote servers contacted, it helps users make informed privacy and security decisions."

# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlock Complete Visibility Into Webpage Network Connections

uBO Scope is a powerful browser extension designed to reveal the full scope of remote server connections initiated by webpages. It shows every attempted and successful connection, giving you a clear, accurate picture of how web content communicates externally.

- **See all outgoing connections:** Including those allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright denied.
- **Accurate third-party server count:** Understand exactly how many unique external servers a webpage interacts with.
- **Independent of content blockers:** Works regardless of which content blocking rules or DNS filters are active.
- **Empowers privacy and security decisions:** Identify legitimate third parties versus potentially intrusive connections.

**Ideal for:** Privacy-conscious users, filter list maintainers, and anyone wanting to understand the network behavior of web pages deeply.

## What Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension for Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers that tracks the remote server connections made by webpages you visit. Unlike common content blockers that focus on blocking unwanted content, uBO Scope focuses on **reporting** all network connection attempts — successful, stealth-blocked, or blocked — providing transparent insight into what servers your browser contacts.

### Core Purpose

The primary goal of uBO Scope is to **surface the connections** between your browser and every third-party remote server involved during page loading. By aggregating these connections, it enables you to:

- Detect which and how many unique third-party servers are being contacted.
- Understand the effectiveness of your content filtering setup by seeing what gets blocked or allowed.
- Make informed privacy and security assessments based on real network behavior rather than relying on heuristics or surface-level metrics.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

- **Comprehensive connection reporting:** Unlike typical blockers that only count blocked requests, uBO Scope counts every distinct third-party connection attempted by the browser.
- **Independent of blocking settings:** It receives data directly from the browser's networking API (`webRequest`), unaffected by the current content blocking configurations.
- **Real-time badge indicators:** The toolbar icon dynamically displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted, offering an at-a-glance measure of network exposure.

### How uBO Scope Works at a High Level

When you visit a webpage, your browser makes multiple network requests to various domains. uBO Scope listens to these requests via the browser's `webRequest` API, including redirects and failures. It categorizes requests as:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully established.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests intercepted or hidden by content blockers in subtle ways.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed or were actively blocked.

It aggregates this information per browser tab, maintaining counts of unique hostnames and domains contacted, then displays this data in the extension popup and as a badge on the toolbar icon.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Real-Time Network Connection Monitoring**
  - Tracks all HTTP(S) and WebSocket connections originating from active tabs.
  - Reports the outcome status of each request (success, redirect, error).

- **Comprehensive Third-Party Server Reporting**
  - Distinguishes between first-party and third-party connections using domain analysis.
  - Counts unique domains and hostnames separately.

- **Visual Badge Indicator**
  - Displays the count of distinct third-party servers contacted on the browser toolbar.
  - Updates dynamically to reflect live network events.

- **Detailed Popup Summary Panel**
  - Lists domains categorized by outcome: not blocked, stealth-blocked, and blocked.
  - Shows counts of connection attempts per domain.

- **Persistence and Session Awareness**
  - Remembers connection data per tab across browsing sessions using browser session storage.
  - Automatically resets data when tabs reload or close.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
  - Supports Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari with manifest configurations tuned accordingly.

### How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Workflow

Imagine opening a new tab, loading a web page, and wondering just how many external servers this page interacts with and which were blocked by your content blocker. uBO Scope tracks this for you silently and shows the total count on its toolbar badge. Clicking the badge opens the popup where you get detailed visibility into:

- Which servers were contacted without interference.
- Which servers were blocked outright.
- Which were stealth-blocked (blocked in subtle ways that might not be obvious).

This lets you quickly assess if a content blocker or filtering setup is effective and understand the real network footprint of any page you visit.

## Why Should You Care?

### Clarity on Network Exposure
Without a tool like uBO Scope, you might assume that installing any popular content blocker ensures minimal network exposure to third-party servers. However, many blockers differ in subtle ways, and traditional metrics like block count don't reflect the true number of third parties contacted.

uBO Scope provides **transparent, unbiased data** based on actual network events.

### Busting Common Misconceptions
- **Misleading Block Counts:** High block counts don't guarantee fewer connections; uBO Scope shows you how many distinct servers are actually contacted.

- **Unreliable Ad Blocker Tests:** Many 'ad blocker test' pages fabricate scenarios that do not represent real-world traffic. uBO Scope reveals the reality hidden behind these tests.

### Use Cases
- **Privacy Advocates:** Understand which third parties are communicating and whether blocking rules cover them.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Analyze how lists impact network connections and identify stealth-blocked or missed domains.
- **Security Researchers:** Track external connections and assess potential leak points.

### Tangible Benefits
- Make better decisions about which content blockers or filter lists to use.
- Reduce unnecessary exposure to tracking domains and CDN third parties.
- Monitor network connections effectively without invasive or heuristic-based methods.

## Getting Started Preview

### Installing and Initializing uBO Scope
1. Install the extension from your browser's official store (see README).
2. Navigate to any web page and observe the badge icon; it shows the number of distinct third-party servers connected.
3. Click the toolbar icon to open the popup panel with detailed connection status, including lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

### Prerequisites
- Browser version supporting Manifest v3 (Chromium 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Permissions required: `activeTab`, `storage`, and `webRequest` APIs.

### Next Steps
- Explore how the badge and popup data relate to your existing content blocker setups.
- Review guides on interpreting connection outcomes and integrating uBO Scope with your workflow.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope alongside your existing content blocker—not as a replacement—to gain supplementary insights.
- Favor domains with low counts on the badge for higher privacy assurance.
- Understand that not all third-party connections are undesirable; some are legitimate services (CDNs, analytics).
- Regularly check the popup details when visiting new or suspicious pages.

<Callout>
**Important**: Connections outside of the browser’s `webRequest` API scope (e.g., OS-level calls or proxy requests) will not be reported by uBO Scope.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

### The Badge Shows No Count
- Ensure you have opened at least one webpage that makes network requests.
- Confirm uBO Scope permissions are granted during installation.

### Popup Shows No Data or "NO DATA"
- This happens if the current tab has no recorded connection data yet.
- Reload the page and wait a few seconds for data to aggregate.

### Unexpectedly High Third-Party Counts
- Some websites use many third-party CDNs and services; review domains carefully in the popup.
- Cross-check with your content blocker to assess if stealth-blocking is in effect.
