# Why Use uBO Scope?

Understanding your web browser's privacy posture is more complex than just counting blocked ads or trackers. uBO Scope offers an essential transparency layer into how your browser interacts with third-party servers, presenting an unbiased report that goes beyond what typical ad blockers and block counters provide.

## Reveal True Third-Party Connections

Many users rely on block counters or ad blocker test sites to judge privacy protections. These methods often miss hidden or stealthy network connections made by websites, giving a false sense of security. uBO Scope exposes **all outgoing connections** to remote servers from the active tab, including those that generic block indicators ignore.

By showing the **distinct third-party domains contacted**, you can see exactly how many external entities your browser interacts with. This real-time insight enables you to distinguish between superficial block counts and genuine network exposure.

## Debunk Misleading Metrics and Myths

uBO Scope equips you with facts to refute common misconceptions around content blocking:

- **Block counts can be deceptive.** A higher number of blocked items does not necessarily mean better protection. Because browsers may fetch content from more unique domains despite blocking many individual requests, traditional counts don’t reflect the true network impact.
- **Ad blocker test pages don’t reflect real-world activity.** Such tests use artificial network requests and ignore stealth blocking techniques, making their results unreliable for assessing real privacy.

With uBO Scope, you see the *actual* third-party exposure on any webpage rather than relying on flawed or artificially constructed metrics.

## Empower Filter List Maintainers and Privacy-Conscious Users

For those managing or validating blocking filter lists, uBO Scope is a vital companion:

- It tracks and reports the precise third-party domains that connect during browsing sessions.
- It identifies "stealth-blocked" connections that evade typical block counters.
- It verifies blocking effectiveness over time and across browsing scenarios.

Even on restricted platforms where developer tools are scarce, the extension’s independent measurements serve as a trustworthy metric.

## Practical Benefits to You

- Gain a **clear, indisputable view** of all network interactions initiated by websites.
- Make **informed decisions** on your content blocker settings, knowing which third parties are truly reaching your browser.
- Detect unexpected or hidden connections potentially impacting privacy and security.
- Validate and improve privacy-oriented filter lists with actionable data.

## How uBO Scope Surpasses Others

Unlike standard ad blockers or generic block counters, uBO Scope:

- Monitors network requests at a browser level through **webRequest API**, independent of any specific filter engine.
- Counts **unique third-party domains contacted**, not just blocked URLs.
- Reports connections categorized as **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked**, facilitating deeper insights.
- Remains agnostic to the content blocking solution you use, offering a consistent measurement baseline.

## Real-World Example

Imagine browsing a news website:

- A traditional ad blocker reports it blocked 150 items.
- Ad blocker test sites show it passes their tests.
- uBO Scope reveals the site actually connected to 25 unique third-party domains, including some connections the blocker missed.

This insight might encourage you to customize your filter lists or use more stringent blocking for certain trackers, actively improving your privacy.

## Getting Started with uBO Scope

After installing the extension, simply open its popup panel while browsing any tab to see:

- The total number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- A breakdown of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.

Use this data to evaluate your privacy posture and refine your content blocker configurations.

For detailed guidance, explore the documentation on interpreting the [Popup Panel and Badge Explained](/overview/feature-overview-usage/popover-and-badge) and the [Badge Counts: What They Mean and Why They Matter](/guides/getting-started-essentials/understanding-badge-logic).

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Use uBO Scope regularly** during your browsing sessions to help detect emerging third-party connections.
- Combine insights from uBO Scope with your preferred content blocker for optimal protection.
- Remember that a low number of connected domains generally indicates better privacy but always consider the context (e.g., legitimate CDN usage).
