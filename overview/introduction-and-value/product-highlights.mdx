# What is uBO Scope?

Discover the unseen network interactions initiated by web pages with uBO Scope, an insightful browser extension that unveils every attempted and successful connection to remote servers. Regardless of any active content blockers, uBO Scope provides you detailed, actionable visibility into third-party domains your browser interacts with, empowering you with a new level of transparency and control.

## Uncovering Hidden Connections

Imagine browsing your favorite website, unaware of the numerous unseen connections it quietly makes behind the scenes. These connections often involve third-party servers that can track, profile, or serve content without your knowledge. uBO Scope lifts the veil by capturing and reporting all such connections, revealing the true network footprint of every webpage you visit.

### What Does uBO Scope Do?

- **Reports All Remote Server Connections:** Whether a network request was allowed, blocked by your content blocker, or redirected stealthily, uBO Scope tracks and counts them all.
- **Independent of Content Blockers:** It functions regardless of what other extensions or system-wide filters are active, relying on the browser’s `webRequest` API.
- **Shows Distinct Third-Party Domains:** The extension’s badge count reflects how many unique third-party remote servers a webpage connects to, highlighting exposure levels.
- **Supports Multiple Browsers:** Available for Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari, it integrates seamlessly across platforms.

## Why Should You Care?

### Transparency in a Complex Web

Web pages today communicate with numerous external servers—CDNs, analytics, advertising networks, and more—often invisibly to end users. Knowing exactly which remote servers are involved helps users:

- Identify unwanted or suspicious third-party requests.
- Gauge the effectiveness of content blockers beyond mere block counts.
- Understand exposure to potential tracking or data leakage points.

### Busting Common Myths

- **Block Count is Misleading:** A high block count doesn't mean better blocking. Sometimes, it means more connections were attempted in the first place. uBO Scope tends to focus on the count of allowed connections—not just blocked ones—to better judge exposure.
- **Beware of Ad Blocker Test Pages:** These tests don’t reflect real-world web activity accurately. uBO Scope reports connections on real browsing in your active tab, offering a trustworthy picture of third-party interactions.

---

## Key Concepts You Will See

When you open uBO Scope's popup panel, you interact with three main categories of network requests:

- **Not Blocked:** Connections that were successful and unblocked, representing the third parties your browsing actually accessed.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that your content blocker or browser reported as stealth-blocked, often indicating attempts blocked silently.
- **Blocked:** Explicitly blocked connections, counted and listed for review.

Each category lists domains and the frequency of their connections, offering deep insight into the external network activity caused by the webpage.

---

## How It Works (Simplified)

uBO Scope constantly listens to your browser's network requests for your active tabs and logs outcomes for each:

- **Allowed:** Network requests that succeed.
- **Redirect:** Requests that were redirected.
- **Error / Blocked:** Requests that failed or were blocked.

It maps these requests back to their hostnames and domains using a comprehensive public suffix list, ensuring granular and accurate grouping of third-party entities.

This data is presented in an intuitive popup UI with counts and domain lists, instantly informing you of your current browsing third-party exposure.

---

## Real-World Example

When visiting an online news article, you might see in uBO Scope:

- 3 trusted CDN domains listed under **Not Blocked**.
- 2 advertising networks quietly blocked under **Blocked**.
- A stealth tracker blocked silently, appearing in the **Stealth-Blocked** category.

This breakdown allows you to quickly assess the nature of external connections and decide whether to adjust your filters or investigate further.

## Practical Tips for Using uBO Scope

- **Monitor Your Badge:** The toolbar badge number shows how many distinct third-party domains your current webpage connected to. A lower number usually indicates fewer third-party exposures.
- **Check Each Category:** Don’t overlook stealth-blocked connections; they reveal requests intended to bypass detection.
- **Use in Combination with Blockers:** While uBO Scope doesn’t block itself, it helps evaluate if your content blockers effectively reduce third-party connections.
- **Understand Legitimate Third-Parties:** Recognize that some third-party connections like CDNs or essential services are normal and not inherently harmful.
