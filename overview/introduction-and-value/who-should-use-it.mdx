# Who Should Use It?

Understanding who benefits most from uBO Scope helps you decide if this tool fits your privacy or professional needs. uBO Scope is designed with particular user groups in mind, each gaining unique insights from its transparent reporting of third-party network activities.

## Ideal Users of uBO Scope

### Privacy-Conscious Individuals
If protecting your online footprint matters, uBO Scope reveals all third-party domains your browser contacts during web browsing. This goes beyond what conventional content blockers show by including allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections, giving you a clear picture of your exposure.

### Web Professionals and Developers
Web developers, security experts, and site administrators benefit from uBO Scope’s visibility into network traffic. It helps verify which domains are contacted by web pages, enabling troubleshooting, performance analysis, and validation of content blocking strategies without relying on browser developer tools that may be unavailable or limited.

### Filter List Maintainers
For those maintaining or developing filter lists for content blockers, uBO Scope is invaluable. It works on platforms with limited debugging tools, providing straightforward data on which third-party servers are actually contacted. This allows maintainers to evaluate filter effectiveness more accurately and prioritize updates.

### Users on Restricted or Mobile Platforms
Platforms like mobile browsers often restrict access to advanced webRequest debugging or developer tools. uBO Scope fills this gap by exposing third-party connections directly through its simple interface, enabling users to inspect network outcomes even where other tools fall short.

### Users Seeking Real-World Content Blocker Evaluation
If you want to understand the actual impact of different content blockers—not just block counts but the true scope of network connections—uBO Scope offers clarity. It debunks misleading metrics from "ad blocker test" sites and block counters alone by focusing on distinct remote server connections, which are the true measure of privacy risk.

## What You Should Expect

- **Transparency**: See every domain your browser connects to while browsing, categorized by whether the connection was allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Works reliably where browser debugging tools are limited or non-existent, providing a consistent user experience.
- **Context Beyond Block Counts**: Instead of relying on a tally of requests blocked, understand how many unique third-party domains are being contacted—lower counts equal better privacy.

<Note>
While some third-party connections are legitimate, such as CDN providers, uBO Scope exposes them all to empower informed oversight.

## Real Scenarios Where uBO Scope Excels

- Before trusting a new content blocker, compare it with uBO Scope to see if it truly reduces exposure to third-party servers.
- When debugging site breakages, determine which external domains loads successfully versus those silently blocked or stealth-blocked.
- For filter list maintainers, analyze which third-party domains are still contacted that may need blocking or adjustment in filter rules.
- On mobile browsers without rich developer tools, gain insight into network activity invisible to standard browser interfaces.

## Avoiding Common Misunderstandings

- **Not Just Another Block Counter:** uBO Scope emphasizes distinct domains contacted, not just number of blocked requests, providing a clearer privacy metric.
- **Debunking Ad Blocker Test Pages:** Many "ad blocker test" pages use unrealistic network calls and cannot detect stealth blocking, which uBO Scope reveals through real user traffic.

## Getting the Most From Your Use

To leverage uBO Scope effectively, consider pairing it with your favorite content blocker and compare outcomes. This can expose hidden connections and improve your content filtering strategies.

**Summary**

uBO Scope is perfectly suited for users demanding transparency on network connections: privacy advocates, web professionals, filter list maintainers, and anyone on platforms with limited debugging capabilities. It provides a rare, real-world window into how web pages interact with third-party servers beyond typical content blocker metrics, positioning users to make informed decisions about their online privacy and site performance.

## Practical Tips

- Use uBO Scope alongside your current content blocker to gain visibility into allowed versus blocked connections.
- Review the extension’s popup dashboard regularly to track changes in third-party exposure while browsing different sites.
- Filter list maintainers should utilize uBO Scope’s detailed domain breakdowns to spot gaps in blocking coverage.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t rely on block count badges as a sole measure of privacy—focus on the number of distinct domains contacted.
- Avoid using "ad blocker test" webpages to assess content blocker effectiveness. Instead, trust uBO Scope’s real traffic insights.
