# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Understanding who benefits most from uBO Scope empowers users to leverage this tool effectively. Its audiences range from privacy-conscious individuals wanting transparency, to filter list maintainers aiming to optimize ad blockers, to developers and analysts seeking detailed insight into network activity.

---

## Target Audiences

### Privacy-Conscious Users

If you value online privacy and want real visibility into the network connections your browser makes, uBO Scope is essential. It reveals every third-party server your active page reaches out to—whether connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or explicitly blocked. This insight helps you understand the true extent of data exposure beyond what content blockers report.

*Example:* Jane suspects certain websites load trackers despite her ad blocker. Using uBO Scope, she verifies the domains contacted and notes stealth-blocked or blocked connections, allowing her to refine privacy settings.

### Filter List Maintainers

Filter list authors and maintainers can harness uBO Scope as a diagnostic companion. By exposing all requested remote servers and outcomes, it provides empirical data to assess which domains should be blocked or allowed. This helps produce more efficient and accurate filter lists, especially on platforms with limited browser developer tools.

*Example:* Alex manages a filter list and uses uBO Scope to monitor third-party connections occurring during browsing sessions to identify missing blocks or false positives.

### Developers, Researchers, and Analysts

For web developers, security analysts, or researchers investigating network behavior, uBO Scope offers a transparent window into network requests generated by web content. This can be useful for debugging, auditing privacy policies, or studying third-party resource usage on websites.

*Example:* A security researcher uses uBO Scope to quantify connections made to external servers by various sites, validating claims about minimal third-party exposure.

## Typical Use Cases

- **Validating Privacy Claims:** Confirm if a content blocker effectively limits exposure to third-party domains.
- **Investigating Content Blocker Behavior:** Detect differences between stealth blocking and explicit blocking impact on network connections.
- **Analyzing Third-Party Resource Loading:** Examine which remote servers serve resources on popular sites.
- **Improving Filter Lists:** Use concrete network data to refine domain blocking rules.
- **Educational Insights:** Help users understand how websites operate with respect to remote connections.

## Before and After with uBO Scope

Without uBO Scope, users rely on indirect signals like block counts or webpage behavior, which can misrepresent actual third-party exposure. With uBO Scope, users gain a clear, reliable count and categorization of distinct domains their browser interacts with, making privacy assessments and troubleshooting grounded in real data.

---

## Best Practices

- Regularly check the badge count to monitor third-party connections.
- Use the popup panel to review allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Combine uBO Scope data with browser developer tools for deeper analysis.
- For filter list maintainers, consistently verify domain outcomes during updates.

---

## Troubleshooting and Considerations

- The extension depends on browser support of the `webRequest` API. Some network requests made outside this API’s scope won't appear.
- Badge counts reflect distinct third-party domains, not total requests or resources.
- A low badge count generally indicates fewer distinct third-party connections, which aligns with higher privacy.
