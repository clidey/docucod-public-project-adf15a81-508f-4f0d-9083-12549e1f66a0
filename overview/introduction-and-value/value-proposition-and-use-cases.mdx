uBO Scope isn't just another browser extension; it is your clear window into the complex world of remote server connections made by the webpages you visit. By shining a factual, unbiased light on all network requests—successful or blocked—it empowers you to understand and evaluate what is truly happening behind the scenes.

### What uBO Scope Brings to You

- **Accurate Visibility:** See every connection attempt, not just the ones your content blockers allow or block.
- **Unbiased Measurement:** Understand true third-party connections regardless of browser or blocker stealth techniques.
- **Myth-Busting Insights:** Debunk common misconceptions around blocker performance and ad-blocker test sites.
- **Data for Filter List Maintainers:** Obtain meaningful metrics to fine-tune and evaluate filter lists with real connections, not fabricated scenarios.
- **Lightweight Transparency:** Gain clarity without performance overhead or invasive monitoring.

### Who Benefits from uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users seeking clarity about third-party connections.
- Filter list maintainers needing realistic connection data.
- Users troubleshooting unexpected network activity or content blocker behaviors.

## Understanding uBO Scope’s Purpose and Value

At its core, uBO Scope reveals all remote server connections a webpage attempts, successfully establishes, or blocks. This goes beyond what traditional content blockers or browser tools show by capturing every network request event reported by the browser’s `webRequest` API.

It addresses a critical challenge: many users and developers mistakenly evaluate content blockers by how many items they report blocked or pass, or by relying on synthetic test pages meant to simulate ad-blocker performance. uBO Scope cuts through this confusion with **objective data** about distinct third-party remote servers.

Because the badge count on the extension icon reflects the _number of unique third-party domains connected_, it directly speaks to your browsing privacy surface area. Lower counts suggest fewer remote servers receiving data from your browsing session, which is generally a better privacy outcome.

### Why This Matters

- **Block Count Fallacy:** A blocker reporting more blocked requests isn't necessarily better. A higher block count can correlate with more distinct third-party servers being contacted, implying more, not less, data leaving your browser.
- **Fake Test Scenarios:** So-called 'ad blocker test' pages use unrealistic request patterns, failing to represent real-world browsing; uBO Scope’s data is grounded in actual network traffic.

<u>uBO Scope offers a factual basis under your control, empowering informed decisions about blocking strategies and privacy.</u>

## Real-World User Scenarios Where uBO Scope Excels

### Scenario 1: You want to verify your content blocker’s effectiveness

Rather than trust ambiguous block counts or online tests, install uBO Scope to see exactly which third-party servers your browser contacts. Observe how your current blocker affects the distinct domains connected during real browsing.

### Scenario 2: You suspect a site is connecting to unexpected third parties

Use uBO Scope’s popup panel to instantly inspect the domains your browser attempted or blocked. Identify stealth or blocked connections clearly, helping you decide if further blocking rules are needed.

### Scenario 3: You maintain or update filter lists

Leverage uBO Scope’s precise connection data to verify if your lists are truly reducing distinct third-party connections rather than just inflating block counts or triggering page breakage.

### Scenario 4: You want to debunk misleading content blocker comparisons

Use uBO Scope as a neutral arbiter, not relying on marketing claims, but on the core metric of distinct third-party domains contacted by your browser.

## How Getting Started Looks

Getting started is seamless:

1. Install uBO Scope from your browser’s extension store.
2. Browse normally and observe the badge count indicating distinct third-party domains contacted.
3. Click the toolbar icon to open the popup panel showing detailed breakdowns:
    - Domains not blocked (allowed)
    - Domains stealth-blocked (connections silently intercepted)
    - Domains explicitly blocked
4. Use this data to deepen your understanding or troubleshoot network activity.

## Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls

- The badge counts third-party domains connected, not the number of requests; one domain may serve many requests.
- Don't confuse a high block count for better privacy – focus on how many distinct servers are contacted.
- Some third-party connections (e.g., Content Delivery Networks) are necessary for webpage functionality; consider context.
- uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API and therefore does not see network requests outside the browser.
- Stealth blocks are connections blocked silently (without webpage knowledge) — useful to detect hidden resource loads.

## Summary

uBO Scope provides a transparent window into your browser’s network behavior, revealing all attempted remote server connections with a focus on distinct third-party domains. It helps users and filter list maintainers base privacy assessments and troubleshooting on factual data, debunking common misconceptions about content blockers and their tests.
