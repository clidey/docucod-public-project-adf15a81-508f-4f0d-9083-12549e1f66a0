# Why Use uBO Scope?

Discover how uBO Scope empowers you with unparalleled visibility and actionable insights into your browser's network connections. Designed for users focused on privacy, security, and filter list maintenance, this tool transcends conventional ad blocker metrics to give you clarity on what truly matters.

---

## Unlock Transparency into Network Connections

uBO Scope reveals every remote server your browser attempts to communicate with — whether those connections are allowed, stealthily blocked, or outright prevented. Unlike standard content blockers that only report basic block counts, uBO Scope shows you **the actual number of distinct third-party servers contacted.**

- **See the full picture:** Understand your web traffic beyond opaque block counters.
- **Verify blocker effectiveness:** Confirm whether your blocking setup actually reduces external connections.
- **Track third-party domains:** Differentiate legitimate CDN domains from potential tracking or advertising servers.

Imagine browsing your favorite news site and instantly knowing which third-party servers it connects to. uBO Scope surfaces that detail clearly, letting you gauge if your privacy defenses hold strong or if unexpected leaks occur.

## Validate the Real Impact of Your Content Blocker

Many users assume that a high block count means better protection, but uBO Scope debunks this myth by shifting focus from block counts to **distinct remote servers contacted.** Here's what you gain:

- **Avoid misleading block scores:** Higher block counts may correspond to *more* third-party connections allowed — not fewer.
- **Insightful network outcome:** uBO Scope reports three key categories:
  - *Allowed*: Connections successfully made.
  - *Stealth-blocked*: Requests redirected or blocked silently.
  - *Blocked*: Requests that failed outright.

This nuanced insight lets you assess content blockers with accuracy, avoiding false assumptions based on cookie-cutter metrics.

## Debunk Common Blocking Myths

uBO Scope challenges these widespread misconceptions with concrete evidence:

### Myth 1: "More blocks = better blocker"

- Reality: A content blocker reporting many blocked requests could still allow more distinct external servers, undermining overall privacy.
- uBO Scope focuses on server connections, not just filter lists triggered.

### Myth 2: "Ad blocker test sites provide reliable blocker evaluation"

- Reality: These test pages simulate unrealistic scenarios and often don't detect stealthy content blocking techniques.
- uBO Scope tracks *real-world* network connections from actual sites for practical accuracy.

By illuminating these truths, the extension empowers you to make informed privacy choices.

## Ideal For Privacy-Conscious Users and Filter List Maintainers

Whether you're an advanced user auditing privacy settings or a filter list maintainer working on content blocking rules, uBO Scope delivers benefits tailored to your needs:

- **Privacy-focused users** gain peace of mind by verifying that fewer third-party remote connections occur during browsing.
- **Filter list maintainers** can analyze precise connection data even on devices without full browsing tools.

The extension's simple badge count indicates the number of unique third-party domains contacted, encouraging minimal exposure.

---

## Practical Tips for Maximizing Value

- Use uBO Scope alongside your favorite content blocker to monitor actual network behavior rather than filter counts.
- Avoid relying on ad blocker test websites; instead, trust the real-time connection data from this tool.
- Periodically inspect domains listed as allowed or stealth-blocked to detect any emerging tracking sources.

## Real World Example Scenario

**Before uBO Scope:** You see "100 blocks" on your content blocker and believe it's highly effective.

**After uBO Scope:** You notice your browser is actually connecting to 15 distinct third-party servers — more than you expected for a blocked count that high. You investigate these connections, adjust your filter lists, and reduce the number to 5.

This deeper insight lets you take meaningful action.

## Summary

uBO Scope is not just another blocker; it is the definitive tool that "measures stuff" — quantifying the real network exposure your browser experiences. It provides transparent, actionable data about remote server connections to elevate your understanding and enhance your privacy.
