# Key Use Cases of uBO Scope

uBO Scope offers users an unparalleled window into the hidden world of web page connections. By focusing on the real outcomes of network requests—including allowed, blocked, and stealthily blocked connections—this extension empowers you to deeply understand and verify your browser’s exposure to third-party domains.

---

## Why Key Use Cases Matter

As a user, developer, filter list maintainer, or privacy enthusiast, you need actionable, transparent data about what your browser is connecting to. Many tools give misleading metrics or incomplete perspectives, but uBO Scope delivers straightforward, factual insights based on actual network activity.

This page details scenarios where uBO Scope shines, helping you see exactly why it matters for your privacy, web debugging, or development workflow.

## 1. Transparent Reporting of Third-Party Connections

**What you experience:**
When browsing a website, countless resources often load from multiple third-party servers beyond the site's own domain. Not all connections are visible or intuitive, especially when content blockers alter or stealthily modify requests.

**How uBO Scope helps:**
- Gives a clear count and listing of distinct third-party domains contacted by the page.
- Differentiates outcomes into allowed, stealth-blocked (requests hidden from the page), and blocked categories.
- Provides a reliable indicator in the toolbar badge of distinct allowed third-party servers—the *actual* surface of network exposure.

**Real example:**
You visit an online news site and suspect it loads hidden trackers. uBO Scope lists all external domains connected, showing which were blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed, clarifying if trackers truly got through.

<Tip>
Keep an eye on the badge count: a lower number indicates fewer third-party connections actually succeeded, reflecting stronger privacy protection.
</Tip>

## 2. Debunking Misleading Claims about Content Blocker Efficacy

**Common misconception:**
Some users assume a blocker is better if it shows a high number of blocked connections in its badge.

**Why this is flawed:**
A high block count doesn't necessarily mean fewer connections. It may signal that your browser allowed many different third-party connections (not blocked), which were then caught and blocked at a later point or not effectively.

**How uBO Scope clarifies:**
- By counting distinct allowed third-party domains, uBO Scope provides the real impact metric: how many distinct servers your browser actually fetched resources from.
- Shows stealth-blocked requests, illustrating the limitations of block counts seen in other blockers.

**Use case:**
Compare your usual content blocker’s badge number with uBO Scope’s insight. You might discover your content blocker blocks many requests but still allows connections to a larger number of unique domains.

<Warning>
Do not rely solely on block counts from content blockers to evaluate privacy protection.
</Warning>

## 3. Verifying Which Remote Servers Webpages Contact

**Why it’s crucial:**
Webpages often dynamically load resources from many domains including CDNs, analytics, social widgets, and ad networks. Detecting which servers received traffic helps security audits, performance optimization, and privacy reviews.

**Functionality in uBO Scope:**
- Automatically records every domain involved in network requests, categorizing by request outcome.
- Updates the toolbar badge and popup panel live for active tabs.
- Shows per-domain request counts to highlight connections with the highest traffic.

**Typical scenario:**
A developer audits their website and spots unexpected third-party domains. With uBO Scope, they confirm if third-party APIs or analytics are sharing data externally.

## 4. Supporting Filter List Maintainers with Real-World Traffic Data

**Challenge for maintainers:**
Filter lists rely on real-world browsing data but lack visibility on which third-party servers are contacted on various devices or browsers, especially where developer tools are limited.

**How uBO Scope assists:**
- Captures comprehensive network request data regardless of the active content blocker.
- Works across multiple browsers including environments with restricted debugging tools, providing unfiltered connection information.
- Offers a data foundation to refine filters based on actual, observed third-party domains.

**For example:**
Maintainers on mobile browsers or specialized devices without full devtools can use uBO Scope to verify and update blocklists accurately against current web traffic.

---

## 5. Operating on Devices with Limited Developer Tools

**Problem:**
Many browsers or platforms restrict access to webRequest APIs or have minimal developer tools that limit debugging network activity.

**uBO Scope's solution:**
- Uses browser extension webRequest listeners to capture all network requests as reported by the browser.
- Provides an extension popup UI to directly display connection details and outcomes without needing complex devtool access.
- Works reliably even when other debugging tools fail to provide insight.

**Use case:**
Users on tablets or constrained browsers obtain visibility into remote connections for privacy assessment, avoiding guesswork or inaccurate assumptions.

---

## Practical Tips for Key Use Cases

- Regularly check the badge count and popup for sites you browse intensively to monitor potential privacy exposures.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your primary content blocker to validate which connections ultimately succeed versus those blocked or stealth-blocked.
- If you manage or maintain filter lists, leverage uBO Scope data to identify domains seen in actual browsing scenarios rather than in synthetic tests.
- Beware of 'ad blocker test' sites; rely on uBO Scope’s real-traffic analysis for consistent and trustworthy results.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Misinterpreting block counts as direct indicators of privacy protection.
- Relying solely on synthetic test pages without real network context.
- Ignoring stealth-blocked domains, which may affect the reliability of perceived blocking effectiveness.
