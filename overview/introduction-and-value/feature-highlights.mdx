# Core Features at a Glance

uBO Scope focuses on delivering a clear and immediate understanding of your browser’s network connections to third-party servers. This documentation highlights uBO Scope’s standout capabilities that empower you to monitor, analyze, and verify network activity in real time—all from the convenience of your browser.

## Real-Time Monitoring of Distinct Third-Party Servers

At the heart of uBO Scope is the ability to track every remote server your browser attempts to connect with during your browsing session. What sets it apart is its focus on **distinct third-party servers**, helping you see not just the volume of connections but the diversity of external resources involved.

- **Tracks all connection attempts**, including successful, blocked, and stealth-blocked requests.
- Aggregates connection data by domains and hostnames for clear insight.
- Uses internal session tracking to maintain a comprehensive overview per browser tab.

This approach offers you a precise understanding of which third-party networks are active, shining a light on potential privacy or performance concerns.

## Visual Reporting Through Popup UI and Badge Count

uBO Scope makes insights accessible with two straightforward visual tools:

- **Toolbar Badge Count:** Displays the number of distinct third-party domains your current tab has connected to. This badge refreshes in real-time and serves as an immediate, at-a-glance indicator of network diversity.
- **Popup Interface:** Clicking the toolbar icon opens a detailed popup showing three outcome categories:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains where resources were successfully fetched.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were silently blocked without triggering errors.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where network requests were explicitly blocked.

Each category lists connected domains alongside the count of requests, offering nuanced insight into the nature of each network interaction.

### Example Workflow

Imagine you’re visiting a news site and want to check which third-party domains are contacted behind the scenes. The badge count immediately shows you how many distinct external domains are in play. Opening the popup, you find some domains are allowed (CDNs, analytics), a few stealth-blocked domains, and others explicitly blocked.

This gives you actionable knowledge about external connections without digging into developer tools.

## Compatibility Across Major Browsers

uBO Scope seamlessly integrates across popular browsers such as Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari. It adheres to each browser’s extension architecture with:

- Support for Manifest Version 3 standards.
- Usage of `webRequest` API permissions to intercept network requests.
- Browser-agnostic code for consistent functionality and experience.

This broad compatibility enables users to rely on uBO Scope regardless of their preferred browser, ensuring you have consistent visibility into network connections.

## How These Features Fit Your Browsing and Analysis Workflows

- **Everyday Users:** Gain peace of mind by knowing which third-party servers your browser connects to as you surf the web.
- **Privacy Enthusiasts:** Verify that content blockers are effectively minimizing third-party connections.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Analyze how different filters and blockers impact network requests, identifying stealth-blocked or problematic domains.

This combination of real-time tracking and clear visuals anchors uBO Scope as an essential companion tool for transparency and control over your web connections.

## Practical Tips

- Keep an eye on the badge count: a sudden rise can indicate new or unexpected third-party connections.
- Use the popup details to identify stealth-blocked domains, which may hint at blockers working subtly.
- Remember that not all third parties are harmful—content delivery networks (CDNs) often count as legitimate third-party servers.

## Common Pitfalls

- The badge only counts distinct domains; multiple connections to the same domain increase the count by one only.
- Network requests made outside the browser’s `webRequest` API scope (e.g., some WebSocket connections depending on permissions) may not be reported.

## Getting Started Preview

Once installed, uBO Scope works automatically:

1. Browse websites as usual.
2. Observe the badge while navigating; it updates as new connections form.
3. Click the badge to open the popup and explore detailed connection outcomes per tab.
