# Ecosystem & Integration Context

## Understanding uBO Scope's Operation Beyond Content Blockers

uBO Scope is designed to operate independently of any content blockers you may have installed, such as uBlock Origin or DNS blocking solutions. Instead of relying on blocking mechanisms or their internal counts, it leverages browser APIs to report comprehensive network activity about all remote server connections made by webpages. This approach ensures transparency and accuracy when monitoring network requests, providing insights into the actual connections attempted or completed, regardless of what gets blocked elsewhere.

## How uBO Scope Integrates with Browser APIs

At the core of uBO Scope's design is the use of the browser's `webRequest` API. This powerful API allows the extension to listen for all network requests issued by webpages and categorize their outcomes:

- **Allowed connections:** Requests that successfully reached remote servers.
- **Blocked requests:** Requests that resulted in errors indicating blocking.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Redirects or silent failures that may not be visible through conventional means.

By tapping into these events, uBO Scope collects precise data about each request's status per browser tab, independent of the content blocking layer.

### Independence From Content Blockers

Because it listens directly via the `webRequest` API, uBO Scope can capture network activity even when content blocking occurs at different layers, such as:

- DNS-based blocking
- Other extensions with stealth or alternative blocking mechanisms

This ensures that all attempted and successful connections are accurately reported, giving you a truthful view of third-party requests your browser makes.

## Limits of Reporting and Integration Points

While powerful, uBO Scope has defined limits to what it can observe:

- **Network requests outside browser scope:** Some network activity generated by apps or extensions that do not expose their traffic through the browser's `webRequest` API will not be reported.

- **Browser API restrictions:** Variations across browsers might slightly affect monitoring granularity, but uBO Scope is compatible with Chromium, Firefox, and Safari (with some small differences in host permissions).

- **No blocking functionality:** uBO Scope does not block traffic; it only reports it. To control requests, consider pairing it with established content blockers.

## Practical Integration Scenarios

### Combining uBO Scope with Content Blockers

Many users deploy uBO Scope alongside traditional content blockers like uBlock Origin. This combination allows:

- Content blockers to actively manage what requests are allowed or blocked.
- uBO Scope to independently verify the actual network activity and outcomes.

This dual setup provides a trustworthy audit of how effective content blockers are in minimizing unwanted third-party connections.

### Extending Privacy Analysis

Filter list maintainers and privacy researchers can use uBO Scope to:

- Monitor network behaviors that evade detection by conventional blockers.
- Analyze stealth blocking or redirects that might indicate subtle tracking tactics.

By integrating uBO Scope's detailed reporting into privacy toolchains, users gain an additional layer of insight beyond block counts.

## How uBO Scope Collects and Categorizes Data

uBO Scope's background service worker listens to multiple webRequest events:

- `onBeforeRedirect`
- `onErrorOccurred`
- `onResponseStarted`

Through these listeners, the extension queues network events and periodically processes them:

- It associates requests with the active browser tab.
- Categorizes outcomes into allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Maintains domain- and hostname-level counts.
- Updates the toolbar badge with the count of allowed third-party domains.

This real-time and persistent data storage ensures consistent user experience and reliable reporting.

## Browser Compatibility and Permissions

uBO Scope supports major browsers using manifest version 3, with these key permissions:

- `webRequest` to monitor network events.
- `activeTab` and `storage` for context and data persistence.

Host permissions include wide URL patterns to capture HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and secure WebSocket traffic where available. Notably, host permissions differ slightly by browser due to platform constraints (e.g., Safari restricts WebSocket permissions).

## Best Practices and Considerations

- Always use uBO Scope in conjunction with a capable content blocker if you wish to control network requests instead of just monitoring.

- Do not rely solely on tool-provided block counts to judge the effectiveness of any blocker. Use uBO Scope to see actual network connections.

- Remember that some network traffic may be undetectable by uBO Scope if it does not pass through browser APIs.

- Use the popup panel for a straightforward view of domains connected in each active tab.

## Troubleshooting Common Integration Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Integration Questions">
<Accordion title="Why doesn't uBO Scope show any data on some tabs?">
Some network activity may occur outside the browser context or in ways the `webRequest` API cannot monitor. Ensure the website is loaded in a standard tab and not in incognito mode without extension permission.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope detect blocking by DNS-based filters?">
uBO Scope can see the resulting error events reported by the browser, so it can report blocked outcomes but not directly control DNS-level blocking.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope interfere with other privacy or blocking extensions?">
No, uBO Scope operates passively by listening to network events. It does not block or alter traffic, minimizing conflicts.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

uBO Scope uniquely offers visibility into all remote server connections made by webpages, independent of any content blockers. By leveraging browser APIs and robust session data management, it supplies truthful insights into allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections. It fits naturally into privacy and network auditing ecosystems as a complementary tool that empowers users to understand their network exposure deeply.
