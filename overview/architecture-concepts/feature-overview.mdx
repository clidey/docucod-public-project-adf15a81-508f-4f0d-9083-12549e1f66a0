# Feature Highlights

Discover the core strengths that make uBO Scope an indispensable tool for anyone serious about understanding and monitoring their browser's network activity. This page offers a clear and concise overview of the essential features that deliver real-time insights into remote server connections, regardless of active content blockers.

---

## Real-Time Connection Monitoring

uBO Scope provides an immediate view into every remote server your browser tab interacts with. It captures network connection attempts and outcomes in real time, allowing you to see exactly which domains your browsing session contacts, without delay. This transparency is crucial for verifying the genuine network behavior that happens behind the scenes of any webpage.

**Key User Benefit:** You no longer have to guess or rely on partial information — every connection is logged and tracked live for comprehensive visibility.


## Compatibility Across Content Blockers

Unlike tools that depend solely on your content blocker's reporting, uBO Scope works independently of any blocking mechanism. It records all network requests and their actual outcomes, whether allowed, stealth-blocked (invisible blocking techniques), or outright blocked.

**Why It Matters:** This cross-blocker compatibility ensures that you get a true picture of network activity without blind spots, regardless of what blocker you use or if you're using multiple blockers simultaneously.


## Detailed Domain-Level Reporting

Each network request is aggregated and displayed with fine-grained detail. uBO Scope categorizes remote servers into three distinct outcome types:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully established.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Connections silently blocked by stealth techniques.
- **Blocked:** Connections actively blocked.

The popup interface lists the specific domains contacted in each category along with the count of connections initiated, helping you quickly identify which third parties are engaging with your browser session.


## Intuitive Popup Interface and Badge Summary

uBO Scope's popup breaks down connection outcomes in a clear, user-friendly format:

- The **toolbar badge** shows the count of distinct third-party domains successfully connected to — a low count is a positive indicator.
- The **popup UI** categorizes domains into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked sections with counts, giving immediate insight.

This dual-level reporting lets you assess network behavior quickly and dive deeper whenever necessary.


## Broad Platform Support

uBO Scope is designed to work seamlessly across all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. It leverages the browser's native `webRequest` API, providing consistent functionality across platforms.


## Upcoming Features Tailored for Filter List Maintainers

While the current release offers comprehensive monitoring and reporting, future updates will introduce advanced details specifically useful for filter list maintainers, empowering them to refine and improve filtering rules with better insights.

## How These Features Work Together

Imagine navigating to a news website. With uBO Scope active, you instantly see the full spectrum of every third-party connection your browser tries — be it analytics, advertising, content delivery networks, or other services. The extension shows which of these connections were allowed, which were stealthily blocked (so you know stealth blocking is in effect), and which were blocked outright.

This empowers you to detect excessive tracking, verify if your content blockers are truly effective, and avoid relying on misleading block counts.

## Practical Example: Using the Feature Highlights

1. Open uBO Scope popup by clicking its toolbar icon.
2. Observe the badge number indicating how many distinct third-party domains connected in the current tab.
3. Review the detailed lists of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
4. Identify unexpected or suspicious third parties to take further privacy measures.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Pay close attention to the badge count: a lower count generally means fewer third-party connections and better privacy.
- Understand that not all third-party connections are harmful; some are essential CDNs or trusted services.
- Use the detailed domain lists to verify the effectiveness of your content blockers.
- Look for stealth-blocked entries to ensure stealth blocking is working as expected.


---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you do not see expected data:
- Ensure uBO Scope has proper permissions and is installed correctly (see Installation guides).
- Confirm your browser supports the `webRequest` API.
- Be aware that some network connections made outside the browser's observable scope cannot be reported.
