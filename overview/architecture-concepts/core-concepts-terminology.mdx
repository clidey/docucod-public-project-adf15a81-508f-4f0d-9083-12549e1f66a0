# Key Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the core concepts and terminology used in uBO Scope is essential for effectively interpreting the extension’s data and maximizing your browser privacy insight. This page explains the fundamental terms you will encounter both in the user interface and within the extension’s documentation, along with how these relate to the data collected and presented.

---

## What Are Third-Party Domains?

A **third-party domain** refers to any remote server address that is **different** from the main site domain you are currently visiting in your browser tab. 

### Why It Matters
Third-party domains represent external services, ads, analytics, and content delivery networks that your browser connects to alongside the main website. uBO Scope aggregates these third-party connections to help you see how many and which external domains are contacted.

### Real User Scenario
- When visiting `example.com`, connections to `cdn.examplecdn.com` are first-party if owned by example.com.
- Connections to `ads.network.com` are **third-party** because they belong to a separate domain.

This distinction helps you identify potential privacy risk or unwanted tracking domains.

---

## Remote Server Connection

uBO Scope tracks every attempted or successful **remote server connection** made by webpages through your browser.

### Connection Outcome Categories
Each network request outcome is categorized as one of the following:

- **Allowed**: The network request was successfully made and the resource was retrieved.
- **Blocked**: The network request failed to complete or was expressly blocked (e.g., by the browser or content blockers).
- **Stealth**: A stealthy blocking event where requests may have been redirected or filtered in a way that is not overtly observable by the webpage.

### Importance of Outcomes
This outcome categorization reflects what truly happens at the network level, beyond what a content blocker claims, empowering you with factual connection data.

---

## Session Data

### What Is a Session?
A **session** corresponds to the current browsing context tracked by uBO Scope. It maps individual browser tab IDs to their network connection details.

### Data Tracked Per Tab
For each tab, uBO Scope records:

- The **main domain and hostname** of the page being browsed.
- The sets of third-party domains and hostnames grouped by connection outcomes: allowed, blocked, and stealth.

### Why Session Data Matters
Maintaining session data allows uBO Scope to provide per-tab summaries and accurate badge counts that update as you browse.

## Understanding Network Request Outcomes

uBO Scope uses browser APIs to listen and log network request events and determine their outcome status:

| Outcome  | Meaning                                              | What uBO Scope Does                           |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Allowed  | Request completed successfully                        | Counts domain to “allowed” set               |
| Blocked  | Request was denied or errored                         | Counts domain to “blocked” set               |
| Stealth  | Request was redirected or unpredictably handled      | Counts domain to “stealth” set                |

These distinctions are made regardless of any content blockers installed, reflecting *actual* network activity.

---

## Popup Badge Count Explained

The uBO Scope toolbar icon badge reflects **the number of distinct third-party remote domains for which connections were allowed** in the active tab.

### Key Points
- A **lower badge count** represents fewer third-party connections and typically better privacy.
- Only connections from **allowed** requests increment the badge count.
- The badge updates dynamically as network requests resolve.

### User Impact
The badge offers a quick glance at how many distinct external domains your current page is contacting, empowering you to spot unexpectedly high third-party activity.

## Lexicon: Terms You Will See

| Term in UI / Documentation | Meaning                                                                              |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Domain**                 | The registered internet domain name (e.g., `example.com`)                            |
| **Hostname**               | A full domain name that may include subdomains (e.g., `images.example.com`)          |
| **Allowed**                | Requests that successfully connected to servers                                   |
| **Blocked**                | Requests that failed due to blocking or errors                                      |
| **Stealth**                | Requests which were silently redirected or filtered, obfuscated from pages         |
| **Session**                | Current browsing context tracking per-tab network request details                   |
| **Popup Badge**            | Toolbar icon indicator showing count of distinct allowed third-party domains        |
| **Third-Party**            | Domains different from the main site domain being visited                           |

## How These Concepts Fit Together

When you load a webpage, uBO Scope kicks in behind the scenes to:

1. Identify the main domain and hostname of the active tab.
2. Monitor all network requests initiated by the page.
3. Categorize each remote server connection based on outcome: allowed, blocked, or stealth.
4. Aggregate counts and domain lists per category.
5. Update the popup display and badge count to give you an accurate snapshot of the tab's connections.

This flow reveals surface and hidden connections that impact your privacy and browsing experience.

---

## Practical Tips

- Use the popup panel to explore which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- Pay attention to high counts in the stealth or allowed categories as they may indicate hidden network activity.
- A zero or very low badge count usually means minimal third-party connections.
- Remember that not all third-party connections are malicious — many are needed for legitimate content delivery.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Misinterpreting the badge count as a block count rather than allowed third-party domain count.
- Ignoring stealth connections, which can be a sign of advanced content blocking or circumvented filters.
- Assuming all third parties are harmful without investigating their purpose.

Understanding the terms and their relationships avoids confusion about what uBO Scope reveals.

## Next Steps

Once you grasp these key concepts and terminology, consider exploring the following guides to deepen your mastery:

- [Understanding and Using the Toolbar Badge Count](../core-workflows/understanding-the-badge-count)
- [Interpreting Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth Outcomes](../advanced-usage-patterns/interpreting-network-outcomes)
- [Monitoring Domain Connections in Real Time](../core-workflows/monitor-domain-connections)

These will help contextualize the data uBO Scope surfaces and inform your decisions about privacy and content blocking.

## Additional Resources

- The [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) is used by uBO Scope to accurately parse domains and hostnames.
- The extension’s background logic manages session data and categorization ([background.js source](../js/background.js)).
- The popup UI displays domain outcomes and badge counts ([popup.js source](../js/popup.js)).

These technical underpinnings translate raw connection data into the meaningful terminology described here.
