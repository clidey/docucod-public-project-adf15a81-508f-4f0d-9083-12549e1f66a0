# Key Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the language and terms used in uBO Scope empowers you to interpret its data correctly and make informed privacy decisions. This page unpacks the core concepts and essential terminology you'll encounter throughout your use of the extension. By mastering these, you unlock clarity on what the extension reveals about your browser's network connections and how to read its badge counts and categories.

## What is a '3rd-party Remote Server'?

At the heart of uBO Scope's monitoring is the distinction between first-party and third-party remote servers. A **3rd-party remote server** is any domain that your browser contacts which is different from the domain of the site you are currently visiting (the first-party).

For example, if you visit `example.com` and your browser connects to `cdn.example.net` or `tracker.analytics.com`, those are considered 3rd-party servers because their domains differ from the current site's domain.

This concept matters because tracking and privacy concerns often stem from 3rd-party connections out of your direct control.

## Definitions of Key Outcome Categories

uBO Scope classifies each network request into an **outcome category** based on whether the browser allowed or blocked the connection, and whether blocking was done stealthily.

- **Allowed (Not Blocked)**
  - These are network requests successfully completed without interference.
  - They represent the resources your browser actually fetched from remote servers.
  - The badge count primarily reflects the number of distinct 3rd-party domains here.

- **Blocked**
  - These are requests actively blocked, typically by content blockers like uBlock Origin.
  - Blocking here is explicit and evident — the network request did not complete.

- **Stealth-Blocked**
  - A subtle form of blocking where the network request is redirected or modified to evade detection.
  - The user or webpage cannot easily observe that blocking took place.
  - Helps maintain webpage functionality while limiting certain connections.

Understanding how these categories relate lets you interpret domain counts and logs in uBO Scope meaningfully.

## How uBO Scope Interprets Network Data

The extension listens to your browser's network request events via the `webRequest` API, tracking what happens to each request initiated by webpages:

- **Success events** reflect requests completed and resources fetched.
- **Redirect events** (mapped as stealth blocks) indicate requests covertly redirected, potentially avoiding explicit blocking conclusions.
- **Error events** indicate failed requests, which uBO Scope treats as blocked.

Each request is analyzed to record:

- The exact domain contacted
- The outcome category (allowed, stealth blocked, blocked)

This data is aggregated per browser tab, giving you a domain-centric view of your browsing connections.

## What Do Badge Counts Mean?

The badge on uBO Scope's toolbar icon shows the number of distinct 3rd-party remote servers contacted **and allowed** within the active tab.

**Important:**

- This number reflects the count of unique third-party domains your browser successfully connected to.
- A lower count is better, indicating fewer external third-party connections.
- It does *not* represent how many requests were blocked.

This distinction debunks common misconceptions that higher block counts equate to better blocking. Instead, focus on the unique allowed third-party count to assess privacy impact.

## Common Related Terms

- **Hostname:** The full network address portion of a URL, for example, `sub.domain.com`.
- **Domain:** The registered domain name derived using the Public Suffix List, e.g., `domain.com`.
- **Public Suffix List (PSL):** A standardized list used by uBO Scope to identify registrable domains versus subdomains, ensuring correct domain parsing.
- **Network Request Event:** Notifications from the browser when network requests start, redirect, fail, or complete.

## Real-World Example Walkthrough

Imagine visiting `news.website` in your browser:

1. Your browser starts loading the main page hosted at `news.website`.
2. The extension records this main frame's hostname and domain.
3. As the page loads, your browser attempts to fetch images, scripts, and ads from multiple third-party domains such as `cdn.assets.com`, `analytics.tracker.org`, and `ads.network.net`.
4. uBO Scope silently listens to all these requests and categorizes each:
   - A script from `cdn.assets.com` loads successfully → classified as **allowed**.
   - A tracking pixel from `analytics.tracker.org` is blocked by your content blocker → classified as **blocked**.
   - An ad request is redirected stealthily to a dummy server → classified as **stealth-blocked**.
5. In the popup, these domains are grouped accordingly, and the badge displays how many unique 3rd-party domains were allowed.

This flow gives you a precise snapshot of which third parties are actually having network access.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use the badge count as your primary indicator of privacy exposure per tab.
- Check the popup to see detailed domains per outcome category.
- Remember stealth block happens quietly; absence of a blocked count there doesn't mean blocking wasn't effective.
- Use this terminology knowledge when reading other guides or troubleshooting network privacy.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

**Q: Why doesn't the badge count reflect all blocked requests?**

The badge count is specifically the number of _allowed_ distinct 3rd-party domains, as those indicate potential privacy exposure. Blocked or stealth-blocked domains are reported separately in the popup.

**Q: What if a domain appears in allowed and blocked categories?**

Each network request outcome is tracked individually. A domain can appear in multiple categories if some requests succeeded and others were blocked or stealth-blocked.

**Q: Why is understanding the Public Suffix List important?**

Because domain parsing anchors on the PSL, knowing this ensures you trust that subdomains (e.g., `ads.example.co.uk`) are counted properly under their registered domain (`example.co.uk`).
