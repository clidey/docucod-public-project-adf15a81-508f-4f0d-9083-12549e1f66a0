# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the core concepts and terminology of uBO Scope is essential for interpreting what you see in the extension's badge and popup interface. This page clarifies key terms such as 'allowed', 'blocked', 'stealth', 'third-party remote server', and the 'webRequest API'. With precise definitions and context, you can confidently analyze the network connection metrics reported by uBO Scope and make informed decisions based on them.

## Understanding the Key Outcomes: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth

uBO Scope categorizes the network requests it observes into three primary states. These outcomes provide insight into what resources a webpage is loading, which connections were successfully made, which were blocked, and how stealthy blocking influences network behavior.

- **Allowed (Not Blocked)**: These are network connections that your browser made successfully without interference. In uBO Scope, "allowed" means the resource was fetched or the connection was established to the remote server. This indicates third-party servers actively supplying content or services.

- **Blocked**: These are network requests that were prevented from completing, typically by content blocking measures such as uBlock Origin or other browser-integrated content blockers. Blocked connections indicate resources or requests that did not reach the remote server or were rejected.

- **Stealth (Stealth-Blocked)**: This is a special category where the content blocker has silently blocked a request in a way that minimizes detection by websites. Instead of overtly cancelling the connection, stealth blocking allows the page to behave as if the connection succeeded but effectively suppresses the loading of unwanted content. This approach prevents sites from detecting that blocking is in place and reduces issues like webpage breakage.

<Info>
The notion of "stealth blocking" is crucial to debunking common misconceptions about block counts on other blockers or test pages. uBO Scope distinctly reports stealth-blocked connections to help you understand when requests were quietly suppressed.

## What Is a "Third-Party Remote Server"?

A third-party remote server, in the context of uBO Scope, is any server contacted by a webpage that is not the same as the site's main domain you are visiting. These servers host content, ads, trackers, CDNs, or other resources essential or irrelevant to the webpage's functioning.

- The **main domain** is the domain of the website you are visiting directly (the top-level site in your address bar).
- A **third-party server** is any other domain contacted as part of that page loading process.

<u>For example:</u> When browsing `example.com`, requests to `cdn.example.com` are generally same-party (subdomain of the same domain), whereas requests to `analytics.tracker.com` are third-party.

### Domain and Hostname Resolution

To accurately group requests, uBO Scope uses a public suffix list to determine the "effective site domain" of a hostname. It uses this to identify if a request is first-party or third-party.

This disambiguation allows the extension to count distinct third-party domains rather than just hostnames, providing a clearer picture of connections.

## The Role of the `webRequest` API

uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API to observe and report network requests:

- The `webRequest` API allows uBO Scope to listen to network request events—including redirects, errors, and successful responses.
- It captures all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and WSS requests originating from tabs you browse.
- By leveraging this API, the extension records outcomes of network requests independent of content blockers or DNS filters, giving an accurate overview of network activity.

<Note>
These capabilities depend on browser support for the `webRequest` API and permissions granted when installing uBO Scope. Some network requests outside this API's scope may not be reported.
</Note>

## Interpreting Metrics in the Extension Badge and Popup

uBO Scope displays data in two main user interfaces: the toolbar badge and the popup window, each emphasizing distinct but complementary information.

- **Toolbar Badge**: Shows the count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted (allowed outcomes). A lower count indicates fewer third-party connections, often translating to greater privacy or less tracking.

- **Popup Window**: Provides a detailed breakdown of connections by category:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Lists third-party domains that the browser successfully connected to.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Shows domains where stealth blocking silently prevented requests.
  - **Blocked**: Displays domains where requests were overtly blocked.

This comprehensive categorization helps you:

- Quickly identify which third parties are active on the current page.
- Recognize stealth-blocking in effect, explaining why some requests might seem to succeed but are suppressed.
- Compare blocking states for an informed understanding of traffic and content blocker effectiveness.

## Practical Example: How uBO Scope Tracks a Tab’s Network Requests

When you open a webpage, uBO Scope’s background script monitors all network requests made by that tab using the `webRequest` API. The requests are sorted into the outcomes described above. The extension maintains an internal data structure per tab that holds:

- The primary domain and hostname of the tab.
- Maps of allowed, stealth, and blocked outcomes, each further subdivided into domains and hostnames.

This data flows to the popup UI upon user interaction, which then renders the categorized domain counts for your review.

---

## Tips for Users

- Pay attention to stealth-blocked domains—they represent silent interference which helps maintain webpage usability while blocking unwanted content.
- The badge count is your quick privacy health indicator: fewer third-party domains generally mean less tracking.
- Check the domains listed under “Not Blocked” to audit which sites your browser communicates with.
- Use this knowledge alongside content blockers to refine your blocking preferences when desired.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Do not infer the quality of a content blocker solely from block counts on other tools or test pages. Stealth blocking can mask blocking activity.
- Avoid reliance on "ad blocker test" sites. Real-world browsing scenarios offer more accurate network insights.
- Remember that some third-party connections are legitimate and necessary, such as CDN domains.

## Related Resources

- **Public Suffix List**: uBO Scope uses the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to determine domain boundaries, an industry-standard resource that defines effective second-level domains.
- **Browser `webRequest` API**: This extension depends on the browser’s network event listener API. For more information, see your browser’s documentation.

## For Developers: Internal Data Structures (Overview)

While this page is user-focused, here is a brief peek at the internal tab data shape uBO Scope keeps for tracking outcomes, useful to understand underlying terms:

```javascript
const TABDETAILS_ENTITY = {
    domain: '',                // Effective primary domain of the tab
    hostname: '',              // Hostname of main frame
    allowed: {
        domains: new Map(),   // Map of allowed domains with counts
        hostnames: new Map()  // Map of allowed hostnames with counts
    },
    stealth: {
        domains: new Map(),   // Map of stealth-blocked domains
        hostnames: new Map()  // Map of stealth-blocked hostnames
    },
    blocked: {
        domains: new Map(),   // Map of blocked domains
        hostnames: new Map()  // Map of blocked hostnames
    },
};
```

This structure is populated dynamically as network events occur, with requests classified based on their network event outcome.

---

## Troubleshooting Terminology Confusion

If the terms here do not seem to align with what you see:

- Verify your browser supports the `webRequest` API.
- Confirm uBO Scope's permissions are correctly enabled.
- Remember the extension only reports network requests visible to the API.
- Some connections might be network errors or redirects; these have specific outcomes.

Understanding these concepts ensures accurate interpretation of your browsing session’s connections.
