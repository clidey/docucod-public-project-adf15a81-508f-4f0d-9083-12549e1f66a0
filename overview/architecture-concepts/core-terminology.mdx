# Core Concepts and Terminology

Understanding the key concepts behind uBO Scope is crucial to unlocking its full potential in monitoring your browser's network activity. This page defines essential terminology such as "third-party remote server," "allowed," "blocked," and "stealth" connections, explains how domain classification is performed, and clarifies the significance of the toolbar badge count.

## What Is a Third-Party Remote Server?

When you visit a website, your browser may establish connections not only with the site's own servers but also with external servers owned by other organizations. These external servers are called **third-party remote servers**. They typically support services such as advertising, analytics, content delivery networks (CDNs), or social media widgets.

uBO Scope specifically tracks these third-party servers your browser tries to communicate with. Identifying them provides transparency about the external connections that could impact your privacy.

### Key Points:
- A **third-party remote server** is any server your browser connects to **that is different from the website's main domain** you are visiting.
- Understanding these servers helps reveal hidden or background requests your browser makes.

---

## Classification of Network Requests

uBO Scope categorizes network requests based on their outcome into three groups:

### 1. Allowed (Not Blocked)
These are third-party connections that your browser successfully established. Resources from these servers were fetched without interference.

**Benefit:** Knowing allowed connections helps you understand which external servers are actively involved in loading the webpage.

### 2. Blocked
Blocked connections are third-party requests that were prevented from completing. These may be blocked by your content-blocker extension, by DNS filtering, or errors preventing the connection.

**Benefit:** Seeing blocked servers confirms that your privacy protections are actively preventing connections where needed.

### 3. Stealth (Stealth Blocked)
Stealth connections represent requests that get redirected (e.g., via HTTP redirects) or cloaked in such a way that they don't appear as normal allowed or blocked connections. This category highlights more subtle or indirect network activity.

**Benefit:** Helps uncover hidden behaviors such as stealthy redirects or evasive tracking attempts.

## Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count

The number displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar badge indicates the **number of distinct third-party remote servers with allowed (successful) connections on the current webpage/tab**.

### Important to Know:
- This count does **not** represent the number of blocked requests or ad-blocker activations.
- A **lower count is better**, meaning fewer third-party servers fetched resources.
- The badge provides a precise, real-time insight into your exposure surface related to third-party connections.

### Common Misconceptions:
- The badge count is **not** a block count.
- High block counts don't necessarily mean better privacy.
- This metric focuses on **successful third-party connections**, which reflect real external dependencies.

## Domain Classification with Public Suffix List

To accurately group requests by domain, uBO Scope uses the **Public Suffix List (PSL)**, a widely accepted and maintained list of domain suffix rules maintained at [publicsuffix.org](https://publicsuffix.org/).

### Why is this important?
- It helps determine the "registrable domain" for any hostname — the domain at which users can register a domain name.
- For example, `ads.example.co.uk` and `analytics.example.co.uk` both group under `example.co.uk` as their registrable domain.

### How uBO Scope applies this:
- When recording network requests, hostnames are parsed to extract their effective top-level domain plus one level (eTLD+1), representing the actual domain considered for classification.
- This prevents skewing of counts due to subdomains and ensures consistent grouping.

---

## Practical Example

Imagine you visit `example.com`. Your browser starts resource requests, and uBO Scope tracks the following:

| Connection Outcome | Example Hostname                 | Domain           | Status       |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Allowed            | `cdn.example.com`               | `example.com`    | Visible      |
| Allowed            | `ads.adnetwork.com`             | `adnetwork.com`  | Third-party  |
| Blocked            | `trackers.badtracker.net`       | `badtracker.net` | Blocked      |
| Stealth            | Redirected from `redir.tracker.com` to `trackers.badtracker.net` | `badtracker.net` | Stealth Blocked |

The popup UI will show these hosts grouped accordingly, and the badge will increase to reflect the distinct allowed third-party domains encountered.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Focus on the badge count to gauge privacy exposure**, not on block counts or test-page behaviors.
- Check the **'allowed' section** in the popup to identify which third-party domains your browser is actively connecting to.
- Review the **'blocked' and 'stealth' sections** for insight into defenses triggered.
- Remember that some third parties, such as CDNs and essential services, are often legitimate and low risk.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting and FAQs">
<Accordion title="Why doesn’t the badge show blocked domains?">
The toolbar badge specifically counts **allowed distinct third-party domains**. Blocked or stealth domains do not increase this count but are shown in the popup UI for transparency.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does uBO Scope determine the main domain vs third party?">
uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List to extract the effective domain name (eTLD+1) from each hostname. If a connection's domain differs from the main page's domain, it is considered third party.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some requests appear under 'stealth'?">
Stealth connections are typically requests that were redirected or involved indirect behaviors, which can bypass simple allowed/blocked classification. These are flagged to reveal such subtleties.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if my browser doesn’t support the extension fully?">
uBO Scope depends on the browser's `webRequest` API for network monitoring. Browsers or versions that limit this functionality may not show complete results.
