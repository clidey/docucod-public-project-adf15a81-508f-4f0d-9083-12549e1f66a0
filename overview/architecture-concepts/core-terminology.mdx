# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the core terminology of uBO Scope is essential for accurately interpreting the data it provides and making informed decisions about your browsing privacy. This page defines critical terms such as 'third-party domain', 'blocked request', 'stealth blocking', and 'badge count', explaining how uBO Scope detects and reports these events to reveal the true nature of web connections.

---

## Why These Concepts Matter

When you visit a website, multiple remote servers may be contacted to load content, run scripts, or deliver ads. Not all connections are harmful or privacy-invasive, but distinguishing which are allowed, blocked, or stealthily blocked is crucial. uBO Scope brings transparency by categorizing these connections, helping you know exactly what happens behind the scenes.

With clear terminology, you can:

- Gain precise insight into third-party network activity.
- Debunk common myths about content blocker effectiveness.
- Use badge counts and connection details to evaluate your privacy posture realistically.

## Key Terms Defined

### Third-Party Domain
A *third-party domain* is any domain accessed by the browser that differs from the domain of the main site you are visiting. If you are on `example.com`, a request to `cdn.example.com` is first-party (as it's a subdomain) but a request to `adtracker.net` is third-party.

uBO Scope identifies third-party domains by:

- Parsing the hostname of each network request.
- Using the Public Suffix List (PSL) to extract the effective domain.
- Comparing it against the top-level site domain.

This distinction helps users focus on external connections, which often carry privacy risks.

### Blocked Request
A *blocked request* is a network request initiated by the browsing context that was prevented from reaching its remote server, typically by content blocking tools or network-level filters.

In uBO Scope, blocked requests are tracked by listening for errors reported via the browser's `webRequest` API, marking such requests as failed and categorizing their domains accordingly to show what would otherwise load.

### Stealth Blocking
*Stealth blocking* refers to a subtle method of content blocking employed by some blockers to hide their interference from websites. Instead of failing a request outright, the blocker allows certain network requests to proceed in a way that masks blocking activity to avoid breaking webpages or being detected.

uBO Scope detects stealth blocking by noticing requests that resulted in redirects or other anomalous outcomes, labeling those connections separately to clarify what is truly blocked versus what is stealthily handled.

### Badge Count
The *badge count* is the number displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon for each browser tab. It represents the **number of distinct third-party domains** for which network connections have been *allowed* (i.e., successful and not blocked).

Key points about badge counts:

- The badge count is a count of unique distinct third-party domains, not individual requests.
- A *lower* badge count indicates fewer third-party connections—generally better for privacy.
- Badge counts exclude blocked domains and highlight only those connections that actually occurred.

Understanding badge counts lets users gauge the real exposure to third-party servers per tab, rather than trusting misleading block counts from content blockers.

## How uBO Scope Detects and Classifies Connections

uBO Scope operates by hooking into the browser's `webRequest` API, tracking network events as they occur per tab:

- **Request Parsing:** Each request is parsed to identify its URL, hostname, and effective domain.
- **Outcome Determination:** Based on the browser's signals, requests are categorized as:
  - **Allowed (success):** Network requests that completed successfully.
  - **Blocked (error):** Requests that failed due to blocking or errors.
  - **Stealth (redirect):** Requests that redirected in a manner indicative of stealth blocking.

These outcomes are aggregated per tab and domain level, enabling uBO Scope to maintain records of which third-party domains are actively connected, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.

## Common Misconceptions Clarified

<u>Myth:</u> *Higher block counts mean a better ad blocker.*

<u>Reality:</u> A block count does not equate to better privacy. It is the actual number of **allowed third-party domains** that matter. More blocks may correlate with a greater number of allowed connections, reducing efficacy.

<u>Myth:</u> *Ad blocker test pages reliably show blocking effectiveness.*

<u>Reality:</u> Such test pages use unrealistic network calls and cannot detect stealth blocking. They provide misleading conclusions about blocker performance.

uBO Scope helps users and filter list maintainers see beyond these myths by offering transparent, accurate data.

## Practical Impact for Users

By mastering these concepts, you can:

- Accurately interpret uBO Scope's popup panels showing allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.
- Use badge counts as a privacy metric for each tab.
- Identify unwanted or suspicious third-party connections for informed filtering.
- Understand real privacy exposure instead of relying on external, unreliable blocker claims.

---

## Example Scenario

Imagine browsing `news.example.com`:

- uBO Scope shows a badge count of `3`.
- The popup lists allowed domains like `cdn.example.com`, `analytics.tracker.net`, and `ads.adnetwork.com`.
- Blocked domains include `malicious.ads.fake`.
- Stealth-blocked domains are identified as `tracker.stealthblock.com`.

This insight helps you realize you are exposed to 3 distinct third-party domains despite blocking some undesirable ones and can guide adjustments to your blocker or filters.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- Always consider badge counts as the primary indicator of your current third-party exposure per tab.
- Check the popup listing to understand what exactly is allowed or blocked.
- Recognize that stealth blocking means some requests may be hidden from conventional tests.
- Use domain names decoded from punycode for clarity when dealing with internationalized domains.

## Troubleshooting Common Understanding Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Confusions">
<Accordion title="Badge Count Shows Zero Even When Content Loads">
This may happen if the tab data is not yet processed or if the page restricts network requests outside of `webRequest` API scope. Reload the page or check your blocker settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Blocked Requests Still Appear as Allowed">
Stealth blocking may cause some requests to appear as allowed but behave differently. Consult the stealth-blocked section for clarity.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Domain Names Are Displayed in ASCII Form (Punycode)"
>
uBO Scope automatically converts punycode to Unicode in the popup panel for readability, but badge counts and internal tracking use canonical domain names.
</Accordion>
