# Key Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the core terminology behind uBO Scope is essential to gain full insight into how it provides transparency into your browser's network activity. This page defines and explains the key concepts such as 'third-party remote server', the `webRequest` API, 'stealth connections', 'badge count', and why these ideas matter in evaluating network traffic and content blockers.

---

## Third-Party Remote Server

A **third-party remote server** is any external server your browser attempts to connect to that is distinct from the main website's domain you are visiting.

- For example, if you visit `example.com`, any connection to domains like `cdn.example.net`, `analytics.tracker.com`, or `ads.adnetwork.org` qualifies as third-party.
- These connections often serve ads, load assets, or track user behavior.

**Why it matters:** The primary purpose of uBO Scope is to reveal all such third-party connection attempts during browsing.

**User Scenario:**
> You're browsing a news site and want to see all external domains your browser contacts. uBO Scope lists them clearly, helping you identify tracking and ad servers.

---

## webRequest API

The `webRequest` API is a browser interface that allows extensions like uBO Scope to monitor, intercept, and observe network requests made by webpages.

- uBO Scope uses this API to capture detailed information about every network request's fate: whether it was allowed, blocked, or redirected.
- This API reports requests regardless of content blockers in place, including DNS-level blocking, as long as the browser supports reporting through `webRequest`.

**User Intent:**
> To understand exactly which connections happen and how content blockers impact your browsing.

**Limitations:**
- Requests made outside the `webRequest` API scope cannot be reported by uBO Scope (for example, some low-level browser components).

---

## Stealth Connections

**Stealth connections** refer to network requests that are redirected or blocked by content blockers in a silent or non-obvious way.

- These connections don't show up normally in standard blockers’ interfaces but are detected by uBO Scope through network events.
- Marked in the UI as "stealth-blocked", they reveal subtle attempts that some blockers prevent without direct user notification.

**Benefit to User:**
> Discover hidden or indirect network activity, helping you understand the true impact of stealth blocking.

---

## Badge Count

The **badge count** is the numeric indicator shown on the browser toolbar icon of uBO Scope.

- It reports **the number of distinct third-party remote servers for which there was a connection request** (successful or attempted).
- A **lower badge count is better**, indicating fewer third-party connections.

**Important nuance:**
- The badge count reflects distinct third-party domains, not cumulative request counts.
- This metric avoids misleading assumptions based on "block counts" that other blockers show.

**Why it matters:**
> It provides a clear, objective way to measure the true external connections made by your browser per tab.

---

## Network Request Outcomes

uBO Scope classifies network requests into three categories to provide clarity on their results:

- **Allowed:** Remote servers your browser connected to successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections prevented or redirected invisibly.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked by content blocking mechanisms.

This classification enables you to evaluate the effectiveness of your content blockers and understand network transparency.

---

## Domain and Hostname

- **Hostname:** The full domain name from a URL, e.g., `ads.example.com`.
- **Domain:** The registered or registrable domain, a higher-level aggregation e.g., `example.com`.

uBO Scope groups requests by domain as well as hostname to provide a summarized view.

## Why These Concepts Matter

Together, these terms frame how uBO Scope reveals the true nature of your browser's network activity:

- Understanding **third-party remote servers** isolates external connections affecting privacy.
- The **webRequest API** is the backbone enabling this extension to intercept request events accurately.
- Recognizing **stealth connections** helps unveil obscure network traffic that conventional blockers might miss.
- The **badge count** offers an intuitive and reliable metric for monitoring distinct external servers.

This clarity empowers users and filter maintainers to make informed decisions about privacy, content-blocking performance, and network transparency.

---

## Practical Example: User Flow with Key Concepts

1. You visit a webpage, `news.site`.
2. The browser initiates multiple network requests.
3. uBO Scope listens via `webRequest` API and captures data about each request's target hostname.
4. Each resulting domain is categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
5. uBO Scope aggregates count of distinct allowed domains and updates the toolbar badge.
6. You open the popup UI to see detailed breakdowns of all domains connected to or blocked.

---

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Interpret the badge count as your immediate privacy indicator.**

- **Don’t equate higher block counts from other blockers with better privacy.** Instead, consider how many third-party remote servers are actually being contacted.

- **Use the distinctions between allowed, stealth, and blocked connections to evaluate your content blocker’s stealthiness and effectiveness.**

- **Remember that some third-party connections are legitimate, such as CDNs delivering site assets.**

- **Combine insights from uBO Scope with other privacy tools to get a fuller picture of your browsing safety.**

## Troubleshooting Common Misunderstandings

<AccordionGroup title="Common Misconceptions About uBO Scope Concepts">
<Accordion title="Why does a higher block count not mean better blocking?">
A higher block count could mean more allowed connections from distinct third parties. uBO Scope tracks distinct third-party domains, not just individual block attempts, offering a more accurate measure.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are all third-party connections bad?">
No. Many third-party servers are legitimate (like content delivery networks). uBO Scope counts them all to provide transparency, but it is up to you to assess risk.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why doesn’t uBO Scope detect all requests?">
uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API; any network requests outside its scope cannot be reported. This is a limitation of browser APIs, not the extension.
