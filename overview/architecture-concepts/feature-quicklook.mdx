# Features at a Glance

Discover the primary capabilities of uBO Scope that empower you to monitor and analyze third-party network connections swiftly and intuitively. This page provides a concise feature overview, guiding you on where and how to see these features in the popup user interface.

---

## Live Per-Tab Badge Reporting

- **What It Does:** On your browser's toolbar, uBO Scope displays a badge count representing the number of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections for the active tab.
- **Why It Matters:** This immediate visual feedback helps you gauge the network footprint of the current webpage at a glance—lower counts generally indicate fewer third-party connections.
- **Where to See It:** Look at the extension icon in your browser’s toolbar. This badge dynamically updates based on the active tab’s network activity.


## Categorized Domain Lists

- **What It Does:** uBO Scope organizes third-party connections into three meaningful categories within the popup UI:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains successfully connected.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were stealthily redirected.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed due to blocking.
- **Why It Matters:** This classification helps you understand the filtering effectiveness and distinguish between allowed, stealthy blocking, and outright blocking.
- **Where to See It:** Inside the popup under separate sections titled “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked.” Each section lists domains and their connection counts.


## Cross-Blocker Compatibility Reporting

- **What It Does:** The extension tracks and reports network requests regardless of which content blocker is active—including those that block at the DNS level or by other techniques.
- **Why It Matters:** You get a comprehensive and unbiased view of actual network connections, unaffected by the type or method of content blocking employed.
- **Where to See It:** Domain lists and badge counts reflect connections even when other blockers affect network requests, enabling you to verify blocker behavior in real time.


## Compatibility with Content-Blocked Tabs

- **What It Does:** uBO Scope accurately reports outcomes on tabs where content is blocked or restricted by other extensions, DNS, or browser-level mechanisms.
- **Why It Matters:** This ensures that the extension provides reliable data for every active tab, letting you confidently assess the reach and impact of your content filters.
- **Where to See It:** The popup UI presents domain statistics consistently, no matter the content blocking setup in the active tab.


## Session History

- **What It Does:** uBO Scope maintains an ongoing record of network request outcomes per tab during your browsing session.
- **Why It Matters:** You can monitor network activity over time, even as you navigate between pages, giving richer context and enabling pattern recognition.
- **Where to See It:** When opening the popup for any active tab, the domain counts and categorized lists reflect cumulative activity recorded during that tab’s current session.

## Navigating the Popup Interface

When you click the uBO Scope extension icon, the popup displays a summary of network activity for the active tab:

- The **top header** shows the hostname and domain of the loaded page, clearly separating the subdomain from the registered domain.
- The **summary section** beneath, labeled "domains connected," presents a total count of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- Below that, individual **sections for each outcome category** present sorted domain lists with badge counts indicating how many times connections were recorded.
- Domains in the **"not blocked"** section are those allowed by filters; **"stealth-blocked"** domains reflect redirections or silent blocking; and **"blocked"** domains show fully blocked requests.
- Each domain entry is displayed using Unicode for clear readability, supporting internationalized domain names.


### Practical Example

Imagine visiting a news website with several embedded resources and trackers:

- uBO Scope's toolbar badge might show a count like "7," indicating seven third-party domains connected.
- Opening the popup, you might see domains such as `cdn.example.net` under **not blocked**, `tracker.blockedsite.com` under **blocked**, and `analytics.stealthytracker.io` under **stealth-blocked**.
- This breakdown allows you to assess which third parties are fully blocked, which evade detection, and which are silently allowed.

## Tips for Success

- **Check the Toolbar Badge Frequently:** Use the badge as a quick privacy health indicator for the current tab.
- **Explore Domain Lists Regularly:** Investigate domains listed, especially under stealth-blocked, to understand potential privacy leaks.
- **Use Alongside Content Blockers:** Compare badge counts with other blockers’ statistics to verify blocking effectiveness honestly.
- **Understand the Limitations:** Some network requests outside the browser’s `webRequest` API scope may not be reported.
