# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the terminology behind uBO Scope is pivotal to effectively harnessing its power to provide clear, meaningful insights into your browser’s network connections. This page serves as a straightforward glossary that not only defines key terms used throughout uBO Scope but also explains their importance in the context of user privacy, content blocking, and filter assessment.

## Allowed Domain

An **allowed domain** refers to a remote server’s domain from which network requests by a webpage have successfully retrieved resources without being blocked. These connections represent those external servers that the browser has been able to communicate with during page load or interaction despite any active content blocking.

- **Why it matters:** Tracking allowed domains helps you understand what third-party servers your web browsing genuinely depends on, giving you a realistic view of your exposure.

- **Example:** When visiting a news website, the primary content domain and CDN domains for images or scripts are part of the allowed domains.

## Stealth-Blocked

**Stealth-blocked** domains are those remote servers whose network requests have been silently intercepted and blocked in a way that leaves the page unaware of the interference. These requests typically do not fire network errors or other signals that a page can detect, making stealth blocking distinct from visible blocking.

- **Why it matters:** This silent form of blocking prevents websites from detecting that requests are blocked, reducing breakage and anti-blocker detection tactics.

- **Example:** A tracking server request that is prevented before it can fully initiate but without generating an error visible to the website’s scripts.

## Blocked Domain

A **blocked domain** is any remote server domain for which network requests were attempted but ultimately blocked, resulting in network errors or failed responses. This blocking is often visible from the standpoint of the page or extension.

- **Why it matters:** Knowing which domains are actively blocked helps you validate your content blocker’s effectiveness and identify potential performance improvements.

- **Example:** An advertising server domain that is prevented from loading by your blocker and produces an error event.

## Third-Party Remote Server

A **third-party remote server** is any external server domain different from the primary website’s domain currently being visited. These are typically servers providing resources, trackers, ads, analytics, or content delivery.

- **Why it matters:** Distinguishing third-party servers from first-party is crucial because third parties often represent privacy risks and potential tracking surfaces.

- **Example:** On a shopping site (first party), requests to a social media analytics domain or an ad network are third-party connections.

## Badge Count

The **badge count** is the number displayed on the extension’s toolbar icon. It represents the number of distinct third-party remote server domains for which a connection was successfully established (allowed domains).

- **Why it matters:** This count provides a quick snapshot of your exposure to third-party connections on the active tab, guiding privacy-conscious users to minimize unwanted connections.

- **Important:** A **lower** badge count indicates fewer third-party connections and generally better privacy. Do **not** confuse the badge count with the number of blocked requests, which can be misleading.

## Domain vs Hostname

- **Hostname:** The full label from a URL, e.g., `images.cdn.example.com`.
- **Domain:** The registered domain recognized by the public suffix list, e.g., `example.com`.

uBO Scope normalizes requests by domain to group and count connections meaningfully.

- **Why it matters:** Grouping by domain rather than hostname prevents inflated connection counts caused by subdomains or CDNs.

## Public Suffix List (PSL)

The **Public Suffix List** is a community-maintained list of domain suffixes under which Internet users can directly register names. uBO Scope uses the PSL to accurately extract the registered domain portion from hostnames.

- **Why it matters:** Correct domain determination is foundational to aggregating requests and calculating counts that reflect real third-party entities.

- **Example:** For `subdomain.example.co.uk`, the PSL identifies `co.uk` as the public suffix, making `example.co.uk` the registered domain.

## Practical Impact of These Concepts

Understanding and differentiating *allowed*, *stealth-blocked*, and *blocked* connections lets you better interpret the extension’s reports. For example, many blockers employ stealth blocking to avoid webpage breakage, so seeing stealth-blocked domains confirms silent blocking occurred.

The badge count highlighting allowed third-party domains is your direct measure of tracking exposure risk and surface area for privacy concerns. Awareness of domain versus hostname and proper domain extraction further enhances the reliability of this measurement.

By mastering these concepts, you gain the ability to confidently assess your privacy setup’s efficacy and make informed decisions about filters and blockers.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Pay attention to the **badge count** logged by uBO Scope as your key indicator of third-party exposure.
- Use the categorization of domains (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked) to understand the mode of operation of your content blocker.
- Remember that not all third-party connections are bad; many relate to necessary services like CDNs.
- Be cautious about over-interpreting block counts; a higher block count does not guarantee better blocking effectiveness.
- Keep your extension updated to ensure the public suffix list used is current for the most accurate domain extraction.
