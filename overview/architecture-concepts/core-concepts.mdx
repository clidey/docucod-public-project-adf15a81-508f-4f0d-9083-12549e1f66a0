# Core Concepts & Terminology

## Understanding uBO Scope's Key Terms and Metrics

When using uBO Scope, grasping the core terminology and measurement concepts is vital to unlocking its full potential. This page walks you through the essential terms such as third-party remote servers, the meaning behind allowed, stealth, and blocked connection outcomes, and the significance of the toolbar badge count. Beyond definitions, it emphasizes why not all third-party connections are equally concerning and highlights how uBO Scope helps dispel common misconceptions about content blocking effectiveness.

## What Are Third-Party Remote Servers?

Think of third-party remote servers as the external internet domains a webpage tries to connect to, aside from the site you’re visiting. For example, when you visit a news website, it may load images, videos, or ads from different companies’ servers — these are third-party connections.

- **Why care?** These servers can track your activity, inject content, or deliver unwanted ads.
- **How uBO Scope helps:** It identifies all attempts made by the webpage to connect with these remote servers, no matter if the requests were blocked or allowed.

<u>Example:</u>

If you visit `example.com`, and the page loads scripts from `cdn.examplecdn.com` and images from `images.anothersite.net`, uBO Scope categorizes these external servers as third-party.

---

## Badge Count: What Does It Represent?

The toolbar badge count in uBO Scope shows the number of **distinct third-party domains from which network requests were successfully allowed.**

- **Lower count is better:** A lower number means fewer third-party servers could connect, indicating better privacy.
- **Not a block count:** Unlike some blockers that show how many requests they blocked, this badge reflects how many distinct third-party servers you actually connected to.

<u>Value of the badge:</u>

It provides a transparent and direct insight into your browsing session’s network footprint — making it easier to judge how much external exposure a webpage generates.

---

## Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked Requests

uBO Scope classifies network requests into three clear result categories, each indicating how the browser handled the connection:

- **Allowed:** These are third-party connections that successfully occurred and were not blocked by any filter or blocker. They represent active external servers contacted during browsing.

- **Stealth-blocked:** These requests were blocked in a subtle or hidden way, often through mechanisms like redirects or network-level filtering that prevent the request from reaching the server without alerting the webpage. It signals the “stealthiness” of content blocking.

- **Blocked:** These requests were explicitly denied or failed due to content blocking rules or security errors, making the connection unsuccessful.

<u>Real-World Analogy:</u> Imagine outgoing mail from your house:

- Allowed mail is delivered openly.
- Stealth-blocked mail is quietly intercepted without the sender knowing.
- Blocked mail is returned unopened.

---

## Significance of the Toolbar Badge

The toolbar badge is your quick-read indicator of browsing privacy related to third-party connections:

- It shows how many **unique** third-party domains your current tab communicated with.
- Helps you gauge connection breadth at a glance.
- Acts as a real-time validation tool to verify how effective your content blocking or privacy settings are.

Using the badge, you can quickly tell if a page is contacting too many remote servers, potentially signalling tracking or aggressive third-party content.

---

## Why Not All Third Parties Are Equal

Not every third-party connection is harmful or unwanted. Many legitimate sites rely on trusted third-party servers for essential functionality:

- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) hosting scripts or images.
- Analytics providers helping sites improve performance.
- Cloud services powering search or maps.

<u>How to interpret this?</u>

uBO Scope empowers you to see the raw number and identity of third-party servers. It lets you discern which connections are harmless and which may be privacy risks, rather than assuming all third parties should be blocked outright.

---

## Myths uBO Scope Helps Debunk

### Myth 1: “Higher Block Count Means Better Blocking”

Often, the extension showing the highest number of blocked requests is considered superior. However, a high block count can paradoxically correlate with more allowed third-party connections, due to how different blockers work.

**uBO Scope reveals this by showing the actual distinct third-party servers allowed, which is the more meaningful privacy metric.**

### Myth 2: “Ad Blocker Test Pages Reflect Real-World Effectiveness”

Fake or test pages designed to trigger ads and trackers don’t represent real browsing behavior and fail to capture stealth blocking techniques.

**uBO Scope shows live network connections behind real webpages, giving you a true picture of network exposure and blocking effectiveness.**

## Practical Tips for Using uBO Scope Terms

- Use the badge count to monitor your browsing exposure: lower is a signal of greater privacy.
- Use the popup to inspect allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains in detail.
- Recognize that some third parties are necessary for site functionality — use uBO Scope to distinguish these.
- Employ uBO Scope insights in conjunction with content blockers to make informed filtering decisions.

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions About Core Concepts">
<Accordion title="What is the difference between domains and hostnames in uBO Scope?">
Domains are the registered root domains (like example.com), while hostnames are the full specific labels (like ads.example.com). uBO Scope aggregates and counts third-party connections by domain for simplicity and better insight.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why does the badge only count allowed connections and not blocked ones?">
Because allowed connections represent actual network exposure to third parties. Blocked requests do not result in data exchange. The badge focuses on measuring what the browser truly connected to.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can stealth-blocked requests help with privacy analysis?">
Stealth-blocked connections indicate requests that were quietly prevented, often making blocking less detectable by sites or scripts. This helps reveal subtle blocking effectiveness beyond obvious blocks.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Should I try to block all third-party connections?">
Not necessarily. uBO Scope helps you see all connections so you can make informed judgments. Some third parties provide essential services without compromising privacy.
