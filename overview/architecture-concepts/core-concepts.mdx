# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding uBO Scope begins with grasping the essential terms it uses to report network connection outcomes and display data in its user interface. This page defines these core concepts and clarifies what users see in the UI, how badge counts are computed, and why these measurements are critical to managing online privacy.

---

## Essential Terms

### Remote Server
A **remote server** refers to any external web server that a webpage attempts to connect to during browsing. This includes all third-party domains requested by the site you visit, such as content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics providers, advertisement servers, and other external resources.

### Third-Party Connection
A **third-party connection** happens when a webpage loads resources from a domain that differs from the one displayed in the browser's address bar. For example, if you visit `example.com` and the page loads an image from `cdn.example.net`, that connection is third-party relative to `example.com`.

### Connection Outcome Categories
uBO Scope categorizes all network connections it observes into three outcome types, reflecting their interaction with content blocking layers:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** These are connections successfully made to remote servers. They represent third-party domains from which resources were fetched without interference.

- **Blocked:** These connection attempts were actively blocked by the browser extension or other blocking mechanisms exposed via the browser's `webRequest` API. The request was prevented from completing.

- **Stealth-Blocked:** This unique category identifies connections that were blocked in ways that are typically invisible to the page or other extensions—such as DNS blocking or content blocking performed by means outside the standard browser APIs. They do not appear as blocked requests in typical debugging tools but are detected by uBO Scope through indirect observation of outcomes like redirects or failures.

> This distinction highlights uBO Scope’s ability to reveal blocking behaviors that other measurement tools miss.

## What You See in the UI

The extension's popup panel divides connections into three sections corresponding exactly to the outcome categories:

- **Not Blocked:** Lists all third-party domains from which resources were permitted.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Lists third-party domains with stealth blocking detected.
- **Blocked:** Lists third-party domains with explicitly blocked requests.

Each domain entry shows the count of connection attempts, giving you quantitative insight into how frequently the domain was contacted or blocked during the page load.

Moreover, the toolbar button badge reflects the **number of distinct third-party remote domains allowed** for the current active tab. This count is a critical privacy indicator conveying your exposure to external servers.

---

## Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count

- The badge number indicates how many unique third-party domains were successfully connected to (allowed) while visiting the current page.
- A **lower badge count** generally means fewer third-party connections were made, indicating a smaller privacy footprint.
- The badge **does not count blocked or stealth-blocked domains**, only those from which resources were actually loaded.

### Why the Badge Matters

This count serves as a clear, real-time gauge of your browsing session’s exposure to external domains. Because it counts distinct third parties, it prioritizes **diversity of connections over total requests**, which better reflects privacy risk.

---

## Why These Measurements Matter

Many users and filter list maintainers struggle to evaluate the effectiveness of content blocking tools due to misleading metrics such as block counts or deceptive test pages. uBO Scope provides a **more rigorous and transparent view** by:

- Showing all network connection attempts regardless of blocking mode.
- Separating allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections to paint an accurate picture.
- Counting unique third-party domains to highlight the true extent of external exposure.

This clarity enables informed decision-making about privacy settings, filter lists, and content blockers.

---

## Summary of Data Flow

When you visit a webpage, uBO Scope captures network requests and categorizes each connection outcome by domain. It maintains an internal session mapping of tab IDs to details, tracking:

- Domains and hostnames allowed
- Domains and hostnames blocked
- Domains and hostnames stealth-blocked

This data is then displayed in the popup UI, and the badge count is updated accordingly for the active tab.

---

## Practical Example

Imagine loading a news website that pulls images and scripts from various sources:

- `example-news.com` (main site)
- `cdn.example-news.com` (allowed third-party CDN)
- `adserver.ads.com` (blocked ad server)
- `tracker.analytics.net` (stealth-blocked tracker)

uBO Scope will:
- Show `cdn.example-news.com` under **Not Blocked** with the count of requests.
- Show `adserver.ads.com` under **Blocked**.
- Show `tracker.analytics.net` under **Stealth-Blocked**.
- Set the badge to reflect one allowed third-party domain (the CDN).

This gives you a nuanced understanding of third-party contacts, not just block counts.

---

## Tips for Using uBO Scope Effectively

- Focus on the **badge count** as a primary indicator of your privacy exposure.
- Review the domain lists in each outcome category to audit third-party involvement.
- Use stealth-blocked information to detect hidden blocking that typical tools miss.
- Remember that not all third parties are harmful; some (like CDNs) are necessary.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **No badge or data shown:** Make sure uBO Scope has the necessary permissions to access network requests via manifest settings.
- **Unexpected high badge count:** Investigate the allowed domains list for unexpected third parties; consider tightening your content blocker or filters.
- **Stealth blocking unrecognized:** Some network requests made outside the browser's `webRequest` API scope (e.g., browser extensions, system DNS) may not be detected.
