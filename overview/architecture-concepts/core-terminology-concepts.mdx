# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the language and logic behind uBO Scope is essential for accurately interpreting its data and making informed decisions about your browsing privacy. This page defines key terms and explains how uBO Scope categorizes network requests, counts connections, and presents results to help you grasp what uBO Scope reports and why it matters.

## Understanding Key Terms

### Third-Party Remote Servers

In the context of uBO Scope, a 'third-party remote server' is any remote server contacted by a webpage you visit that is distinct from the website's own domain. For example, if you visit `example.com` and your browser makes a request to `cdn.somesite.net`, that `somesite.net` host is a third-party.

Identifying third-party servers is critical because they represent external entities potentially tracking or serving additional content beyond the first-party site.

### Allowed

'Allowed' requests are those network requests to third-party servers that successfully completed and were not blocked by any content blocker or network filter. These are the actual connections your browser made to fetch resources.

In uBO Scope, each allowed third-party domain is counted and displayed, reflecting your real exposure to external servers.

### Blocked

'Blocked' requests are those that your content blocker or network security measures prevented from completing. These requests were initiated but failed due to blocking rules or errors reported by the browser's webRequest API.

Despite blocking, these requests signify attempted connections and indicate how many third parties tried to load content but were stopped.

### Stealth-Blocked

A unique and important category in uBO Scope, 'Stealth-Blocked' requests represent redirected connections where blocking is done stealthily (often via re-routing requests silently). These requests do not fail outright but are redirect mechanisms to prevent detection and maintain webpage stability.

Stealth blocking is a sophisticated method content blockers use to hide blocked requests from webpages to avoid breakage or advertising anti-blocker detection.

## How uBO Scope Categorizes Requests

uBO Scope listens to browser network events through the `webRequest` API to determine the fate of each network request:

- **Success:** The request completed normally (Allowed).
- **Error:** The request failed or was interrupted (Blocked).
- **Redirect:** The request was silently redirected, often to block or filter content (Stealth-Blocked).

Each categorized request is assigned to the originating browser tab and grouped by domain and hostname to offer a clear, aggregated picture.


## The Badge Counter Logic

The badge count on uBO Scope's toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct third-party remote domains **allowed** to load resources in the active tab's page.

- **Lower counts are better:** Fewer allowed third-party connections mean less exposure and potentially better privacy.
- It counts domains, not individual requests, giving a high-level view of how many external connections your visited webpage involves.

### Why this matters:

A filter or content blocker might block many requests but still allow connections to numerous third-party servers. Such a blocker might report a high blocking count, but your actual privacy exposure is higher because more distinct third-party servers were contacted.

uBO Scope’s focus on distinct allowed domains helps debunk common misconceptions about block counts equating to better blocking.

## Practical Example: Interpreting Request Categories

Suppose you visit a news website, and uBO Scope shows:

- **Allowed:** `analytics.examplecdn.com`, `fonts.googleapis.com`
- **Blocked:** `ads.tracker.net`, `static.adservice.com`
- **Stealth-blocked:** `redirect.ads.doubleclick.net`

This means:

- Your browser successfully connected to two legitimate third-party servers providing fonts and analytics.
- Two other third-party requests were blocked outright.
- One request was stealth-blocked, possibly replaced or redirected to avoid webpage disruptions.

The badge would show `2`, representing the two distinct allowed third-party domains.


## Why These Concepts Empower You

By distinguishing allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked requests, uBO Scope reveals not just the volume of blocking, but the **true network exposure** imposed by webpages. You gain:

- A realistic understanding of how many distinct servers your browser talks to.
- Transparency into the subtle stealth-blocking techniques affecting connections.
- Data to assess network exposure beyond misleading block counts or unreliable ad blocker tests.

Knowing these concepts lets you make confident privacy choices and better comprehend what your content blocker is protecting you from.

## Troubleshooting Common Misunderstandings

<AccordionGroup title="Common Confusions about uBO Scope Concepts">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge sometimes show zero on a site with ads?">
If all third-party connections are stealth-blocked or blocked before the browser reports them, uBO Scope might show zero allowed third-party connections. Some ads can also be loaded from first-party or same-domain sources, so those aren’t counted as third-party.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is a low block count always good?">
A low block count in other blockers can be misleading as they might still let connections to many third-party servers. uBO Scope encourages focusing on allowed distinct third parties, which better represents actual exposure.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does stealth-blocked mean for website functionality?">
Stealth blocking tries to minimize site breakage by redirecting requests silently. It means the request was blocked or altered without causing obvious failure.
