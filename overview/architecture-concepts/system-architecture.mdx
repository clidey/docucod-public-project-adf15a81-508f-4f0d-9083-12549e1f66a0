# How uBO Scope Works (Architecture Overview)

Discover the inner workings of uBO Scope through a clear, high-level architecture overview designed for users who want to understand how this powerful extension tracks and presents network connections in real time. This page focuses specifically on how uBO Scope monitors network requests, processes data behind the scenes, interacts with browser APIs, and displays connection insights in the popup interface.

## Overview: Grasping uBO Scope’s Architecture

At its core, uBO Scope is a browser extension that acts as a vigilant observer of all network connections made by webpages you visit. Its architecture is optimized to collect, analyze, and visualize these connections effectively, providing you with meaningful insight into every third-party server your browser interacts with.

Unlike typical content blockers that focus on blocking unwanted requests, uBO Scope’s unique strength lies in reporting and categorizing **all** network requests — whether allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked — thereby giving you transparency and control over your browsing privacy.

### How It Works From Your Perspective

1. **Real-Time Request Monitoring**: uBO Scope listens to the browser’s network activity using the `webRequest` API, capturing every outgoing request and its outcome.

2. **Background Data Processing**: The extension’s background service worker collects these network events, categorizing them into 'allowed', 'blocked', or 'stealth-blocked' groups, all linked to the relevant browser tab.

3. **Session-Based Aggregation**: Data is aggregated per browser tab, maintaining a clean and organized record of all third-party domains contacted during your browsing session.

4. **Visual Display in Popup UI**: When you open uBO Scope’s popup panel via the toolbar icon, this aggregated data is presented clearly, showing you domains connected and their status with straightforward counts and lists.

5. **Badge Integration**: The toolbar icon dynamically updates to show the count of distinct third-party domains your current tab has connected to. A lower number signals less exposure to external servers, directly reflecting your privacy profile.

## Components and Their Roles

To understand how uBO Scope collaborates with browser APIs and manages data flow, here’s a breakdown of its key building blocks:

- **Browser WebRequest API**: This is the vital interface that feeds uBO Scope real-time information about the fate of each network request (success, error, redirect).

- **Background Service Worker**: The heart of data management. It processes network events, aggregates connection outcomes, maintains session storage, and triggers badge updates.

- **Session Management**: Persistent storage scoped to your browsing session records connection details for each active tab, enabling accurate and tab-specific reports.

- **Popup UI**: The front-end panel powered by `popup.js` that queries the background for session data, then renders a user-friendly summary of connected domains categorized by outcome.

## Network Request Flow Explained

Visualize how a network request transitions through the architecture:

1. A webpage initiates a network request.
2. The browser reports the request outcome via `webRequest` listeners:
   - **Success**: Request completed successfully.
   - **Error**: Request failed or was blocked.
   - **Redirect**: Request redirected to another URL.
3. uBO Scope's background service worker queues these events for batch processing.
4. After a brief debounce (1 second), the queued events are processed together to optimize performance.
5. Connection outcomes are categorized and stored per tab, updating counts for domains and hostnames.
6. Badge count is updated for each tab, reflecting the real-time number of unique allowed third-party domains contacted.
7. When you open the popup, the background delivers the aggregated data, which the popup renders for immediate insight.

## Practical Insights & User Benefits

- **Transparency at Your Fingertips**: By understanding this architecture, you appreciate how uBO Scope continuously gathers and refines connection details, ensuring your popup UI reflects the latest data.

- **Privacy Awareness**: The dynamic badge icon immediately informs you about third-party exposure, enabling real-time privacy assessments.

- **Stealth Blocking Visibility**: The architecture’s capability to report stealth-blocked domains (which many tools miss) stems from the detailed processing in the background service worker.

- **Session-Centric Reporting**: This tab-specific approach allows you to focus on privacy per browsing context, avoiding data pollution from other tabs.

- **Efficiency and Performance**: Batching network events and storing processed session data ensures responsiveness without slowing your browser.

## Tips for Maximizing Value

- **Interpret Badge Counts Correctly**: Remember, the badge shows the count of unique third-party domains successfully connected, not just blocked requests.

- **Use the Popup Panel for Detailed Analysis**: The popup UI shows categorized lists — allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked — helping identify which domains are active and which are mitigated.

- **Understand Third Party Domains**: Domains grouped by the Public Suffix List allow you to detect common content delivery networks and trackers.

- **Know Limitations**: Some network requests made outside the browser’s `webRequest` scope won’t be reported, but this architecture maximizes coverage where allowed.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Asked Questions about uBO Scope Architecture">
<Accordion title="Why doesn’t uBO Scope block any requests?">
This extension focuses strictly on monitoring and reporting connections rather than blocking them. Its architecture is designed to observe outcomes from other blockers or DNS filters.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How is stealth blocking detected?">
Stealth-blocked requests are detected because the background service worker receives `redirect` or `error` events that indicate requests were silently blocked or redirected, even if other blockers don't expose this.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why might some connections not appear in uBO Scope?">
Requests originating outside the browser’s `webRequest` API scope aren’t visible to uBO Scope. This is a limitation of the browser API, not the extension itself.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How is domain categorization handled?">
Domain registration and grouping are managed via the embedded Public Suffix List, ensuring third-party domains are correctly identified and reported.
