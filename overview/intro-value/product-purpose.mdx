# What is uBO Scope?

## Unveiling the True Network Connections of Your Browser

Have you ever wondered exactly which remote servers your browser is connecting to when you visit a website? uBO Scope answers this question for you with absolute clarity. This simple yet powerful browser extension exposes every connection—whether attempted or successful—that your browser makes to remote servers, independent of the content blocker or DNS filtering you're using.

### See Beyond the Badge Count

Most content blockers show a badge indicating blocked items, but this number alone can be misleading. uBO Scope's unique insight is that it reports the number of *distinct* third-party remote servers your browser encounters. This goes beyond counting blocked requests and reveals the actual web of connections made under the hood, giving you a direct lens into what’s truly happening.

### Key Benefits at a Glance

- **Complete Network Transparency:** Track all remote server connections initiated by webpages in real time.
- **Independent of Content Blockers:** Works regardless of which content blocking or DNS filtering method is active.
- **Identify Ambiguous Third Parties:** Helps distinguish between essential third-party services like CDNs and those that may be potentially invasive.
- **Debunks Misleading Metrics:** Clarifies misconceptions around block counts and test sites.
- **Lightweight and Reliable:** Runs efficiently with minimal overhead across major browsers.

### Who Should Care?

If you are a privacy-conscious web user, a technologist, or someone intrigued by how the web communicates behind the scenes, uBO Scope gives you the knowledge required to understand and control your browsing environment.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to reveal all outgoing network connections to third-party remote servers that are initiated by web pages. It provides visibility into network activity regardless of the content blocker you have enabled.

By listening to the browser's network request events, uBO Scope compiles detailed reports on allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections. It then presents these insights in an intuitive popup panel for quick, actionable understanding.

---

## Why Was uBO Scope Created?

This extension addresses a fundamental gap: while content blockers report blocked requests, few tools offer a comprehensive and unbiased view of all remote connections — both permitted and prevented.

Many users rely on badge counts to gauge blocker effectiveness, but a higher badge number can ironically indicate more third-party servers being contacted. uBO Scope cuts through this confusion by explicitly counting distinct remote domains rather than just incidents or blocked events.

Moreover, it exposes the fallacy of relying on so-called "ad blocker test" websites, which generate unrealistic network behavior and fail to accurately represent real-world content blocking.

---

## How uBO Scope Works at a High Level

- **Network Monitoring:** uBO Scope taps into the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor all outgoing HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and WebSocket Secure connections initiated by the currently active tab.
- **Categorization:** Each connection is classified as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked based on the actual network event outcomes.
- **Domain Analysis:** Using a public suffix list, uBO Scope extracts the base domain from every hostname, aggregating counts per domain.
- **User Interface:** Through its popup panel accessed from the browser toolbar, users see a summary of all third-party domains connected to by the tab — divided clearly into categories.

This approach ensures that users gain meaningful information about *who* is connected to and *how* those connections are handled by their browser and content blocking layers.

## Debunking Common Misconceptions

### Myth 1: "More Block Count Means Better Blocking"

A higher block count badge does not necessarily signal stronger privacy protection. In fact, it may mean your browser is contacting more third-party servers to begin with, making blocking more events but allowing more distinct third-party connections.

uBO Scope reframes this narrative by focusing on the *number of distinct third-party servers allowed*, encouraging a clearer, more useful privacy measurement.

### Myth 2: "Ad Blocker Test Websites Provide Reliable Results"

Such test sites make synthetic network requests that deviate from actual web browsing behavior. Also, many content blockers employ stealth techniques that evade detection by these tests.

uBO Scope sidesteps these pitfalls by observing real network traffic directly from the browser’s requests, providing an authentic view.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine browsing your favorite news website. It loads content directly from its own domain and also pulls resources from CDNs and advertising networks.

With uBO Scope, a simple click on its extension icon opens a detailed panel showing:

- How many and which third-party domains were contacted and whether those connections were allowed or blocked.
- Counts of resources fetched per domain, giving insight into the site's real network footprint.

This empowers you to recognize potentially excessive third-party tracking or confirm that the site relies primarily on benign CDNs.

---

## Practical Tips

- **Lower distinct third-party counts typically indicate cleaner browsing sessions.** Watch these numbers over time to spot changes.
- **Use the 'stealth-blocked' category to detect hidden redirects or sophisticated blocking.**
- **Combine uBO Scope with a strong content blocker for maximum privacy control.**

## Next Steps

To start exploring uBO Scope:

1. Install the extension from the official [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Navigate to your desired website.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon in the browser toolbar to open the popup display showing current third-party connection data.
