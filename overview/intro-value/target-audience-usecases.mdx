# Who is uBO Scope For?

uBO Scope is designed with clear user groups in mind, each with a specific motivation to harness its full capabilities. Whether you are a privacy-conscious user seeking transparency, a filter list maintainer working to improve content blocking, or a curious individual aiming for verifiable insight into your browser’s network activity, uBO Scope offers vital tools tailored to your needs.

## Primary Target Audience

### Privacy-Conscious Users
Privacy is paramount in today’s internet landscape. uBO Scope empowers these users by revealing every connection their browser attempts to make, including third-party network activity that might otherwise be hidden. By exposing real connection data, privacy-conscious users gain clarity and assurance about what resources their browser accesses, enabling smarter decisions about content blocking and digital hygiene.

### Filter List Maintainers
Maintaining filter lists requires precise and trustworthy insights into network behavior under restrictive environments. uBO Scope supports filter list maintainers by delivering exhaustive connection reports, including those on locked-down devices where developer tools are inaccessible. This visibility aids maintainers in verifying the effectiveness of filter rules, identifying stealth-blocked connections, and refining filters for optimal user protection.

### Transparency Seekers and Performance Auditors
For users interested in debunking popular myths about ad blockers or understanding real-world connection outcomes, uBO Scope provides robust data. It clarifies misconceptions related to block counts and ad blocker testing sites by showing actual remote server connections, without bias. Transparency seekers use uBO Scope to verify claims about content blockers and to monitor how their browser handles third-party resources.

## Use Cases Highlighted

- **Debunking Ad Blocker Metrics:** uBO Scope demonstrates that a high block count does not necessarily indicate better blocking. Instead, it reveals the number of distinct third-party servers actually contacted, providing users with an accurate privacy metric.

- **Supporting Filter List Maintenance on Locked-Down Devices:** By working independently of developer tools, uBO Scope allows maintainers to audit network connections precisely, even in constrained environments such as locked-down browsers or systems.

- **Gaining Real-World Insight into Resource Connections:** Users can observe allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections, gaining a nuanced understanding of how their browser interacts with remote servers during normal browsing.

## Why These Users Should Care

Choosing uBO Scope means embracing transparency in browser network behavior:

- **Complete Visibility:** See all network requests regardless of filters or DNS-level blocking, granting comprehensive awareness.
- **Myth Busting:** Move beyond superficial metrics and marketing claims relying on block counts or synthetic tests.
- **Actionable Insight:** Use clear, categorized outcomes to refine privacy strategies or validate filter list changes.
- **Cross-Browser Support:** Compatible across major browsers, ensuring wide applicability for different user environments.

## Practical Scenario

Imagine you suspect that a popular content blocker is allowing connections to trackers despite showing a high block count badge. With uBO Scope installed, you open its popup and see the exact number and domains of third-party servers your browser contacted. You notice several unexpected allowed domains, confirming your suspicions.

As a filter list maintainer, you work on refining rules on a locked-down device without access to developer tools. uBO Scope enables you to audit connections live, identify stealth-blocked domains that might affect page behavior, and iteratively improve your list’s effectiveness.

To maximize uBO Scope’s value, consider these next steps:

1. **Install uBO Scope:** Follow the [installation guide](/getting-started/installation-basics/installing-extension).
2. **Explore the Popup Interface:** Learn to interpret allowed, blocked, and stealth blockdomains in the [usage guide](/guides/getting-started/first-connection-overview).
3. **Leverage for Filter List Testing:** If you maintain or test filters, utilize our [advanced maintainers guide](/guides/advanced-usage/filter-list-maintainers-use-case).
4. **Continued Transparency:** Regularly audit your browsing sessions to maintain awareness about your exposure.

<Tip>
For privacy-conscious users, a lower badge count on the extension icon generally means fewer distinct third-party servers were contacted — a good indication of improved privacy.
</Tip>

<Note>
Filter list maintainers will find uBO Scope particularly useful in environments where typical browser developer tools are unavailable or insufficient.
</Note>

<Warning>
Remember that some network requests outside the browser's `webRequest` API scope are not reported. uBO Scope’s data represent all connections seen through the browser’s official APIs.
</Warning>
