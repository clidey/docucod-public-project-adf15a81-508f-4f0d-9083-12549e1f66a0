# Who Should Use It and Why?

Understanding network activity on a per-tab basis can be a game-changer for anyone serious about privacy, content filtering, or web diagnostics. uBO Scope delivers precise visibility into the connections your browser attempts or achieves with remote servers, helping you grasp the true footprint of web pages beyond what traditional content blockers reveal.

## Ideal Users of uBO Scope

### Privacy-Conscious Individuals
If you prioritize limiting your exposure to third-party trackers, advertising networks, or unfamiliar remote servers, uBO Scope is your trusted companion. It offers a clear, tab-specific snapshot of which domains your browser is contacting — distinguishing between connections allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.

### Filter List Maintainers
Managing or fine-tuning filter lists demands deep insight into network requests that a browser sees and processes. uBO Scope provides detailed, domain-level data that enables maintainers to validate the effectiveness of filters and refine blocking strategies by exposing connections regardless of any content blockers in place.

### Analysts and Developers Needing Network Transparency
Whether you are a developer, security analyst, or power user, understanding per-tab network activity aids in diagnosing issues, validating content blocking, or debunking misleading metrics typically presented by ad blocker tests. uBO Scope offers a reliable, unvarnished view of remote server interactions initiated by web pages.

## Use Cases That Highlight Its Value

### Validating Filter List Effectiveness
Filter list maintainers and advanced users can deploy uBO Scope to monitor which remote domains are permitted, blocked, or stealth-blocked on a per-tab level. This targeted insight helps ensure filters are correctly identifying and controlling unwanted content.

### Debunking Misleading Ad Block Metrics
Many users rely on block counts shown in toolbars or on ad blocker test webpages to gauge content blocker performance. uBO Scope clarifies why these metrics can be misleading—revealing the actual number of unique third-party server connections matters more than sheer block tallies.

### Tracking Network Requests During Browsing Session
uBO Scope surfaces all remote server connections attempted by the active tab, including those stealth-blocked or blocked at network or DNS levels beyond standard content blockers. This comprehensive visibility helps users understand the full network behavior of the websites they visit.

### Working Around Limitations in Browser Developer Tools
On devices or platforms where built-in developer tools are restricted, uBO Scope serves as an accessible alternative for monitoring network requests, providing actionable data on the domains involved, their block status, and counts.

## Real-World Example Scenario

Imagine you open a news website in your browser. While the page loads, uBO Scope displays — directly in its popup panel — a categorized view of domains contacted:
- **Not Blocked:** Primary and allowed third-party content servers.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were redirected or hidden from blocking APIs but effectively prevented.
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests were actively stopped.

This granular per-tab visibility empowers you to promptly spot excessive tracking, identify suspicious domains, or verify that your filter lists are working as intended.

## Why Does This Matter?

### Beyond the Toolbar Badge
The numeric badge on your browser extension’s icon counts distinct third-party connections related to the active tab. Lower counts generally mean fewer third-party connections and thus better privacy, but without insight into _which_ domains and their block status, this numeric badge alone is insufficient.

### Accurate Insight Despite Content Blockers
Unlike many other tools that only see allowed or blocked requests, uBO Scope captures network events reported through the browser’s `webRequest` API regardless of your content blocking solution, including those at DNS or network layers invisibly stealth-blocked from the page.

### No Noise from Artificial Test Pages
uBO Scope reveals genuine browsing network behavior, debunking myths caused by synthetic test pages that produce misleading metrics for ad blockers, ensuring your understanding comes from real-world data.

## Best Practices for Users

- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to cross-reference actual network connections.
- For filter list maintainers, regularly validate list updates against uBO Scope’s per-tab domain reports.
- Avoid relying solely on ad blocker test webpages or block counters; examine distinct server connections instead.
- When diagnosing page breakage or unexpected content loading, check the stealth-blocked domains section for subtle network behavior.
