# Why Use uBO Scope?

Understand the unique value uBO Scope offers compared to typical content blockers. This page explains how uBO Scope provides accurate, transparent insight into third-party network activity, corrects common misconceptions about content blocking effectiveness, and works seamlessly alongside any content blocking configuration.

---

## Gain Accurate Visibility Into Third-Party Network Activity

When browsing the web, countless unseen connections are made to third-party servers—CDNs, analytics, advertising networks, and more. Most content blockers focus on stopping unwanted content but do not fully reveal what actually happens on the network level.

**uBO Scope fills this critical gap by reporting every remote server connection your browser attempts or completes, regardless of your content blocking setup.**

- The toolbar badge shows the **number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected to** — a powerful metric indicating your actual exposure.
- The detailed popup breaks down connections by category: **allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked**, giving you granular understanding.

This transparency empowers you to:

- Assess the true scope of third-party reach on any website.
- Detect connections that sneak past or are hidden from your content blocker.
- Make informed decisions about your blocking and privacy strategy.

## Debunk Common Myths About Content Blocking Efficacy

Many users rely on toolbar badge counts or ad blocker test sites to judge if their blocker is working effectively. These approaches can be misleading and cause confusion.

### Myth 1: _'A higher block count means a better content blocker.'_ 

- A high block count may instead indicate your browser is connecting to *more* third-party servers, thus more resources require blocking.
- uBO Scope's focus on distinct third-party connections shows the **real impact** of blocking — fewer successful third-party connections is the true sign of efficacy.

### Myth 2: _'Ad blocker test pages provide reliable results.'_ 

- These test sites generate artificial and unrealistic network requests.
- Extension content blockers often use stealth methods that make blocking undetectable by such sites.
- uBO Scope reports what really happens at the network layer and is unaffected by trickery or fabricated tests.

By exposing these misunderstandings, uBO Scope helps you evaluate content blockers with clear data, not guesswork or misleading benchmarks.

## Transparency Across All Content Blocking Setups

uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor and report network requests irregularly and accurately.

- It works regardless of whether your content blocker is an extension, uses DNS blocking, system-level blocking, or custom setups.
- Even in complex or layered blocking environments, uBO Scope presents a consistent, unbiased view of network activity.

This makes it ideal for:

- Users wanting an independent view of their network connections.
- Filter list maintainers analyzing real-world connection behavior.
- Privacy-conscious users seeking confidence in their blocking setups.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine browsing a news site that loads content from multiple third-party CDNs and ad networks. Your content blocker’s badge shows a high block count, and a popular ad block test claims you have spotty coverage.

Using uBO Scope, you discover:

- Several stealth-blocked connections you were unaware of.
- The number of unique third-party networks is actually very low.
- The suspicious high block badge count was due to multiple blocked requests to the same domains — not more exposed connections.

This clear insight helps you trust your content blocker setup and identify if you've got unnecessary exposures.

## Best Practices When Using uBO Scope

- Use the badge count to monitor third-party exposure, not the block count alone.
- Regularly inspect the detailed popup to understand which domains are connecting or being blocked.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with other tools for a comprehensive privacy and security strategy.
- Avoid relying on ad blocker test sites for evaluating blocker performance — prefer real-world data from uBO Scope.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Misinterpreting a low blocked request count as a sign of weak blocking — the real signal is distinct allowed connections.
- Confusing stealth blocked connections with successful fetches; stealth blocking means the blocker operated without triggering page-detectable changes.
- Expecting uBO Scope to control blocking — it is a reporting tool designed to measure, not block.
