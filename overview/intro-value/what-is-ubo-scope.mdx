# What Is uBO Scope?

## Discover What Your Browser is Connecting To — Instantly

uBO Scope is a lightweight, privacy-focused browser extension designed to reveal every network connection your browser attempts or successfully makes to third-party remote servers. Whether a connection is allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked, uBO Scope brings full visibility to your web browsing activity.

This transparency empowers you to understand exactly which external services your visited webpages are interacting with — a crucial insight for anyone concerned about privacy, tracking, or simply the performance and security of their browsing experience.

## The Essence of uBO Scope

At its core, uBO Scope:

- Monitors and logs all network connections initiated by your browser tab.
- Distinguishes third-party remote servers, counting only unique domains contacted.
- Reports outcomes as **allowed** (successful connections), **stealth-blocked** (blocked without obvious trace), or **blocked** (failed or explicitly denied).
- Displays a badge count on its toolbar icon representing the number of unique third-party domains your current tab has connected to.

By doing so, uBO Scope puts you in control, letting you see the external footprint of your browsing patterns independent of which content blocker or DNS-level blocker you use.


## Why uBO Scope Matters

In an era where invisible trackers and hidden connections silently collect data, having an unobstructed lens on these network activities is vital. Many users are left guessing the reach of third-party requests or basing their trust on block counts alone, which can be misleading.

uBO Scope cuts through this fog by telling you the *real* story — how many, and which, third-party services your browser actually talks to during a browsing session.

## How uBO Scope Works (From a User Perspective)

When you load a webpage, many requests are invisibly made in the background: ads served from ad networks, analytics pings, content delivery networks (CDNs), and more. uBO Scope listens to all these network requests and categorizes them into these groups:

- **Allowed Connections:** Third-party domains that your browser successfully contacted.
- **Stealth-Blocked Connections:** Requests that were silently prevented without typical browser errors.
- **Blocked Connections:** Requests that failed or were explicitly blocked.

These are all surfaced in the extension's popup interface, letting users instantly assess the network’s transparency and understand third-party activity.

For example, if you open a news article, uBO Scope might reveal that beyond the site’s domain, your browser connected to a dozen other domains — ranging from ad servers to CDN providers. This visibility enables you to make informed decisions about which content blockers or privacy tools to deploy.


## What Makes uBO Scope Unique

Unlike typical content blockers that only count how many requests they block or allow, uBO Scope's badge count reflects the **number of distinct third-party domains actually connected to**, not just individual requests. This distinction changes your perspective from raw request count to meaningful domain-level insight.

Key distinctions:

- Provides a reliable metric based on distinct domains, which more accurately reflects tracker exposure.
- Works independently of any content blocker, offering reliable results even when multiple blockers or DNS filters are active.
- Helps debunk myths around content blocker effectiveness based solely on block counts.

---

## Real-World Example: Why This Matters

Consider two content blockers, A and B. Content blocker A reports blocking dozens of requests, while B reports fewer. Without context, you might assume A is *better*. However, uBO Scope reveals that blocker B actually results in fewer third-party domains contacted, meaning it better limits your exposure despite the lower block count.

This level of clarity empowers smarter choices.

## Quick Peek: What You’ll See in the Extension's Popup

- The top-level domain and hostname of the current tab.
- A summary count of third-party domains connected.
- Categorized lists showing which domains were:
  - Allowed (connected successfully)
  - Stealth-blocked (requests blocked silently)
  - Blocked (requests failed or blocked)

This structured, easy-to-read layout provides immediate context about what your browser is doing behind the scenes.

## Summary

uBO Scope is a specialized companion extension to uBlock Origin that

- Reveals *all* network connections attempted or succeeded to third-party domains.
- Provides a meaningful badge count showing unique third-party domains contacted.
- Surfaces connection outcomes to improve transparency and privacy awareness.

It’s an indispensable tool for users serious about understanding and controlling their web privacy footprint.
