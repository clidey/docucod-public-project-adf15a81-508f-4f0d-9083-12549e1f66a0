# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Network Connection Made by Web Pages

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to reveal **all** network connections initiated by web pages—whether they succeed or fail, no matter which content blocking or DNS-level filters you have active. It surfaces detailed, real-time insights about connections to third-party and remote servers so you can truly understand what’s happening behind the scenes as you browse.

- **Complete Visibility:** Shows every attempted or successful connection your browser makes to remote servers.
- **Independent of Blocking Filters:** Reports connections accurately regardless of whether you use content blockers, DNS-level filters, or privacy tools.
- **Informed Badge Count:** Toolbar icon badge reflects the number of _distinct third-party domains_ connected, helping you monitor exposure concisely.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?
- Privacy-conscious users seeking deep insight into web tracking and connections.
- Developers and security professionals auditing third-party resource loading.
- Filter list maintainers optimizing and verifying content blocking rules.

## Introduction to uBO Scope

At its core, uBO Scope acts as a vigilant observer of network activity within your browser. Unlike tools that simply block connections or report counts of blocked requests, uBO Scope digs deeper: it catalogs every remote server your browser tries to reach, regardless of outcome.

It leverages browser `webRequest` APIs to intercept network request events, recording successes, redirects, failures, and stealth blocks (transparent blocking events due to redirection or clever filtering).

What sets uBO Scope apart is its **independence** from any particular content blocker or DNS-based filtering method. It captures the **raw truth** of your browsing connections, circumventing misleading metrics like block counts or fabricated "ad blocker test" results.

### Why This Matters

- A higher block count often misleads users into thinking a content blocker is better, but what matters is **how many distinct third-party domains are actually contacted**. uBO Scope surfaces this.
- Many content blockers claim effectiveness based on contrived test pages; uBO Scope reveals live, real-world network behavior.
- It empowers an evidence-based approach to digital privacy and filter list evaluation.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Comprehensive Connection Auditing:** Records every network request initiated by webpages, grouping them by domain.
- **Connection Outcome Categorization:** Classifies each connection as `allowed`, `blocked`, or `stealth blocked` to give nuanced understanding.
- **Real-Time Tab-Level Analysis:** Provides detailed views per browser tab of network activity to troubleshoot or audit current sessions.
- **Detailed Domain Reporting:** Converts domain names from punycode to Unicode for clarity across internationalized domains.
- **Persistent Session Data:** Stores connection data during the browser session to maintain continuity and badge accuracy.
- **Non-Intrusive UI:** A simple, clean popup shows summary and domain lists without interfering with your regular browsing.

### Real-World Example

Imagine loading a news site. While the page appears straightforward, uBO Scope reveals dozens of background connections to ads, analytics, content delivery networks (CDNs), and social widgets. It highlights which third-party domains are genuinely active and which are stealthily blocked — giving you complete control and transparency.

## Why Should I Care? (Benefits & Use Cases)

### Outcomes You Can Expect

- **Enhanced Privacy Awareness:** Identify unexpected or excessive third-party connections lurking on websites.
- **Accurate Content Blocker Evaluation:** Separate meaningful privacy protection from misleading block counts.
- **Filter List Improvement:** Use actual connection data to fine-tune filters and blocks.

### Common Use Cases

- **Privacy Audits:** Quickly scan active tabs to gauge third-party exposure.
- **Content Blocker Comparison:** Compare what distinct domains are contacted under different blockers.
- **Filter List Maintenance:** Verify if filters are working as intended without relying on flaky test pages.

### Before vs. After uBO Scope

| Without uBO Scope                           | With uBO Scope                                |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Guesswork about connection activity        | Verifiable data on all attempted connections |
| Misleading block counts                     | Accurate unique domain counts                 |
| Reliance on potentially fake test pages    | Real-world network request insights          |

### Measurable Benefits

- Toolbar badge shows distinct third-party domains, enabling instant assessment.
- Save hours by debugging network behaviour without complex developer tools.

## Getting Started Preview

Getting started with uBO Scope is straightforward:

1. **Install the extension** from your browser’s official store (available on Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, and Safari Extensions).
2. **Open the popup** via the toolbar icon after loading any web page to view the live network connection status.
3. **Interpret connection data:** The popup categorizes domains into allowed, stealth blocked, or blocked, listing counts and domain names.

### Prerequisites
- A modern browser supporting the `webRequest` API (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Chromium-based browsers).
- Permissions granted during installation, including activeTab, storage, and webRequest access.

## Understanding the uBO Scope Popup Interface

The primary user interaction with uBO Scope occurs through its popup UI, accessible by clicking the toolbar icon.

### What You'll See

- **Tab Hostname and Domain:** Shows the current page’s host and main domain, translated from punycode to readable Unicode.
- **Summary Count:** Number of distinct domains connected to by the current tab.
- **Outcome Sections:**
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains for which connections were allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were silently blocked (e.g., via redirection).
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts failed or were explicitly blocked.

Each section lists domains alphabetically, accompanied by the count of connection attempts.

### Practical Tip
A lower count on the badge generally means fewer third-party connections and potentially better privacy.

## Troubleshooting and Common Pitfalls

- **No data visible in popup:** Ensure you have loaded a page after installation and that browser permissions were correctly granted.
- **Connection counts do not match blocklists:** Remember uBO Scope focuses on network connections independently — differences are expected.
- **Extension does not work on some browsers:** Some browsers limit `webRequest` API functionality; verify the browser version and permissions.
