# Who Is uBO Scope For?

Understanding who benefits most from uBO Scope is essential to harness its full potential. Whether you're a privacy-conscious individual, a filter list maintainer, or someone seeking genuine transparency into web request activity — especially on platforms with limited browser developer tools — uBO Scope offers tailored insights that meet your needs.

## Unlocking Transparency for Privacy Enthusiasts

If you care deeply about your online privacy, uBO Scope arms you with a crystal-clear view of every remote connection your browser attempts or succeeds in making as you surf the web. Unlike many other tools, uBO Scope reveals these connections regardless of your content blocking setup, giving you an unfiltered look behind the scenes.

**Why it matters:** You will see exactly which third-party servers your browser contacted — whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked — enabling you to make informed decisions about your browsing habits and security.

### Real User Scenario:
Imagine visiting your favorite news site and wondering which ad networks or trackers are truly active despite your blocker. uBO Scope instantly lays them out, enabling you to spot unwanted connections you might want to block further.

## Empowering Filter List Maintainers

Filter list maintainers need precise, reliable data on network requests to create and refine filtering rules that protect millions of users.

uBO Scope delivers:

- **Accurate categorization:** It distinguishes allowed connections from stealth-blocked or outright blocked requests, helping you identify gaps or stealthy behaviours.
- **Independent verification:** It reports connection outcomes regardless of which content blockers are active or whether DNS-based blocking is employed.

**Practical advantage:** By using uBO Scope, maintainers can isolate third-party domains that bypass filtering or behave unexpectedly, supporting targeted updates to block lists.

## Insight for Users on Devices with Limited Browser Tooling

Some browsers or platforms (e.g., mobile or constrained environments) provide limited developer tools or network monitoring capabilities. uBO Scope fills this gap by surfacing network activity directly via its toolbar badge and popup interface.

- **No need for complex tools**: Access detailed connection breakdowns without opening developer consoles.
- **Lightweight and straightforward**: Focused solely on revealing remote connections without overwhelming configuration.

This makes uBO Scope an ideal companion for everyday browsing where transparency into network activity is otherwise difficult to attain.

<Callout type="tip">
Keep in mind: uBO Scope presents network connections as reported by the browser's `webRequest` API. Connections made outside this scope might not be visible, so use it as a powerful complement rather than sole monitoring source.

<Callout type="note">
The extension works across major browsers including Chromium, Firefox, and Safari, adapting to the platform’s API nuances to maintain consistent visibility.
