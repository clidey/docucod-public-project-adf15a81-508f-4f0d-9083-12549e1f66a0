# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Understanding who benefits most from uBO Scope helps you realize its role in enhancing web privacy transparency and improving content blocker reliability. This guide outlines the primary audiences who gain concrete value from using uBO Scope and illustrates practical use cases where the extension is especially powerful.

## Designed for Privacy-Conscious Users

If protecting your online privacy is a priority, uBO Scope empowers you with unprecedented visibility into the actual third-party connections your browser makes. Instead of guessing or relying on opaque browser behavior, uBO Scope reveals the distinct domains contacted, offering clarity on which remote servers receive your data.

- **See Beyond the Badge Count:** While many content blockers show how many requests are blocked, uBO Scope highlights how many distinct third-party domains are being reached, which directly correlates to your web footprint.
- **Verify Filter Effectiveness:** Confirm if your current blocker truly limits connections, not just blocks requests superficially.
- **Understand Real-World Network Traffic:** Know exactly which parties your browser communicates with during browsing sessions.

> Imagine visiting your favorite news site. uBO Scope helps you see if only essential CDNs load resources or if numerous tracking and advertising domains establish connections behind the scenes.

## Essential for Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining filter lists is challenging, especially when assessing the real-world effect of rules under varied browsing environments. uBO Scope provides maintainers with a reliable method to audit and validate blocking behavior across different domains and network conditions.

- **Monitor Third-Party Domains:** See which external domains are genuinely contacted and whether rules successfully prevent those requests.
- **Test Compatibility:** Identify cases where stealth blocking or other advanced filtering techniques affect connection visibility.
- **Gather Data for Rule Improvements:** Collect actionable insights to tweak or expand filter lists based on live network observations.

> For example, on devices with limited browser development tools, uBO Scope offers a lightweight way to confirm if new filter rules improve blocking coverage.

## Useful for Anyone Seeking Informed Decisions About Network Requests

Whether you are a security researcher, web developer, or informed user, uBO Scope helps demystify the complex nature of third-party connections made by modern websites.

- **Evaluate Content Blockers Reliably:** Avoid misleading metrics like block counts alone and focus on the actual reduction in distinct third-party domain connections.
- **Avoid False Benchmarks:** Recognize the shortcomings of “ad blocker test” pages by verifying connections that truly occur during browsing.
- **Gain Transparency into Web Behavior:** Explore the network interactions of websites as they happen in real environments.

> For instance, when comparing multiple content blockers, uBO Scope clarifies which blockers effectively reduce your exposure to third-party domains.

## Key Use Cases

### 1. Verifying Content Blocker Effectiveness
- **Goal:** Determine if your content blocker is truly reducing third-party connections, not just increasing block counts.
- **How uBO Scope Helps:** By displaying distinct third-party domains contacted vs. blocked, you gain factual insight into blocking success.

### 2. Evaluating Real-World Network Connections
- **Goal:** See the complete set of remote servers your browser attempts to access for any website.
- **How uBO Scope Helps:** Presents categorized domains by their network request outcomes (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked).

### 3. Supporting Filter List Development
- **Goal:** Validate and refine filter lists in practical browsing contexts.
- **How uBO Scope Helps:** Supplies detailed domain-level data crucial for adjusting filtering rules, including stealth-block scenarios.

### 4. Debunking Ad Blocker Myths
- **Goal:** Understand why some popular assumptions and test pages are misleading.
- **How uBO Scope Helps:** Clarifies that a higher block count can correspond to a larger number of domains contacted and that synthetic test pages don’t accurately reflect real browsing behavior.

## Practical Tips for Users

- Always interpret uBO Scope’s badge count as the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connected with — **the lower, the better for privacy**.
- Use the popup interface to see domain lists segmented by their request outcomes:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains your browser successfully connected to.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests that were redirected or invisibly blocked by content blockers.
  - **Blocked:** Requests that were explicitly blocked or failed.
- Combine insights from uBO Scope with your content blocker’s interface to get a complete picture of privacy protection.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t rely solely on block counts as a measure of content blocker quality.
- Avoid trusting ad blocker test webpages as conclusive evidence of blocker performance.
- Remember that uBO Scope works only where browser APIs report network requests; some native or OS-level filtering may not be detected.
