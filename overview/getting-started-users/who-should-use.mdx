# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

## Understanding the Right Users for uBO Scope

uBO Scope is designed specifically for those who want transparent insight into web page network activity, especially the connections made to third-party servers.

This page clarifies who benefits most from uBO Scope and how it tackles common challenges faced by these user groups.

## Primary User Profiles

### 1. Privacy-Conscious Users

If you care deeply about your online privacy, uBO Scope offers you a unique and empowering view. It reveals:

- **All network connections made by web pages**, regardless of which content blockers you have enabled.
- The **exact count of unique third-party domains** contacted during your browsing session.

This visibility helps you:

- Understand which external servers your browser connects to in real time.
- Assess whether trackers or unwanted third parties are active despite other blockers.
- Gain peace of mind by monitoring your browser’s network behavior rather than relying solely on blocker claims.

### 2. Content or Filter List Maintainers

Filter list maintainers face the challenge of accurately identifying all third-party remote servers involved in delivering content or trackers. uBO Scope is a powerful tool for this because:

- It collects **network request data independently of any content blocking software**.
- It provides a clear, session-based accounting of which third parties were contacted, **helping you discover any new or previously untracked domains**.
- It works seamlessly where browser developer tools may be limited or not available, such as on devices with restricted access.

This makes uBO Scope an essential auditing companion for maintaining effective, up-to-date blocking lists.

### 3. Auditors and Security-Conscious Professionals

For those auditing web pages or performing security assessments, uBO Scope offers:

- Transparent access to the network endpoints a web page touches.
- Insights into which requests succeeded, were blocked, or stealth-blocked, helping diagnose the effectiveness of content control measures.
- Freedom from interference by existing content blockers, showing the true network activity.

It is especially useful in verifying claims about blocking and connection behavior within enterprise or security environments.

---

## Typical Use Cases

- **Verifying Third-Party Activity:** Confirm if a privacy blocker is letting through unwanted domains.
- **Filter List Debugging:** Identify new or hidden third-party servers to maintain filter lists.
- **Network Request Audits:** Assess web page connections when building security or compliance reports.
- **Myth Busting Misconceptions:** Provide factual data to counter misconceptions from ad blocker tests or misleading badge counts.

## Challenges uBO Scope Helps You Solve

- **Lack of Transparency:** Many users do not know whom their browsers connect to; uBO Scope makes all such connections visible.
- **Misinformation from Other Tools:** Standard ad blocker badges and test pages often mislead about what is blocked; uBO Scope counters this confusion by showing actual network connections.
- **Limited Access on Some Devices:** Inspecting web requests via developer tools isn’t always possible; uBO Scope works independently to fill that gap.


## Summary

By revealing the number and type of distinct third-party connections your browser makes, uBO Scope empowers various users — from everyday privacy enthusiasts to filter list maintainers and security auditors — to achieve deeper, accurate insights into web traffic, helping them make confident decisions.

## Practical Tips for Users

- Use uBO Scope alongside other content blockers to verify their effectiveness, not just replace them.
- Regularly check the popup badge counts after visiting trusted and untrusted sites to understand behavior changes.
- For filter list maintainers, leverage uBO Scope's independent view to catch edge cases and obscure third parties.
