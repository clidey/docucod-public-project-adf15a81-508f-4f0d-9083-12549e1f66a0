# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Your Browser Makes

Imagine browsing the web with full clarity on what remote servers your browser talks to, whether those connections are allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked. **uBO Scope** is a lightweight browser extension designed precisely for that purpose — it reveals all attempted and successful connections to remote servers initiated by webpages.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You

- **Complete Connection Visibility:** See every network request to remote servers, regardless of any content blocker or DNS-level filtering in place.
- **Privacy Insights:** Identify how many distinct third-party servers load resources on pages you visit, helping you gauge real privacy exposure.
- **Unbiased Reporting:** Counts distinct remote servers contacted rather than raw block counts, avoiding common misinterpretations about content blocking effectiveness.
- **Filter List Maintainer’s Ally:** Provides actionable data that can validate and refine filter lists, especially useful when browser developer tools or other resources are limited.
- **Minimalism & Focus:** Delivers focused, accurate reporting without the noise and pitfalls of typical adblocker test sites or synthetic benchmarks.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope

- Privacy-conscious users wanting a transparent view of their browser’s network activity.
- Filter list maintainers seeking real-world data about network requests and blocking outcomes.
- Security researchers or web developers interested in analyzing third-party connections.

## What uBO Scope Is and Does

At its core, uBO Scope is a **browser extension** that hooks into the browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor network requests initiated by webpages. It keeps track of each connection attempt's fate, categorizing them as:

- **Allowed:** Requests that successfully connected.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests blocked stealthily by content blockers, hidden from direct page detection.
- **Blocked:** Requests that were explicitly blocked during network activity.

This extension aggregates the number of **distinct remote third-party domains** contacted and reports this count visually via a badge on the browser toolbar icon. 

### What Problem Does It Solve?

Users struggle to understand what third parties their browsers connect to, often relying on inaccurate block counts or misleading adblocker tests. uBO Scope cuts through this uncertainty by providing a dependable, practical count of actual connections made or attempted in real browsing conditions.

### How It Works Simply

- It listens to network request lifecycle events (`onBeforeRedirect`, `onErrorOccurred`, `onResponseStarted`) for URLs matching typical web protocols (`http`, `https`, `ws`, `wss`).
- Each request is recorded and analyzed to determine whether it was allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- It tracks unique domains contacted per browser tab and updates a badge count accordingly.
- The extension stores session data to preserve state and leverage a public suffix list for domain determination.


## Positioning Compared to Other Privacy & Blocking Tools

uBO Scope is **not a content blocker itself**, but a transparent network connection reporter that complements content blockers such as uBlock Origin. It helps you:

- Verify the effectiveness of your existing content blockers by seeing what actually gets through.
- Avoid misleading statistics from block counts alone or fake "ad blocker test" pages.
- Understand the broader network footprint of webpages, not just what is blocked.

It’s a diagnostic and evaluative tool, empowering you with data rather than filtering.

## Real-World Example: Monitoring Your Active Tab’s Connections

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup panel displays:

- The hostname and domain of the active tab.
- The number of distinct connected third-party domains.
- Lists of domains by connection outcome: _Not Blocked (Allowed)_, _Stealth-blocked_, and _Blocked_.

This allows you to instantly see the profile of third parties your browsing session interacts with, helping you spot unexpected or excessive connections.

## Practical Tips for Getting the Most from uBO Scope

- **Badge Interpretation:** A lower badge count means fewer third-party connections, reflecting better privacy practice. Use it as a quick privacy gauge.
- **Complement Existing Blockers:** Use alongside content blockers to gain clarity on their impact, rather than relying on block counters.
- **Avoid Relying on Test Sites:** Trust the extension’s data over adblock test pages, which often do not reflect real browsing.
- **For Filter List Maintainers:** The recorded data provides a reliable baseline to assess filter performance and third-party contact patterns.
