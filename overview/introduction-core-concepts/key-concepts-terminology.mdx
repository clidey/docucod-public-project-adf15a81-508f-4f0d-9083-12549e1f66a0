# Key Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the foundational terminology and concepts of uBO Scope is crucial for unlocking its full potential. This guide introduces essential terms like **distinct third-party servers**, **webRequest API**, and how uBO Scope categorizes network requests as **blocked**, **allowed**, or **stealth blocked**. Equipped with this knowledge, you will better comprehend the data presented by the tool and make insightful decisions about your online privacy.

## Distinct Third-Party Servers

At the core of uBO Scope's reporting is the idea of *distinct third-party servers*. In web browsing, your device connects not only to the website you visit but also often to other servers—these are typically content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics providers, ad networks, and various external services.

- **What it means:** A "third-party server" is any server that is different from the main website's domain.
- **Why it matters:** Each distinct third-party server represents a separate external connection your browser makes, impacting your privacy and security.
- **User impact:** Monitoring and minimizing connections to unnecessary third-party servers helps reduce data exposure and tracking.

uBO Scope tracks the number of these distinct servers your browser interacts with. The count shown on the extension's badge reflects this number, helping you visualize your browsing footprint.

## The `webRequest` API

uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to observe and record network requests made by webpages.

- **What is it?** The `webRequest` API is an interface available in modern browsers that allows extensions to monitor, modify, or block network requests.
- **How uBO Scope uses it:** By tapping into this API, uBO Scope can see all outgoing requests and their results—whether they were allowed, blocked, or altered.
- **Limitations:** Requests made outside this API's reach (such as some browser internals or specific protocols) cannot be observed.

Understanding this API helps appreciate how uBO Scope gathers accurate, real-time connection data transparently and independently from any content blocker.

## Classification of Network Requests

uBO Scope organizes observed network connections into three clear outcomes, providing immediate clarity:

1. **Allowed**
   - These are requests that completed successfully.
   - Represent connections that the browser established without interference.
   - Typically, these include essential resources or trusted third parties, like CDNs.

2. **Blocked**
   - Requests that were explicitly blocked by the content blocker or other filtering mechanisms.
   - These never reached the remote server or were dropped before completion.
   - Seeing these helps you verify and understand what your content blocker is preventing.

3. **Stealth-blocked**
   - This is a nuanced category for requests that were silently blocked without direct rejection signals.
   - These connections may have been intercepted or rewritten stealthily, making detection harder.
   - It ensures uBO Scope accounts for subtle blocking strategies and doesn't underestimate network filtering.

This classification helps you distinguish the different handling of network requests, giving you detailed insight into what loads and what does not.

## Domain vs Hostname

Two critical terms you’ll encounter are:

- **Hostname:** The full domain name for a specific network request, including any subdomains (e.g., `cdn.example.com`).
- **Domain:** The registered domain under which subdomains exist, typically the main organizational label (e.g., `example.com`).

uBO Scope presents counts of both hostnames and domains to let you understand activity at different granularities.

## Public Suffix List (PSL)

To accurately determine domains from hostnames, uBO Scope employs the Public Suffix List (PSL).

- **What is PSL?** A maintained list of domain suffixes under which Internet users can directly register names (e.g., `.com`, `.co.uk`).
- **Why PSL matters:** It helps separate the registrable domain from subdomains, ensuring domain-based reporting is accurate.
- **Source:** The extension fetches the PSL from [publicsuffix.org](https://publicsuffix.org) and keeps it updated in session.

Understanding the PSL's role clarifies how uBO Scope groups hostnames into domains, avoiding misclassification.

## Practical User Scenario

Imagine you visit your favorite news website. Behind the scenes, your browser connects to:

- The news website's main server (`news.example.com`)
- A CDN provider (`cdn.provider.net`)
- An analytics service (`analytics.track.com`)

With uBO Scope:

- You see the badge showing "3" — three distinct third-party connections.
- In the popup, 'allowed' includes `news.example.com` and `cdn.provider.net`.
- The analytics service might show under 'blocked' if your filters prevent it.
- If your content blocker silently blocks some connections without alerting, those appear under 'stealth-blocked'.

This explicit visibility helps you understand your exposure and control your privacy.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Interpret badge count correctly:** A lower number means fewer third-party connections, which often translates to better privacy.
- **Do not rely on block counts alone:** A high number of blocked requests doesn't always mean better blocking; focus on distinct allowed domains.
- **Update PSL regularly:** This is managed automatically but knowing this process helps you trust domain classification.
- **Review stealth blocking:** It reveals subtle blocking that traditional tools may ignore.

## Common Pitfalls

- Confusing hostname counts with domain counts — domains aggregate many hostnames.
- Misinterpreting badge counts as your content blocker’s overall effectiveness.
- Relying on third-party "ad blocker test" sites — uBO Scope offers a more realistic perspective.
