# Key Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the core terminology behind uBO Scope is essential for making sense of the extension's reporting results and how it operates with your browser's `webRequest` API. This page clarifies crucial terms such as third-party vs. first-party connections, the meaning of public suffixes, the significance of the badge count, and how uBO Scope classifies connections into allowed, blocked, or stealth categories.

---

## Third-Party vs. First-Party Connections

At the heart of uBO Scope's analysis is the distinction between first-party and third-party connections, which determines what the extension counts and displays:

- **First-Party Connections:** These are network requests made to the same domain as the website you are currently visiting. For example, visiting `example.com` and connecting to `cdn.example.com` counts as first-party if the domain is considered the same.

- **Third-Party Connections:** Connections made to domains different from the one you are visiting. For instance, if you are on `news.site` but your browser loads resources from `ads.trackingnetwork.com`, that is a third-party connection.

Importantly, uBO Scope focuses on **distinct third-party remote servers**. This focus provides a clear, practical measurement of your web privacy footprint, as these third-party domains are often involved in tracking, advertising, or other external activities.

## What Is a Public Suffix?

A **public suffix** is a domain under which Internet users can directly register names. Often, this is a top-level domain (TLD) like `.com`, `.org`, or `.net`, but it can also be complex, like `.co.uk` or `.edu.au`. 

For instance:

- In `news.example.com`, the public suffix is `.com`.
- In `services.example.co.uk`, the public suffix is `.co.uk`.

uBO Scope uses a curated list of public suffixes from the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to determine the **registrable domain** part of hostnames. This allows the extension to accurately classify network requests by domain regardless of local variations or multi-level TLDs, ensuring that the counting of third-party domains is precise.

---

## Badge Count: What It Represents

The badge count shown on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon represents:

> **The number of distinct third-party domains with which a connection was attempted or established during the current browser tab’s lifetime.**

This metric reflects domains that injected content, whether successfully fetched or blocked, highlighting your exposure to external networks.

**Why this matters:**

- A **lower badge count** indicates fewer third-party connections, generally signifying a smaller privacy exposure.
- The count **does not show the number of blocked network requests**, but rather the distinct remote servers involved.

This approach debunks common misconceptions like equating a high block count with better content blocking. The real measure is how many distinct third-party servers your browser connects to, not how many individual requests are blocked.

## Connection Classifications in uBO Scope (Allowed, Blocked, Stealth)

uBO Scope categorizes network connections using three outcome categories that correlate with your content blocker's effect and network request results:

| Outcome    | Description                                                                                                             | User Value                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Allowed**    | Connections that successfully loaded resources from third-party domains without being blocked. These indicate active external content. | Shows which external domains are actively contributing resources to your browsing experience. Useful for understanding active external dependencies. |
| **Blocked**    | Connections that your content blocker or other network restrictions prevented from completing.                          | Helps you identify third-party domains your blocker successfully stopped, highlighting how your blocking rules protect you. |
| **Stealth**    | Connections silently redirected or modified by your content blocker to avoid detection by webpages (stealth blocking). | Indicates advanced blocking techniques that prevent webpages from detecting blocking, which helps maintain site functionality while preserving privacy. |

Each outcome maintains a count of the distinct domains and requests related to these categories, allowing you to analyze the behavior at domain granularity.

## How uBO Scope Works With the Browser's `webRequest` API

uBO Scope relies entirely on the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network requests:

- It listens to **network events** like request redirects, errors, or successful responses.
- For each request, it identifies the hostname, extracts the registrable domain via the public suffix list, and classifies the outcome (allowed, blocked, stealth).
- Counts of domains are then updated and displayed in the extension popup and badge.

**Important Limitations:**

- Any network requests **not reported by `webRequest`** (e.g., some DNS-level blocks or non-browser native connections) cannot be tracked by uBO Scope.
- The extension **does not block or modify network requests itself**; it only reports.

This means the extension provides a **transparent, accurate reflection** of network activity as reported by your browser, independent of which content blocker is active.

## Practical Example: Understanding Connection Outcomes

Imagine you visit `example.com`:

- The page loads its own content from `example.com` (first-party).
- The site loads fonts from `fonts.googleapis.com` (third-party allowed).
- An analytics script attempts to load data from `tracking.service.com` but is blocked by your content blocker.
- A redirect occurs from `ads.redirection.com` to `ads.finalserver.com` but is stealth blocked (silently stopped).

uBO Scope will show:

- **Allowed:** `fonts.googleapis.com` (counts as one third-party domain).
- **Blocked:** `tracking.service.com` (listed as blocked).
- **Stealth:** `ads.finalserver.com` (listed as stealth-blocked).

The badge will count only the distinct allowed third-party domains, which in this example is 1.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Use the badge count as a simple, clear indicator of your browsing exposure to third-party domains.
- Dive into the popup details to see which domains are allowed, blocked, or stealth blocked.
- Remember, not all third-party domains are harmful; some are legitimate services like CDNs.
- The distinction between allowed, blocked, and stealth can help you evaluate the effectiveness of your blocker and diagnose unexpected third-party activity.
- If you observe an unexpectedly high badge count, investigate the domains in the popup to determine if they are necessary or related to tracking.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

### Why Doesn’t the Badge Count Match Block Counts from My Content Blocker?
uBO Scope counts distinct third-party domains connected, not the number of blocked requests. High block counts can coexist with high badge counts if many third-party domains are being contacted.

### What If the Badge Is Empty or Zero?
It means no third-party connections were allowed on the current tab so far, which might happen on freshly opened tabs or sites that do not load external content.

### Can uBO Scope Detect Blocked Connections From DNS-Level Blocking?
Only if the browser reports the blocked or failed request through `webRequest`. Some DNS-level blocks may be invisible to uBO Scope.
