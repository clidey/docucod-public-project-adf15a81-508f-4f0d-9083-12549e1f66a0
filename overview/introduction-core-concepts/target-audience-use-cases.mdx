# Who is uBO Scope For?

Understanding who benefits most from uBO Scope empowers users to leverage this extension effectively. This page outlines the primary user groups and highlights key real-world use cases where uBO Scope delivers indispensable insights.

## Primary User Groups

### Privacy-Focused Users
Individuals deeply concerned with online privacy find uBO Scope an essential companion. It reveals every connection web pages attempt or establish to remote servers, helping users spot and minimize third-party data exposure. By exposing stealth-blocked and allowed connections, it creates transparency often hidden by traditional blockers.

### Technical Evaluators and Privacy Auditors
Professionals performing security audits, privacy evaluations, or network diagnostics depend on accurate connection data. uBO Scope provides detailed reports on network requests — allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked — regardless of any content blocker active. This insight is critical to verify actual blocking efficacy and detect unexpected network activity.

### Filter List Maintainers
Maintainers of content blocking lists rely on empirical data to validate rules and understand real-world scenarios. uBO Scope measures outcomes across all network requests irrespective of filtering mechanisms used. This holistic visibility aids maintainers in refining lists, troubleshooting misses, and confirming stealth blocking performed outside extension scope.

### Users Questioning Content Blocker Claims
Web users skeptical of adblocker statistics or eager to debunk myths use uBO Scope as the definitive truth source. It helps clarify misunderstandings, such as misleading block counts and unreliable test pages. By showing actual distinct third-party connections, users can assess blocker effectiveness without bias.

## Key Use Cases

### 1. Auditing Privacy on Visited Websites
Privacy-focused users launch uBO Scope while browsing to see exactly which third-party domains their browser connects to, including those blocked or stealth-blocked. This live auditing helps identify unexpected trackers or excessive third-party resource calls that compromise privacy.

### 2. Debunking Misleading Blocker Statistics
uBO Scope exposes the fallacy that a blocker with a higher block count is necessarily better. Instead, it shows the number of distinct third-party connections allowed by the browser, often the true measure of effectiveness. Users can confidently evaluate and compare blockers on meaningful metrics.

### 3. Understanding Site Network Behavior
Curious users and evaluators observe real-time domain connection outcomes, distinguishing between connections allowed, blocked outright, or stealth-blocked (hidden). This understanding supports troubleshooting issues with content or site functionality and bolsters privacy awareness.

### 4. Supporting Filter List Refinement
Filter list maintainers extract practical connection outcome details to tune rulesets, ensuring the right requests are blocked or permitted. They can identify stealth-blocked connections triggered by external means such as DNS or network-level blocking, enabling thorough list evaluation.

### 5. Verifying WebRequest API Coverage
Technical users confirm if all relevant network requests are visible through the browser's `webRequest` API, which uBO Scope depends on. They can identify limitations where certain requests (outside `webRequest` reach) are not reported, guiding troubleshooting or blocker improvements.

## Before and After Scenario: Evaluating a Content Blocker

- **Without uBO Scope:** A user relies on the block count shown by their adblocker but has no insight into which distinct third-party domains actually load content.

- **With uBO Scope:** The user sees the precise number of distinct connected third-party domains, including those stealth-blocked or allowed, yielding a more accurate picture of privacy exposure.

This contrast empowers informed decisions on extension choice and configuration.

## Practical Tips

- Keep an eye on the toolbar badge count; a lower number indicates fewer unique third-party remote servers connected, generally more privacy-friendly.
- Remember that not all third parties are harmful - CDNs and essential services often form legitimate connections.
- Use uBO Scope alongside other debugging tools for comprehensive analysis.
- Engage with the filter list maintainer community by providing empirical connection data.

---

## Troubleshooting and Common Pitfalls

- **No data visible in popup?** Ensure that uBO Scope has the correct permissions and that the browser supports `webRequest` API fully.
- **Unexpected high badge count?** Some legitimate third-party services might inflate the count; inspect the domain list to identify them.
- **Stealth-blocked domains still appearing?** These reflect connections blocked outside uBO Scope’s control; review your network-level blocking solutions.
