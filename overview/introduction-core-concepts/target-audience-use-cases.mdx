## Real-World Use Cases That Show uBO Scope’s True Value

### 1. Identifying Excessive Third-Party Requests

Ever load a site and wonder why it feels bloated or slow? By using uBO Scope, you can pinpoint the exact number of distinct external domains your browser interacts with. This helps you:

- Detect websites with excessive third-party connections that might be compromising your privacy or wasting bandwidth.
- Verify whether your content blocker effectively reduces exposure by lowering the actual third-party server count.

### 2. Debugging and Refining Filter Lists

As a filter list maintainer, ensuring your rules achieve the intended blocking results is crucial. uBO Scope provides:

- Transparent visibility into which requests are blocked, allowed, or stealth-blocked.
- Data to help analyze complex interactions, enabling you to improve filter accuracy.
- An independent check on network requests that can be vital when browser development tools are unavailable or limited.

### 3. Verifying Content Blocker Impact

Not all high block counts mean better privacy. uBO Scope helps you:

- Understand that a higher block count does not necessarily equate to fewer third-party connections.
- Measure the true effectiveness of your content blocker in reducing the diversity of third-party servers accessed.

## Before and After: Visualizing Your Web Traffic

Imagine visiting a news site. Before using uBO Scope, you don’t know which third parties the site contacts or which are blocked. After installing uBO Scope, you instantly see: 

- The exact number of external domains connected.
- Which of those requests were blocked or allowed.
- Whether any requests are stealth-blocked (blocked invisibly by the content blocker).

This visibility empowers you to make informed decisions and adjust your privacy tools accordingly.

## Keep In Mind

- **Not All Third Parties Are Bad:** Legitimate services like CDN providers usually count as third parties but often pose no privacy risk.
- **Limits of Network Visibility:** Connections originated outside the browser’s `webRequest` API cannot be tracked by uBO Scope.

---

## Practical Tips for Users

- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to get a more accurate picture of your browsing privacy.
- Review the badge count regularly to monitor shifts in third-party exposure.
- Combine insights from uBO Scope with browser developer tools for comprehensive web analysis.
