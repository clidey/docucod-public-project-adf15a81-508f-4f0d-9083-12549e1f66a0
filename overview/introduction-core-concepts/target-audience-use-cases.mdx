# Target Audience & Use Cases

## Who Benefits From uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is designed with a specific set of users in mind who need clear, accurate insights into their browser's network activity — particularly connections to third-party remote servers. Understanding who benefits most helps you decide if uBO Scope fits your needs.

- **Privacy-Focused Individuals**: If you care about minimizing tracking and exposure to third-party servers, uBO Scope is your transparent window into what’s truly happening behind the scenes. It empowers you to verify which servers your browser connects to regardless of the content blocker in place.

- **Filter List Maintainers**: For those who maintain or test filter lists used in content blockers, uBO Scope provides real-world, reliable data about network requests and blocking outcomes, even in environments with limited access to developer tools.

- **Technically-Savvy Users & Researchers**: Researchers, security analysts, and advanced users who want to audit and understand the network behavior of websites will find uBO Scope indispensable. It reveals not just what’s blocked, but what connections succeed or are stealthily rerouted.

## Common Scenarios Where uBO Scope Adds Value

### Scenario 1: Confirming Your Content Blocker’s Effectiveness

Imagine you use a popular content blocker and see a high count of blocked items on its toolbar badge. You may be tempted to assume it’s more effective than another blocker with fewer blocks. However, uBO Scope reveals the number of *distinct third-party remote servers* successfully connected to your browser. 

- If the number of distinct connected servers is high, even with many blocked requests, your blocker might actually be allowing more third-party connections than you expect.
- Understanding this protects you from common misconceptions based on block counts alone.

### Scenario 2: Debunking Ad Blocker Test Websites

Some "ad blocker test" webpages advertise themselves as proof your content blocker works. Unfortunately, these tests simulate unrealistic scenarios and can’t detect stealthy blocking techniques used by advanced extensions.

- uBO Scope helps you avoid such unreliable benchmarks by showing real-world connections and actual network request outcomes from browsed websites.

### Scenario 3: Filter List Development & Device Limitations

Filter list maintainers may sometimes work on devices where full browser developer tools aren’t accessible or effective.

- uBO Scope provides a compact, extension-based view of network requests outcomes, assisting maintainers in verifying if their lists block or allow certain domains properly.

### Scenario 4: Privacy Audit & Transparency

By showing each requested domain categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked, users gain transparency.

- This empowers you to take control, tweak filters, or understand what resources your browser fetches from third parties.

## Why uBO Scope Matters: Clarifying Transparency in Content Blocking

- The key value of uBO Scope is its focus on **distinct third-party remote servers**, which offer a more meaningful picture than raw block or request counts.
- It is unique in its ability to report accurate network request outcomes despite any content blocker active or DNS-based blocking methods.
- This capability fills an important gap for users seeking *clarity* over browser network behavior beyond traditional block counts.

## Practical Tips for Getting the Most From uBO Scope

- **Interpret Badge Counts Correctly**: Remember, a *lower* badge count means fewer third-party servers were connected to, indicating stronger privacy protection.
- **Check Multiple Tabs**: The extension tracks network activity per tab, helping identify which websites load more third-party resources.
- **Use As a Diagnostic Tool**: When troubleshooting site behaviors or filter lists, uBO Scope’s detailed reporting can show if connections are stealthily allowed or blocked.

## What Happens Without uBO Scope?

- You risk misjudging content blocker efficiency based on misleading block counts.
- You remain unaware of stealthy network requests that bypass or evade detection by traditional tools.
- Filter list maintainers lack a simple, reliable way to audit network requests on limited devices.

<Tip>
Use uBO Scope to move beyond surface metrics like block counts and gain trustworthy, granular insight into your browser's third-party connections for better privacy decisions.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Avoid relying on third-party "ad blocker test" sites as indicators of your blocker’s effectiveness; uBO Scope shows real network data from actual browsing.
</Warning>

<Check>
Keep in mind that not all third-party remote servers are harmful — some are essential services like CDNs; uBO Scope helps identify their presence.
