# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Discover how uBO Scope uniquely empowers various users to gain a deeper understanding and control over their browser's network connections. Whether you prioritize privacy, maintain filter lists, or audit content blockers, this extension gives you visibility and actionable insights custom-tailored to your needs.

## Understanding Your Audience: Who Benefits Most from uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is designed for three primary groups who share a common goal: transparency and control over third-party network activity in your browser.

- **Privacy-Conscious Web Users**
- **Filter List Maintainers**
- **Content Blocker Auditors and Researchers**

Let's explore how each benefits from the real-time, detailed connection data uBO Scope reveals.

## Privacy-Conscious Web Users

For users deeply concerned about online privacy, uBO Scope is an indispensable tool. Unlike traditional content blockers that primarily show a count of blocked requests, uBO Scope reveals _which_ third-party domains your browser connects to—even those stealthily hidden or redirected.

### Why Privacy-Focused Users Should Care

- **Clear Visibility Into Connections:** See every distinct remote server your browser contacts, categorized by those allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked.
- **Validate Your Content Blocker Efficacy:** Understand the real impact of your blocking setup beyond badge counts, ensuring fewer unexpected data leaks.
- **Identify Stealth Connections:** Spot connections that are redirected or otherwise obscured from standard blocking metrics.

### Real-World Scenario

Imagine browsing your favorite news website and wondering if trackers are silently sneaking through your content blocker. uBO Scope shows exactly which third-party servers communicate with your browser, helping you confirm or adjust your privacy settings based on actual data—not assumptions.

## Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining filter lists—rulesets that block or allow specific network requests—is complex and requires comprehensive testing environments. uBO Scope serves as a critical companion for maintainers who need precise, actionable data from real-world browsing sessions.

### Benefits for Filter List Maintainers

- **Cross-Content Blocker Insights:** uBO Scope reports connections regardless of which content blocker is active, giving a consistent reference point.
- **Works on Limited Browser Tools:** Useful on devices or environments where traditional browser debugging tools are unavailable or restricted.
- **Detailed Domain Breakdown:** Get clear information on which domains are interacting with a page, aiding in crafting more effective filter rules.

### Practical Example

A filter list maintainer testing new filter rules can use uBO Scope to quickly identify domains that slip through or are incorrectly blocked, on both desktop and mobile browsers. This speeds up debugging and improves list quality.

## Content Blocker Auditors and Researchers

For security researchers, auditors, and developers comparing content blockers, uBO Scope offers a transparent, data-driven approach to auditing network behavior.

### How uBO Scope Supports Auditing

- **Debunks Common Myths:** Avoid misleading conclusions drawn from simple block counts or synthetic 'ad blocker test' pages.
- **Accurate Measurement of Third-Party Exposure:** Reveals the true count of distinct third-party remote servers reached during page load.
- **Independent of Blocking Methodology:** Content blockers use various stealth techniques and DNS-level blocking; uBO Scope aggregates the results without bias.

### Use Case

When comparing two blockers, a researcher using uBO Scope can spot if a higher block count actually correlates with more connections allowed, which might indicate lower real-world protection. This insight refines evaluation methodologies.

## Why uBO Scope Provides Unique Insights

Many existing tools rely on metrics that can be easily misinterpreted. uBO Scope brings clarity by focusing on the _domains_ your browser connects to, with outcomes classified as:

- **Allowed:** Domains with successful connections.
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were redirected or quietly suppressed.

This granularity supports informed decision-making whether you aim to protect your privacy, enhance filter lists, or evaluate blockers.

---

## Summarizing Real-World Scenarios Where uBO Scope Excels

- **Disprove the notion that more blocks always mean better protection:** Using uBO Scope reveals when a high block count masks multiple allowed connections to different domains.
- **Validate effectiveness on mobile and limited browsers:** Devices where developer tools are scarce can still expose third-party activity through uBO Scope.
- **Assist filter list enhancement:** Accurately identify problematic domains to focus rule creation.

## Getting Started

Jump into transparency today by installing uBO Scope on your browser:

- Visit the browser's extension store (e.g., [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)).
- Open the uBO Scope popup while browsing to see detailed connection reports.
- Explore detailed outcomes to understand your actual data exposure.

From there, you can explore related documentation such as the [Popup UI Guide](/guides/getting-started/understanding-the-popup) for interface details or learn about core concepts in the [Core Concepts and Terminology](/overview/introduction-core-concepts/core-concepts-and-terminology) page.

<Note>
While uBO Scope provides deep visibility, it relies on the browser's `webRequest` API and cannot report network requests outside of this scope.
