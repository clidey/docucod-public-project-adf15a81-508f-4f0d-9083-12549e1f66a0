# Feature Highlights

Explore the key features of uBO Scope that empower you to see, understand, and interpret the true privacy impact of each website you visit. This page breaks down the essential functionalities — connection monitoring per tab, toolbar badge counts, and neutral reporting that works independently of other blockers — to help you gain clear insights into your online exposure.

## Understanding uBO Scope's Core Features

### Connection Monitoring on a Per-Tab Basis

uBO Scope meticulously tracks all network connections initiated by each active browser tab. Instead of showing aggregated data, it provides granular insight tied to the specific website you are visiting.

- **What it does:** Every tab’s outgoing connections — whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked — are listed distinctly.
- **Why it matters:** This allows you to see exactly which remote servers a particular page is contacting, uncovering third-party services even when other blockers are active or sophisticated blocking methods hide these connections.
  
**Example:** When you open a news article, uBO Scope shows all the distinct domains that webpage connects to, helping you spot trackers or CDNs it fetches content from.

### Toolbar Badge Counts Reflect Distinct Allowed Connections

The colored badge displayed on uBO Scope's toolbar icon is not just a random number — it communicates the **number of distinct third-party remote servers that a page successfully connects to.**

- **Key insight:** A lower badge count means fewer third-party connections, signaling better privacy.
- **Neutral metric:** This count does not depend on how many resources were blocked but counts only the allowed connections, filtering out noise and focusing on real exposures.

This method avoids misleading privacy metrics based on block counts alone, which often fail to reveal true outside communication.

### Neutral Reporting Independent of Other Blockers

uBO Scope works transparently alongside any content blocker or DNS-level filter.

- It listens to the browser's network request events directly, providing a true picture of network activity regardless of any blocking logic.
- This ensures that your privacy assessment isn't skewed by how aggressively or silently your blockers operate.

**Benefits:**
- See stealth-blocked connections that some blockers hide.
- Compare how different blockers influence real third-party exposure.

## How These Features Help You

uBO Scope equips you with objective, actionable data:

- **Interpret Third-Party Exposure Accurately:** Understand which external domains you interact with beyond the first-party site.
- **Evaluate Content Blockers Reliably:** Avoid relying on misleading block counts or fake blocker test pages.
- **Diagnose Privacy Risks Per Tab:** Quickly spot tabs loading unwanted content or communicating with suspicious servers.

By examining the allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked sections per tab, you receive a comprehensive snapshot of your real privacy landscape.

## Practical Scenario

Imagine browsing a site that appears clean. uBO Scope’s toolbar badge shows a non-zero count of allowed third-party domains. Clicking the popup reveals a list under 'not blocked' containing several advertiser domains you didn’t expect. Meanwhile, the 'stealth-blocked' section lists other domains your blockers quietly prevented from connecting. This transparency lets you take informed actions—like adjusting your filters or avoiding certain sites—based on true network behavior.

## Best Practices and Tips

- Regularly check the toolbar badge after loading key websites to track third-party connection trends.
- Use uBO Scope’s popup to differentiate between allowed, stealth blocked, and fully blocked domains.
- Remember that some third-party connections (like well-known CDN providers) are often legitimate and unavoidable.
- Avoid drawing conclusions solely from block counts of other blockers; trust uBO Scope’s distinct connection metrics.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Feature Highlights FAQs">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count only show allowed connections?">
Counting distinct allowed domains focuses on actual privacy exposure rather than the volume of blocked requests, which can be misleading. A high block count does not necessarily mean better privacy if more distinct third parties are allowed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does 'stealth-blocked' mean?">
Stealth-blocked connections are those blocked silently by the browser or other blockers in a way that the site is unaware. uBO Scope reports these to reveal hidden blocking activity.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope interfere with other blockers?">
No. It independently listens to the network requests from the browser, so it does not block or alter requests itself but reports what actually happens.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can the features be trusted if some requests occur outside browser control?">
uBO Scope only reports connections it can observe via the browser's webRequest API. Connections occurring outside its reach, like native app background connections, will not appear.
