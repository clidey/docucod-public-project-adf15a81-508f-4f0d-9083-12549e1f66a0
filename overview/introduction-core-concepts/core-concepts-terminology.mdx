# Core Concepts and Terminology

Understanding the language and logic behind uBO Scope is essential to fully leveraging its capabilities. This page defines the key terms and concepts that underpin the extension’s reporting and measurement of outbound network connections.

---

## What Are Third-Party Remote Servers?

Third-party remote servers are domains or hostnames that a website’s content triggers connections to, which are different from the first-party site the user visits. For instance, when you load a webpage, it may request resources from other domains such as ad networks, CDNs, analytics providers, or social media platforms. These are considered third-party remote servers.

uBO Scope focuses specifically on these third parties as they are often sources of privacy concerns and unwanted resource loading.

**Example:**

- Visiting `example.com` (the first party)
- Your browser makes requests to `cdn.example.com` (first-party subdomain)
- Your browser also requests `analytics.tracker.com` (third-party domain)

uBO Scope tracks and categorizes such third-party domains.

## Badge Count: What Does It Tell You?

The badge count displayed on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon represents the **number of distinct third-party domains that a browser tab has connected to**. This is a direct measure of how many unique remote servers a webpage is communicating with.

> A **lower badge count indicates fewer distinct third-party connections**, which generally corresponds to better privacy and less tracking.

Keep in mind:

- The badge counts unique third-party domains *per active tab*.
- It does not count individual requests but distinct domains.
- The count reflects both allowed and stealth-blocked requests (discussed below).

This count is more meaningful than raw block counts reported by ad blockers, helping you understand the exposure level of the current webpage.

## Understanding Status Categories: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth

uBO Scope categorizes network requests into three main outcomes based on their connection status.

### Allowed Requests

- These are connections that successfully reached third-party servers.
- Resources were loaded without interference by content blockers.
- These indicate the parties your browser is communicating with during the page load and interaction.
- This category is important for understanding which third parties are actually participating in content delivery.

### Blocked Requests

- These are network requests that failed due to active blocking by content filters or related security measures.
- Blocked requests prevent connections to specific third-party domains.
- Important to evaluate what your content blocker is preventing from loading.

### Stealth-Blocked Requests

- These represent requests that are blocked in a stealthy manner, making blocking less detectable by webpages.
- Often used to reduce detection by sites employing anti-adblock scripts.
- Stealth blocking still reduces unwanted network connections but does so in a way that minimizes webpage breakage or detection.

---

## Why Measuring Unique Outbound Connections Matters

Most users seek to keep their browsing private and free from unnecessary third-party tracking or resource loading. However, many content blockers report unreliable metrics based on mere block counts or test sites.

### uBO Scope’s approach:

- Counts **distinct third-party domains contacted**, not just requests blocked.
- Provides transparency into actual connections, whether allowed or blocked.
- Helps debunk myths based on skewed block numbers from unreliable benchmarks.

### Practical Benefits

- Identify exactly which third-party domains your browser communicates with on a per-tab basis.
- Assess the **effectiveness of content blockers** by comparing allowed vs. blocked domains.
- Detect unexpected or unwanted third-party connections.

## Key Terms at a Glance

| Term                 | Definition                                                                                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Third-party domain**| A domain distinct from the one in the address bar, contacted during page load or interaction.  |
| **Badge count**       | Number of unique third-party domains contacted in a browser tab, shown on the toolbar icon.    |
| **Allowed request**   | Network request that succeeded and resource loaded from a third-party domain.                  |
| **Blocked request**   | Network request that was actively prevented by content blocking.                               |
| **Stealth block**     | Requests blocked quietly to avoid detection by websites, without breaking the site’s behavior. |
| **Tab domain**        | The registered domain of the tab’s active webpage, used as the first-party reference.          |

## Practical User Scenario

Imagine you open a news site that loads resources from several ad networks and analytic services. With uBO Scope:

1. The badge shows the number of **distinct third-party servers** connected (e.g., 5).
2. The popup interface categorizes those domains as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
3. You can see if some trackers are silently blocked or still allowed.
4. This insight lets you verify if your content blockers are effective and understand your exposure.

This granular split provides actionable clarity beyond simple block counts.

---

## Tips to Make the Most of Core Concepts

- Use the badge count as a **privacy exposure meter per tab**.
- Review allowed vs. blocked domains in the popup to identify troublesome third parties.
- Understand that stealth blocking is a subtle form of protection not directly visible in other blockers.
- Avoid relying on simplistic “ad blocker test” sites for your blocker’s effectiveness; use uBO Scope’s real-world data.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Clarifications & Common Questions">
<Accordion title="Why might the badge count be zero but third-party domains appear in the popup?">
Sometimes stealth-blocked or blocked domains are visible in the popup but not counted in the badge. The badge reflects only allowed third-party domains, emphasizing active connections.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does uBO Scope differ from traditional ad blocker block counts?">
uBO Scope counts distinct third-party domains contacted, not raw block or request counts. This gives a more meaningful and privacy-centered metric of connections.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my browser doesn’t support webRequest API fully?">
uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API to detect network events. If the browser limits this API, uBO Scope cannot report all connections accurately.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can legitimate third-party servers inflate the badge count?">
Yes. CDNs, fonts, and analytics may appear as third parties. Lower counts are ideal, but some legitimate connections are normal. Focus on unknown or unnecessary domains.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
