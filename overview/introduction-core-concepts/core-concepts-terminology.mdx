# Core Concepts & Terminology

Welcome to the foundational page that equips you with essential terms and concepts for understanding uBO Scope's data insights. Knowing these terms will empower you to accurately interpret reports, evaluate network connections, and make informed decisions on web privacy.

## Understanding Key Terminology

uBO Scope monitors and reports remote server connection outcomes your browser encounters when loading web pages. To navigate its output confidently, here are the key terms you will encounter:

### Third-Party Remote Servers
A **third-party remote server** is any external domain or hostname contacted by your browser that is not the original site you're visiting. For example, if you visit `example.com`, and your browser loads content or makes requests to `cdn.example.net` or `analytics.tracker.com`, those are third parties.

> **Why it matters:** Third-party connections are the primary focus of uBO Scope since these often involve trackers, CDNs, advertising services, or other external resources.

### Allowed Requests
**Allowed** refers to third-party requests that successfully connect and load resources. These are network requests that were not blocked or interfered with, indicating the resource was fetched from a remote server.

> **User goal:** Understanding which third parties your browser successfully contacts helps evaluate privacy exposure and content dependencies.

### Blocked Requests
This term indicates third-party requests your browser attempted but were **blocked**, preventing the resource from loading. Blocking can be due to content blockers, DNS blocking, or network errors.

> **Tip:** A high block count doesn't necessarily mean better privacy unless it translates to fewer distinct third-party servers contacted.

### Stealth Requests (Stealth-Blocked)
**Stealth requests** are network requests that content blockers or privacy tools prevented *silently*, so they don’t appear in some metrics but are still tracked by uBO Scope. These are often attempts by websites or trackers to bypass detection.

> **Benefit:** uBO Scope uniquely reports stealth-blocked requests, offering transparency on hidden third-party activity that other tools may miss.

### Public Suffix & Registered Domain
To correctly identify and group third-party domains, uBO Scope uses the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) (PSL). This list defines domain suffixes like `.com`, `.co.uk`, or `.github.io` where registrations occur.

- The **public suffix** is the part of a domain under which Internet users can directly register names (e.g., `.com`, `.co.uk`).
- The **registered domain** is the portion immediately left of the public suffix that users have registered (e.g., `example.com`, `mysite.co.uk`).

> **How uBO Scope uses this:** To count distinct third-party servers accurately, it groups hosts by their registered domain, ensuring subdomains don’t inflate counts unnecessarily.

### Hostname vs Domain
- A **hostname** is a full label identifying a specific host (e.g., `images.example.com`).
- A **domain** refers specifically to the registered portion plus suffix (e.g., `example.com`).

uBO Scope tracks requests both by hostname and registered domain to give detailed insight and aggregated results.

## How These Terms Work Together

When you load a webpage, uBO Scope monitors all network requests:

1. **Detect Third Parties:** It identifies every third-party hostname contacted.
2. **Classify Requests:** Each request is classified as allowed, blocked, or stealth (hidden blocking).
3. **Aggregate Domains:** Hostnames are grouped by their registered domain from the Public Suffix List.
4. **Report Counts:** The popup UI and badge summarise the number of distinct third-party domains connected (allowed).

This holistic approach helps you discern not only which requests succeed or fail, but also the exact domains involved, enabling precise privacy evaluations.

## Real-World Example
Imagine visiting `news.example.com`:

- Your browser loads images from `images.cdnprovider.net` (allowed).
- It attempts analytics requests to `track.adnetwork.com` (stealth-blocked).
- It fails to load a video from `video.adsplatform.org` (blocked).

uBO Scope will show:

- **Allowed:** `cdnprovider.net` domain with count of requests.
- **Stealth:** `adnetwork.com` domain silently blocked.
- **Blocked:** `adsplatform.org` domain with blocked request counts.

This clear separation reveals both visible and hidden third-party activity.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Understand that a **lower badge number** (allowed) generally means fewer distinct third-party remote servers contacted, which often correlates with better privacy.
- Use the distinctions between allowed, blocked, and stealth to identify not just what was blocked, but what might be bypassing blockers silently.
- Familiarize yourself with domain groupings using the Public Suffix List to avoid confusion over multiple subdomains.
- Remember that stealth detection is unique to uBO Scope, giving you visibility unavailable in other browser tools.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions About Terminology">
<Accordion title="Why are some domains showing under 'stealth-blocked'?">
Stealth-blocked entries result from network requests silently blocked by content blockers trying to evade detection. These suggest attempts to circumvent normal blocking methods.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What’s the difference between hostname and domain in reports?">
Hostnames are the full subdomain names requested. Domains aggregate these by registered domain using the Public Suffix List to avoid multiple subdomain counts inflating totals.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is the badge number sometimes lower than the number of domains I see?">
The badge counts **allowed third-party domains only**—blocked and stealth-blocked domains are separately reported in the popup but don’t contribute to the badge number.
