# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the terminology used in uBO Scope is essential to effectively audit and interpret network connections initiated by your browser tabs. This page defines key terms—such as 'third-party connection', 'allowed', 'blocked', 'stealth', and 'badge count'—and explains their significance in the context of web privacy and transparency.

---

## What Is a Third-Party Connection?

A *third-party connection* occurs when a web page, loaded from one domain, initiates a network request to a different domain. For example, if you visit `example.com` and the page loads resources or makes network requests to `analytics-service.net`, that request is considered third-party. 

These third-party connections often involve content such as ads, trackers, or analytics scripts, and understanding them helps you assess the privacy impact of the websites you visit.

<u>Why it matters:</u> Not all third-party connections are harmful—content delivery networks (CDNs) and legitimate third parties are common. However, excessive or unknown third-party connections increase your exposure to tracking and privacy risks.

## Domain Statuses Explained

uBO Scope categorizes third-party domains based on the network request outcomes observed from your browser tabs. These categories help you grasp which connections are passing through, which are stopped, and which may be hidden by stealthy blocking techniques.

### Allowed

**Allowed** means the connection to the domain was successful and not blocked by any content blocking mechanism. 

- These are the domains your browser successfully communicated with to fetch resources.
- The badge count on the toolbar reflects the number of **distinct allowed third-party domains** per tab.

<Info>
A lower allowed count generally means fewer third-party connections, which is favorable from a privacy perspective.
</Info>

### Blocked

**Blocked** indicates that a request to the domain was attempted but was explicitly stopped by content blocking measures—such as uBO, DNS filters, or the browser itself.

- These domains represent connections that were prevented from transmitting data.
- Blocking reduces exposure to potentially unwanted or tracking domains.

<Warning>
Blocked doesn't necessarily mean the domain was malicious, only that its connection was prevented.
</Warning>

### Stealth

**Stealth** is a special category where blocking occurs in a way that is designed to be hidden or masked from the requesting web pages. 

- Some content blockers use stealth techniques to prevent detection by sites trying to circumvent blocking.
- Stealth blocking ensures the blocked domain is disguised, so the site believes the resource was fetched or behaves normally.

<Note>
Stealth blocking can prevent sites from detecting that requests were blocked, enhancing the reliability and compatibility of content blockers.
</Note>

## Badge Count: What Does It Represent?

The **badge count** displayed on uBO Scope's toolbar icon shows the **number of distinct allowed third-party domains connected to from the active tab**.

- **Not** the count of blocked or stealth domains.
- This metric highlights how many unique remote servers your browser is communicating with through the tab.

<Check>
A lower number means fewer third-party contacts, which typically improves privacy.
</Check>

The badge count helps debunk several myths:

- It challenges the misconception that a higher block count equals better blocking.
- It clarifies that the key is how many third-party connections are allowed — stealth or blocked domains do not increase privacy risk if effectively prevented.

## Why These Concepts Matter for You

By understanding these terms, you can better interpret uBO Scope's data, allowing you to:

- Accurately assess the number and types of third-party connections your browser tabs make.
- Distinguish between successful, blocked, and stealthily blocked requests.
- Gain transparency on your browsing activities and evaluate content blocker effectiveness based on domain exposure.
- Recognize that not all blocking activity is visible to websites, improving privacy without sacrificing site functionality.

---

## Practical Recommendations

- Use the badge count as your primary indicator of third-party exposure per tab.
- Investigate Allowed domains to understand potential privacy leaks or trusted CDNs.
- Note Blocked and Stealth domains to confirm your content blockers are actively protecting you.
- Remember stealth blocking exists to improve blocking stealthiness and site compatibility—it is a positive aspect.
