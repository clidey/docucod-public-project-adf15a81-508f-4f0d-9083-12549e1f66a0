# Core Concepts & Terminology

Welcome to the essential glossary for uBO Scope. This page defines the key terms and concepts you'll encounter throughout your experience with the extension, empowering you to confidently interpret the connection data and extension results.

## Understanding uBO Scope's Core Terms

uBO Scope focuses on shedding light on all network interactions your browser attempts, especially highlighting third-party remote servers and their connection outcomes. Knowing these terms helps you grasp what the extension reports and how to evaluate your browsing environment.

### Third-Party Remote Servers

In the context of uBO Scope, third-party remote servers are any external servers that your browser attempts to communicate with besides the domain of the page you are currently visiting. These often include content delivery networks (CDNs), advertising servers, analytics providers, and other service hosts.

<u>Why This Matters:</u> Monitoring third-party connections helps you understand which external entities receive data or content requests from your browser. Since a lower count of allowed third-party servers usually means a reduced exposure surface, this metric is critical for privacy-conscious users.

### Network Request Outcomes

Every network request triggered during your browsing session can result in one of several outcomes. uBO Scope categorizes these outcomes to give you a clear picture of what was allowed, blocked, or stealthily handled:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** The request was permitted and successfully reached the remote server.
- **Blocked:** The request was explicitly blocked by the content blocker or network policy.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** The request was handled in a stealthy manner—this means it was effectively blocked without alerting the originating webpage or leaving visible traces. This stealthing protects against detection by websites trying to bypass content blocking.

<u>How to Use This:</u> These distinctions enable you to differentiate between genuinely blocked connections and those that were stealthily suppressed, which is important to accurately measure the effectiveness of your blockers.

### Domain and Hostname

- **Hostname:** The full domain name extracted from a URL, including subdomains (e.g., `ads.tracker.example.com`).
- **Domain:** The registrable domain, determined using the public suffix list (e.g., `example.com`)—this represents the base entity owning the hostname.

uBO Scope leverages the public suffix list (PSL) to correctly identify domains. This matters because many hostnames may appear different but belong to the same domain, affecting how connections are grouped and counted.

### Domain Blocking, Allowance, and Stealth Behavior in the Extension

To effectively summarize network activity, uBO Scope tracks connections per domain and categorizes them according to outcome:

- **Allowed Domains:** Domains from which requests were allowed.
- **Blocked Domains:** Domains where the requests were blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains:** Domains where requests were stealthily blocked.

Each category contains counts of how many times requests were made to those domains during the session.

<u>Key Benefit:</u> This categorization simplifies identifying which third-party servers your browsing session interacts with and how they are treated by your content blocker.

## Behind the Scenes: How Terms Relate to Your Experience

### Interpreting the Popup Panel

When you open the uBO Scope popup, you see your current tab's connected domains sorted by request outcome:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Shows domains your browser successfully contacted.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Shows domains blocked without detection.
- **Blocked:** Shows domains blocked with explicit blocking.

Each domain entry is accompanied by a count indicating the number of requests made to that domain.

### What the Badge Count Means

The badge icon on your browser toolbar shows the number of distinct third-party remote domains for which connections were allowed in the active tab. This is a snapshot measure of your exposure to external entities when browsing that page.

<u>Remember:</u> A lower badge count signifies fewer distinct third-party connections were allowed, which often correlates with better privacy.

### How Domains Are Determined

uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List extensively to resolve hostnames to effective second-level domains or registrable domains. For example:

- `cdn.provider.example.com` and `ads.provider.example.com` share the domain `example.com`.
- This aggregation allows the extension to group related subdomains together, simplifying your view and making the badge count more meaningful.

It even handles internationalized domain names (IDNs) using Punycode conversion to make domain names human-readable.

## Practical Tips

- When you see a large number of allowed third-party domains, consider reviewing your content blocking rules or filter lists to reduce unnecessary data leakage.
- Domains listed under "Stealth-Blocked" indicate requests blocked so effectively that websites can't detect blocking, which helps prevent scripts from targeting your blockers.
- Use the domain counts to identify heavy third-party connections—these might point to trackers, CDNs, or services worth examining.
- Understanding domains vs. hostnames helps you spot when many different subdomains belong to the same domain, consolidating your privacy analysis.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Mistaking high block counts with better protection—focus instead on allowed distinct third-party domains.
- Overlooking stealth blocking results; they represent an important protection layer invisible to many "ad blocker test" sites.
- Confusing hostname with domain can lead to misunderstanding how many distinct third parties are actually contacted.
