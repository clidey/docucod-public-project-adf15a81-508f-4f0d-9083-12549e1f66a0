# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding uBO Scope starts with grasping several foundational concepts that explain how this extension interprets network activity and the key metrics you will see. This page guides you through terms like third-party remote servers, classification of request outcomes, stealth-blocking, and the meaning behind badge counts. These concepts empower you to make sense of uBO Scope's measurements, unlocking actionable insights into your browsing security and privacy.

## What Are Third-Party Remote Servers?

When you visit a webpage, it often loads resources not only from its own domain but also from other domains. These other domains are considered 'third-party remote servers.'

- **First-Party vs. Third-Party:**
  - The first-party is the domain of the website you are actively visiting.
  - Third-party remote servers are any domains outside this main domain that host resources such as ads, analytics, content delivery networks (CDNs), or widgets.

uBO Scope tracks connections to all these third-party remote servers to provide a realistic picture of what external domains your browser attempts to communicate with while browsing.

> **Why it matters:** Monitoring the number and identity of third-party servers helps you assess your exposure to potential privacy risks and resource loading origins.


## Allowed vs. Blocked Domains

uBO Scope categorizes network requests based on their outcome — whether the browser loads resources from them or blocks them. Understanding these distinctions is key to interpreting your browsing exposure.

- **Allowed Domains:**
  These are remote servers your browser successfully connected to and loaded content from. These represent the domains that ultimately served resources on the page.

- **Blocked Domains:**
  These domains had connection attempts, but the requests were blocked either by content blockers or network-level filtering. These domains represent prevented connections.

- **Stealth-Blocked Domains:**
  A subtle but critical category; these are servers for which connections are blocked so quietly that the webpage sees no indication of blocking. uBO Scope can uniquely detect these stealth-blocked requests by monitoring browser network APIs.


## Stealth Requests Explained

Content blockers sometimes use "stealth blocking" techniques to avoid webpages detecting that resources were blocked. This approach avoids webpage breakage or scripts detecting blocking activity, enhancing your browsing invisibility.

- **What are stealth requests?**
  Requests that were silently blocked without the webpage's knowledge.

- **How uBO Scope handles them:**
  While most blockers hide these stealth-blocked connections perfectly, uBO Scope’s transparent monitoring reveals the true extent of network filtering, listing stealth-blocked domains separately.


## Understanding the Badge Count

The uBO Scope toolbar icon displays a numeric badge. This number is not just a raw count of requests but a meaningful indicator of your browsing exposure.

- **What the badge counts:** The number represents *the distinct third-party remote servers that had any successful connection* with the active webpage.

- **Interpreting the badge:**
  - A **lower** badge number typically means fewer third-party exposures, often desirable for privacy.
  - A **higher** badge count indicates many external domains loaded resources, which might be a privacy concern.

- **Important clarifications:**
  - The badge count does *not* count every single resource request, but distinct domains.
  - The badge is not a blocker performance metric; a higher block count elsewhere does not necessarily mean better blocking.


## How uBO Scope Interprets Browser Network Activity

uBO Scope leverages the browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor all network requests that webpages attempt to make, including HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and secure WebSocket connections. It tracks whether these requests succeed, fail, or are redirected stealthily.

- **Request Life Cycle Tracking:**
  uBO Scope listens to key request events:
  - `onBeforeRedirect` — To detect redirects counted as stealth-blocked connections.
  - `onErrorOccurred` — To identify blocked or failed connection attempts.
  - `onResponseStarted` — To confirm successful connections.

- **Data Aggregation:**
  For each tab, uBO Scope categorizes each domain based on the request outcome and maintains counts of how many times each domain appeared.

- **Outcome grouping:**
  Results aggregate into three outcome groups: **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

<Tip>
Because uBO Scope operates at this network layer, it can report network activity regardless of which content blocker you use — or even if none is active. This makes it uniquely reliable for understanding your true exposure.

## Key Terms Summary

| Term                  | Meaning                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Third-Party Remote Server | Any domain outside the website's primary domain that the browser connects to           |
| Allowed Domain        | A domain from which the browser successfully loaded resources                            |
| Blocked Domain        | A domain whose connection attempts were denied, either by the browser or network level  |
| Stealth-Blocked Domain| A domain for which connection attempts were blocked silently, hiding the blocking action |
| Badge Count           | Number of unique third-party domains successfully connected per active tab              |


## Practical Example

Suppose you visit "example.com" and:

- uBO Scope reports a badge count of **5**.
- The popup shows:
  - Allowed: `cdn.example.net`, `analytics.example.io`
  - Stealth Blocked: `ads.tracker.com`
  - Blocked: `malicious.badsite.org`

This indicates that while your browser successfully connected to 5 different third-party domains (including `cdn.example.net` and `analytics.example.io`), some requests to trackers or malicious sites were blocked — some visibly and some stealthily.

<u>**Outcome:**</u> You gain a transparent, nuanced view of which external domains your browser actually connected to or blocked, empowering informed privacy control.


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Misinterpreting the badge as a content blocker score.** The badge reports connected servers, *not* block efficiency.
- **Assuming all blocked domains are bad.** Some might be harmless or essential third-party services you have explicitly allowed.
- **Ignoring stealth-blocked domains.** Their hidden nature may mask tracking attempts that some blockers do not fully block.
