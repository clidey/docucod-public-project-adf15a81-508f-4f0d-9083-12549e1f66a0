# Core Concepts & Terminology

## Understanding Key Terms and Metrics in uBO Scope

Welcome to the foundational guide that defines the essential language and ideas for effectively interpreting uBO Scope’s network insights. Before diving into using the extension or analyzing its results, a clear grasp of these core concepts ensures you decode the data with confidence and precision.

## What You'll Learn Here

- The meaning of **third-party remote servers** and why they matter
- The classification of network outcomes as **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth**
- The concept of **distinct domains** and their significance
- How uBO Scope presents its metrics for meaningful interpretation

## Why Core Concepts Matter

uBO Scope’s power lies in its transparency — showing you all attempted and successful connections your browser tries to make to third-party services. But with visibility comes complexity: not all connections are equal, and different outcomes reflect different behaviors of trackers, blockers, and web resources.

By mastering these key terms, you navigate the data seamlessly, avoid common misunderstandings, and extract actionable intelligence on your browsing footprint.

## Key Terminology Explained

### Third-Party Remote Servers
These are domains contacted by a webpage that are **different** from the website you are currently visiting. For instance, if you visit example.com, calls to adtracker.net or cdn.someprovider.com are considered third-party requests.

- **Why it matters:** Third-party connections often represent trackers, analytics, or embedded content outside the main site’s control.
- uBO Scope focuses on counting these to reveal the true scope of external communications.

### Allowed
Requests classified as **allowed** are network connections that succeeded with no interference from the content blocker or network-level filtering. These third-party connections completed successfully and contributed resources to the webpage.

- **User value:** Shows which third parties are actively receiving data or serving content.
- **Example:** Legitimate CDNs delivering images or scripts load as allowed domains.

### Blocked
The **blocked** category reports requests that were explicitly stopped, either by your content blocker or some other network filtering mechanism (such as DNS blocking).

- **User value:** Helps identify which third parties were prevented from loading.
- **Example:** Ads, trackers, or other unwanted domains stopped from connecting.

### Stealth
The **stealth** classification represents network activity that happened in a way intended to be hidden or less detectable by webpages or tools. This includes connections that have been redirected or otherwise manipulated to avoid detection.

- **User value:** Highlights subtle or covert network activity.
- **Example:** Stealth-blocking techniques by content blockers that prevent webpages from detecting the block.

### Distinct Domains
A critical concept for interpreting uBO Scope is the count of **distinct domains**, meaning the number of unique third-party domains contacted, independent of how many requests or resources came from each.

- **Why focus on distinct domains:** A lower count generally indicates a smaller tracking surface and fewer external parties involved.
- The toolbar badge count directly represents how many distinct third-party domains successfully connected.

## How uBO Scope Presents Metrics

uBO Scope visualizes connection outcomes split into these three classifications — allowed, blocked, and stealth — along with the count of distinct domains contacted in each category.

This clear vocabulary allows you to assess:

- Which domains are freely accessed by the webpage (allowed)
- Which are actively denied (blocked)
- Which are hidden from webpage detection via stealth blocking

This approach provides a comprehensive and objective view spanning any content blocker or DNS filtering you have enabled.

### In the Popup Panel

When you open uBO Scope’s popup, you instantly see:

- The **total number of distinct third-party domains connected to**
- Separate lists and counts of domains for each outcome category: not blocked (allowed), stealth-blocked, and blocked

This directly ties these terms to practical, observable results.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Always interpret the toolbar badge as the number of distinct **allowed** third-party domains — a critical privacy indicator.
- Understand that a **blocked** count does not always mean better protection; some blockers stealthily block connections (stealth) which also reduces your exposure.
- Use the domain lists to identify specific third parties interacting during browsing sessions.
- Recognize that some third-party connections (like legitimate CDNs) are generally harmless and expected.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Misreading block counts as total privacy:** Higher block counts do not always translate to better blocking if more unwanted third parties connect nonetheless.
- **Assuming stealth is the same as blocked:** Stealth connections are subtle and may still involve data exchanges, even if hidden from normal detection.
- **Ignoring the importance of distinct domains:** Counting the total number of connections is misleading; focus on unique domains to assess exposure.

## Summary

Mastering these core concepts equips you to:

- Confidently interpret uBO Scope’s network data
- Distinguish genuine third-party exposure from blocked or stealth activity
- Make informed decisions on privacy tools and content blockers
