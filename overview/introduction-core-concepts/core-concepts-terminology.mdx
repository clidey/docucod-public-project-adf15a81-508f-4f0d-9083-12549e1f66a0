# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the foundational terms and mechanics of uBO Scope is critical to effectively interpreting its data and insights. This section clarifies what constitutes third-party remote servers, the differences between types of network request outcomes including blocking and stealth blocking, how badge counts are determined, and the vital role of browser `webRequest` listeners in uBO Scope's operation.

---

## What Are Third-Party Remote Servers?

In the context of web browsing and uBO Scope, a _third-party remote server_ is any server domain that is distinct from the website domain you are visiting directly. 

> **Example:**
> 
> If you visit `example.com`, any network connection attempt from your browser to `cdn.example.com` is generally considered _first-party_, whereas connections to `analytics.thirdparty.com` or `ads.anotherdomain.net` are third-party since they belong to different domains.

uBO Scope tracks these distinct third-party domains because they often represent external service providers, trackers, advertising networks, or CDNs whose connection behavior has direct implications for privacy and page content.

---

## Blocking vs. Stealth Blocking

uBO Scope classifies network request outcomes into three main categories:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully completed or permitted by the browser and underlying content blockers.

- **Blocked:** Connections that were explicitly prevented, resulting in errors reported by the browser.

- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections which did not complete normally and were subject to a redirect or other network interference that conceals the blocking action. This category helpfully reveals stealthy blocking attempts that ordinary statistics might miss.

<u>Why the distinction matters:</u> While blocked requests show obvious denial of connection, stealth blocking represents the more subtle approach some content blockers take to evade detection or to minimize webpage breakage. uBO Scope exposes both to give you the full story.

---

## Badge Counts: Meaning and Interpretation

The badge count displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon represents the **number of distinct third-party domains with allowed (non-blocked) connections** for the active tab.

- This count is not a simple tally of all requests, but a unique count of third-party domains connected to.

- A *lower* count indicates fewer third-party domains connected, which generally implies better privacy protection or tighter content blocking.

- A *higher* count suggests more third-party domains allowed through, which can impact your privacy and browsing security.

> **Important Clarification:**
> 
> Do not interpret the badge count as a “block count.” The number represents allowed third-party domains, not the number of blocked requests.

This approach cuts through common misconceptions where block count numbers are mistakenly equated with blocking effectiveness.

## The Role of `webRequest` Listeners in uBO Scope

uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor all network requests initiated by pages.

- These listeners detect request states such as redirects, errors, and successful responses.

- uBO Scope listens regardless of which content blocker is functioning in the browser or even if none is active.

- It reports accurate information on whether connections were allowed, blocked, or stealth blocked, based on observable network events.

> **Note:**
> 
> Any connections outside the reach of the `webRequest` API (e.g., internal browser processes or protocols not exposing requests) will not be captured.

Because uBO Scope’s data depends on `webRequest` listeners, it is unbiased with respect to the filtering tools running in your browser and reflects the actual network activity you encounter.

---

## What Counts as a 'Distinct Connection'?

uBO Scope defines _distinct connections_ at the **domain** level rather than at the full hostname or individual request URL level.

- This means multiple requests to different subdomains (e.g., `img.cdn.example.com` and `api.cdn.example.com`) are considered separate if their registered domains differ.

- The extension identifies registered or registrable domains via a _Public Suffix List_ algorithm, ensuring accurate domain boundary detection even in complex cases (like country-code TLDs or multi-level TLDs).

> **Example:**
>
> Requests to `tracker.example.com` and `ads.otherdomain.com` count as two distinct third-party connections because their base domains are different.

This granularity helps you focus on the actual third-party domains involved in your browsing session, aligning with privacy-focused perspectives.

## Common Terminology Demystified

| Term                | Definition                                                                                          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **First-party**      | The domain of the site you are directly visiting (the main frame).                                 |
| **Third-party**      | Any domain distinct from the first-party domain that a page contacts.                             |
| **Allowed**          | Network requests that completed successfully without intervention.                                 |
| **Blocked**          | Requests explicitly prevented, resulting in a network error.                                      |
| **Stealth-blocked**  | Connections blocked via redirects or interference designed to mask blocking.                      |
| **Badge Count**      | The count of distinct allowed third-party domains currently connected by the active tab.          |
| **`webRequest` API** | Browser API that reports on network request lifecycle events, used to detect request outcomes.    |
| **Public Suffix List** | A comprehensive registry of domain suffixes used to accurately extract the main domain segment.    |

## Practical Scenario: Making Sense of the Popup Data

Imagine you open uBO Scope’s popup for a webpage you just visited. Here’s how these concepts help you interpret the data:

1. The header shows the current page’s hostname and domain.

2. Domains listed under “not blocked” are third-party domains your browser connected to successfully.

3. “Stealth-blocked” domains are those where connections were intercepted more subtly — these might indicate advanced blocking methods.

4. “Blocked” domains are those outright denied.

5. The summary shows the number of distinct not blocked domains, matching the badge count on the toolbar.

This categorization lets you quickly grasp your browsing exposure and the effectiveness of your blocking setup.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Don’t equate block counts with blocking quality.** Use domains connected (badge count) as your main indicator.

- **Check stealth-blocked domains** to detect hidden blocking behavior which might not be obvious otherwise.

- **Remember that some third-party connections are legitimate** (e.g., CDNs) and keeping their count low is the goal, not zero.

- **Understand that `webRequest` reliance means some requests may be invisible.** uBO Scope shows as complete a view as the browser allows.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Network Request Outcomes">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count sometimes not match expectations?">
The badge count is based on distinct third-party <em>domains</em> connected, not individual requests or total traffic. If a domain hosts many resources, it counts only once. Concealed or redirected requests may also affect counts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What causes a domain to appear in stealth-blocked but not blocked?">
Stealth blocking involves network behavior such as redirects or suppressed errors designed to avoid detection. It might reflect content blockers aiming for silent blocking without page breakage.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are first-party connections shown in the popup?">
No. uBO Scope focuses on third-party domains. The first-party domain is shown as the main header but only third-party domains appear in allowed/blocked/stealth lists.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do I see more allowed domains with some blockers?">
A higher allowed count can mean your blocker allows more third-party domains. More blocked requests don’t always relate to stricter privacy but can indicate less effective blocking strategies.
