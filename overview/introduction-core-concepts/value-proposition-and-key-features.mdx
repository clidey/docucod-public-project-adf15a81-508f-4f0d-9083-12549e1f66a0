# Product Value Proposition & Key Features

## Unlock the True Picture of Outbound Connections with uBO Scope

uBO Scope empowers you to see through the noise of raw block counts and reveals the actual number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connects to. Designed as a transparent companion tool, it helps you understand the effectiveness of your content blockers by visualizing each connection’s fate — whether allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked — directly per browser tab.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You
- **Clarity Over Block Counts:** Break free from misleading badge counts by focusing on unique third-party servers, not just blocked request totals.
- **Per-Tab Granularity:** Investigate each browser tab’s outbound connections in isolation, enabling precise analysis.
- **Outcome Categorization:** Easily distinguish whether connections were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- **Reliable Badge Count:** Toolbar badge shows the count of distinct third-party domains contacted, giving you a meaningful privacy metric.
- **Vendor-Agnostic Tracking:** Measures all network requests regardless of which content blocker or DNS-based blocker is active.

### Who Benefits Most
Users who want to truly understand their network exposure, verify content blocker effectiveness, troubleshoot unwanted connections, or maintain filter lists will find uBO Scope indispensable.

## What Is This Page?

This page distills the core business value and highlights uBO Scope’s essential features. By focusing on the user-visible value and capabilities, it bridges the understanding from the product’s mission to practical execution via the popup interface.

## Key Features & Benefits

### 1. Visualize Unique Outbound Connections
Unlike traditional content blockers that report raw block counts, uBO Scope presents the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connects to. This distinction helps users avoid incomplete or misleading interpretations of protection effectiveness.

**Example:** Instead of seeing "100 blocks" which might be hiding connections to 50 different remote servers, uBO Scope shows you the real number of servers communicating.

### 2. Per-Tab Connection Monitoring
Network requests are scoped by active browser tabs, allowing focused inspections.

**Benefit:** Instantly assess which tabs cause external connections and analyze their network behavior separately.

### 3. Outcome Categorization: Allowed, Blocked, Stealth-Blocked
The extension classifies requests into three outcomes:
- **Allowed:** Requests that successfully reached third-party servers.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests hidden by content blockers, not directly reported to the webpage.

This triage clarifies the nature of each request and the content blocker’s behavior.

### 4. Toolbar Badge Count Reflects Distinct Remote Domains
The badge number on the toolbar icon does not show total requests but counts unique third-party domains contacted, giving a strong indicator of privacy exposure.

### 5. Vendor-Agnostic Network Request Measurement
uBO Scope listens to the browser's `webRequest` API and works in tandem with any content blocker or DNS filtering method, providing a unified view of outbound traffic regardless of the underlying blocking technology.

**Consequence:** You get a consistent, reliable picture of connections irrespective of your chosen protection stack.

### Practical Use Case
Imagine opening a news website with aggressive tracking scripts. With uBO Scope, you can instantly see in the extension popup how many distinct third-party domains your browser talks to from that tab, whether your blocker allowed or blocked requests, and whether stealth blocking is occurring. This empowers you to make informed adjustments to your filters or recognize when block counts alone are insufficient as a protection metric.

## Why Should I Care?

### Get Accurate Visibility Into Connections
Many content blockers only display the number of resource blocks, which can mislead you. uBO Scope’s focus on actual remote domains contacted is a more meaningful privacy indicator.

### Debunk Misconceptions About Content Blocking
uBO Scope debunks false beliefs such as "more blocks equal better protection" and exposes stealth behaviors that might otherwise evade your notice.

### Enhance Control & Trust
Whether you are a privacy advocate, filter list maintainer, or an inquisitive user, this extension helps build trust by returning clear, honest metrics about your browsing footprint.

### Real-World Impact
- **Before:** You rely on block counts and ad blocker test sites, which can provide skewed or fabricated information.
- **After:** You see actual remote connections per tab, with truthful information about allowed and blocked requests, helping you build confidence in your setup.

## Getting Started Preview

Upon installation and activation, accessing uBO Scope’s popup presents the per-tab connection summary:

- Displayed hostname and domain of the active tab.
- Count of connected third-party domains.
- Categorized lists of domains by outcome.

To dive deeper, see the [Getting Started](/getting-started/using-extension/first-usage) guide for steps on interpreting these insights.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope regularly to monitor new tabs and websites you visit.
- Leverage outcome categorization to identify stealth trackers your blockers might hide.
- Treat the badge count as your primary privacy health metric – lower is better.
- Analyze which tabs cause unexpected or suspicious external connections, and consider adjusting filters.

<Note>
Remember: Not all third-party domains are harmful. Legitimate CDNs or services can contribute to a lower number of distinct domains.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- **No data shown in popup:** Ensure the active tab is properly initialized and your browser supports `webRequest` events.
- **Badge count seems inconsistent:** This reflects distinct domains contacted, not block counts; verify with the popup display.
- **Stealth-blocked section empty:** The blocker in use might not employ stealth blocking techniques.

Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Problems](/getting-started/using-extension/common-issues) page for detailed resolutions.
