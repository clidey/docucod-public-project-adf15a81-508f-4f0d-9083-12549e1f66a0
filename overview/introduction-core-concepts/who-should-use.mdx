# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is designed with a focused audience in mind—users and maintainers who care deeply about understanding the remote server connections web pages make. This page explicitly identifies the key audiences for uBO Scope and presents typical use cases, helping you quickly see how this tool can benefit your privacy, filtering efforts, or general curiosity.

## Key Audiences

### Privacy-Conscious Users
If you want to know exactly which third-party servers your web browser connects to when loading a webpage, uBO Scope offers transparent, accurate insights. Beyond what most content blockers display, it reveals connections even if they are stealthily blocked or affected by DNS-level blocking. By showing the true network activity of any page you visit:

- You can validate whether your content blocker actually protects you well.
- You get insight into hidden or unexpected connections that could compromise your privacy.
- You gauge third-party exposure, helping you make informed decisions about which sites to trust and which extensions or settings to adjust.

### Filter List Maintainers
Maintaining filter lists that block trackers, ads, or malicious servers demands accurate measurement tools. uBO Scope is invaluable in this context because:

- It provides a low-level view of *all* network request outcomes—allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked—regardless of blocking techniques.
- It helps identify which third-party domains are actually being contacted, not just which requests are intercepted.
- It offers a reliable way to verify filter effectiveness on diverse devices, including those where native browser developer tools or extension debugging might be limited or unavailable.

### Curious Users and Researchers
Anyone curious about web behavior, network connections, or how extensions control or fail to control content can use uBO Scope for investigation and learning. Seeing a real-time, accurate snapshot of network requests enables:

- Exploration of how modern webpages interact with third parties.
- Understanding of content blocker behaviors beyond superficial block counts.
- Confirmation or debunking of common myths around ad blocking effectiveness.

## Typical Use Cases

### Validating Content Blocker Effectiveness
Imagine you’ve installed your favorite blocker and want to ensure it actually prevents unwanted third-party connections. Using uBO Scope, you can:

- Load any webpage and open uBO Scope’s popup to see a categorized summary of all connected domains.
- Compare what’s allowed versus blocked, including connections stealthily blocked behind the scenes.
- See the accurate count of distinct remote hosts your browser connected to, which is the true measure of exposure.

This direct visibility exposes situations where a blocker with a high block count may *still* allow many third-party connections, helping you choose better tools or settings.

### Monitoring Third-Party Network Exposure
When privacy matters, knowing exactly which external servers your browsing touches is critical. uBO Scope makes it straightforward to:

- Identify third-party domains contacted when visiting any page, not just popular or tracker domains.
- Detect unexpected or stealth activity that might bypass your current blocking strategy.
- Audit your typical browsing patterns to understand and reduce potential data leakage.

### Filter List Verification and Development
If you build or maintain filter lists, you can leverage uBO Scope to:

- Test filter rules by directly viewing network request results per page visit.
- Validate that stealth blocking and error blocking behave as expected across scenarios.
- Use uBO Scope as a minimal and reliable extension where other tools or browser devtools are unavailable.

## Before and After: What Changes with uBO Scope?

| Scenario | Without uBO Scope | With uBO Scope |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Checking third-party connections | Relies on incomplete or indirect signals | Gets a full, transparent view of all requests and their outcomes
| Evaluating blocker performance | Based on block counts or unreliable webpages
| Understanding stealth-blocked requests | Opaque or guesswork | Clear categorization and counts

This improves your confidence and control over your online privacy and browsing security.

## Practical Tips

- Use uBO Scope alongside your regular content blockers to get a reality check on network traffic.
- Frequently check sites you trust and those you don’t, to compare hidden third-party activity.
- Filter list maintainers should consider uBO Scope an essential companion to measure and refine efforts.
