# Product Value and Benefits

## Unlocking True Network Transparency with uBO Scope

When using browser extensions related to privacy and security, knowing what is actually happening behind the scenes on your network is critical. The **uBO Scope** extension delivers this clarity by revealing every unique connection to third-party remote servers your browser attempts or succeeds to establish.

Unlike traditional content blockers or ad blockers that only count blocked requests or rely on simplified heuristics, uBO Scope focuses on revealing **the reality of network activity** as your browser experiences it.

### Why Choose uBO Scope?

- **Accurate Counting of Distinct Third-Party Connections**: The badge on the toolbar icon reflects the number of *distinct third-party domains* your browser is connected to — a crucial metric for true privacy awareness.

- **Bypasses Misleading Metrics**: Unlike block count badges in content blockers, uBO Scope's counts cannot be gamed by filter list complexity or artificial block/remove methods.

- **Works Independently of Content Blocking Methods**: Whether your browser blocks content via extensions, DNS-level blocking, or stealth techniques, uBO Scope reports the actual network requests observed through the browser’s `webRequest` API.

- **Debunks Common Myths**: It clearly exposes misunderstandings around block counts and fake "ad blocker test" pages, providing you with truthful insight.

- **Supports Filter List Maintainers**: Provides a valuable tool to verify how many and which third-party connections actually occur, especially on devices with limited browser inspection tools.

## What Makes uBO Scope Indispensable?

Traditional content blockers use badge counts based on block events, which can mislead users:

- A higher block count often sounds better but can indicate that resources are still loaded from *more* third-party domains, thus potentially decreasing privacy.
- "Ad blocker test" websites create unrealistic traffic and cannot truly validate real-world extension effectiveness.

uBO Scope flips this approach by telling you **how many unique third-party remote servers your browser truly connects to in real time**, independent of the blocking approach in use. This honest view empowers you to:

- Understand your browsing footprint more accurately.
- Choose content blockers and filter lists based on actual network efficacy.
- Detect if stealth blocking techniques are hiding connections.
- Gauge the minimal third-party presence, typically represented by a few legitimate CDNs.

## Real-World Examples

Imagine browsing a news site. uBO Scope reveals:

- How many and which third-party domains your browser connects to.
- Differentiates between requests that were allowed (shown under "not blocked"), stealth blocked (blocked after redirection), or fully blocked.

This information helps you see past the noise of block counts or misleading tests and get to what really matters:

Are you connecting to fewer third parties? Are some connections being hidden by stealth blocking? uBO Scope answers these questions clearly.


## Common Misconceptions and Myths

### Myth: "More blocks mean better protection"

uBO Scope reveals that a high block count badge can mean a browser still fetches resources from numerous third-party domains, often defeating the purpose of blocking. The key indicator is distinct allowed connections, not the count of blocked requests.

### Myth: "Ad blocker test pages provide trustworthy benchmarks"

These test pages simulate unrealistic scenarios and rely on detectable patterns, failing to test how stealthy or effective a blocker really is. uBO Scope goes beyond these tests to show actual network behavior.

## The Trustworthy Badge Summary

The toolbar badge count is much more than a number; it is a **trustworthy summary** of your third-party network exposure. It provides an *objective* measurement of how many remote servers your browser interacted with during your web session, allowing you to assess the real privacy impact instantly.


## Best Practices for Users

- Use uBO Scope in conjunction with your favorite content blocker to measure true third-party connection counts.
- Avoid judging blockers solely by block counts or "ad blocker test" results.
- Regularly monitor your third-party connection badge to understand your browsing privacy footprint.
- Employ uBO Scope for debugging or filter list development, especially on platforms where advanced developer tools might be unavailable.
