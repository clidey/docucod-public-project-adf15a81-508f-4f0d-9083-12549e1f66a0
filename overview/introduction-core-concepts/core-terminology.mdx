# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the fundamental terms and concepts used by uBO Scope is essential to interpreting its user interface and making informed decisions about your browser's privacy and security. This page defines key terms like **third-party remote servers**, **network request outcomes**, and the categories of blocking behaviors — namely **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth** — that influence how your browsing data is reported and displayed.

---

## What Are Third-Party Remote Servers?

In the context of uBO Scope, a **third-party remote server** means any remote server hosting a domain different from the one of the website you are currently visiting (the first-party).

<div>
Imagine you visit `example.com`. Every network request your browser makes to `example.com` is considered **first-party**. However, if your browser loads resources from domains like `cdn-images.com` or `analytics.net`, these are **third-party remote servers** because they are separate entities external to `example.com`.
</div>

### Why Third-Party Remote Servers Matter

Third-party connections often involve trackers, ad providers, or external content delivery networks (CDNs). Monitoring these connections helps you understand how many different external domains engage with your browsing session, which is crucial for privacy evaluation.

---

## Network Request Outcomes Explained

uBO Scope tracks **network requests** — attempts your browser makes to load resources — and classifies their outcome into three types:

- **Allowed:** Network requests that completed successfully without being blocked.
- **Blocked:** Network requests that failed due to blocking by your browser extensions, settings, or other network restrictions.
- **Stealth:** Requests intercepted in a way that they do not appear as blocked but are effectively prevented or redirected, often used by content blockers to minimize webpage breakage or detection.

This classification enables you to see beyond just visible blocks and understand the true behavior of your browser and its content blockers.

---

## Understanding the Categories: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth

| Category | Description | User Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Allowed** | Third-party remote servers your browser successfully connected to and loaded resources from. | Represents the actual exposure to external domains. A lower count reflects fewer third-party connections. |
| **Blocked** | Third-party remote servers where network requests were explicitly blocked, preventing connection or loading. | Shows which domains were prevented from loading resources, reflecting direct blocking actions. |
| **Stealth** | Third-party remote servers where connections were blocked or redirected subtly, without obvious failure. | Helps avoid webpage breakage or detection by silently handling network requests. |

### How These Impact Your Browsing

- **Allowed** domains indicate external entities your browser actually communicated with. Minimizing this number is key to reducing your exposure online.
- **Blocked** domains reflect active intervention preventing requests from completing.
- **Stealth-blocked** domains indicate sophisticated blocking that maintains webpage integrity while enhancing privacy.

## How Core Concepts Shape uBO Scope's UI and Badges

### Toolbar Badge Count

The badge on the uBO Scope icon shows a count of **distinct third-party remote servers** that your browser connected to in the current tab — specifically, the count of domains in the **allowed** category.

> **Important:** A lower badge count is generally better, indicating fewer distinct external third-party connections.

### Domain Groupings

Within the extension’s popup panel, domains are grouped under three sections:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains your browser successfully connected to.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains for which connections were stealthily blocked or redirected.
- **Blocked:** Domains whose requests were explicitly blocked.

This grouping provides a transparent snapshot of your tab’s network activity, helping you analyze privacy exposure and blocker effectiveness.

---

## Making Sense of Domain and Hostname Terminology

uBO Scope distinguishes between **hostnames** and **domains** based on established public suffix rules (via Mozilla's Public Suffix List):

- **Hostname:** The full name used in a URL (e.g., `sub.example.com`).
- **Domain:** The registrable domain part excluding public suffixes (e.g., `example.com` rather than `sub.example.com`).

Using the Public Suffix List ensures accurate grouping and counting of third-party connections by domain rather than potentially inflated counts from subdomains.

### Example

| URL                          | Hostname         | Domain      |
|------------------------------|------------------|-------------|
| https://shop.example.com     | shop.example.com | example.com |
| https://cdn.example.com      | cdn.example.com  | example.com |

This distinction prevents overcounting third parties by consolidating subdomain requests under their registered domain.

## Common User Scenarios With These Terms

### Scenario 1: Interpreting a High Badge Count

If you see a high number on the toolbar badge, it means many distinct third-party domains were contacted. This highlights the scope of external connections your browser made, signaling potential privacy concerns.

### Scenario 2: Spotting Suspicious Domains

Blocked and stealth-blocked sections help identify domains your content blocker intercepted. Frequent connections to the same domains appearing in these sections can inform finer blocking or whitelist decisions.

### Scenario 3: Understanding Why a Domain Is Counted

Domains appear in the allowed list because your browser successfully retrieved resources, possibly cached or not blocked by filters. This clarifies that a domain counted here was actually involved in your browsing session.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Focus on the Allowed list** to gauge true exposure to third-party servers.
- **Review the Blocked and Stealth lists** to assess how effectively your content blocker is operating.
- Understand that **stealth blocking** is a subtle form of intervention designed to minimize website breakage.
- Use uBO Scope to identify domains you hadn’t expected to connect to and evaluate if they align with your privacy preferences.

## Troubleshooting Common Misinterpretations

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Confusions">
<Accordion title="Why does the Badge Count sometimes not match blocked domains?">
The badge count represents only the distinct third-party domains that were actually allowed to connect, not the domains blocked. A high blocked count can coincide with a high or low badge depending on which allowed domains remain.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if known trackers appear in the allowed list?">
Some legitimate CDNs or essential third-party domains might appear in the allowed list. Consider carefully before blocking domains to avoid breaking websites.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How to understand 'stealth' blocking?">
Stealth blocking prevents requests without obvious failures, preserving site functionality. A stealth-blocked domain is effectively prevented without telling the website it was blocked.
</Accordion>
