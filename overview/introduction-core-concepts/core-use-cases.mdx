## Understanding the Value of uBO Scope

Every website interacts with multiple servers during your browsing session. Some connect directly from the site you visit, while others are third parties providing essential or ancillary content. uBO Scope shines by shedding light on these remote connections, giving you clarity and control over your online exposure.

Unlike traditional content blockers that focus mainly on blocking or filtering requests, uBO Scope measures and reports all remote connections made or attempted by webpages—whether blocked or allowed. This unique perspective enables you to understand the *real* network landscape behind your browsing experience.

## Who Benefits Most from uBO Scope?

### 1. Privacy-Aware Users Concerned About Third-Party Tracking

- **What you want:** To see exactly how many and which third-party servers your browser interacts with while browsing.
- **How uBO Scope helps:** It reports the number of distinct third-party domains involved, helping you spot excessive or unexpected trackers.
- **Why it matters:** A lower badge count means fewer third parties your browser talks to, indicating reduced potential for unwanted tracking.

<u>Example scenario:</u>
> You're cautious about privacy and want to detect hidden trackers embedded in websites. uBO Scope reveals if a site loads numerous third-party servers beyond the first-party domain, pointing out tracking risks beyond what your content blocker might say.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers & Content Blocking Experts

- **What you want:** Reliable insights into which network requests your filters allow or block in *practice* across real-world browsing.
- **How uBO Scope helps:** By recording outcomes of network requests—allowed, stealth-blocked (requests invisibly redirected or obfuscated), or fully blocked—it provides data essential to verify and improve filter lists.
- **Why it matters:** It prevents misleading conclusions drawn simply from block counts and enables more precise tuning of filtering behavior.

<u>Example scenario:</u>
> You maintain a filter subscription aiming to block tracking without breaking sites. uBO Scope’s detailed connection data helps you identify requests that bypass or evade your filters, improving your list’s accuracy.

### 3. Web Developers and Network Security Analysts

- **What you want:** A detailed view of dynamic network activity initiated by web pages.
- **How uBO Scope helps:** It exposes connection attempts—including successes, redirects, or failures—across all third-party domains.
- **Why it matters:** This visibility aids in diagnosing problems, understanding resource dependencies, and ensuring secure connections.

<u>Example scenario:</u>
> During troubleshooting or security audits, you use uBO Scope to verify all remote calls made by your application are intentional and properly handled, quickly spotting unexpected external connections.

### 4. Anyone Comparing Content Blockers

- **What you want:** A trustworthy way to evaluate content blockers without relying on misleading block count badges.
- **How uBO Scope helps:** It focuses instead on the number of distinct servers actually connected to, which reflects the real-world effectiveness of blockers.
- **Why it matters:** Higher block counts don't necessarily mean better blocking — uBO Scope clarifies true exposure.

<u>Example scenario:</u>
> You’re testing two content blockers and want to know which truly limits third-party connections. uBO Scope shows that a blocker with a higher block count might still allow connections to more unique trackers.

## What Makes uBO Scope Different?

- **Holistic connection measurement:** It reports attempted and successful network connections, not just blocks.
- **Works irrespective of content blocking method:** Whether blocking happens at DNS, extension, or system level, uBO Scope captures what the browser reports.
- **Focus on distinct third-party domains:** Prioritizes real-world network exposure over just raw request counts.

## Common Usage Workflow

1. **Install uBO Scope** in your preferred compatible browser.
2. **Browse websites as usual.** uBO Scope silently monitors all network requests in the background.
3. **Observe the badge count:** It reflects the number of distinct third-party domains your current tab touches.
4. **Open the popup panel:** See the categorized list of domains — not blocked, stealth-blocked, and fully blocked — along with counts to understand connection outcomes.
5. **Use insights to adjust your content blocker or privacy settings** for tighter control.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Remember that not all third parties are harmful; some, like CDNs, are essential for site function.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your existing blockers to gain transparency rather than replacing them.
- Regularly check connection counts across different sites to spot unusual spikes that may indicate tracking or malware.
- For filter list maintainers, leverage the detailed breakdown to prioritize improvements.

---

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

- Do not rely solely on block counts from content blockers — use connection counts from uBO Scope for accuracy.
- Avoid using "ad blocker test" websites as benchmarks; they often trigger unrealistic request behaviors.
- Understand that uBO Scope depends on browser’s `webRequest` API availability — network requests outside its scope won’t be reported.
