# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlocking Full Transparency into Your Browser's Network Connections

uBO Scope is a powerful companion extension to uBlock Origin designed to give you unparalleled insight into every network connection initiated by your browser tabs. It transparently reveals all third-party connections—whether they are allowed, stealthily blocked, or explicitly blocked—providing you with critical visibility regardless of which content blockers you use.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You

Every modern webpage loads resources from many external servers, often without your explicit knowledge. While content blockers limit unwanted tracking or ads, it's hard to verify exactly which connections are made behind the scenes. uBO Scope bridges that gap by making these connections visible and auditable, empowering you to make informed decisions about privacy and trust.

### Key Benefits at a Glance

- **Complete Network Transparency:** View all third-party server connections initiated by your active browser tab, including those hidden from other blockers.
- **Blocker-Independent Reporting:** Works regardless of which content blocker, DNS filtering, or blocking method is in place by leveraging the browser's own `webRequest` API.
- **Actionable Insight:** Understand which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or actively blocked, helping you fine-tune your privacy tools.
- **Simple, Intuitive Interface:** Quickly scan summarized connection counts and detailed domain lists through a lightweight popup UI.

### Who is uBO Scope For?

- Privacy-conscious users who want transparency beyond standard content blockers.
- Filter list maintainers needing accurate reports on third-party network activity.
- Developers and security professionals auditing network requests on webpages.

## What Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension that listens to all network requests from your browser tabs and reports their outcomes. It tracks which third-party servers your current tab is communicating with, categorizing connections as allowed, stealth-blocked (blocked silently, invisible to the webpage), or blocked.

Unlike traditional blockers, uBO Scope does not block connections itself—it acts as a transparent observer. This makes it an invaluable auditing tool to verify what is truly happening at the network level as you browse.

### The Problem it Solves

Webpages often load elements from numerous external domains, including advertising networks, trackers, content delivery networks (CDNs), and analytics services. Existing blockers may hide or obscure some of these activities, especially stealth blocking performed to evade website breakage or detection. Users have limited visibility into these hidden connections.

uBO Scope provides an accurate picture of all network connections initiated by your browser tab, enabling better trust and privacy decisions.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique

- It reports network outcomes independently of any content blocking rules.
- Detailed domain-level reporting distinguishes between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.
- Displays real-time badge counts reflecting distinct third-party domains connected.
- Helps debunk common misconceptions about blocker effectiveness, making it a reliable measuring standard.

## How uBO Scope Works: A High-Level Overview

uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API, intercepting and analyzing all outgoing network requests every tab makes. It categorizes network requests based on their status:

- **Allowed:** Requests that completed successfully.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests blocked in a way that the webpage is unaware of.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly denied or that errored out.

The extension then aggregates these outcomes by domain and hostname, maintaining a live summary per active tab.

When you open the uBO Scope popup for the current tab, it visually presents these categorized domains with connection counts, allowing you to audit third-party network activity effectively.

## Real-World Example

Imagine you're visiting a news website. Even though you use a content blocker, the site may still connect to various CDNs and analytics servers silently. uBO Scope will show:

- **Allowed domains** like your CDN provider delivering images.
- **Stealth-blocked domains** representing trackers quietly blocked by your filters.
- **Blocked domains** you explicitly blocked or which failed to connect.

With this transparent view, you can better understand which external parties your browser communicates with, validating the effectiveness of your blocker setup.

## Next Steps

To get started with uBO Scope:

- See the [Installing and Enabling uBO Scope](../guides/getting-started/installation.md) guide for installation steps.
- Explore [Your First Network Scan](../guides/getting-started/first-run.md) to perform your initial audit.
- Dive into the [Understanding the Popup UI](../guides/getting-started/ui-overview.md) to interpret connection results.

By combining uBO Scope with your existing content blocker, you gain unparalleled transparency into your browsing network connections, empowering you to protect your privacy with confidence.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

<Tip>
For the most accurate results, ensure your browser supports `webRequest` for all connection types and that uBO Scope has necessary permissions.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Network requests made outside of the `webRequest` API scope (e.g., certain browser internals or native apps) cannot be monitored by uBO Scope.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Use the badge count on the toolbar icon as a quick indicator: lower distinct third-party connection counts generally indicate a cleaner browsing experience.
</Tip>

<Note>
Remember, not all third parties are harmful—many legitimate websites rely on CDNs and analytics for performance and service delivery.
