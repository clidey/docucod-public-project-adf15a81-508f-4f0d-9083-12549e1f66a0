# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Remote Connection in Your Browser

uBO Scope is a powerful companion extension designed to transparently reveal all remote server connections initiated by the web pages you visit. Unlike typical content blockers that focus solely on blocking, uBO Scope provides you with a clear, detailed view of *every* network interaction—whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked—irrespective of which content blocker you use.

### Why uBO Scope Matters
- **Total Transparency:** See every distinct third-party remote server your browser connects to.
- **Universal Compatibility:** Works alongside any content blocker by leveraging the browser's own `webRequest` API.
- **Insightful Outcomes:** Classifies every connection into allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked categories for easy understanding.
- **Privacy Awareness:** Helps users identify unwanted network connections that may compromise privacy.
- **Myth-Busting Tool:** Debunks common misconceptions about content blocker effectiveness by focusing on server connection counts rather than block counts.

### Intended Users
- Privacy-conscious web users seeking clarity on which third-party servers their browser communicates with.
- Developers and security enthusiasts interested in monitoring network activity.
- Filter list maintainers needing reliable data on content blocking and connections.

## What is uBO Scope?

### An Extension That Measures Network Traffic at Its Core

uBO Scope is a browser extension that continuously monitors all network requests made by web pages. Unlike standard content blockers focused on preventing certain requests, uBO Scope captures and categorizes *all* connections made to third-party servers. It surfaces this data into an accessible popup interface paired with an icon badge that reflects the current active tab's distinct third-party connections.

### Addressing a Critical Visibility Gap

Web users typically lack detailed insight into the calls their browser initiates behind the scenes. Content blockers often indicate how many requests were blocked, but they don’t convey the full story of what connections actually occurred or were stealthily blocked. uBO Scope fills this void by reporting the network request outcomes accurately, regardless of the blocking method involved — including DNS-based or stealth blocking.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique

- **Content-Blocker Agnostic:** It captures data independently, showing connections allowed by your content blocker as well as those stealth-blocked or explicitly blocked.
- **Domain-Level Aggregation:** Groups connections by registered domain names for simplicity and clarity.
- **First-Party vs Third-Party Insight:** Distinguishes first-party page connections from third-party server interactions.
- **Minimalistic and Purpose-Driven:** Focuses purely on connection reporting without overloading you with excessive details.

## How uBO Scope Works

uBO Scope uses the browser's `webRequest` API to listen for network request events:

- **Success:** Requests successfully completed.
- **Redirect:** Requests that are transparently redirected.
- **Error:** Requests blocked or failed to complete.

It records these outcomes along with the hostnames involved, mapping and counting occurrences by domain. This information is stored in a session-level data structure, updated live as you browse.

When you open the extension popup, this data is summarized and rendered:

- The current page’s full hostname and primary domain are displayed prominently.
- Three categorized sections present the domains connected:
  - **Not Blocked:** Connections allowed by your content blocker or browser.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections silently intercepted or redirected by blocking techniques.
  - **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked and failed.

The popup provides counts for each domain to help you understand the frequency of connections.

## Example: Viewing uBO Scope in Action

1. **Open a browser tab** with a website.
2. **Click the uBO Scope icon** in the toolbar to open the popup.
3. The popup shows:
   - The website's hostname at the top.
   - The total number of distinct third-party domains connected.
   - Detailed lists of domains grouped into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked.

This immediate feedback reveals how many external entities your browsing activity touches, empowering you to make informed privacy decisions.

## Practical Benefits

### Clear, Actionable Insights
uBO Scope transcends generic blocker statistics by focusing on the vital measure of *distinct third-party domains connected*. This dimension matters most for assessing privacy exposure — fewer distinct third-party connections typically imply less tracking and better privacy.

### Use Cases Where uBO Scope Excels
- **Privacy Auditing:** Check which domains are contacted by any given webpage.
- **Content Blocker Comparisons:** Understand a blocker’s effectiveness beyond block counts by inspecting which connections actually happen.
- **Filter List Development:** Gain a clear view of silent or stealth blocking effects.
- **Troubleshooting Network Requests:** Quickly identify whether a request was allowed or blocked and by what method.

### Before vs After uBO Scope
Without uBO Scope, users rely on incomplete blocker counts or opaque reports. With uBO Scope, users receive transparent, domain-focused insights that clarify real networking activity behind the browser pages they visit.

## Getting Started Preview

- **Installation:** Available via official web stores for Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers.
- **Popup Interface:** Launch from the toolbar icon to instantly see connection details for the current tab.
- **Requirements:** Running a supported browser with `webRequest` API permissions.

For detailed installation instructions and core workflows, see the [Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope](../guides/core-usage/install-and-setup) page and [Understanding the Popup Interface](../guides/core-usage/understanding-the-popup).

## Tips & Best Practices

- Interpreting badge count: The badge shows the number of *distinct third-party domains connected*; a lower count generally means better privacy.
- Recognize that *stealth-blocked* connections are those silently intercepted without explicit failure indications.
- Use the domain counts in the popup to identify heavy or suspicious third-party activity.
- Remember, not all third parties are harmful; many are essential CDNs or service domains.

---

## Troubleshooting

If you see no data or unexpected results:
- Verify that uBO Scope has the necessary permissions (`webRequest`, activeTab).
- Ensure you have an active tab open and that it’s a valid webpage.
- Confirm that other extensions or browser settings do not interfere with network request reporting.

Further troubleshooting is covered in the [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](../getting-started/install-launch-validate/troubleshooting-setup) guide.
