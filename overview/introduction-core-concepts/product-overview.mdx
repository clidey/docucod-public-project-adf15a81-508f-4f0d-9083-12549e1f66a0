description: "Discover uBO Scope’s mission as a browser extension: to transparently report all attempted and successful connections to third-party remote servers made by webpages. Learn how it provides objective visibility into network activity, regardless of content blocker or DNS filtering, and sets itself apart from conventional ad blockers by focusing on distinct third-party domains, not just block counts."

# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlock Transparent Visibility into Webpage Network Connections

When you visit a website, countless invisible network requests happen behind the scenes to fetch resources, ads, trackers, and more. How do you know which remote servers your browser talks to, and which connections are actually allowed or blocked? uBO Scope answers this critical question with clarity and precision.

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to **reveal every attempted and successful connection to third-party remote servers initiated by webpages**, giving you unparalleled insight into your browser's network activity.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You

- See exactly how many **distinct third-party domains** your browser reaches out to on each webpage.
- Understand the **real-world network effects** of content blockers and filters, beyond misleading block counts.
- Gain transparency even if network requests are blocked by DNS or other stealth techniques.
- Avoid common misinformation spread by ad blocker test sites or block count comparisons.
- Empower yourself or filter list maintainers with actionable data about network connections.

Whether you’re a privacy-conscious user, a developer debugging network issues, or a filter list maintainer wanting detailed connection data, uBO Scope puts essential network insight at your fingertips.

## What is uBO Scope?

### A Clear Definition

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension companion to uBlock Origin that **measures and reports network requests to remote servers** initiated by webpages. It tracks attempted, allowed, stealth-blocked, and outright blocked connections, and surfaces this information in a simple, clear interface.

### The Purpose It Serves

Unlike traditional content blockers that emphasize block counts or heuristic detections, uBO Scope focuses on the **number of distinct 3rd-party domains your browser connects to**, regardless of the content blocker or DNS filter in place. This approach clarifies the actual network surface exposed and helps debunk myths related to block count metrics.

Through this focus on domain-level visibility, uBO Scope:

- Enables you to objectively evaluate your privacy posture by showing how many unique third parties are contacted.
- Provides a reliable method to verify if content blockers truly reduce connections, beyond deceptive block metrics.
- Detects stealth-blocked connections that might otherwise be hidden from detection.

### Key Differentiators

- **Content Blocker Agnostic:** Works independently from any content blocker, reflecting outcomes even if blocking occurs outside the extension.
- **Domain-Focused Counting:** Counts distinct domains contacted rather than raw request or block numbers, delivering meaningful insight.
- **Stealth Detection:** Identifies connections stealthily blocked by some blockers to provide a fuller picture.
- **Open and Transparent:** Built as open-source, with a focus on accuracy and reliability.

## How uBO Scope Works at a High Level

At its core, uBO Scope listens to your browser’s `webRequest` API events related to network requests such as successes, redirects, and errors. With this data, it records each connection's outcome to categorize whether it was allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

It then aggregates these results by domain, showing you a clear summary that highlights the diversity and number of distinct third-party domains contacted during the page load.

This means that **no matter your content blocking setup or DNS filtering, uBO Scope will reveal all network attempts reported by the browser**, helping you achieve a transparent picture of your network activity.

## Explore uBO Scope in Action

In the popup panel activated from the browser toolbar icon (via `popup.html`), you’ll find:

- The hostname and domain of the active tab,
- The total count of distinct domains contacted,
- Clear sections listing domains that were **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked**.

Domains are shown alongside the number of connection attempts, making it easy to pinpoint persistent third parties or unexpected connections.

<u>Example use case:</u> While browsing, you open the uBO Scope popup and see that ten distinct third-party domains were contacted on the page—several allowed, one stealth-blocked, and a few blocked. This lets you identify potential trackers or servers that bypass blocking untouched.

You can trust this data as it is retrieved directly from the browser’s network event API, not inferred or estimated.

---

## Summary

uBO Scope is the definitive browser extension to **quantify and clarify your network connections to third-party domains**. Moving beyond superficial metrics and untrustworthy ad blocker tests, it brings precise, domain-based reporting of network request outcomes.

This empowers users, developers, and filter list maintainers alike with reliable, actionable visibility of their browsing network landscape.
