# What is uBO Scope?

Discover uBO Scope, a powerful browser extension designed to bring transparency to your web browsing by revealing every network connection — both attempted and successful — made by webpages to remote servers. Whether these connections are blocked, stealthily handled, or allowed, uBO Scope gives you an accurate, real-time view of network activity beyond what traditional content blockers show.

## Seeing Through the Shadows: Why uBO Scope Matters

When you browse the web, your browser talks to many remote servers behind the scenes. These may include third-party trackers, content delivery networks (CDNs), or legitimate services. Most content blockers focus on blocking requests, but they don’t always reveal the bigger picture of *which* remote servers your browser communicates with, especially when stealthy blocking is involved.

uBO Scope fills this gap by monitoring all network requests your browser attempts — regardless of whether they were allowed, blocked, or stealthily handled by your content blocker or network configuration. This empowers you with a clear understanding of your exposure to third-party connections.

## What Exactly is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension that listens to all network requests made by your active browser tabs. Using the browser's `webRequest` API, it captures the status and outcome of each connection attempt and summarizes these by domain.

It categorizes the outcomes as:

- **Not Blocked:** Requests successfully completed.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests intercepted or modified in a way that hides blocking from the webpage.
- **Blocked:** Requests outright prevented from completing.

This categorization helps you understand the reality of your network connections, not just a binary block list.

Unlike other tools, uBO Scope reports these connections **independently** of which content blocker is installed or active — even catching those blocked at the DNS or network level, as long as the browser reports the request.

## How Does uBO Scope Stand Out?

- **Neutral and Transparent:** It doesn't block or interfere with your browsing. Instead, it provides unbiased visibility into network requests.
- **Browser Integration:** Works seamlessly with modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari by leveraging their official APIs.
- **Accurate Third-Party Detection:** Counts distinct third-party servers rather than raw block counts, offering a meaningful measure of your network footprint.
- **Stealth Connection Awareness:** Detects connections hidden from usual blocker counts.

These unique qualities make it a valuable tool for privacy-conscious users, security researchers, and filter list maintainers.

## Behind the Scenes: How uBO Scope Works (Simplified)

At its core, uBO Scope listens for network requests for your active tab. It records the hostname and domain of each request and tracks whether the request was successful, blocked, or stealthily redirected.

The extension maintains a categorized tally and updates a badge count on the browser toolbar showing the number of distinct third-party domains connected. It also provides a popup UI listing these domains and their connection status, letting you drill down into details instantly.

This process occurs continuously in the background without impacting your browsing experience.

## Real-World Example

Imagine you visit a news website. uBO Scope tells you:

- You connected to 5 third-party domains successfully (like a CDN or analytics provider).
- 2 connection attempts were stealth-blocked, possibly preventing trackers you didn’t know about.
- 3 domains were outright blocked by your content blocker.

Without uBO Scope, you might only see block counts or miss stealth connections entirely.

## Why You Should Care: The Benefits

- **Gain Clear Visibility:** Understand exactly which remote servers your browser communicates with for each tab.
- **Improve Privacy Posture:** Detect stealth connections you may not realize happen.
- **Make Informed Decisions:** Evaluate your content blocker’s real effectiveness beyond claims or block counts.
- **Support Filter List Maintainers:** Use transparent data to refine blocking rules and improve community filters.

## Summary

uBO Scope empowers you with unprecedented insight into your browser's network connections. It serves as your trusted companion in navigating a complex web ecosystem filled with visible, stealthy, and blocked communications.

By revealing the hidden web of third-party network traffic, uBO Scope helps you take control of your online privacy and security.
