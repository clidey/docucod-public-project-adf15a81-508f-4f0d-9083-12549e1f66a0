# What is uBO Scope?

## Understand Your Web Connections Like Never Before

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to reveal the true network activity of your browser by reporting every connection attempt — whether allowed, blocked, or stealthily handled — to third-party remote servers. Unlike traditional content blockers that focus primarily on blocking ads and trackers, uBO Scope shines a spotlight on network transparency, showing you the number of distinct third-party servers your browser actually connects to.

### Why Should You Care About Tracking Third-Party Connections?

In today's web ecosystem, a single webpage often connects to dozens of remote servers — many you may not even be aware of. These third-party connections can impact your privacy, security, and browsing speed. By tracking these connections:

- You gain **clear visibility** into which third parties your browser communicates with.
- You identify **potential privacy risks** by spotting unknown or unwanted remote servers.
- You understand the **true effectiveness** of your content blockers, beyond mere block counts.

### Key Value Propositions

- **Transparent Network Activity**: See all third-party servers your browser attempts to connect with, regardless of blocking or success.
- **Accurate Badge Counts**: The toolbar icon count reflects the precise number of distinct third-party remote servers connected, aiding better privacy awareness.
- **Independent of Content Blockers**: Works effectively alongside any content blocker or DNS filtering method.
- **Myth Busting and Education**: Helps debunk common misconceptions about blockers and ‘ad blocker test’ sites.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

This extension is ideal for privacy-conscious users, security enthusiasts, web developers, and filter list maintainers who want a reliable measure of third-party network traffic without interference.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is not a content blocker itself. Instead, it is a **network monitoring tool** focusing on the browser’s connections to third-party servers. It listens to the browser's `webRequest` API to track every network request independently of any blocking methods in place.

### Core Purpose

At its heart, uBO Scope aims to provide:

- An accurate count and reporting of distinct third-party remote servers your browser interacts with.
- Real-time feedback via a toolbar badge and popup panel that details these connections.

This lets you measure your actual exposure on the web rather than relying on proxy indicators such as block counts.

### How Does uBO Scope Differ From Traditional Content Blockers?

| Feature                                      | Traditional Content Blockers                             | uBO Scope                                               |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary Function                            | Blocks unwanted content (ads, trackers)                  | Reports network requests to third-party servers         |
| Focus                                      | Filtering based on rules and lists                        | Transparency into actual network behavior                |
| Indicator on Toolbar Icon                   | Number of blocked requests                                | Number of distinct third-party domains connected to      |
| Operation Independence                      | May be stealthy or limited by blocking mechanisms        | Works independently via `webRequest` listeners           |

### Why Tracking Third-Party Domains Matters

Third-party connections are the key privacy factor on the web. Even if many requests are blocked, the presence of connections to numerous remote servers can signal:

- **Tracking vectors** by analytics or ad companies.
- **Download of external resources** such as scripts, images, or fonts.
- **Hidden communication channels** used by web pages.

By showing you exactly who your browser talks to, uBO Scope lets you make informed privacy and security decisions.

## Before and After uBO Scope

| Without uBO Scope                                         | With uBO Scope                                           |
|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| No clear visibility into third-party connections.         | Instantly see how many unique third-party domains are contacted on each tab. |
| Rely on block counts which can be misleading.             | Get a reliable indication of network exposure by tracking distinct domains rather than raw block counts. |
| Difficulty verifying claims about content blocker efficacy.| Verify and understand third-party connections independent of blockers. |

## Getting Started Preview

To experience uBO Scope:

1. **Install the extension** from your browser’s official store.
2. **Open a webpage** and watch the toolbar badge update when connections are made to third-party domains.
3. **Click the badge icon** to open the popup panel and explore detailed domain connection information.

Ensure your browser supports WebExtension APIs like `webRequest` and permissions for host access.

For installation guidance, see the [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope#installing-ubo-scope) documentation.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

- The badge count reflects _distinct third-party domains_ contacted, so a higher count implies more exposure.
- Not all third parties are harmful; CDNs and essential services contribute to connections.
- The extension relies on the browser's capability to report network requests; some background or system-level blocking may not be visible.
- If badge counts do not update, verify extension permissions and that other extensions do not interfere with `webRequest` APIs.
