# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Your Browser Makes — No Secrets Left Behind

uBO Scope is a lightweight, browser extension built to reveal all connections—whether attempted or successful—that your browser makes to **third-party remote servers**. Unlike traditional content blockers that focus solely on blocking ads or trackers, uBO Scope shines a spotlight on the *actual* network interactions occurring behind the scenes, giving you clear insight into what your browser communicates with on every page.

### Why This Matters
Often, browsers and content blockers will show you block counts or stealth modes, but these numbers only tell part of the story. uBO Scope reframes your perspective by showing the **number of distinct third-party servers** your browser connects to, offering a far more meaningful indicator of network exposure.

### Who Benefits from uBO Scope?
- **Privacy-conscious users** wanting transparency about remote servers interacting with webpages.
- **Filter list maintainers** and developers who need accurate, real-world data to improve blocking rules.
- **Security researchers** analyzing third-party behavior across the web.

## What Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a simple yet powerful browser extension compatible with Chromium and Firefox browsers, designed to accurately report all distinct third-party remote connections triggered by your browsing activity.

### The Core Mission
It captures and displays network requests to remote servers, detailing which were allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked — all organized by domain. Its primary focus is to reveal the *true scale* of your exposure to distinct third-party servers, bringing clarity that other tools often obscure.

### How It Works
- **Network Monitoring:** Using the browser's `webRequest` API, uBO Scope listens for all network requests initiated by webpages.
- **Request Outcome Tracking:** It classifies each connection as "allowed," "stealth-blocked," or "blocked," based on their success or failure.
- **Distinct Domains Counting:** It emphasizes the count of unique third-party domains rather than raw block counts, a key metric that reflects real-world network connections.

### What Sets uBO Scope Apart?
- It reports on *all* network connection attempts—even those blocked at the DNS level or by other content blockers—as long as the browser exposes them through the `webRequest` API.
- It debunks common misconceptions around block counts and "ad blocker tests" by focusing on the total distinct remote servers connected.
- Its badge count on the toolbar shows the number of unique third-party domains connected, guiding users toward a lower—and thus more private—number.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Comprehensive Connection Visibility**  
  Monitors every connection attempt to remote servers initiated by the active tab.

- **Distinct Domain Tracking**  
  Counts unique third-party domains connected to during browsing, offering a meaningful privacy metric.

- **Outcome Categorization**  
  Separates network requests into "allowed," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" categories, helping users identify what was successfully accessed vs. blocked.

- **Toolbar Badge Indicator**  
  Displays a real-time badge count indicating how many distinct third-party domains are connected on the current tab.

- **Resilient to Content Blockers**  
  Reports network request outcomes regardless of which content blocking extensions or DNS filters are in place.

- **Filter List Maintainer Support**  
  Designed to support maintainers by providing reliable data on network interactions, especially useful on devices with limited browser tooling.

### Real-World Example
Imagine opening a news website. Traditional ad blockers might show dozens or hundreds of blocked requests, but uBO Scope will show you *exactly* how many third-party domains your browser still contacts on that page—often just a handful of CDNs or embedded services—straight from the toolbar badge and detailed popup.

## Why Should You Care?

### Clear, Trustworthy Insight
- Get the *real* picture of your browser’s network reach: fewer connected domains means less third-party exposure.
- Rethink the value of block counts and "ad blocker test" pages which often mislead.

### Practical Privacy Benefits
- Identify unexpected or hidden third-party connections that could compromise privacy.
- Know instantly if your blockers are effectively limiting third-party network reach.

### Empower Filter List Developers
- Access reliable network connection data essential to refining blocking and filter lists.
- Use uBO Scope’s findings to validate or challenge assumptions about network behavior.

### Before and After—Understanding the Difference
| Without uBO Scope | With uBO Scope |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Only see block counts that may be misleading or misinterpreted. | See actual number of distinct third-party domains connected per page. |
| Blind to stealth-blocking or DNS-based blocking effects. | Visibility into all request outcomes regardless of blocking method. |

## Getting Started Preview

Getting up and running with uBO Scope is simple and fast:

1. **Installation**: Add the extension from the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons.
2. **Browse as usual**: The toolbar icon badge instantly starts showing counts of connected third-party domains.
3. **Open the popup panel**: Click the badge to see detailed breakdowns of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains on the active tab.

### Prerequisites
- Compatible modern browser (Chromium 122.0+, Firefox 128.0+, Safari 18.5+).
- Browser must support the `webRequest` API for accurate reporting.

### Next Steps
- Explore the [Product Value and Benefits](/overview/introduction-core-concepts/value-proposition-benefits) page to understand deeper advantages.
- Visit the [Getting Started Guide](/guides/getting-started/install-setup) for step-by-step installation.
- Learn about interpreting badge counts and network outcomes in [Making Sense of Badge Counts and Block Metrics](/guides/analysis-patterns/badge-counts).

<Tip>
Keep in mind: The ultimate indicator of browsing privacy is the number of distinct third-party servers you connect to — aim to keep this as low as possible.
