# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Remote Server Your Browser Connects To

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension that shines a light on all remote server connections your browser attempts or successfully establishes while you browse the web. It was designed to provide transparent insight into third-party network activity, helping you understand and control your exposure to external domains.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You

- **See beyond the surface:** Instantly reveal every distinct third-party server your browser talks to, not just what is blocked.
- **Debunk common blockers myths:** Verify your content blocker’s real-world impact by focusing on actual server connections rather than misleading block counts.
- **Privacy awareness:** Identify and quantify external domains interacting with your browsing sessions.
- **Keep it simple:** A no-nonsense tool focusing strictly on network connections—with no complicated setup or frequent updates.

### Who is this for?

- Privacy-conscious users seeking transparent, actionable data on third-party connections.
- Filter list maintainers requiring reliable insights where conventional developer tools aren’t accessible.
- Anyone curious about the true nature of their browser’s network activity beyond user-agent or ad-blocker statistics.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension that passively monitors network requests your browser issues while loading web pages. It reports every remote server connection attempt or success, regardless of whether content blockers, DNS filters, or other security measures intervene.

At its heart, uBO Scope leverages the browser’s `webRequest` API to listen for network events, aggregating these to present a clear picture of distinct third-party remote servers involved in your browsing.

The extension displays this information via its toolbar icon badge and a popup panel summarizing connections categorized by their outcome.

## Why You Need uBO Scope

Browsers often connect to many third-party servers silently. Many privacy and content blocking tools count resource blocks but fail to show you exactly which servers remain connected. uBO Scope fills this gap, because:

- The **number of distinct third-party servers connected** is a more reliable measure of exposure than block counts.
- Block counts can be misleading; a higher block count may coincide with a greater number of distinct remote servers accessed.
- ‘Ad blocker test’ webpages frequently generate unrealistic network requests that fail to reflect genuine browsing conditions.

By focusing on _distinct third-party remote servers_, uBO Scope lets you see what truly matters—what’s actually reaching your browser.

## What Sets uBO Scope Apart?

- **Accurate Third-Party Tracking:** Reports connections regardless of blocking methods—including DNS-based content blockers—so long as the browser's `webRequest` API exposes the data.
- **Simplicity:** It operates silently, with minimal UI and no configuration needed.
- **Transparent Metrics:** Toolbar icon badge shows the count of distinct third-party domains connected, which you want to keep as low as possible.
- **Myth Busting:** Helps clear up misconceptions around content blocking, giving you the facts rather than block count illusions.
- **Developer Ally:** Although minimalistic, it assists maintainers of filter lists by revealing which domains are active during browsing.

## How it Works (High-Level)

When you visit a webpage, your browser fetches resources from multiple remote servers. uBO Scope listens to these requests via browser network event APIs and:

1. Extracts the hostname from each request URL.
2. Maps hostnames to their registered domain names using a public suffix list.
3. Categorizes connections based on outcomes: **allowed** (successful fetches), **stealth** (redirects and stealth-blocked requests), and **blocked** (failed connections).
4. Aggregates counts of distinct domains per category.
5. Updates the browser toolbar badge with the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.
6. Enables users to view detailed connection breakdowns through the popup UI.

<u>By focusing on the domain level rather than just individual requests, uBO Scope provides a meaningful abstraction of third-party exposure.</u>


## Real-World Example

Imagine you visit a news website. uBO Scope will show you:

- How many distinct third-party domains the site tries to connect to.
- Which domains were allowed to respond successfully.
- Which connections were stealthily redirected or blocked.

If you use a content blocker that claims to block millions of requests, uBO Scope can reveal if, in reality, the number of distinct connected third parties is still high—indicating the content blocker might not be as effective as it appears from block counts alone.

## Key Benefits & Use Cases

- **Get a Clear Privacy Profile:** Instantly understand your exposure to third parties on any visited site.
- **Assess Content Blockers Fairly:** Compare your blockers based on actual server connections, not misleading block numbers.
- **Analyze Complex Browsing Behavior:** Detect stealthy requests like redirects that might evade other monitoring tools.
- **Aid Filter List Development:** Provides data useful to filter list maintainers, especially when developer tools are inaccessible.
- **Easy Integration:** Works seamlessly across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers that support the `webRequest` API.

## What Does the Badge Count Mean?

The number displayed on the extension toolbar icon represents the number of _distinct third-party remote servers_ your browser connected to during the current tab’s browsing session. **A lower number means fewer third parties are communicating with your browser, which typically equates to reduced exposure and better privacy.**

## Practical Tips for Using uBO Scope

- Keep an eye on the badge count for each tab to monitor third-party exposure.
- Use the popup panel to see which domains are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Remember not to rely on 'ad blocker test' sites—they don’t simulate real-world blocking behavior.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blocker for a transparent, factual picture.

## Common Misconceptions Clarified

### Block Counts vs. Distinct Connections
Block counts do not equate to better blocking. uBO Scope focuses on distinct third-party domains connected rather than raw block numbers, reflecting the true effectiveness of your privacy setup.

### Avoid ‘Ad Blocker Test’ Pages
These pages often create artificial and unrealistic network requests, making their results unreliable. Trust real-world data collected by tools like uBO Scope instead.
