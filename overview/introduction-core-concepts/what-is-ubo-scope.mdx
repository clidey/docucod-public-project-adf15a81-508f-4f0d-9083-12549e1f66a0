# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlocking Your Web's Hidden Connections

**uBO Scope** is a lightweight yet powerful browser extension designed to uncover all the remote server connections your browser initiates—whether those connections were successful, blocked, or stealthily redirected. Instead of simply counting blocked requests or relying on complex heuristics, uBO Scope focuses on the real impact: how many distinct third-party domains your browser connects to during your web browsing.

This unique perspective empowers you with clear insight into your web privacy footprint and helps you evaluate content blockers more meaningfully.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Reveals all remote server connections** across all network request outcomes (allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked).
- **Measures distinct third-party connections**, providing an accurate reflection of browsing privacy exposure.
- Supports realistic assessment of content blocker effectiveness beyond misleading block count metrics.
- Offers an independent, transparent view unaffected by how content blockers choose to report or hide activity.
- Simple to use, with an immediate badge count and an intuitive popup reporting connected domains.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious web users who want deeper visibility into the network activity behind the scenes.
- Users curious about the real effectiveness of content blocking tools.
- Filter list maintainers seeking an accurate measurement of third-party connections.
- Developers and security analysts monitoring remote server interactions from the browser.

## What Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension companion to the popular uBlock Origin, designed to _measure network requests rather than block them_. It listens to browser webRequest events to report on every remote connection attempt that webpages make, categorizing each by its outcome.

### Core Purpose

At its heart, uBO Scope answers this crucial question:

> _'How many distinct third-party remote servers did my browser connect to, or attempt to connect to, during my browsing session?'_

Traditional content blockers usually report how many requests they blocked. However, this number doesn't always reflect the actual network exposure—because a high block count can accompany a large number of third-party connections and vice versa. uBO Scope flips this narrative by showing the ultimate surface of network exposure by counting distinct domains touched.

### Unique Approach

- **Comprehensive Outcome Tracking**: uBO Scope tracks three connection outcomes:
   - **Allowed**: Requests that successfully connected.
   - **Blocked**: Requests definitively blocked by the content blocker.
   - **Stealth-blocked**: Requests silently redirected or hidden by stealth techniques.

- **Domain-Centric Reporting**: Instead of counting individual requests, the extension aggregates counts by domain and hostname, giving a clearer picture of unique third-party connections rather than repeated hits to the same domain.

- **Badging For Quick Insight**: The browser toolbar icon badge shows the number of distinct third-party domains contacted on the active tab, enabling quick privacy status checks at a glance.

- **Browser Compatibility**: Supports major browsers including Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari, integrating natively using their webRequest APIs.

## How uBO Scope Works — The User's Journey

Imagine you're browsing a site and want to know exactly which outside parties your browser talks to beyond the main domain. uBO Scope automatically listens in on all network connections your browser attempts, categorizing and tallying unique domains.

When you click the uBO Scope icon:

1. The popup displays the current tab's hostname and domain.
2. It shows summary information: how many distinct domains your browser connected to.
3. It lists those domains grouped by their outcome — allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked — showing counts for each.

You immediately see where your browser reaches out, revealing hidden third-party trackers, content delivery networks, or ads.

This empowers you to make informed decisions about privacy settings, filter list selections, and content blockers.

## Key Benefits & Use Cases

### Understand Your Exposure
See exactly how many and which third-party domains your browser connects to, gaining clarity on your web's real privacy surface.

### Assess Content Blockers Meaningfully
Move beyond simple block counts to evaluate which blockers truly limit your exposure to third-party domains.

### Debunk Common Myths
uBO Scope provides evidence-based insights to challenge myths like:

- _'Higher block counts mean better privacy.'_ (uBO Scope shows that it's the count of distinct third-party connections that matters.)
- _'Ad blocker test sites are reliable measures.'_ (uBO Scope warns that these tests don't reflect real-world browsing.)

### Support Filter List Maintenance
Filter list creators can leverage uBO Scope to verify the effectiveness of their rules in reducing distinct remote connections.

### Troubleshooting & Validation
Verify your setup by comparing expected versus actual distinct connections, helping diagnose issues with content blockers or network configurations.
