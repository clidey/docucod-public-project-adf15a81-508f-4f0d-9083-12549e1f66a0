# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Your Browser Makes — Instantly

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to give you unparalleled transparency about the network connections initiated by webpages you visit. Whether a connection succeeds or is blocked, uBO Scope reveals every remote server your browser attempts to contact — including those hidden from traditional content blocker metrics.

### Why uBO Scope Matters
- **Complete Visibility:** See all remote server connections attempted by your browser, without exception.
- **Real Outcomes:** Understand which connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.
- **Myth Busting:** Challenge misconceptions about content blocker effectiveness by focusing on distinct third-party servers rather than raw block counts.
- **Complement Your Content Blocker:** Works alongside your existing content blockers to provide an independent audit.

### Who Benefits Most?
- Privacy-conscious users wanting to monitor third-party tracking and remote connections.
- Developers and security researchers auditing network behavior of webpages.
- Filter list maintainers seeking real-world data on what connections occur.
- Anyone curious about what their browser is really doing behind the scenes.

## What Exactly Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a complementary browser extension initially authored by Raymond Hill, creator of uBlock Origin. It passively listens to all network requests made by your browser and maintains a categorized record of the remote servers contacted during your browsing sessions.

At its core, it listens to the browser’s `webRequest` API, capturing every request's outcome — whether it resolved successfully, was blocked, or was stealthily redirected — and groups them by domain. This gives you a domain-level overview of connections initiated by whatever content you load.

Unlike traditional content blockers that focus on counting blocked requests, uBO Scope's distinctive value is its focus on **distinct remote servers** contacted, providing a more meaningful signal regarding exposure to third-party resources.

### The Unique Value Proposition

- **Beyond Raw Block Counts:** Where most tools count how many connections were blocked, uBO Scope counts how many unique third-party servers your browser actually talked to.
- **Visibility Into Stealth Blocking:** Detect stealth blocking events that are otherwise invisible to webpages or basic tools.
- **Works Across Browsers:** Supporting Chromium, Firefox, and Safari with consistent behavior.

## How Does uBO Scope Work?

Without diving into internal implementation, here’s the user-centric flow:

1. You install uBO Scope in your browser.
2. The extension passively monitors every network request made on the active browser tab.
3. Each request is categorized as “allowed,” “blocked,” or “stealth-blocked.”
4. Domains contacted are identified and counted.
5. The count of distinct third-party domains is displayed as a badge on the toolbar icon.
6. Clicking the icon reveals a detailed popup listing all domains contacted, grouped by their outcome category.

This enables you to quickly see not only how many third-party servers were contacted but also their status, lending transparency into the browsing session’s network footprint.

## Key Features of uBO Scope

- **Real-Time Domain Reporting:** Instantly see domains contacted by the current page.
- **Outcome Categorization:** Domains are grouped into “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked” for granular insight.
- **Toolbar Badge Indicator:** Shows the number of distinct allowed third-party domains, pushing focus toward minimizing unwanted connections.
- **Cross-Browser Consistency:** Utilizes browser-native APIs ensuring same experience on Chromium, Firefox, and Safari.
- **Lightweight and Non-Intrusive:** Operates passively without interfering with regular browsing.
- **Historical Session Data:** Remember connections across tabs and sessions where possible for continuous monitoring.

### Example Scenario

Imagine visiting a news website that loads multiple third-party trackers, ad servers, and content delivery networks (CDNs). uBO Scope will report how many unique third-party servers the page actually talks to:

| Outcome        | Domains Detected |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Allowed        | 3 (e.g., CDN, Analytics)
| Stealth-Blocked| 1 (tracker silently blocked)
| Blocked        | 2 (ad servers you're explicitly blocking)

The badge number shown (3) encourages minimizing allowed third-parties for better privacy.

## Why Should You Care About uBO Scope?

Traditional content blockers often present statistics that can be misleading or incomplete. A high block count does not necessarily mean better privacy or less tracking—because multiple requests can connect to many different third parties.

uBO Scope helps you:

- **Focus on What Matters:** It shows how many **distinct third-party remote servers** were contacted, which correlates more closely with your privacy exposure.
- **Identify Indirect Connections:** Sometimes requests are stealthily redirected or routed, and uBO Scope catches these events.
- **Make Informed Decisions:** Use the data to tune content blocker settings or filter lists based on actual network behavior, rather than heuristic assumptions.

### Before and After Using uBO Scope

| Without uBO Scope                    | With uBO Scope                      |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| See block counts with no context     | See unique domains contacted       |
| No insight into stealth blocking     | Detect stealth-blocked domains     |
| Rely on dubious metrics from webpages| Understand real network outcomes   |

## Getting Started with uBO Scope

Using uBO Scope is as easy as installing the extension from your browser’s official add-on store. Once installed:

1. **Visit any webpage.** uBO Scope starts monitoring connections automatically.
2. **Check the badge count.** The icon shows how many distinct third-party domains made connections.
3. **Click the icon to inspect details.** The popup shows allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains for the active tab.

> **Tip:** Pay attention to the *allowed* domains count. Fewer distinct third parties usually means better privacy.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

- The extension relies on the browser’s support for the `webRequest` API and may not report requests made outside it.
- Badge counts reflect distinct third-party domains, so domains hosting multiple resources still count once.
- Stealth-blocked domains may appear when requests are redirected silently or manipulated by content blockers.

<u>Ensure your browser meets the minimum version requirements:</u>
- Chromium 122.0+
- Firefox 128.0+
- Safari 18.5+

For additional help, consult the Troubleshooting section in the documentation.
