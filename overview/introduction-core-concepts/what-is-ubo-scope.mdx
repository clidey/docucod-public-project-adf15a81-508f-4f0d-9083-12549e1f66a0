# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Your Browser Makes — Transparently and Accurately

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to reveal **all** attempted or successful network connections your browser makes to third-party remote servers. Its core mission is to empower you with clear, unbiased insight into the web’s hidden connections — helping you understand, audit, and ultimately reduce unwanted or excessive third-party interactions for stronger privacy and control.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

The web is full of third-party domains loaded invisibly by websites — often without your knowledge. Unlike traditional content blockers that focus on blocking ads or trackers, uBO Scope acts as a **diagnostic and transparency tool** that tells you exactly what connections your browser attempts and which ones succeed or fail.

This clarity helps you make informed decisions about which third parties are needed versus those that may be invasive or untrustworthy. Armed with this insight, you can optimize your privacy setup more effectively.

### Key Benefits

- **Complete Visibility:** Track both successful and blocked network requests to third-party servers with precision.
- **Independent from Blockers:** Works alongside your existing blockers, revealing what they allow or block.
- **Real-Time Insights:** See live badge counts and detailed breakdowns per domain directly in your browser.
- **Browser-Wide Coverage:** Monitors requests across tabs and sessions for a full picture.
- **Helps Debunk Myths:** Clarifies common misconceptions about content blocking effectiveness.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users seeking detailed transparency on all remote connections.
- Filter list maintainers and developers who want to audit network activity under content blocking.
- Security analysts verifying the effectiveness of blocking rules in real-world browsing.
- Web developers interested in understanding third-party resource usage.

## What Makes uBO Scope Different?

While content blockers measure effectiveness by the volume of blocked requests, uBO Scope shifts the focus to **how many distinct third-party domains your browser actually connects to.** This metric offers a better gauge of your exposure surface.

Additionally, uBO Scope is not an ad blocker or privacy extension per se; it does not block or alter any requests. Instead, it serves as an **objective observer** reporting outcomes:

- Requests allowed and successfully connected.
- Requests blocked or failed.
- Requests stealth-blocked, i.e., silently redirected or handled.


## How uBO Scope Works — At a Glance

- Listens to the browser’s `webRequest` API, capturing network request events including redirects, errors, and responses.
- Maps requests by their originating tab and categorizes outcomes.
- Tracks domains and hostnames, leveraging the Public Suffix List for accurate domain extraction.
- Updates a clear badge count on the browser toolbar, representing active distinct third-party domains.
- Provides a popup UI that summarizes, categorizes, and details all connection outcomes for the currently active tab.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine browsing your favorite news site. uBO Scope quietly logs every remote server your browser tries to contact — from content delivery networks (CDNs) serving images to embedded analytics platforms.

You notice the badge shows a surprisingly high count of distinct domains. Opening the popup, you see some connections marked "blocked" by your content blocker and others "allowed." This clear split helps you realize which third parties your current setup lets through and whether that aligns with your privacy expectations.

## Best Practices for Using uBO Scope

- Use uBO Scope alongside your existing content blockers for complementary insights.
- Regularly check the badge and popup output to monitor changes in third-party network activity.
- Investigate unexpected or unknown domains to identify potentially unwanted connections.
- Combine insights from uBO Scope with manual filter list tuning for enhanced control.

## Summary

uBO Scope is your transparent companion extension designed not to block but to **expose every network connection your browser attempts and makes.** It complements existing privacy tools by providing the factual data needed to fully understand your web exposure to third-party servers.

Empower your browsing with complete awareness and make privacy decisions based on accurate, concrete network data—not guesswork or misleading statistics.
