# What is uBO Scope?

## See Every Connection Behind the Scenes — Transparency Over Third-Party Network Activity

uBO Scope is a specialized browser extension designed to expose all remote server connections initiated by webpages you visit. Unlike conventional content blockers that focus primarily on blocking ads or trackers, uBO Scope’s primary mission is to reveal *every* attempted or successful connection to third-party servers — providing you with unmatched transparency and insight into your web traffic.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You

- **Comprehensive Insight:** Track all network connections, not just the blocked ones.
- **Real Clarity:** Understand which third-party domains your browser truly connects to during web browsing.
- **Effective Monitoring:** Evaluate content blockers by actual network activity rather than misleading block counts.
- **Myth Busting:** Debunk common misconceptions about content blockers with factual connection data.
- **Privacy Awareness:** Gain control over exposure to third-party services and potential tracking.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users who want greater visibility of web connections.
- Developers and security professionals monitoring real network behavior.
- Filter list maintainers who want accurate data on third-party hosts.
- Anyone skeptical of traditional ad-blocker metrics seeking factual analysis.

## What Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a companion browser extension to uBlock Origin that acts as a network connection reporter. Instead of blocking content itself, it listens to your browser’s network request activity and categorizes remote server connections used by the webpages you visit.

By leveraging your browser’s `webRequest` API, it reports the outcome of network requests — whether they succeed, are stealthily blocked, or are explicitly blocked by some filter. This lets users see beyond simple block tallies and understand the actual third-party domains their browser connects to.

### The Core Problem It Solves

Traditional content blockers often measure their effectiveness by how many requests they block, but this can be misleading. The true measure is how many distinct third-party connections are allowed. uBO Scope fills this gap by tracking all such connections, giving you a true picture of your browsing exposure.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique

- **Network-Focused Reporting:** It zeroes in on remote server connections, regardless of which content blocker is active.
- **Independent and Transparent:** Works alongside any content blocker or none.
- **Detailed Aggregation:** Tracks connections by hostname and domain, categorizing them as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Available for Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari with tailored background service workers or scripts.

### How It Works at a High Level

uBO Scope listens for network requests via browser APIs and collects data on:

- The request's target hostname and its associated domain.
- Whether the request succeeded, was blocked stealthily, or was explicitly blocked.
- Aggregation of this data per browser tab to inform meaningful per-page network connection summaries.

It then surfaces this information through its popup interface — showing you lists of connected domains sorted by status and counts.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Real-Time Network Monitoring:** Continuously records all outgoing web requests that your browser initiates while you browse.
- **Connection Outcome Classification:** Differentiates between requests that were explicitly blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed.
- **Badge Count Indicator:** The browser toolbar icon displays the count of distinct third-party domains connected for the active tab — the lower the count, the more private your browsing.
- **Domain and Hostname Aggregation:** Presents connection data grouped both by domain and by hostname for granularity.
- **Session Persistence:** Remembers connection data across your browsing session for consistent context.
- **Compatibility with Various Browsers:** Supports multiple browsers through tailored manifest and background/service worker implementations.

### Example Scenario

Imagine you're browsing a news website. uBO Scope will listen to all network requests the page triggers — fetching ads, images, analytics, and other resources. It counts:

- How many unique third-party domains the page successfully connected to.
- Which connections were stealth-blocked, potentially by your content blocker.
- Which requests were outright blocked.

This comprehensive view helps you assess the actual third-party exposure rather than relying on block counts alone.

## Why Should I Care?

### Gain Accurate Control
Knowing all remote connections empowers you to make informed decisions about your privacy and security. uBO Scope’s clear visibility helps you understand exactly which third parties a website communicates with.

### Avoid False Metrics
Many users wrongly believe high block counts equal better privacy. uBO Scope reveals that fewer allowed third-party connections — not just blocking more requests — is the trusted yardstick.

### Validate Your Content Blockers
By seeing the footprint your content blocker leaves on actual connections, you can compare effectiveness fairly and objectively.

### Debunk Common Myths
- **Myth:** Block count alone equals blocker performance.
- **Reality:** Fewer distinct third-party connections matter more.

- **Myth:** Ad blocker test sites show accurate blocker reliability.
- **Reality:** Such tests use unrealistic scenarios, whereas uBO Scope uses real-world web traffic.

## Getting Started Preview

To start leveraging uBO Scope:

1. **Install uBO Scope** from your browser’s extension store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, etc.).
2. **Activate and use your browser normally.** uBO Scope automatically monitors network requests for your active tab.
3. **Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon** to open the popup and view detailed connection data for the current page.

<u>Prerequisites:</u> A modern browser supporting the `webRequest` API with permissions for network domains.

From there, explore other documentation pages to learn how to interpret the popup data, validate content blocker effectiveness, and leverage real-world analysis workflows.
