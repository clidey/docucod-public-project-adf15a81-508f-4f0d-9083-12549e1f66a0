# Why Use uBO Scope? Value Proposition & Use Cases

## Unlock Clear Insight Into Website Connections

When you browse the web, numerous network connections are happening behind the scenes—many to third-party servers like trackers, advertisers, or content delivery networks (CDNs). uBO Scope shines a light on this hidden network activity, providing precise, unbiased data about which remote servers your browser connects to, whether those connections are permitted, blocked, or stealthily blocked.

## Who Benefits From uBO Scope?

- **Privacy Advocates:** Instantly verify what third-party domains a website contacts, empowering you to understand and control your exposure to trackers.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Use uBO Scope on devices or platforms with limited developer tools to validate the effectiveness of filters and blocking rules.
- **Everyday Users:** Gain a straightforward badge count indicating the number of distinct third-party servers accessed — a factual indicator of your browsing privacy.

## Practical Scenarios Where uBO Scope Excels

### 1. Confirming Trackers and CDNs

Imagine visiting a news website and wondering which external entities it contacts. With uBO Scope active, the extension monitors all network requests and neatly categorizes them based on their outcome:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains with allowed connections.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were redirected stealthily by content blockers.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were outright blocked or errored.

This categorization helps you pinpoint trackers, ad networks, or essential CDNs delivering legitimate content.

### 2. Debunking Misleading Ad Blocker Statistics

The number shown on traditional adblocker icons often reflects the quantity of blocked requests, but this is misleading. A high block count does not necessarily mean better privacy—it might indicate more attempts to load third parties. uBO Scope reverses this narrative by showing the distinct third-party domains that were _allowed_ in connections. A lower count here means fewer trackers or third parties actually contacted, providing a better measure of real privacy.

### 3. Validating Your Content Blocker’s True Effectiveness

If you’re experimenting with multiple content blockers or filter lists, uBO Scope offers an objective reality check. It doesn't rely on the block count but tracks distinct third-party domains your browser truly connects to, no matter what blocking method is used (extension, DNS filtering, etc.). This ensures you get accurate visibility irrespective of the underlying technology.

### 4. Aiding Filter Development on Limited Platforms

For filter list maintainers working on restricted platforms (mobile browsers, locked-down environments) where investigative tools are sparse, uBO Scope is a vital companion. It reports outcomes of network requests far beyond typical browser consoles, letting maintainers identify where their rules succeed or fall short.

## Before uBO Scope vs After

| Without uBO Scope                                         | With uBO Scope                                                         |
|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| You rely on block counts or opaque guesses about network activity | You see the factual count of distinct third-party servers contacted    |
| Filter effectiveness is guesswork                          | Filter appearance is validated by actual network request outcomes      |
| Suspicions about trackers have no tangible verification    | You confidently identify real trackers and CDNs                        |

## Return on Investment (ROI)

- **Time Savings:** Quickly assess a website’s network footprint without combing through network logs manually.
- **Better Privacy Decisions:** Use clear data to fine-tune content blockers or choose safer browsing setups.
- **Filter Optimization:** Save hours by debugging filter rules informed by real network outcomes.
