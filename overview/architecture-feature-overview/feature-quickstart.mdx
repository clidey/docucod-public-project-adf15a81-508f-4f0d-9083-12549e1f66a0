# Quick Feature Overview of uBO Scope

uBO Scope brings clarity and control to your browsing experience by providing instant insights into the network connections a webpage attempts or successfully makes. This page offers a concise rundown of its core features, designed to help you quickly understand which third-party domains your browser interacts with, the outcomes of those requests, and how these are visually communicated.

---

## Real-Time Domain Counting

At the heart of uBO Scope lies its ability to **count distinct third-party domains connected by the active webpage in real-time**. Instead of overwhelming you with every single network request, it aggregates these requests by domain, providing a clear snapshot of the range of external servers your current tab communicates with.

- The popup displays the **total number of distinct connected domains** prominently.
- This count updates dynamically as new connection attempts succeed, fail, or get stealth-blocked.

**Why this matters:** Knowing the exact number of third-party domains helps you assess your exposure to trackers, CDNs, or other external resources effortlessly.

---

## Classification of Network Request Outcomes

uBO Scope intelligently categorizes all observed network requests into three outcome types, making it straightforward to evaluate network activity and content blocking effectiveness:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** Domains from which resource connections were successfully established.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections blocked silently or redirected without apparent browser-level blocking notification.
- **Blocked:** Requests that were explicitly blocked by content blockers or failed to connect.

Each category is presented in its own section within the popup panel, complete with:

- A list of domains
- A count of requests made to each

This classification enables you to quickly differentiate between domains your browser is communicating with, those it tried and failed silently, and those explicitly stopped.

**Example use case:** If you see many stealth-blocked domains, it might indicate subtle blocking technologies in play or filtering that bypass traditional blocker metrics.

---

## Badge Updates Per Tab

The uBO Scope toolbar icon features a dynamic badge that reflects the number of distinct third-party domains allowed for the **currently active tab**:

- The badge count updates continuously in the background as new network requests complete.
- A lower badge count suggests fewer third-party connections, often reflecting tighter privacy and security.
- If no connections are found, the badge is cleared for a clean appearance.

This immediate visual feedback provides a quick glance overview of third-party exposure without opening the popup.

---

## Snapshot Presentation Enables Quick Scanning

When you open the popup panel, uBO Scope delivers a **snapshot** of the third-party network activity for the current webpage tab:

- The **hostname and domain** of the main tab are displayed clearly at the top.
- Each outcome category is shown in separate sections (Not Blocked, Stealth-Blocked, Blocked), allowing rapid comparison.
- Domains are displayed in Unicode form for clarity, even for internationalized domain names.
- Next to each domain, the number of requests initiated is visible, helping prioritize domains with the most activity.

This organized layout supports efficient monitoring — ideal when you need to quickly audit what external servers a page is interacting with.

---

## Practical Workflow Example

Imagine you're visiting a news website. Opening uBO Scope's popup shows:

- **12 domains allowed:** content delivery from recognized CDNs and legitimate services.
- **3 stealth-blocked domains:** some hidden trackers quietly blocked by your content blocker.
- **5 blocked domains:** known ad servers actively blocked.

The badge on the toolbar reflects ‘12’ for that tab, offering you peace of mind on third-party exposure right away.

---

## Tips for Best Use

- Monitor the badge count to quickly detect changes as you navigate between tabs or webpages.
- Use the popup’s categorized domain lists to identify unexpected or suspicious third parties.
- Remember that a lower count generally improves privacy but ensure essential services are not unintentionally blocked.
