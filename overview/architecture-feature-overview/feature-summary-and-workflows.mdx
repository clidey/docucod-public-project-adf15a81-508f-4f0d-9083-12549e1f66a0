# Key Features & Typical Workflows

Explore the core capabilities of uBO Scope that enable you to monitor and understand your browser’s network activity in real time. This page walks you through its essential features: how it tracks network requests, categorizes third-party connections on a per-tab basis, presents clear summary statistics in the popup UI and badge, and remains compatible with all content blockers.

## Overview of uBO Scope’s Core Features

### Real-Time Monitoring of Network Requests
uBO Scope listens to your browser's network events to capture every connection attempt and outcome, including allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked requests. This comprehensive monitoring lets you uncover all remote server connections your browser makes, regardless of which content blockers or filtering methods you use.

### Tab-Specific Third-Party Connection Tracking
The extension organizes connection data by browser tab, showing distinct counts for each third-party domain connected during that tab's session. This granularity helps you assess privacy exposure on a site-by-site basis accurately.

### Intuitive Summary Presentation through Popup and Badge
A concise connection summary is accessible via the extension's popup interface, breaking down the number of domains contacted according to the connection outcome:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Connections that were successful and permitted
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections suppressed silently to avoid webpage breakage or detection
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked by content blockers or network errors

The badge on the browser toolbar updates dynamically to show the count of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections for the active tab, delivering at-a-glance privacy insights.

### Seamless Support for Any Content Blocker
uBO Scope's design ensures it reports accurate connection outcomes no matter what content blocker is used, including DNS-based filters or stealthy blocking techniques. As long as the browser exposes network requests via its `webRequest` API, uBO Scope tracks them reliably.

---

## Typical User Workflow

1. **Open a Browser Tab and Browse:** As you navigate websites, uBO Scope silently captures the network requests your browser makes.

2. **Click the uBO Scope Icon:** The badge number instantly informs you of how many distinct third-party domains your current tab contacted without being blocked.

3. **Inspect the Popup UI:** Open the popup to see a detailed breakdown, including domain names and counts of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.

4. **Analyze Third-Party Connections:** Use this information to understand which external servers your browsing activity involves, helping you evaluate privacy exposure or filtration effectiveness.

5. **Monitor Continuously:** Refresh pages or open new tabs to watch live updates reflected on the badge and popup.

## Detailed Feature Descriptions

### Network Request Capture
uBO Scope uses browser APIs (`webRequest.onBeforeRedirect`, `onErrorOccurred`, and `onResponseStarted`) to capture network request events as they occur:

- **Success Events:** Record allowed network connections with status codes and IP data where available.
- **Error Events:** Record blocked or failed connection attempts signifying content blocking or network errors.
- **Redirect Events:** Categorized as stealth blocks to flag connections hidden by certain blocking techniques.

By consolidating these events, uBO Scope builds a comprehensive picture of your browser's network activity across tabs.

### Tab Data Management and Session Handling
Connection details are stored per tab session to maintain an accurate state of network activity:

- Each tab maintains counts of hostnames and domains contacted per outcome category: allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked.
- Main frame navigations reset the tab’s session data, ensuring fresh measurement for each page load.
- When tabs close, their data is cleared to preserve memory and relevance.

### Popup Interface Summary
The popup displays tab-specific data succinctly:

- **Tab Hostname and Domain:** Displayed at the top, with Unicode-friendly domain representation.
- **Connection Counts:** Number of distinct third-party domains contacted is prominently shown.
- **Sectioned Lists:** Domains are split into "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" sections, each listing domain names alongside how many requests were observed.

This organization helps users quickly assess the nature and scale of remote connections their browser encountered.

### Badge Updates
The extension badge reflects the real-time count of allowed third-party domains for the active tab:

- When no allowed third-party domains are present, the badge is blank, indicating minimal exposure.
- The number updates as network activity occurs, giving continuous feedback.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Focus on the Badge Number:** Use the badge count as your main privacy exposure metric—a lower number means fewer external parties seen.
- **Use the Popup for Deep Dives:** When concerned or curious, open the popup to get detailed domain-level insights.
- **Remember Stealth-Blocked Connections:** These represent connections silently blocked to avoid breaking websites—they are important for understanding true exposure.
- **Check Across Tabs:** Since data is tab-specific, monitor multiple tabs independently for accurate assessments.
- **Combine with Filter Lists Efforts:** If you maintain or evaluate filtering lists, leverage uBO Scope to verify the real-world impact of your rules.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **No Data in Popup:** Ensure you have an active tab loaded with network traffic. uBO Scope shows data only for the active tab.
- **Badge Not Updating:** Sometimes browser permission changes or background script restarts might temporarily delay badges. Switching tabs or refreshing should resolve this.
- **Missing Connections Due to Browser Limitations:** Requests initiated outside the `webRequest` API scope (like some WebSocket traffic) may not be tracked.

For setup issues, consult the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-run-usage/troubleshooting) page.

## Code Illustration: How Tab Data Aggregation Works

Below is a conceptual overview of how uBO Scope organizes and counts connections per tab and outcome.

```javascript
// Simplified pseudocode
function recordOutcome(tabId, request) {
    let tabDetails = session.tabIdToDetailsMap.get(tabId) || createNewTabDetails();
    let hostname = extractHostname(request.url);
    let domain = extractDomain(hostname);

    switch (request.event) {
       case 'success':
           addCount(tabDetails.allowed, hostname, domain);
           break;
       case 'redirect':
           addCount(tabDetails.stealth, hostname, domain);
           break;
       case 'error':
           addCount(tabDetails.blocked, hostname, domain);
           break;
    }

    session.tabIdToDetailsMap.set(tabId, tabDetails);
}

function addCount(outcomeMap, hostname, domain) {
    outcomeMap.hostnames[hostname] = (outcomeMap.hostnames[hostname] || 0) + 1;
    outcomeMap.domains[domain] = (outcomeMap.domains[domain] || 0) + 1;
}
```

This approach ensures detailed, accurate recording of connection outcomes.
