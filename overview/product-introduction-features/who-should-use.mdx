# Target Audience & Typical Use Cases

## Who Should Use uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is designed for users who value transparent insight into the network activity of websites they visit. Its primary audience consists of three distinct groups:

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Individuals who want to understand exactly which third-party servers their browser connects to when loading a webpage, allowing them to better safeguard their personal data.
- **Tech-Savvy Users:** Those with a more technical background interested in auditing network connections, verifying content blocker effectiveness, or investigating potentially hidden connections.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Developers and maintainers of ad/content blocker filter lists who require a reliable tool to audit real network requests even in environments where browser developer tools may be limited or unavailable.

By focusing on these groups, uBO Scope delivers precise, blocker-agnostic visibility into all attempted and successful remote server connections initiated during the browsing session.

## Typical Usage Scenarios

### 1. Verifying Actual Network Connections on a Site

Even with content blockers active, it can be unclear which third-party domains a webpage actually connects to. uBO Scope fills this gap by reporting every distinct third-party remote server connection attempted or completed in real-time. Users can quickly:

- Confirm whether a site is connecting to known trackers or advertisers.
- Identify unexpected or suspicious third parties.
- Validate that privacy settings or blockers are effectively limiting exposure.

This empowers users to make informed decisions about site trustworthiness and their own privacy posture.

### 2. Auditing Third-Party Communications in Restrictive Environments

Certain devices or browsers may restrict access to advanced developer tools or detailed network logs. For filter list maintainers or security auditors working in these constrained settings, uBO Scope offers an invaluable alternative to inspect network connections without relying on browser internals beyond the `webRequest` API.

Whether auditing connections on locked-down corporate machines, mobile browsers with limited tools, or testing filter lists for real-world accuracy, uBO Scope provides clear, accessible connection data.

### 3. Debunking Common Misconceptions About Content Blockers

Many users mistakenly judge content blocker effectiveness by the block count badge on the toolbar. uBO Scope reveals the true measure of privacy impact: the number of distinct third-party remote servers that remain connected despite blocking efforts.

By highlighting real third-party network exposure, uBO Scope helps users avoid the fallacy that higher block counts automatically equal better protection, teaching them to focus on the critical metric of distinct third-party connections.

## Scenarios Illustrated

### Scenario: A Privacy-Conscious User Browsing News Sites

Alice, a privacy-aware web user, opens her favorite news website. She wants to know if the site silently connects to advertising or tracking servers. With uBO Scope installed, she sees the badge count steadily showing multiple third-party domains as the page loads. Opening the popup, Alice sees a list of all domains contacted, categorized by their connection outcome, allowing her to decide if she wants to tighten her blocker settings or avoid the site.

### Scenario: A Filter List Maintainer Testing on a Locked-Down Browser

Bob, who maintains a filter list, needs to verify if his rules correctly block third-party requests on browsers that lack comprehensive developer tools. Using uBO Scope on such a browser, Bob sees precise, real-time connection data regardless of the blocking mechanisms in place. This helps him tune his list accurately to ensure effective filtering in real-world environments.

## Why uBO Scope Fits These Users

- **Accurate Connection Reporting:** By using the browser's `webRequest` API, uBO Scope delivers reliable data on all attempted and successful remote connections, independent of the content blockers installed.
- **Clear Metrics:** The toolbar badge counts distinct third-party server connections rather than just blocked requests, refocusing users on what actually affects privacy.
- **Simple, Focused UI:** The popup interface categorizes domains by connection outcome, making complex network data accessible and actionable.

<u>In summary, uBO Scope provides actionable insights that let users understand and control their third-party network exposure with confidence and clarity.</u>

## Practical Tips for Target Audiences

- Check the toolbar badge during browsing sessions to see your current third-party exposure at a glance.
- Use the popup details to investigate unknown or unexpected domains connecting behind the scenes.
- Filter list maintainers can combine uBO Scope with their testing routines to verify blocking effectiveness beyond artificial "ad blocker test" webpages.
- Privacy-conscious users should watch for connections to uncommon third-party domains — these may warrant added blocking or scrutiny.
