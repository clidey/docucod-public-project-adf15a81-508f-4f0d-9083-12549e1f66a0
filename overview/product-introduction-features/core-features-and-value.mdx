# Core Features and Value of uBO Scope

Discover how uBO Scope empowers you with transparency and clarity about all remote server connections your browser makes as you navigate the web. This page unpacks uBO Scope's core features that provide real-time insights into live domain connections, present credible tracking server counts resistant to content blocker variations, and debunk common misconceptions about content blocker effectiveness.

## At a Glance: What uBO Scope Brings to Your Browser

- **Live Domain Connection Reporting:** Instantly see which distinct domains a webpage connects to, categorized by whether requests were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- **Credible Third-Party Server Count Badge:** The toolbar badge displays a trustworthy count of unique third-party servers connected, independent of which content blocker is active.
- **Content-Blocker-Agnostic Tracking:** Utilizes the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network requests, unaffected by the type or presence of content blockers.
- **Myth Busting on Content Blocker Reliability:** Provides factual data to challenge common misunderstandings about content blocker effectiveness, especially concerning block counts and test results.

This page explains these features in the context of practical user benefits, helping you understand and manage your exposure to external web resources.

## Understanding the Core Features

### 1. Real-Time Domain Connection Reporting

uBO Scope monitors all network requests initiated by webpages and groups them into three key categories:

- **Allowed:** Domains with network requests that successfully connected and were not blocked by any content blocking mechanism.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains involved in redirects or connections hidden from webpages (e.g., via stealthy blockers).
- **Blocked:** Domains where the connection attempt failed due to blocking, including errors in reaching the target.

This categorization helps you see, at a glance, the nature of your browser's external connections for each tab, empowering informed decisions.

### 2. Toolbar Badge with Distinct Third-Party Server Count

The badge on the extension icon dynamically shows the count of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to:

- **Third-Party Focus:** It counts only third-party remote servers, excluding the main website’s domain, giving a clearer picture of external exposure.
- **Reliable Across Blockers:** The count reflects actual network requests reported through the browser's `webRequest` API and is agnostic to which content blocker is active, even accommodating those using DNS-level blocking or stealth techniques.
- **Lower Is Better:** A lower badge number means fewer external servers reached, which usually indicates less tracking and better privacy.

### 3. Integration with the Browser's WebRequest API

uBO Scope leverages the webRequest API to observe network activity including:

- **Redirects:** Tracks when requests are redirected, helping identify stealthy loading chains.
- **Errors:** Detects failed connection attempts, indicating blocked or unreachable domains.
- **Responses:** Captures successful responses with IP and status codes to confirm allowed connections.

By using this API, uBO Scope accurately reports network outcomes regardless of the underlying content blocking solution, providing a neutral and comprehensive perspective.

### 4. Practical Aid for Debunking Common Myths

Many users misunderstand content blocker effectiveness based on:

- **Block Count Misinterpretation:** A toolbar showing a higher number of blocked requests does NOT necessarily mean better blocking. Instead, it could correspond to more overall third-party connections occurring.
- **Faulty Ad Blocker Tests:** Many ad blocker test webpages rely on unrealistic scenarios and cannot detect stealthy content blocking techniques, leading to misleading assessments.

uBO Scope helps clarify these misconceptions by showing actual network connections and outcomes independent from skewed block counts or flawed tests.

## Real-World Impact: When uBO Scope Makes a Difference

### Preserve Privacy and Control
See the full scope of third-party tracking attempts invisible to the webpage itself. By knowing which domains connect and their status,
- You gain clearer insights into potential privacy risks.
- You can assess how well your current content blockers or DNS settings protect you.

### Validate Content Blocker Behavior
Filter list maintainers and advanced users can use uBO Scope to:
- Verify if blocked domains correspond with intended filter rules.
- Detect stealth-blocked domains otherwise hard to observe.
- Understand true exposure beyond simplistic blocker badges.

### Make Informed Decisions
Instead of relying on indirect metrics or impressions, rely on concrete data regarding network connections to manage your online security and customize blocking strategies based on actual data.

## Practical Tips for Using uBO Scope

- **Check the Toolbar Badge Regularly:** Use the badge count as a snapshot to detect changes in third-party exposure when browsing or after installing new extensions.
- **Open the Popup for Details:** Click the extension icon to see categorized lists of domain connections by status to better understand what's allowed or blocked.
- **Interpret Counts in Context:** Remember, not all third-party requests are malicious—common CDNs and legitimate services may show up.
- **Use uBO Scope to Troubleshoot:** If you suspect your content blocker is underperforming, uBO Scope can give you objective data to confirm.
