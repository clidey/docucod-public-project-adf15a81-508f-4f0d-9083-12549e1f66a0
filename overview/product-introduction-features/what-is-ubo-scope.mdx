# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlocking Visibility: Your Window into Webpage Connections

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension that transparently reveals every attempted or successful connection a webpage makes to remote servers. While most content blockers show what they block, uBO Scope shows what actually reaches out from your browser — regardless of which content blocker or DNS filtering solution you use. This insight is crucial in understanding your online privacy and the true landscape of third-party connections.

### Why uBO Scope Matters
- **Transparent connection reporting**: See all third-party servers a webpage tries to contact, even if blocked elsewhere.
- **Bypass content blocker limitations**: Understand network requests regardless of content blockers or DNS filtering in place.
- **Empowers privacy-aware users**: Identify unwanted remote server contacts that may affect your privacy.
- **Supports filter list maintainers**: Provides data to validate and improve blocking rules based on actual connections.
- **Simple, lightweight, and unobtrusive**: Designed to reveal information without interfering with your browsing.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?
- Privacy enthusiasts wanting to see real network activity beyond block counts.
- Developers and filter list creators who need accurate connection data to refine filters.
- Anyone curious about which third-party servers their visited websites are accessing.

## What is uBO Scope?

### A Clear Definition
uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to monitor and report the network connections initiated by any webpage in your browser. It detects and displays all remote server requests, whether these requests succeed, are stealthily blocked, or fail, offering a transparent view into the web's background activity.

### Core Purpose
While content blockers focus on blocking unwanted connections, they often do not reveal the true count or identity of third-party remote servers contacted by webpages. uBO Scope fills this gap by giving you a detailed report of every remote server contacted from the page, allowing you to verify exactly what your browser is connecting to.

### Why This Transparency is Crucial
Many users mistakenly judge content blockers by their block counts, thinking a higher block count means better protection. However, a higher block count can mean a blocker is allowing more distinct third-party connections, potentially exposing users more than lower block count alternatives. uBO Scope removes this confusion by showing the count and identity of connected remote servers — the real metric that affects privacy.

### How uBO Scope Works at a Glance
uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to listen in on network requests initiated by webpages. This API reports all network activity visible to the browser, including tasks blocked by content blockers or DNS filters, as long as they are within the browser's network stack. This ensures uBO Scope can reveal all attempted or successful connections, providing a true picture of remote server interactions.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### 1. Comprehensive Connection Reporting
uBO Scope tracks every network request triggered by a webpage, categorizing them as:
- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** Requests that complete successfully.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked or failed with errors.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Redirects or filtered requests captured transparently.

This categorization helps you understand the exact outcome of each request.

### 2. Toolbar Badge with Real-Time Count
The extension icon displays a dynamic badge representing the number of distinct third-party domains that have been contacted (allowed). This count focuses on the domains actually contacted, not just the number of requests, highlighting true third-party exposure.

### 3. Independent of Content Blocker or DNS Filtering
uBO Scope works alongside any content blocker or DNS-based filter by observing network requests regardless of filtering technology, provided the request flows through the browser's `webRequest` system.

### 4. Detailed Popup Interface
Clicking the extension icon opens a popup showing the list of connected domains, classified by their request outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked), along with counts of requests per domain.

### 5. Useful to Filter List Maintainers
Because it records exact remote server contacts, uBO Scope aids filter list developers by providing accurate data on which domains are contacted and their blocking status.

### Real-World Example
Imagine visiting a news website with multiple embedded advertisements, analytics, and content delivery networks (CDNs). uBO Scope will report:
- The main site's domains contacted.
- Third-party ad and tracking servers contacted (allowed or blocked).
- CDN servers delivering static content.

This empowers you to assess the true third-party footprint of the webpage.

## Why Should I Care?

### Understand Your Exposure
Knowing which third-party servers your browser connects to is fundamental for online privacy. This awareness lets you:
- Identify potentially unwanted trackers or ad servers.
- Review if your content blockers or DNS filters are effectively stopping connections.
- Evaluate the quality of your content blocker beyond block counts.

### Avoid Common Misconceptions
- _Block count ≠ protection level_: uBO Scope clarifies that a high block count is not necessarily better protection.
- _Ad blocker test pages are unreliable_: uBO Scope helps debunk misleading test results from synthetic "ad blocker test" sites.

### Make Informed Decisions
By exposing all third-party connections, you can decide:
- Whether to adjust your filter lists.
- Which domains you trust.
- How to improve your browser privacy setup.

### Efficiency Gains for Filter Maintainers
Filter maintainers gain precise telemetry on what domains to include or exclude to optimize filter effectiveness, especially on systems with limited tooling.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blocker to evaluate its real-world effectiveness.
- Don’t rely on extension block counts alone; assess your third-party exposure via uBO Scope.
- Regularly check connection reports to identify new or unexpected third parties.

## Common Pitfalls

- Extensions or browsers that do not implement or expose the `webRequest` API fully will limit uBO Scope’s visibility.
- Network activity from outside the browser’s network stack (e.g., native apps) will not be visible.

uBO Scope isn’t about blocking itself; it’s about empowering you with clarity and data. With transparent visibility into your browser’s network interactions, it serves as a vital tool to enhance privacy and refine blocking strategies—one connection at a time.
