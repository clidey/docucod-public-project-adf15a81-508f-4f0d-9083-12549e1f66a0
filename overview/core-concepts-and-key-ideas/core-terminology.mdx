# Key Terms Used in uBO Scope

Understanding the precise meaning of terms and indicators in uBO Scope empowers you to interpret its data accurately and make informed decisions about your browsing security and privacy.

---

## Third-Party Remote Server

In the context of uBO Scope, a *third-party remote server* refers to any server that a webpage connects to that is different from the primary website's domain currently displayed in your browser's address bar.

- These servers often deliver resources like ads, trackers, analytics, or CDN content.
- uBO Scope counts and displays connections to these servers to reveal the full scope of remote interactions triggered by the webpage.

*Why it matters:* Tracking third-party servers helps you understand which external entities your browsing activity might be exposing data to.

---

## webRequest API

The `webRequest` API is a browser feature that allows extensions like uBO Scope to observe and analyze network requests initiated by webpages.

- It provides hooks for monitoring every request's start, redirect, success, and failure.
- uBO Scope uses this API to capture detailed outcomes of network connections regardless of content blocking status.

*Benefit:* This reliable event capture means uBO Scope gives you an accurate picture of network activity, including allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.

---

## Public Suffix

A *public suffix* is the portion of a domain name under which users can directly register names. Examples include `.com`, `.co.uk`, or `.app`.

- uBO Scope leverages Mozilla’s [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/list/) to correctly identify domains and subdomains.
- Accurately identifying public suffixes is critical for distinguishing between the registered domain and subdomains, which influences connection classification.

*In practice:* When uBO Scope reports connections, it uses public suffix logic to determine the registrable domain, which helps classify connections as first-party or third-party.

## Visual Indicators in uBO Scope UI

uBO Scope presents network connection data using clear visual cues to help users quickly interpret the information.

### Badge Count on Toolbar Icon

- Displays the number of **distinct third-party remote server domains** connected during your active tab session.
- A **lower badge count is better**, indicating fewer third-party connections.

### Outcome Categories in the Popup Panel

uBO Scope divides network connections into three main categories, each presented in its own section:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Connections that were permitted to complete successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were prevented by content blocking but attempted to redirect or evade detection.
- **Blocked:** Connections that were completely blocked and failed to occur.

Each category lists domains along with a count of how many times connections to those domains occurred.

### Domain and Count Rows

- Domains are shown in Unicode for readability, with counts indicating the frequency of connections.
- This granular data lets you see which domains are most active.

---

## Practical Examples

- If you visit a news website and see a badge count of "5", it means five distinct third-party domains were contacted.
- The popup might show `allowed` connections to major CDNs, `stealth-blocked` connections to suspicious tracking domains, and `blocked` connections to known ad servers.

This insight helps you understand the external footprint of what you’re browsing.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Tips

- **Assuming high block count means better blocking:** A high blocked count does not guarantee that fewer third-party domains get loaded, as some allowed connections could still fetch resources from many domains.
- **Ignoring stealth-blocked domains:** These are important as some connections try to bypass blockers and pose privacy risks.
- **Misinterpreting badge count:** The badge counts domains, not individual connections, so a repeated connection to the same domain counts once for badge display but is tracked by frequency in the popup.

*Tip:* Regularly review both the badge and the popup panel for a clear understanding of your tab’s network activity.
