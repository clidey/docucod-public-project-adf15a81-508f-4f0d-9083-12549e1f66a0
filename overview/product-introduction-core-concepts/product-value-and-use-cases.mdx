# Value Proposition & Target Use Cases

## Why uBO Scope Matters

In a digital landscape where privacy is paramount and online trackers are increasingly stealthy, uBO Scope empowers you with unparalleled transparency into your browser’s network activity. It is essential for privacy-conscious users, filter list maintainers, and anyone who wants to understand the true behavior of webpages behind the scenes.

### Empower Your Privacy and Security Awareness
With uBO Scope, you can see every actual connection your browser attempts or successfully makes to remote servers. This visibility helps clarify which third-party domains your web activities are exposing you to — information that traditional tools or content blockers obscure or fail to clearly report.

### Make Objective Content Blocker Comparisons
uBO Scope shines as an unbiased observer, measuring network requests regardless of which content blocker you use, including those blocking at the DNS level. This makes it a valuable tool to objectively compare the effectiveness of different content blockers based on real-world network activity rather than unreliable block counts or misleading web tests.

### Work Around Device and Tool Limitations
Many devices or environments lack the rich developer tool access typically required to monitor network connections. uBO Scope operates as a lightweight, browser extension-based tool that works seamlessly without the need for specialized debugging interfaces.

## Target Audience
- **Privacy-conscious users** who demand transparency about which servers their browser communicates with.
- **Filter list maintainers** ensuring their rules effectively prevent unwanted network requests.
- **Security auditors and analysts** requiring accurate network connection data.
- **Users on restricted or less-featured devices** lacking advanced developer tools.
- **Anyone wishing to objectively compare content blocker effectiveness** under real browser conditions.

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. Comparing Content Blockers on Real Web Traffic
Many users mistakenly rely on block counts or ad blocker test pages to determine which content blocker is superior. However, higher block counts often mean your browser still communicates with more distinct third-party domains, reducing actual privacy. uBO Scope clarifies this by showing the count of unique third-party remote connections that succeeded.

### 2. Debunking Misconceptions About Ad Blocker Test Sites
Online "ad blocker test" pages generate artificial requests designed to detect blocking, but do not mimic real-world browsing. uBO Scope helps you avoid these misleading tests by showing actual network connection data on real webpages, ensuring your privacy choices are guided by reality, not synthetic benchmarks.

### 3. Monitoring Network Activity with Limited Developer Tools
If you're on devices that don’t support advanced browser developer tools—such as some mobile devices or restrictive enterprise environments—uBO Scope provides an essential alternative. It delivers clear and accessible insights directly via the extension popup, showing counts and lists of connected domains categorized by allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked status.

### 4. Filter List Maintenance and Validation
Maintainers can leverage uBO Scope to validate how well their filters perform in the wild. By observing the domains blocked or allowed in genuine network traffic, maintainers gain actionable insights to refine and improve filter list rules.

### 5. Investigating Unexpected Network Activity
If you suspect a website or browser extension is connecting to suspicious or obscure domains, uBO Scope quickly lists these distinct network connections, aiding in investigative and corrective actions.

## Key Benefits at a Glance

- **Complete transparency:** See all network attempts, including successful connections, redirects, and blocked requests.
- **Objective metrics:** Base decisions on the number of distinct third-party domains contacted, not misleading block counts.
- **User-friendly interface:** Instantly view categorized network domains through the popup UI with simple domain counts.
- **Cross-browser compatibility:** Supports major browsers without needing external tools or permissions beyond webRequest.
- **Private and local:** Data collection and processing happen solely within your browser extension, ensuring privacy.
