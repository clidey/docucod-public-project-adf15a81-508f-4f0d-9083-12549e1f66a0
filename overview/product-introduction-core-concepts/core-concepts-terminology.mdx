# Core Concepts & Key Terminology

Understanding uBO Scope starts with grasping the fundamental terms it uses to track and analyze browser network activity. This page defines key concepts such as third-party remote servers, network requests, the browser's `webRequest` API, and the badge count indicator. Clear knowledge of these terms empowers you to make meaningful interpretations of uBO Scope's data and maximize its privacy and security benefits.

## What Are Third-Party Remote Servers?

A **third-party remote server** is any server contacted by your browser that is different from the main website you have loaded. For example, if you visit `https://example.com` and it fetches resources from `cdn.examplecdn.com`, the latter is a third-party server.

uBO Scope counts these distinct third-party domains to give a transparent overview of all external connections a webpage attempts or completes. This helps you identify how many unique external services your browser interacts with beyond the site you expressly visited.

**Why it matters:** Tracking such servers reveals hidden data flows that usually go unnoticed, spotlighting potential privacy leaks or unnecessary connections.

| Term                | Explanation                                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| First-party server   | The server matching the domain of the visited site |
| Third-party server   | Any external domain different from the visited site |


## Network Requests in uBO Scope

Every time your browser fetches a resource — whether a script, an image, a font, or a websocket connection — it generates a **network request**. uBO Scope intercepts these requests to determine their fate:

- Were they allowed and successfully connected?
- Were they stealthily redirected?
- Were they blocked or failed?

This monitoring is done regardless of any content blocking solution currently active since uBO Scope listens directly to the browser's network events.

**Common states tracked**:

- **Success:** Network request completed with a response.
- **Redirect:** The request was redirected to another URL, possibly stealthily.
- **Error:** The request failed or was blocked.


## The Browser's `webRequest` API

uBO Scope relies heavily on the browser’s `webRequest` API — a powerful interface browsers expose that notifies extensions about the lifecycle of network requests.

This API provides events such as:

- `onBeforeRedirect`
- `onErrorOccurred`
- `onResponseStarted`

These events allow uBO Scope to queue and analyze each network request's journey, assembling a detailed log of third-party connections.

**Key points:**

- These APIs capture requests made within the browser context, including those affected by DNS or other blocking mechanisms.
- Requests not reported by this API (e.g., made by external native apps or out-of-browser processes) are not tracked.


## What the Badge Count Represents

The uBO Scope browser extension icon's **badge** displays a numeric count reflecting:

> The number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to for the active tab.

- A lower badge count indicates fewer external connections, generally implying a more controlled network environment.
- The badge count updates dynamically as new network requests succeed or fail.

By monitoring this count, you gain immediate insight into the external network footprint of the webpage you’re visiting.


## How uBO Scope Interprets These Concepts in Practice

When you navigate to a webpage, uBO Scope:

1. **Identifies the first-party hostname and domain** based on the main document URL.
2. **Tracks all network requests** initiated by that tab.
3. **Classifies each request outcome** as allowed (successful), stealth (redirected in a manner typically bypassed by some blockers), or blocked (failed or explicitly canceled).
4. **Aggregates distinct hostnames and domains** involved in these outcomes.
5. **Updates the badge count** to reflect the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.

By clearly separating these states, uBO Scope empowers you to understand not just which connections occurred, but also what was stealthily allowed or explicitly blocked.


## Tips for Success and Common Pitfalls

- **Recognize the badge count is a privacy indicator, not a block efficiency metric.** A higher number means more third-party connections, which may or may not be desirable depending on context.

- **Not all third parties are harmful.** Many legitimate sites utilize a few trusted CDNs or analytics providers. Look for surprising or unknown domains.

- **Stealthed redirects often indicate subtle resource loading tricks** that typical blockers may not catch.

- **If the badge count is unexpectedly low or empty, verify your browser supports the `webRequest` API during your browsing session.**

- **Closing tabs clears their session data, ensuring fresh tracking for new navigation.**


## Real-World Example

Imagine you visit `https://mynews.example`:

- uBO Scope sets `mynews.example` as the first-party domain.
- The page loads images and scripts from `cdn.fastcdn.com`, `tracker.analytics.io`, and `ads.adnetwork.net`.
- uBO Scope logs success for `cdn.fastcdn.com`, stealth redirects for `tracker.analytics.io`, and errors for blocked requests to `ads.adnetwork.net`.
- Your badge count shows **2** (the two allowed distinct third-party domains).
- You can inspect these details in the popup to decide if the stealth or blocked connections require attention.
