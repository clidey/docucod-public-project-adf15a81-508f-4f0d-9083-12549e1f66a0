# What is uBO Scope?

## Unveiling the Hidden Network Connections of the Web

Modern web pages are bustling hubs of activity under the surface. Every page you load may silently make numerous attempts to connect to remote servers—some successful, others blocked or stealthily redirected. These network interactions can affect your privacy, security, and browsing experience, but without specialized tools, they remain hidden. **uBO Scope** is a focused, lightweight browser extension designed to lift this veil.

By revealing **all attempted or successful connections to remote servers** made by the webpages you visit, uBO Scope empowers you with transparency about your browser’s network activity. Understanding these connections helps you spot unwanted trackers, verify content blockers’ effectiveness, and maintain tighter control over your online footprint.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **See every third-party connection attempt:** Discover which remote servers your browser attempts to communicate with, whether allowed, blocked, or redirected.
- **Gain privacy insights:** Identify unexpected or stealthy network activity that could compromise your privacy.
- **Transparency beyond blockers:** Verify which connections content blockers allow or deny, cutting through misleading block counts.
- **Simplified, real-time visibility:** An intuitive badge count and popup interface summarize network connections for the active tab.

### Designed For

- Privacy-conscious users wanting to audit webpage network behavior.
- Filter list maintainers seeking clear visibility of network requests.
- Security auditors needing an independent view of attempted connections.
- Anyone curious about the behind-the-scenes network activity of the sites they visit.

## What Exactly is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a **companion browser extension** to content blockers like uBlock Origin. It monitors and reports **every network request initiated by webpages** within your browser, using the browser's `webRequest` API hooks.

Unlike most tools that focus on blocking content, uBO Scope’s core aim is transparency: it doesn’t block or alter requests but catalogues the outcome—whether the request succeeded, was blocked, or stealthily redirected.

**Key Points:**
- Tracks network requests on the tab level, associating domains and hostnames.
- Differentiates between allowed (successful), stealth-blocked (e.g., redirects or soft blocks), and explicitly blocked requests.
- Uses a badge counter on the toolbar icon to display **the number of distinct third-party domains connected per tab**.

By capturing detailed connection outcomes, uBO Scope demystifies the hidden web traffic that standard tools or browsers' developer consoles may not reveal easily.

## Core Features & Capabilities

### 1. Comprehensive Network Request Tracking

Monitors all HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and secure WebSocket (`wss://`) requests made by the active page in real-time.

- Captures requests regardless of content blocker states—whether blocked by extensions, DNS, or otherwise.
- Classifies requests as **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, or **blocked**, offering nuanced insight.

### 2. Real-Time Badge Count per Active Tab

Displays a clear badge on the extension's toolbar icon showing the total count of distinct third-party domains connected in the current tab.

- Encourages minimizing third-party connections for privacy and performance.
- Reacts dynamically as you navigate pages or tabs close.

### 3. Detailed Popup Interface

Clicking the toolbar icon opens a popup that breaks down the network connections:

- Lists all connected domains grouped by their outcome: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
- Shows request counts next to each domain for deeper analysis.
- Converts punycode domains to readable Unicode for clarity.

### 4. Persistence and Session Awareness

Tracks session data to maintain details per tab and updates dynamically as browsing progresses.

- Resets data cleanly when you navigate or close tabs.
- Preserves data in session storage for consistent user experience.

### 5. Cross-Browser Support

Designed to work with major browsers supporting `webRequest` API, including Chromium, Firefox, and Safari, following manifest version 3 standards.

## Why Should You Care?

### Gain Full Transparency into Network Activity

Without uBO Scope, you only see that a webpage loaded, but not where exactly it's reaching out. Many pages pull resources from dozens of third-party servers silently—some for ads, metrics, or trackers.

uBO Scope exposes hidden network requests, enabling you to make informed decisions.

### Validate Content Blockers Effectiveness

Popular content blockers show block counts, but more blocks don't always mean better privacy.

uBO Scope’s domain-level insights allow you to distinguish between:
- High block counts that still permit many third-party connections.
- Low block counts that effectively reduce distinct third-party servers.

See the real impact on your browsing without misleading metrics.

### Empower Audits and Filter Maintenance

For filter list maintainers or privacy auditors, uBO Scope provides ground-truth data on what domains are truly contacted per page, helping refine blocking rules and detect stealthy requests.

### Enhance Your Online Privacy and Security

Identify unknown or suspicious remote servers contacted by the pages you visit, giving you a chance to scrutinize or avoid them.

## Getting Started Preview

### Quick Start

After installing uBO Scope from your browser’s extension store, start browsing as usual. Observe the badge count increment to reflect live third-party connections on each tab.

Click the toolbar icon to open the popup where you can explore detailed lists of connected domains categorized by request outcome.

### Prerequisites

- Compatible browser (Chrome 122+, Firefox 128+, Safari 18.5+).
- Permissions granted for webRequest and storage (handled during installation).

### Next Steps

- Explore the [Feature Overview & Quick Start Guide](/overview/architecture-features-quickstart/feature-overview-quickstart) for deeper usage tips.
- Review [Interpreting Badge Numbers and Domain Lists](/guides/workflows-usage/interpreting-badge) for practical reading of connection data.

<Tip>
Remember, a **lower badge count is better**: it indicates fewer distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to, reducing your exposure.
</Tip>

<Warning>
uBO Scope can only report network requests observable via the browser's `webRequest` API. Some internal browser requests or unusual network activities outside this scope may not be visible.
</Warning>

By making the invisible visible, uBO Scope equips you with knowledge to browse smarter, safer, and more privately. Dive in and discover the full story behind every webpage’s network footprint.
