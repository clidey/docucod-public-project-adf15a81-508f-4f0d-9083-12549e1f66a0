## Empowering Privacy-Conscious Users

If you’re deeply concerned about online privacy and want a clear picture of what your browser really connects to, uBO Scope is your window into third-party network activity. Unlike traditional content blockers that just show counts or block statuses, uBO Scope reveals all remote server connections, whether allowed or blocked.

### What You Get:
- **Transparent Network Awareness:** See exactly which third-party domains your browser attempts to contact.
- **Real-Time Insights:** The badge count reflects distinct third-party servers connected per tab, helping you keep unwanted tracking in check.
- **Myth Busting:** Avoid misleading metrics from block counts or unreliable "ad blocker test" sites by relying on actual network outcomes.

### Real Scenario:
Imagine browsing a news website and wondering which external domains are silently contacted behind the scenes. With uBO Scope, you can instantly verify if your existing content blocker is truly effective or if unexpected connections are slipping through.

## Filter List Authors and Maintainers

uBO Scope extends powerful diagnostic capabilities to filter list authors who build and maintain third-party blocking rules. It allows them to validate the effectiveness of their filters directly from the browser environment without relying on external test pages or guesswork.

### Why It Matters:
- **Direct Feedback:** Confirm your filter rules by seeing whether network requests are blocked, allowed, or stealth-blocked (hidden from the page).
- **Enhanced Debugging:** Detect subtle cases where requests are redirected or blocked stealthily, which typical tools might miss.
- **Cross-Environment Validation:** Test filter performance on different browsers and locked-down devices where developer tools are limited.

### Practical Use Case:
If you release updated filters for a popular ad blocker, you can immediately observe the real impact on network requests in various browsing environments, ensuring your updates maintain expected behavior.

## Users Testing Restrictive or Locked-Down Environments

Some users operate browsers on devices or networks that impose strict restrictions—like corporate firewalls, DNS-level filtering, or locked-down devices with limited access to debugging tools. uBO Scope shines in those situations by leveraging native browser `webRequest` APIs to expose connection outcomes regardless of how the blocking is enforced.

### Benefits Include:
- **Bypassing Limitations:** Monitor remote server connections even when traditional debugging or filtering transparency tools are unavailable.
- **Confirming Network Behavior:** Understand exactly what your browser attempts and succeeds or fails to connect to, irrespective of content blocker or DNS configuration.
- **Supporting Compliance and Audits:** Provide tangible evidence of network restrictions or filters in place for security or policy verification.

### Example:
You're on a highly restricted company laptop where installing developer extensions or accessing advanced firewall logs is impossible. Using uBO Scope, you can still audit the browser connections to ensure compliance with company policies or diagnose unexpected connectivity issues.
