# Getting Started: Quick Tour

Welcome to your first step with uBO Scope! This quick tour will guide you through installing the extension, accessing its core interface, and understanding the essential information it provides. Our goal is to help you unlock immediate value by confidently interpreting real-time network connection data with minimal effort.

---

## Installing uBO Scope

uBO Scope is available on all major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. To start:

1. **Add the extension from the official browser store:**
   - For Chrome-based browsers, visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).
   - For Firefox, use the [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/) page.
   - Safari support requires version 18.5 or later.

2. **Confirm permissions:**
   uBO Scope requires permission to monitor web requests (`webRequest`), access active tabs, and store data. This enables accurate detection and categorization of remote server connections.

3. **Verify installation:**
   After adding the extension, you will see the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar.


## Accessing the Toolbar Badge

Once installed, uBO Scope immediately starts monitoring network connections made by active web pages:

- **Badge Count:** The number displayed on the toolbar icon shows the **number of distinct third-party domains connected to** by the current active tab.
- **Interpreting the Badge:** A lower number means fewer distinct third-party connections, which generally indicates a reduced exposure surface to trackers or unwanted domains.

The badge updates dynamically as you browse, providing an always-visible summary of a page’s network activity.


## Opening and Using the Popup Interface

Click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to open the detailed popup interface:

- **Current page hostname and domain** are displayed at the top, helping you confirm which site’s connections you’re viewing.
- **Domain Lists:** The popup categorizes third-party domains connected during the current browsing session into three sections:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains that the page successfully connected to without blocking.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were redirected stealthily, often by content blockers operating silently.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were blocked outright.
- Each domain shows the count of connection attempts, offering insight into the frequency of network interactions.

This organized view empowers you to quickly distinguish between legitimate and potentially unwanted third-party connections.


## Understanding Domain and Block Status Lists

The domain lists are your core tool to audit network behavior:

- Use the **Not Blocked** list to identify third parties actively communicating with the page.
- The **Stealth-Blocked** list reveals connections silently redirected to block unwanted content, helping you understand stealthy protections in place.
- The **Blocked** list shows explicitly denied network requests.

By glancing through these lists, you can spot unusual domains or unexpectedly high connection counts, enabling informed decisions about privacy and security.


## How to Get Immediate Value

Here's a simple user flow to maximize your first visit with uBO Scope:

1. Navigate to a website you want to audit.
2. Observe the badge: a concise indicator of distinct third-party connections.
3. Click the toolbar icon to open the popup.
4. Review domain lists, focusing on unexpected or unrecognized domains.
5. If you notice suspicious domains or high counts, consider reviewing your content blocker settings or investigate further in related tools.


## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Frequent use in new tabs:** uBO Scope tracks connections per tab session, so open new tabs to monitor different sites independently.
- **Regular auditing:** Use the popup for deeper inspection especially on sites where privacy is a concern.
- **Complement your blockers:** uBO Scope does not block connections but helps you verify what is blocked or allowed, improving your confidence in existing privacy tools.


## Common Pitfalls

- **No badge count visible?** Ensure the extension is enabled and permissions are granted.
- **Popup shows NO DATA:** This may happen on new tabs without loaded pages, or pages that do not trigger network requests recognized by the extension.
- **Interpreting counts:** Remember, a higher block count does not necessarily indicate better blocking. Focus on domains connected rather than just block metrics.


## Next Steps

After completing this quick tour, enhance your knowledge and workflow by exploring:

- [Core Concepts & Terminology](/overview/core_concepts_architecture/core_concepts) to understand connection outcomes and stealth blocking.
- [Popup Usage guide](/guides/analyzing-connections/using-popup) for expert tips on the popup interface.
- [Best Practices](/guides/best-practices/interpreting-stealth) for interpreting stealth and blocked connections.

These resources will turn your quick start into deeper mastery.

## Troubleshooting Quick Checks

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Quick Checks">
<Accordion title="No badge count appears on toolbar icon">
- Make sure the extension is enabled in your browser’s extension/add-on manager.
- Confirm you visited an HTTP(S) or WebSocket page that triggers network requests.
- Try refreshing the page or opening a new tab with an active website.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Popup shows NO DATA or empty lists">
- The active tab may not have network activity yet; reload the tab.
- Confirm the tab is not a browser internal page (which browsers may restrict).
- Verify your browser and uBO Scope extension have the latest versions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Count seems inaccurate or stuck">
- Network events are processed asynchronously; wait a few seconds for updates.
- Closing and reopening the tab resets tracking for that tab.
- If issues persist, restart the browser.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
