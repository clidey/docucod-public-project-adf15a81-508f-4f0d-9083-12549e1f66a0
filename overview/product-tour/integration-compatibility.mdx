# Browser Support & Compatibility

Explore which browsers uBO Scope supports, how it integrates transparently with various content blockers, and understand any technical constraints due to browser APIs. This guide will also walk you through the straightforward installation process across platforms.

---

## Supported Browsers

uBO Scope is built for compatibility with the most widely used desktop and mobile browsers, ensuring your privacy analysis is seamless regardless of your browsing environment.

- **Google Chrome (Chromium-based browsers):** Requires Chrome 122 or later. Supports the Manifest V3 extension architecture with a service worker background script.
- **Mozilla Firefox:** Requires Firefox 128 or later on desktop and Android. Fully supports Manifest V3 with background scripts.
- **Apple Safari:** Supports Safari 18.5 and later with a module-type background script.

All supported browsers offer the required permissions and APIs, including the critical `webRequest` API, which enables uBO Scope to monitor network connections.

### Why These Versions?

Each listed minimum browser version provides necessary support for Manifest V3 features and the essential browser APIs that uBO Scope relies on. This ensures reliable data capture and avoids compatibility pitfalls.

## Seamless Integration with Content Blockers

uBO Scope functions as a companion extension to popular content blockers like uBlock Origin, but does not interfere or depend on any particular blocker:

- It listens to network requests through the browser’s native `webRequest` API, independent of which content blocker is active.
- It accurately reports the outcome of network requests (allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked) regardless of blocking method, including DNS-based blocking.
- Because it operates at the network request level, it works alongside any content blocker without affecting its functionality or performance.

This means you can continue using your preferred blocker, and uBO Scope will provide an unbiased, real-time window into actual third-party connections.

## Technical Limitations Imposed by Browser APIs

While uBO Scope leverages powerful browser capabilities, some limitations are inherent due to browser API constraints:

- **Scope of Monitoring:** Network requests invisible to the `webRequest` API, such as some WebSocket or fetch requests initiated outside the browser context, cannot be reported.
- **Permission Boundaries:** Full host permissions (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, and WebSocket variants) are required to monitor all relevant requests; browsers may prompt for these during installation.
- **Service Worker Lifecycle:** The service worker background in Chromium-based browsers can be suspended and restarted, but uBO Scope handles this gracefully to maintain accurate session data.

These boundaries ensure that uBO Scope reports with maximum accuracy possible within the browser's security model.

## Installation Simplicity Across Platforms

Getting uBO Scope up and running is quick and simple:

- Find the extension in the official web stores relevant to your browser:
  - Chrome Web Store for Chromium browsers
  - Firefox Add-ons for Firefox
  - Safari Extensions Gallery for Safari

- Installation includes granting standard permissions essential for operation.

- Post-installation, uBO Scope immediately begins monitoring third-party connections.

The extension includes no complex configuration steps, making it accessible for users of all levels.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Grant Full Permissions:** For the most comprehensive monitoring, ensure uBO Scope has permissions to monitor all relevant URLs.
- **Keep Browser Updated:** Periodic browser updates improve API stability, enhancing uBO Scope’s accuracy and compatibility.
- **Combine with Your Content Blocker:** Use uBO Scope alongside your chosen content blocker to validate its effectiveness transparently.

## Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Extension Does Not Appear to Track Requests">
Verify if the browser version meets the minimum requirement. Reinstall the extension ensuring all requested permissions are granted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Installation Blocked or Permissions Denied">
Some browsers restrict extensions' permissions. Check browser security settings and allow uBO Scope the requested host access.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Badge Counts or Missing Data">
Reload the browser tab or restart the browser to refresh background processes. Confirm no conflicting extensions interfere with request reporting.
