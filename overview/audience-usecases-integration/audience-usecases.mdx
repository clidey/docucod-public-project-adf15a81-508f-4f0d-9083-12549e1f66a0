## Empowering Privacy Professionals

If you are focused on maintaining the highest standards of privacy and want to verify exactly which third-party servers your browser is contacting during web sessions, uBO Scope is designed for you.

- **Why It Matters:** Privacy professionals need clear, factual data on distinct third-party connections, beyond simplistic block counts.
- **Typical Use Cases:** Auditing privacy posture, validating the effectiveness of browser-based content blocking or network-level filtering, and ensuring minimal exposure to unwanted remote servers.

### Scenario Example
Imagine you manage browser security policies across an organization and want to verify that your privacy extensions are strictly limiting exposure to third-party networks. uBO Scope provides a precise count and status of connected domains directly in your browser toolbar and detailed insights via its popup panel.

## Assisting Filter List Maintainers

For those who develop or maintain filter lists for content blockers, maintaining accuracy is critical. uBO Scope serves as an indispensable tool to validate your lists' real-world effectiveness.

- **Primary Benefit:** Measure actual third-party connection attempts and outcomes, enabling you to refine lists based on true network activity.
- **Use Case:** Cross-checking which domains are stealth-blocked, blocked, or allowed helps to identify false negatives or positives in your filters.

### Scenario Example
You are updating a filter list and need to verify if the new rules effectively block intended third-party domains while avoiding overblocking. By running uBO Scope alongside your filter, you can observe the live connection outcomes and adjust your list accordingly.

## Power Users and Security-Conscious Individuals

Users who want to gain deeper insight into their browsing footprint will find uBO Scope invaluable.

- **What You Gain:** Transparency about network requests that occur behind the scenes when visiting websites.
- **Why You Should Care:** Even with popular blockers installed, stealth connections or connections affected by DNS-level filtering can be uncovered and verified.

### Scenario Example
You're curious whether a particular website or extension is making unexpected or hidden connections to external servers. Use uBO Scope’s popup to see the breakdown of all domains connected during your browsing session, classified by allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections.

## Optimizing Use on Locked-Down or Restricted Devices

In environments where browser tools are limited or where advanced debugging is unavailable (such as corporate or kiosk devices), uBO Scope offers an easy-to-access way to monitor third-party network activity.

- **Benefit:** Provides essential insights without requiring complex setup or elevated permissions.
- **Use Case:** Validate that no unauthorized external connections are allowed during web browsing.

## Best Practices for Getting the Most Out of uBO Scope

- **Combine with Your Content Blocker:** uBO Scope complements your blocking tools, revealing outcomes independent of your filters’ UI.
- **Regularly Monitor Active Tabs:** The extension displays data per active tab; checking after page loads provides the clearest picture.
- **Interpret Badge Counts Meaningfully:** Focus on the number of distinct third-party domains connected, not simply raw block counts.

<Tip>
For users new to uBO Scope, start by observing your browser’s badge number change as you navigate to different websites. Use the popup panel to see exactly which domains are communicating to understand the privacy landscape better.

## Troubleshooting Common Audience Concerns

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions from Different User Types">
<Accordion title="Privacy Professional: Why do I see connections allowed that I thought were blocked?">
Content blocking varies by browser and network level. uBO Scope reports the actual network connections as known to the browser, which may include connections allowed by your filter or DNS blocking layers not visible to the extension.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Filter Maintainer: How do I distinguish stealth-blocked domains from truly allowed ones?">
The popup categorizes domains under 'stealth-blocked' when network requests were redirected or manipulated without being outright blocked. Comparing these with 'allowed' domains helps identify the subtle differences filter rules make.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Power User: I don’t understand the difference between hostname and domain in the display. Why is that important?">
Hostnames are specific to subdomains, while domains group by public suffixes. uBO Scope aggregates counts by domain to give a clearer picture of third-party relationships, reducing noise from subdomain variations.
