# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the key terms and concepts behind uBO Scope is essential to fully grasp the extension’s reports and user interface. This page defines the foundational language you will encounter throughout the documentation and within the extension itself, empowering you to interpret network activity clearly and confidently.

---

## What Are Third-Party Remote Servers?

A **third-party remote server** refers to any server that a website connects to which is not part of the site's own domain or its immediately related subdomains. These are distinct from the website's primary servers and often include content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics services, advertising networks, or other external resources.

When you browse a website, your browser usually makes network requests not just to the site you intended to visit but also to many such third-party servers. uBO Scope reveals these connections, helping you identify resources loaded from outside the site’s main domain.

Understanding which third parties are contacted is critical for privacy-conscious users who want to minimize external tracking or resource loading.

## Defining Network Requests

A **network request** is any attempt by your browser to retrieve data, such as images, scripts, or other resources, from a server over the internet. These requests typically use HTTP, HTTPS, or WebSocket protocols.

Network requests can have three key outcomes:

- **Success:** The resource was successfully fetched.
- **Blocked:** The request was prevented from completing, for instance, by a content blocker.
- **Redirect:** The request was redirected to another URL, which can sometimes be used by blockers stealthily.

uBO Scope listens to your browser's network requests to determine what actually happens **after** these requests are made, independent of any content blocking or filtering mechanisms.

## Understanding the Badge Count

The badge count is the numeric indicator displayed on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon for each browser tab. It shows the **number of distinct third-party domains that a webpage has connected to without being blocked**.

### Why the Badge Count Matters

- A **lower badge count** means fewer third-party connections were allowed, aligning with a higher level of privacy or stricter content blocking.
- Conversely, a **higher badge count** indicates more third-party domains were accessed, which can suggest more exposure to external resources or trackers.

It is important to note this count reports *unique domains* rather than total requests, giving you a clearer picture of external exposure at the domain level.

## What Is a Stealth Block?

A **stealth block** is a type of network request blocking that happens quietly or invisibly, such that web pages or servers cannot easily detect it. Some content blockers leverage stealth blocking to:

- Prevent page breakage caused by blocking certain resources.
- Avoid detection by websites trying to bypass or identify blockers.

In uBO Scope, stealth blocks are reported distinctly, allowing you to see which third-party requests were blocked under the hood without the typical errors or visible disruptions.

## Additional Key Terms

| Term                | Definition                                                                                                               |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hostname**         | The full part of a URL indicating the specific server or subdomain, e.g., `ads.example.com`.                             |
| **Domain**           | The main registered domain name without subdomains, e.g., `example.com`.                                                 |
| **Allowed Outcome**  | Network requests that successfully fetched data without being blocked.                                                  |
| **Blocked Outcome**  | Network requests that were prevented from completing, typically by filters or content blockers.                           |
| **Redirect Outcome** | Requests that followed a redirect from one URL to another, often involved in stealth blocking scenarios.                |

## How These Terms Fit Into Your Workflow

When you use uBO Scope to inspect a webpage:

1. The extension monitors all network requests initiated from that page.
2. It categorizes each connection into **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked** based on the request’s success or failure.
3. Domains and hostnames are reported and counted separately to give precise insights.
4. The badge count updates to reflect the number of allowed third-party domains, helping you quickly assess external exposure.

By understanding these terms and concepts, you can interpret the extension’s UI and reports effectively, distinguishing between potentially unwanted connections and normal external resources.

## Practical Tip

When evaluating websites through uBO Scope, focus on **distinct third-party domains** to get a meaningful measure of external exposure rather than the number of requests. Remember, some third parties are necessary or legitimate, such as CDN providers.

Tracking stealth blocks can also help uncover hidden third-party connections that other tools might not report, giving you a unique angle on network privacy.

## Summary

Core concepts define the language you need to understand all uBO Scope's reports: from what constitutes third-party remote servers to how network request outcomes are classified. Mastery of these terms empowers you to accurately interpret the extension’s badge count and UI indicators, helping you make informed decisions about what internet connections your browser is making on your behalf.
