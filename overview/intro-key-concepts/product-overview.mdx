# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Transparent Network Connection Reporting Like Never Before

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to give you clear, transparent insight into every connection attempt and success your browser makes to remote servers as webpages load. It reveals the true picture behind the scenes — helping you understand what servers your browser talks to, how many distinct third-party connections occur, and what network requests are actually blocked or allowed.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **See every connection attempt, not just blocks** — uBO Scope captures all network requests, including those permitted, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked.
- **Understand third-party server activity** — Quickly identify how many and which distinct remote domains websites connect to.
- **Debunk popular myths** about content blocking based on misleading metrics.
- **Browser agnostic and compatible** — Works alongside other blockers and reflects true network behavior using the browser’s `webRequest` API.

### Who is uBO Scope For?

- Privacy-conscious users looking to decode web connections in real time.
- Content blocker enthusiasts and filter list maintainers who want to verify the effectiveness of block lists.
- Researchers and developers analyzing web tracking and content filtering patterns.

## Introduction to uBO Scope

At its core, uBO Scope is a monitoring tool that transparently reports all connection attempts your browser makes to remote servers while visiting webpages. Unlike many extensions that solely count blocked requests or rely on incomplete data, uBO Scope captures the full spectrum of network requests by leveraging the browser's `webRequest` API.

It operates as a companion to content blockers — capturing every network request event across the web pages you browse, regardless of whether those requests were allowed, stealthily redirected or blocked outright. By doing so, it provides unparalleled visibility into web traffic, enabling users to assess the true footprint of third-party connections.

### What Problem Does It Solve?

Users often rely on the number shown by content blockers as an indicator of privacy or security effectiveness. However, these numbers can be misleading because they count individual blocked requests rather than unique third-party servers accessed.

uBO Scope solves this problem by reporting:

- The distinct number of third-party remote servers contacted.
- Whether requests to these servers were allowed, stealth-blocked (redirected), or explicitly blocked.

This helps users move beyond superficial metrics and understand actual network behavior.

### What Sets uBO Scope Apart?

- **Third-party server focus:** Counts unique domains contacted instead of raw request counts.
- **Broad coverage:** Captures network requests under any content blocker or DNS filtering, as long as requests pass through the browser's network stack.
- **Myth-busting insights:** Helps clarify misconceptions such as “higher block count equals better blocking.”
- **Lightweight, non-intrusive:** It does not filter or block anything itself but passively observes and reports connections.

### High-Level Overview: How It Works

When you open a webpage, uBO Scope listens to network request events in your browser in real time. It tracks every request’s domain and categorizes it into one of three groups:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully made.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests that were redirected or altered stealthily.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed or were explicitly blocked.

uBO Scope then summarizes the distinct domains involved and presents this data in an easy-to-understand popup panel, giving you immediate insight into the level of third-party activity.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Real-time connection visibility:** Monitor ongoing network connections on the active browser tab.
- **Domain-level aggregation:** Group network requests by domain for clearer analysis.
- **Categorization of network outcomes:** Separate domains based on whether connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- **Human-friendly display:** Unicode domain names are displayed clearly to avoid confusion with punycode.
- **Browser toolbar integration:** Badge shows the count of unique third-party domains contacted.

### Example Use Case

Imagine you visit an unfamiliar website and want to know if it connects to many third-party servers behind the scenes. Opening the uBO Scope popup immediately lists all contacted domains grouped by block outcome, showing you exactly where connections are made. This enables you to decide if the site is contacting undesirable trackers or suspicious servers.

## Why Should You Care?

### Outcomes You Can Expect

- **Peace of mind through transparency:** Know precisely what servers your browser talks with.
- **Better privacy understanding:** Identify unnecessary or unexpected third-party connections.
- **Debunk misleading block counts:** Understand that a high block count icon doesn’t always mean superior privacy.
- **Empowered decision-making:** Use actionable data to adjust your content blocking or browsing habits.

### Common Scenarios Where uBO Scope Shines

- **Validating content blocker effectiveness:** See real networks contacts, not just blocked request tallies.
- **Privacy auditing:** Detect how many distinct domains a page communicates with.
- **Filter list development:** Gain insights to refine and enhance block lists with domain visibility.
- **Investigating suspicious domains:** Quickly spot and research domains that seem unexpected or shady.

### Before & After Comparison

- **Without uBO Scope:** You rely on generic block counts, often misleading, without domain context.
- **With uBO Scope:** You see clear unique domain counts, understand network request outcomes, and gain real insight into your browsing footprint.
