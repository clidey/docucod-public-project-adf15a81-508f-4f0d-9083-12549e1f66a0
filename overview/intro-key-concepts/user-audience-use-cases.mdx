## Core Audiences

### Privacy Enthusiasts
If you aim to protect your online privacy by knowing exactly which remote servers your browser connects to when loading web pages, uBO Scope offers you unparalleled visibility. It surfaces all attempted and successful remote connections, making the invisible visible, so you can gain confidence and control over your browsing exposure.

### Content Blocker Users
For users relying on extensions like uBlock Origin or others for ad and tracker blocking, uBO Scope acts as an objective companion. It shows not just what is blocked but reports on connections regardless of the blocker’s stealth. This insight is crucial when you want to verify how effective your content blocker really is beyond simple block counts or misleading tests.

### Filter List Maintainers
If you create or maintain filter lists, uBO Scope provides real-time connection data essential for fine-tuning your lists. When access to browser developer tools is limited, the extension’s network request reports help validate and detect rule effectiveness efficiently.

### Users with Limited Developer Tools Access
Whether you are using a restrictive device, or simply want easier access to connection information without opening complex developer consoles, uBO Scope provides a lightweight, straightforward interface to view connection outcomes at a glance.

## Scenario-Based Guidance on When to Use uBO Scope

### Scenario 1: Verifying Privacy Protection
You installed a content blocker but want to confirm it’s truly limiting connections to trackers and unwanted third parties. Using uBO Scope, you open the extension popup and immediately see a list of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains connected during your browsing session. This information empowering you to make informed decisions about your privacy setup.

### Scenario 2: Diagnosing Unexpected Connections
Imagine noticing unusual network activity or slower page loads and suspect unwanted connections. uBO Scope helps you map out the remote servers contacted by visited sites, distinguishing which are allowed, stealth blocked, or outright blocked – a clear diagnostic tool without sifting through verbose logs.

### Scenario 3: Evaluating Content Blocker Effectiveness
If you’re switching blockers or updating filter lists, use uBO Scope to observe changes in the number and nature of remote server connections. Unlike badge counts or “ad blocker test” sites, it reports actual network requests as seen by the browser, offering you a more precise and actionable measure.

### Scenario 4: Working on Devices With Restricted Toolchains
Suppose you are using a browser on a locked-down device or a browser without full developer tool access. uBO Scope gives you direct access to connection reports that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain, supporting transparency and troubleshooting.

## Why This Matters: The Value to Your Browsing Experience

The badge count visible on the toolbar icon is a quick indicator of the number of distinct allowed third-party remote servers your browser contacts. A lower number here generally means fewer trackers and potentially a more private browsing experience.

uBO Scope goes a step further than your typical content blocker UI by reporting all connection outcomes — which you cannot obtain reliably from standard block counts or popular ‘test’ pages. This transparency helps debunk common myths and misinformation often encountered in online discussions about blocking.

Remember:
- Block counts alone do not reflect connection quality.
- Webpages can't always detect stealth blocking done by modern content blockers.
- Real-world connections matter much more than fabricated testing scenarios.

## Best Practices for Using uBO Scope

- Use uBO Scope alongside your preferred content blocker to validate what is actually connecting.
- Regularly monitor the domains and connections reported to detect unexpected tracking or third-party involvement.
- Share findings with filter list communities to improve collective blocking rules.
- Avoid relying on artificial testing websites; trust the real-time data uBO Scope provides.

---

## Summary

- uBO Scope is targeted at privacy-conscious users, content blocker users, filter maintainers, and users lacking access to developer tools.
- The extension offers direct insight into network request outcomes during browsing to enable better privacy and blocking validation.
- Scenario examples illustrate practical uses in daily browsing, blocker evaluation, and troubleshooting.
