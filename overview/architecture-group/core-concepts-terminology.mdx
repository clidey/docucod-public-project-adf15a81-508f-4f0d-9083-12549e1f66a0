# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the foundational concepts behind uBO Scope empowers you to fully grasp how the extension reports and categorizes network activity. This page demystifies key terms such as third-party servers, domain outcomes (allowed, blocked, stealth), browser tab sessions, and badge counts, explaining how these elements are reflected in the user interface.

## What You Need to Know

### Third-Party Servers

When you visit a webpage, the browser often connects not only to that site’s main server but also to numerous external (third-party) servers. These third parties can provide content like ads, analytics, fonts, or other resources. Tracking these connections is essential for privacy and security insights.

### Domain Outcomes

uBO Scope classifies these network requests into three distinct outcomes based on how they are handled by your browser or any blocking mechanisms in place:

- **Allowed**: Requests that successfully connected and fetched resources from third-party domains.
- **Blocked**: Requests that were prevented from connecting, typically by your content blockers or network-level filters.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Requests that were quietly prevented (stealth-blocked) without the blocking being visible to the page, often done to minimize webpage breakage or detection of blocking.

These outcomes provide a clear, realistic picture of what third-party connections are actually taking place, rather than what might be reported by unreliable or misleading blocking counters.

### Browser Tab Sessions

uBO Scope tracks third-party network activity on a per-tab basis. Each browser tab maintains its own session of recorded connections, detailing which third-party domains were contacted and how those connections ended (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked).

When a tab is closed, its session data is discarded, ensuring that badge counts and popup data always reflect the current browsing context.

### Badge Counts

The badge displayed on the browser toolbar icon shows a **count of distinct third-party domains allowed** for the active tab’s session. 

For example, if a webpage loaded resources from five different third-party domains that were allowed, the badge will show '5'.

> **Lower badge counts indicate fewer third-party exposures, which is typically better for privacy.**

The badge does not count blocked or stealth-blocked domains—it exclusively reports allowed distinct domain connections.

### How Terms Surface in the User Interface

In the extension popup, you will see three main sections, each reflecting one of the domain outcome categories:

- **Not Blocked**: Lists allowed third-party domains with counts indicating how often they were connected to.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Shows domains whose requests were quietly blocked to avoid detection by webpages.
- **Blocked**: Displays domains whose network requests were explicitly blocked and failed to connect.

Each section summarizes the domain-level connection counts, helping you quickly understand your current privacy exposure.

## From Network Events to User-Facing Information

The extension listens to browser network events (`webRequest` API) including request successes, errors, and redirects. It then records these in a session associated with the current tab. These recorded outcomes dynamically update the badge count and popup view.

### Example Scenario

Imagine you visit example.com:

1. The main site loads successfully (allowed).
2. The page requests an analytics script from analytics.example.net, which is allowed.
3. An ad request to ads.adnetwork.com is stealth-blocked silently.
4. A tracking pixel from tracker.badtracker.com is blocked explicitly by your content blocker.

uBO Scope will:

- Mark `example.com` as the main domain.
- List `analytics.example.net` under **Not Blocked**.
- List `ads.adnetwork.com` under **Stealth-Blocked**.
- List `tracker.badtracker.com` under **Blocked**.
- Show a badge count indicating only 1 allowed third-party domain (`analytics.example.net`).

This clarity lets you quickly assess which external domains are active and what blocking is effective.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Monitor badge counts** to understand how many distinct third-party domains you connect to with each site you visit. Lower counts usually indicate better privacy.
- **Check the popup’s detailed view** regularly to get deeper insights into which domains are allowed or blocked.
- **Use stealth-blocked domains list** to recognize attempts that content blockers hide to prevent webpage breakage or anti-blocker detection.
- **Understand tab sessions** — each tab’s third-party domains are tracked separately, so switching tabs changes the badge and popup data accordingly.
- **Avoid relying solely on block counts from other blockers**; uBO Scope provides independent, transparent verification of actual network outcomes.

---

## Summary

- **Third-party domains** represent all external remote servers contacted by the webpage.
- **Outcomes:**
  - Allowed (not blocked)
  - Blocked (explicitly prevented)
  - Stealth-blocked (silently prevented)
- **Browser tab sessions** keep track of these domains individually per tab.
- **Badge counts** reflect the total number of distinct allowed third-party domains per active tab.
- The **popup interface** displays categorized lists of connected domains with counts.

## Code Snippet: Domain Outcome Tracking Logic (Simplified)

```javascript
function recordOutcome(tabId, request) {
  const tabDetails = getOrCreateTabDetails(tabId);
  const hostname = extractHostname(request.url);
  if (request.event === 'success') {
    addDomainCount(tabDetails.allowed, hostname);
  } else if (request.event === 'error') {
    addDomainCount(tabDetails.blocked, hostname);
  } else if (request.event === 'redirect') {
    addDomainCount(tabDetails.stealth, hostname);
  }
  updateBadge(tabId, tabDetails.allowed.domains.size);
}
```

This function illustrates how uBO Scope records the outcome of requests per tab and updates user-visible counts.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Core Concepts">
  <Accordion title="Why doesn't the badge count blocked domains?">
    The badge exclusively reflects allowed third-party domains to show actual exposures, not block attempts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between stealth-blocked and blocked?">
    Stealth-blocked requests are silently prevented without alerting the webpage, while blocked requests are explicitly denied.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are main site domains included in badge counts?">
    No, the badge counts only third-party domains, excluding the main site domain.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why is tab session data cleared when I close a tab?">
    To ensure badge and popup data reflect only the active browsing context, session data is discarded on tab close.
  </Accordion>
