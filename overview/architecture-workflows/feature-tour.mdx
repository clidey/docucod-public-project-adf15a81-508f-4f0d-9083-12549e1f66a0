# Feature Highlights & Quick Tour

Welcome to uBO Scope's Feature Highlights & Quick Tour. This guide walks you through the core user-facing features of uBO Scope, empowering you to quickly understand how to monitor domain connections, interpret badge counts on your browser tab, and explore real-time connection summaries via the popup interface.

## Unlocking Transparency: What You See at a Glance

When you first install uBO Scope and activate it on a web page, it reveals all remote server connections your browser attempts or successfully makes—offering unmatched visibility into network activity that other tools might hide or block silently.

### Domain Connection Monitoring

At the heart of uBO Scope is its domain connection monitoring system. It tracks:

- **Allowed Connections:** Domains your browser connected to successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked Connections:** Requests that were prevented but stealthily (without revealing) by content blockers.
- **Blocked Connections:** Requests explicitly blocked by content filtering.

The popup interface groups these domains clearly, showing counts and domain names so you immediately know where your browser is talking without your direct consent or knowledge.

---

## Browser Action Badge Explained

The colorful badge over the browser’s uBO Scope icon is a quick-reference indicator for your current tab:

- It displays a **number representing the count of unique allowed domains** your current page connected to.
- The badge updates dynamically as page requests succeed, giving real-time feedback about the breadth of your page’s remote connections.

This immediate insight helps you answer questions like "How many different external domains is this page talking to?" without even opening the popup.

## Popup Overview: A Real-Time Summary

Clicking the uBO Scope icon opens the popup—your command center for detailed connection insights. Here’s how the popup is organized:

### Hostname & Domain Display

At the top, the popup shows the active tab's hostname and domain. If the hostname includes subdomains, this is also indicated, helping you identify the exact site context.

### Connection Outcome Sections

Below the header, the popup separates domains into three outcome categories with clear headings:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains your browser successfully contacted.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains whose requests were silently blocked or redirected.
- **Blocked:** Domains whose connections were explicitly blocked by your content filters.

Each section lists domains with counts representing the number of connections attempts logged, enabling you to gauge the level of exposure or restriction the page has.

### Counts & Sorting

Domains within each section are sorted alphabetically for easy scanning. Counts beside each domain indicate how many times the page connected or tried to connect there, providing a quantitative sense of the request volume.

## How to Use This Feature As a First-Time User

<u>Imagine you're visiting a news website and you want to see how many external domains it talks to and what is being blocked silently.</u>

1. **Look at the Badge:** After the page loads, glance at the badge number on the uBO Scope icon. If it says "12," the page connected to 12 unique domains.
2. **Open the Popup:** Click the icon to see details.
3. **Review Domain Lists:** Check the “Not Blocked” list for domains your browser reached, the “Stealth-Blocked” list for domains that tried to connect but were silently blocked, and the “Blocked” list for overtly blocked requests.
4. **Understand Your Privacy Exposure:** Use this information to determine if the site exposes you to many third-party trackers or if your content blocker screened connections effectively.

## Pro Tips & Best Practices

- **Monitor the Badge Count Continuously:** High counts might indicate heavy third-party usage, prompting closer scrutiny.
- **Use Domain Lists for Filter Tuning:** If you spot domains in the stealth or blocked lists that concern you, you might want to proceed to advanced guides on tweaking filter lists or report issues.
- **Refresh the Popup After Navigation:** Remember to refresh your popup view when you change tabs or navigate to capture the latest data.

<Note>
The popup only shows data for the currently active tab. To analyze another tab, switch to it and open uBO Scope there.
</Note>

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **No Data Displayed in the Popup:** This might occur if uBO Scope hasn't captured network activity for the current tab yet. Reload the page to trigger data capture.
- **Badge Shows No Number:** If the badge is empty, no allowed domains were detected yet, or the page has no external network connections.
- **Popup Loading Slowly:** The popup waits briefly to consolidate network events; small delays ensure accurate data display.
