# Features at a Glance

Discover uBO Scope's essential capabilities in one clear, concise tour. This page highlights the core features that equip you to monitor and analyze third-party network connections confidently, tab by tab.

---

## See Every Network Connection, Live Per Tab

At a glance, uBO Scope tracks all distinct domains contacted by your active tab. It reveals not only which remote servers your browser connects to but also whether those connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked. 

This granular per-tab view helps you understand exactly what third-party resources your browsing encounters and how content blocking affects those connections.

### How It Works for You

- When you open the extension popup on any tab, you see a categorized list of domains that the page contacted during that session.
- Domains are grouped by connection outcome: **not blocked (allowed)**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
- A handy count summary shows the total number of unique third-party domains your tab has connected with.

By surfacing these details, uBO Scope empowers you to question whether content blocking is truly effective—not just by block counts but by actual distinct remote connections.

## Toolbar Badge Summaries

The small but powerful badge icon serves as your immediate feedback:

- It displays the count of **unique third-party domains** that the current tab has successfully reached.
- A smaller count on the badge means fewer third parties, indicating tighter privacy and fewer potential trackers.

This focus on **unique domains** rather than raw block counts helps you measure exposure more meaningfully.

## Fully Independent of Content Blockers

uBO Scope reports outcomes for all network requests visible via the browser’s `webRequest` API regardless of which content blocker (if any) is active. 

- It accurately reflects connections whether blocked by uBlock Origin, another blocker, DNS-based filtering, or stealth blocking tactics.
- This impartial reporting ensures you’re not misled by arbitrary block counts.

## Built for Clarity and Quick Insight

The popup interface organizes data cleanly:

- Domains are listed in compact rows with count badges indicating how many times connections to that domain occurred.
- Color-coded sections differentiate outcomes without clutter.
- The UI adjusts responsively to fit your screen, maintaining readability on various devices.

### Practical Example:

Imagine you visit a news website. By opening uBO Scope's popup:

- You immediately see 5 allowed third-party CDN domains under **not blocked** helping load images and scripts.
- One domain appears under **stealth-blocked**, a tracker silently prevented from loading.
- Two domains are listed as **blocked**, so you know those tracking attempts were stopped.

This transparency shows which connections succeeded, which were stealthily dropped, and which were explicitly blocked — something no other tool presents so clearly.

## Tips for Effective Use

- Check the badge frequently during browsing to track exposure changes in real-time.
- Use uBO Scope side-by-side with content blockers to verify their effectiveness beyond block counts.
- If you manage filter lists, use this insight to discover new third parties appearing across sessions.
