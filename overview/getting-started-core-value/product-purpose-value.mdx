# What is uBO Scope?

## Introducing uBO Scope: Your Clear View into Network Connections

Imagine browsing the web with full insight into every remote connection your browser attempts or successfully establishes. uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed precisely for this purpose: to **reveal all third-party remote servers that web pages try to communicate with**, giving you an unfiltered window into the network activity on your device.

At its core, uBO Scope tracks **distinct third-party remote servers** accessed by tabs, displaying this count directly on the browser toolbar icon. Unlike traditional content blockers that focus on raw block counts, uBO Scope emphasizes **distinct server connections**, offering a meaningful metric that reflects true exposure to third-party domains.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Clarity beyond block counts**: Understand how many unique external servers your browser connects to, regardless of which blocker you use.
- **Bypasses common misconceptions**: Avoid misleading metrics like block counters or unreliable ad blocker tests.
- **Works transparently alongside any content blocker or DNS-based filtering** that uses the browser’s webRequest API.
- **Supports filter list maintainers and privacy enthusiasts alike** by providing clear data on remote connections per browser tab.

### Who Benefits from uBO Scope?
This extension is tailored for users who want deeper insight into web traffic beyond the typical blockers’ reported metrics — including privacy-conscious individuals, filter list developers, and power users seeking clearer information about their browser's network activity.

## What Exactly is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a **browser extension** that listens to network requests made by web pages using the browser’s `webRequest` API. It **records the outcome of these requests and categorizes the remote servers involved** based on whether requests were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked (hidden due to redirects or other techniques).

This extension’s main output is a **count of distinct third-party domains contacted per browser tab**, presented as a badge number on the toolbar icon and detailed in the popup panel.

## The Problem It Solves

When browsing, you might wonder exactly which external servers your browser contacts, especially third parties that might track or serve content to you. Content blockers complicate this picture because they often only show how many requests were blocked, which can be misleading when comparing blockers or understanding exposure.

uBO Scope solves this by:

- **Focusing on distinct servers contacted**, rather than raw request counts.
- Showing outcomes per domain, categorizing connections as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
- Persisting this data per tab for real-time insights.

## What Makes uBO Scope Different?

Unlike common content blockers that emphasize how many requests they block, uBO Scope shines by revealing the **number of unique third-party servers with *any* connection attempt, whether allowed or blocked**.

The badge count is **not about blocking quantity** but about the **breadth of third-party exposure**. This subtle shift prevents misconceptions about blocker effectiveness and encourages users to focus on true network safety.

Additionally, uBO Scope:

- Works reliably even if content blocking happens outside the browser via DNS-level filtering.
- Avoids reliance on flaky 'ad blocker test' web pages that are often unrealistic.
- Maintains a straightforward, privacy-respecting approach without aggressively updating or expanding — ensuring stability and trust.

## How Does uBO Scope Work at a High Level?

1. **Monitors network requests** initiated by web pages using the browser's `webRequest` API.
2. **Extracts hostnames and domains** from each network request URL.
3. **Determines the public suffix and registered domain** using an internal Public Suffix List.
4. **Classifies each request outcome** into allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked categories.
5. **Aggregates counts of unique domains contacted per browser tab.**
6. **Updates the browser toolbar badge** with the number of distinct allowed third-party domains for the active tab.

## Seeing uBO Scope in Action: A Typical User Flow

1. You install uBO Scope from the Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari Extension Gallery.
2. Open any webpage.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup.
4. Observe an organized list of third-party domains your tab connected to, indicating which were blocked or allowed.
5. Use the badge count as a quick indicator of third-party exposure.

This simple interaction helps you gain nuanced insights that raw block counts cannot provide.

## Practical Example: Why Block Counts Can Mislead

Consider two content blockers:

- **Blocker A** shows 1,000 blocked requests but allows connections to 20 distinct third-party servers.
- **Blocker B** shows 200 blocked requests but allows connections to only 5 distinct third-party servers.

Without uBO Scope, you might assume Blocker A is more effective due to its high block count. uBO Scope reveals that Blocker A lets your browser connect to four times as many third-party servers as Blocker B — potentially increasing exposure.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope **alongside your preferred content blocker** to get a complementary view of your network exposure.
- Regularly review the popup’s detailed domain lists to spot unexpected third-party connections.
- Remember that **a lower badge count is better** — it means fewer distinct third-party servers are contacted.
- Be aware that some third parties like popular CDNs are legitimate and typically low in number.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

> **Q: Why doesn’t uBO Scope report all network requests?**

Only requests observable via the browser’s `webRequest` API can be reported. Requests made by browser internals or outside this API are not tracked.

> **Q: Can uBO Scope tell me about DNS-level blocking?**

Yes, as long as the request reaches the browser’s network layer and the `webRequest` API reports it, uBO Scope will reflect blocked or failed requests regardless of whether blocking happens by DNS or extension.

> **Q: Should I compare uBO Scope’s badge count to other extensions’ block counters?**

No. The badge count represents distinct third-party connections, not raw blocked requests, so direct comparison with block counters is misleading.

## What’s Next?

uBO Scope currently focuses on providing essential insights into third-party connections with minimal user effort and overhead.

Future enhancements aim to include:

- Greater detail on individual network requests.
- More features beneficial to filter list maintainers.
- Additional UI improvements while maintaining a lean footprint.

This extension is purpose-built, stable, and intentional — it’s the tool you trust when you want true clarity about your browser’s external connections.
