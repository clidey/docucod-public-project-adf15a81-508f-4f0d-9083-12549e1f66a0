# Why Use uBO Scope?

Discovering exactly which third-party servers your browser connects to while browsing the web is crucial to maintaining your privacy, security, and control online. The **uBO Scope** extension specializes in revealing these remote server connections—both attempted and successful—providing you with an unparalleled level of insight into your web traffic.

## Understand What Truly Matters: Distinct Third-Party Connections

Most users and even many content blockers focus on raw counts of blocked network requests. However, this number alone is misleading. What really impacts your privacy and security is the number of **distinct third-party remote servers** from which resources are fetched or blocked.

- The badge count on the uBO Scope toolbar icon indicates this exact number of distinct third-party domains.
- A **lower count** indicates fewer external connections, reducing your exposure to tracking, data leaks, and unsolicited content.
- Tracking distinct servers helps differentiate between superficial blocking effects and meaningful privacy protection.


## Why This Matters to You

Imagine visiting a popular website and seeing dozens of network requests blocked, but uBO Scope reveals a **high number of allowed third-party connections anyway**: this means your blocker might be letting in more tracking or data sharing than you realize.

Conversely, a low block count but a **high number of unique third-party servers accessed** could signal weak privacy controls letting many parties silently collect your data.

uBO Scope shifts your focus from clicks and blocks to meaningful, real-world impact.

## How uBO Scope Adds Unique Value

### Measure Beyond Block Counts

Most content blockers highlight how many requests they have blocked. But this metric can be deceptive because:
- A higher block count doesn’t necessarily mean better blocking effectiveness.
- Some blockers block many requests to fewer remote servers, while others allow many requests but to a wider range of servers.

uBO Scope measures the **distinct remote servers** involved, giving you an accurate, actionable perspective on your exposure.

### Reveal Stealth Blocking and Errors

The extension categorizes connection outcomes into three main statuses:
- **Not blocked**: requests successfully fetched from third-party domains.
- **Stealth-blocked**: connections blocked in a way that cannot be spotted by standard web page detection.
- **Blocked**: explicitly blocked requests.

This comprehensive view helps debunk myths about blocking effectiveness.

## Debunking Common Myths

### Myth 1: "More Blocks Mean Better Protection"

Reality: A content blocker showing high block counts may still allow connections to more distinct third parties, increasing privacy exposure. uBO Scope measures and reveals this nuance by showing actual unique third-party connections, not just raw block numbers.

### Myth 2: "Ad Blocker Test Pages Reflect Real Effectiveness"

Reality: These pages use unrealistic network requests designed to detect blocking inconsistencies but don’t reflect typical browsing. They often fail to detect stealth methods used by blockers or complex blocking strategies. uBO Scope reflects real-world scenarios as it monitors all connections transparently.

## Practical Benefits for Different Users

- **Everyday Users:** Gain clear insight into how many and which third-party servers your browser reaches, helping you make informed privacy choices.
- **Privacy Advocates:** Validate your content blocker’s real blocking efficiency based on unique connections rather than misleading statistics.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Analyze real network connection patterns to improve blocking rules effectively, especially on devices where developer tools are limited.

## Real-World Use Case

Imagine loading a news website:
1. Without uBO Scope: You only see an ad blocker’s block count, unsure if many third-party trackers still connect.
2. With uBO Scope: The extension’s badge and popup report the total unique third-party servers contacted, whether blocked or allowed.
3. You identify unexpected domains connecting silently and adjust your filter lists or blocker settings accordingly.

This direct feedback loop empowers you to control your browsing footprint confidently.

## Summary of Why uBO Scope Matters

- Focuses on actual **unique third-party connections**, the critical indicator of privacy risk.
- Differentiates between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections for transparency.
- Exposes hidden aspects no other tool or badge reveals.
- Helps debunk common misconceptions about blocking effectiveness and test website reliability.
- Supports both casual users and professionals in evaluating real-world privacy impact.

<Note>
The badge number on the toolbar icon reflects the count of unique third-party domains successfully connected, not the total block or request count. Tracking this number is essential for meaningful privacy protection.
