# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Your Browser Makes

uBO Scope is a powerful browser extension designed with one clear mission: to reveal all attempted and successful connections from web pages to remote servers. Unlike conventional content blockers that focus solely on counting blocked requests, uBO Scope shines a light on the actual network relationships that your browser establishes during any web session.

### Why This Matters

Modern websites frequently connect to many third-party servers beyond the primary page's domain. These connections can include content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics services, advertising networks, and other external services. Understanding which servers are contacted—and whether those connections are allowed, blocked, or stealthily controlled—is key to fully grasping your web privacy landscape and optimizing content filtering strategies.

### What uBO Scope Does For You

- **Reveals full network request footprint:** See not only what is blocked but all connections attempted, including those allowed or stealth-blocked.
- **Distinguishes connection outcomes:** Categorizes servers by whether connections were permitted, blocked outright, or stealth-blocked (hidden blocking).
- **Supports filter maintainers and privacy-aware users:** Provides granular insight beyond simple block counts, helping maintainers refine rules and users make informed decisions.
- **Cross-browser compatibility:** Works seamlessly across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers, respecting their particular mechanisms to capture network activity.

## A Closer Look at uBO Scope's Purpose

uBO Scope exists to answer a core question for modern web users: *What are the actual remote servers my browser connects to when I visit a site?* By focusing on this question, it empowers you to see through the complex webs of third-party connectivity that typical block counters cannot reveal.

### Beyond Block Counts

Many users and filter list maintainers get misled by the raw number of blocked network requests reported by content blockers. These counts don’t tell the full story:

- A high block count might mean many trivial requests are blocked, but does not guarantee fewer third-party connections overall.
- Some blockers stealthily avoid or modify requests, which traditional metrics overlook.
- Only the count of *distinct third-party servers* that successfully connect truly reflects exposure.

uBO Scope corrects misconceptions by showing the full set of attempted network connections and their outcomes, making it a critical tool for transparency.

### Who Benefits Most?

- **Users aiming for better privacy:** Understand what third-party servers are contacted and how your content blockers interact.
- **Filter list maintainers:** Easily verify the actual impact of filters on third-party connections.
- **Security-conscious developers and analysts:** Gain detailed knowledge of network patterns for debugging or auditing.

## How uBO Scope Works at a Glance

Without diving into intricate technical details, here's how uBO Scope gathers its intelligence:

- It hooks into the browser’s webRequest API, capturing every network request your browser initiates from web pages.
- Records the outcome of each request: allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Groups domains and hostnames by these outcomes, simplifying understanding of which servers are reachable.
- Presents this data in a clear popup interface, accessible directly from the browser toolbar.

By integrating at the network request level, uBO Scope ensures you get comprehensive, accurate data regardless of your content blocking setup.

## Real-World Scenario — Making uBO Scope Work For You

Imagine browsing your favorite news site. Behind the scenes, dozens of third-party requests are launched — some for legitimate CDNs, others for tracking or advertising platforms. Traditional tools might show you how many requests were blocked but not which specific third parties remain connected.

With uBO Scope enabled, you can immediately see:

- How many unique third-party domains connected successfully (or failed).
- Which ones were blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed.
- Counts of requests for each domain, helping you prioritize which connections to scrutinize.

This empowers you to adjust your filtering, improve privacy, and debunk flawed assumptions based on simplified badge counts.
