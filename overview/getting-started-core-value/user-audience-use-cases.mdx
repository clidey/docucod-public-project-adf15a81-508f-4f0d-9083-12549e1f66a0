# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

## Understand Your Audience: Privacy Advocates, Filter List Maintainers & Content Blocker Evaluators

uBO Scope is uniquely tailored to serve three core user groups—each with distinct goals and challenges. This page guides you through who benefits most from uBO Scope and why it fills critical gaps left by standard browser or content-blocker metrics.

---

## 1. Privacy-Conscious Users

### Why They Care
Privacy-conscious users want clarity on the external connections their browser makes. Typical content blockers focus on block counts but don’t reveal the *number of distinct third-party domains* actually contacted. This can be misleading and hide the true exposure to tracking or unwanted data sharing.

### What uBO Scope Does for Them
- **Reveal all connections** (blocked or allowed) to third-party servers in each tab, offering an accurate snapshot of the tab’s network footprint.
- **Highlight distinct domains contacted**, helping users understand how many different third parties a website reaches out to.
- Use the intuitive popup UI to see domains separated into:
  - *Allowed* (requests fetched successfully)
  - *Blocked* (requests that failed or were prevented)
  - *Stealth-blocked* (requests redirected or silently blocked without typical signals)

### Real-World Scenario
Imagine visiting a news website. Your content blocker shows many blocked requests, but uBO Scope reveals numerous allowed connections to various ad and tracking domains migrating beyond your block lists. This transparency empowers better-informed privacy decisions.

## 2. Filter List Maintainers

### Why They Care
Maintaining effective filter lists requires insight into real-world network behavior, especially on devices with limited debugging tools or restricted browser developer tools.

### How uBO Scope Helps
- Lightweight and accessible across Chromium, Firefox, and Safari with minimal setup.
- Reports connections that might evade detection by conventional extension-based blockers.
- Captures stealth blocking and DNS-level blocks, which many conventional tools miss.
- Provides counts and breakdowns of distinct domains connected per tab, helping maintainers identify new or unexpected third parties.

### Example Workflow
A filter list maintainer tests new blocking rules on mobile Safari, where developer tools are limited. Using uBO Scope’s badge and popup UI, they quickly identify third-party domains that slipped past filters, allowing them to refine and target their rules more effectively.

## 3. Content Blocker Evaluators

### Why They Care
Evaluating content blockers based on toolbar icon badge counts or so-called "ad blocker tests" can be deceptive and inaccurate.

### How uBO Scope Clarifies Reality
- Debunks myths that a higher block count means a better blocker.
- Shifts focus to the number of distinct allowed third-party connections — the real metric of exposure.
- Surfaces stealthily blocked and redirected requests not visible on web pages or test sites.
- Shows that some blockers with high block counts may allow more unique third-party domains, thus conceding more privacy.

### Myth Busting Insight
Many users believe “ad blocker tests” reliably show blocker effectiveness, but these tests often simulate unrealistic conditions and cannot detect stealth blocking. uBO Scope offers a grounded, accurate assessment instead, directly from the browser’s network activity.

## When Standard Tools Fall Short

Traditional browser developer tools or extension UIs frequently miss:

- **Stealth blocking or DNS-level blocks**: Requests that fail silently or are redirected without visible error.
- **Distinguishing between multiple network events**: Redirects, errors, and successes mixed in a way that loses domain-specific granularity.
- **Counting distinct domains vs. raw block counts**: Raw numbers of blocked or allowed requests don’t indicate exposure breadth.

uBO Scope’s design shines in these blind spots, providing revealing insights when others cannot.

## Practical Tips for Each User Group

- **Privacy Users**: Use the toolbar badge as a quick gauge of third-party exposure; lower counts mean fewer third parties contacted.
- **Block List Maintainers**: Periodically check popup details per tab to catch stealth domains or unusual connections.
- **Evaluator Analysts**: Compare uBO Scope results with other content blockers to see actual network behaviors, not just block tallies.

<Note>
A lower badge number on uBO Scope means fewer distinct third-party domains were connected to, which is a better privacy outcome.
