# Key Benefits & Value Proposition

Unlock deeper insight into your web browsing network activity with uBO Scope, a lightweight yet powerful tool designed to illuminate all connections your browser makes to third-party remote servers. This invaluable visibility empowers you to understand and manage your privacy and security with clarity and confidence.

## Why uBO Scope Matters to You

Imagine visiting your favorite website and instantly knowing exactly how many distinct third-party servers your browser is connecting to — without the guesswork or vague block statistics. uBO Scope delivers this clear snapshot, unobtrusively reporting the network connections behind the scenes so you can see how private your browsing truly is.

Many users rely on content blockers to protect privacy, but the impact of these tools is often misunderstood. A high block count does not necessarily mean better privacy — sometimes it masks more connections behind the scenes. uBO Scope cuts through the noise:

- **Transparent Third-Party Connection Counts:** See the precise number of unique remote servers contacted, giving you an honest gauge of exposure.
- **Independence from Blocker Implementations:** Works regardless of which content blocker or DNS filter you use, revealing the actual network outcomes as your browser experiences them.
- **Educational Insights:** Helps users and filter list maintainers understand what is truly being allowed or blocked — separating myth from reality.

## Core Benefits at a Glance

- **Complete Visibility:** Accurately reveals connections to all third-party remote servers, exposing those hidden beneath filtered layers.
- **Simplified Risk Evaluation:** Low third-party connection counts generally indicate better privacy; uBO Scope’s badge count presents this metric straight on your toolbar.
- **Stealth Awareness:** Differentiates between allowed, stealth-blocked (redirected), and fully blocked domains, enabling nuanced understanding.
- **Filter List Enhancement:** Provides filter list maintainers with actionable data to audit and refine domain blocking.
- **Lightweight and Unobtrusive:** Runs in the background with minimal impact and a simple popup UI focused solely on network connection reporting.

## Real-World Impact

### Before uBO Scope
- Users rely on imprecise block counts that can mislead.
- Evaluations of content blockers depend on artificial tests or guesswork.
- No clear data on how many unique domains a page actually connects to.

### After uBO Scope
- Instantly know the exact number of distinct third-party domains contacted.
- See which connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or explicitly blocked.
- Base decisions on real network behavior, not fallacy or hype.
- Boost confidence in your privacy stance or filter list quality.

## Practical Tips for Maximizing uBO Scope Value

- **Interpret Lower Counts as Positive:** A lower number of distinct third-party domains connected typically reflects better privacy protection.
- **Watch Out for Stealth Blocking:** The “stealth” category points to redirects that might subtly bypass filters — inspect these closely.
- **Use Alongside Your Favorite Filter Lists:** uBO Scope complements any content blocker or DNS filtering approach by providing independent verification.
- **Check Frequently Visited Sites:** Regularly monitor key websites to track changes in their third-party connections.

## What You See in the Toolbar and Popup

- A badge count on the extension icon indicates the number of distinct allowed third-party remote domains.
- The popup shows three sections:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains your browser connected to successfully.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that underwent a redirect or stealth filtering.
  - **Blocked:** Domains that were explicitly blocked.

This straightforward UI lets you quickly assess network activity with no technical distractions.

<Note>
The badge count reflects the number of *distinct* third-party domains your browser connected to successfully; a lower count generally signals better privacy.
</Note>

<Warning>
A higher block count shown by other content blockers does not necessarily mean better blocking—it may indicate more distinct domains ultimately contacted.
</Warning>

<Info>
uBO Scope works independently of content blockers and DNS filters by hooking into the browser's `webRequest` API, ensuring accurate, real-time reporting.
