# Target Audience & Use Cases

## Introduction

This page defines the ideal users for uBO Scope and illustrates key scenarios where the extension delivers maximum value. By understanding who benefits most and how, you can quickly determine if uBO Scope matches your needs and how to apply it effectively.


## Who Should Use uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is designed for anyone serious about gaining precise insights into their browser’s real-time network activity. This includes:

- **Privacy Enthusiasts:** Users committed to understanding and limiting what remote servers their browser communicates with, valuing transparency over black-box blocking.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Content blocker rule developers and maintainers who need reliable data on network requests across various environments, especially where built-in dev tools are restricted.
- **Technophiles & Security-Conscious Users:** Users who want to verify the true efficacy of their content blockers beyond superficial statistics.
- **Researchers and Analysts:** Individuals interested in assessing domain connections on web pages, particularly when browser internals or developer tools cannot be accessed directly.


## Primary Use Cases

### 1. Debunking Ad Blocker Myths

Many users falsely assume a higher block count on an ad blocker means better protection. uBO Scope provides clear, factual evidence by showing the number of **distinct third-party remote servers actually allowed or blocked**. This helps users and reviewers see that a high block count might actually correspond to **more allowed remote connections**, clarifying misconceptions.

### 2. Verifying Content Blocker Effectiveness

uBO Scope transcends limitations found in typical ad blocker test sites, which often produce unrealistic scenarios or fail to capture stealth blocking techniques.

Use uBO Scope to:

- Track allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains in real-time.
- Measure how many unique third-party servers your browser connects to, rather than relying on unreliable “block count” metrics.

This empowers users to judge content blockers more accurately based on meaningful network exposure.

### 3. Domain Analysis on Restricted Devices

Filter list maintainers and analysts sometimes use devices without access to robust browser development tools or with limitations on inspecting network activity.

uBO Scope fills this gap by:

- Reporting network connections transparently via the browser’s `webRequest` API.
- Showing clear badge counts summarizing distinct third-party domains.
- Providing detailed reports accessible through its popup interface, even in constrained environments.


## Real-World Scenario Walkthrough

Imagine you want to verify how many third-party trackers a news website contacts when loaded in your browser with a content blocker enabled.

1. You open the site with uBO Scope installed.
2. The extension automatically records all remote server connections—allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
3. You glance at the toolbar badge showing the exact count of distinct third-party domains contacted.
4. Opening the popup reveals categorized lists of domains with detailed counts.
5. You observe some domains classified as stealth-blocked, indicating covert blocking by your content blocker beyond standard techniques.
6. With this data, you can assess if your blocker effectively limits exposure or if further tuning is necessary.


## Best Practices for Users

- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker—not as a blocker itself—to **gain clarity on network activity**.
- Regularly check the extension’s badge and popup when browsing privacy-sensitive or unfamiliar sites.
- For filter list maintainers, export or note domains frequently contacted to optimize block rules.
- Avoid relying on adblock test websites; instead, trust real-time data surfaced by uBO Scope.


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t misinterpret remote server counts as inherently bad—content delivery networks (CDNs) are legitimate third parties commonly used.
- Avoid assuming all stealth-blocked domains are malicious; stealth blocking is a nuanced technique often used for subtle resource management.
- Keep in mind that network requests made outside the browser’s `webRequest` API scope cannot be captured by uBO Scope and thus won’t appear in reports.


## Summary

uBO Scope is an indispensable tool for privacy-focused users, filter list maintainers, and anyone needing transparent real-world data on browser network connections. By debunking common myths and providing a truthful view behind the scenes, it empowers more confident, informed decision-making about privacy and content blocking.
