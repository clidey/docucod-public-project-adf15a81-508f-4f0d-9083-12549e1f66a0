# What is uBO Scope?

## Transparent Insight Into Your Browser's Network Connections

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension that shines a spotlight on exactly which remote servers your browser tabs connect to — whether those connections are allowed, blocked, or stealthily blocked by other content blockers. By revealing these network outcomes, uBO Scope empowers you with unprecedented clarity on your browsing activity and the effectiveness of your content blockers.

### Why Should You Care?
- **See All Connections:** Visualize every distinct third-party remote server your browser attempts to reach.
- **Understand Blocking Impact:** Discover not just blocked connections but also stealthy blocks that elude typical detection.
- **Privacy Through Awareness:** A lower badge count indicates fewer distinct third-party connections, often translating to better privacy.
- **Independent Verification:** Use uBO Scope to debunk misleading adblock test pages and compare blockers based on real connection data.

### Who Is uBO Scope For?
Privacy-conscious users, security enthusiasts, filter list maintainers, and anyone wanting full visibility of network connections initiated by visited webpages.

## What Is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a browser extension companioning uBlock Origin designed to monitor and report the behavior of network requests made by your browser. It listens to browser network events and categorizes remote server connections into three groups:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully made.
- **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked by content blockers.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections silently intercepted or redirected before they complete.

Unlike other tools that only show partial blocking or require complex setup, uBO Scope reveals these network outcomes transparently, regardless of which content blocker(s) you use or how they implement blocking.

This allows you to judge the true exposure of your browsing session to third-party servers, directly reflecting the privacy performance.

## The Problem uBO Scope Solves

Content blockers often display a block count badge that many users interpret as a privacy metric — the higher, the better. However, these counts can be misleading because they don't measure how many distinct third-party connections remain **allowed** after filtering, which is the critical factor for privacy and tracking exposure.

uBO Scope addresses this gap by providing direct, tab-specific reports on all remote third-party server interactions, showing exactly which domains are contacted, which are blocked, and which are stealth-blocked out of sight.

### What Makes uBO Scope Different?

- **Accurate Network-Level Reporting:** Hooks into the browser's `webRequest` API to observe connection attempts and outcomes as they happen.
- **Content Blocker Agnostic:** Monitors network requests independent of any content blocking logic, thus exposing true blocking results even from DNS or stealth techniques.
- **Focus on Distinct Third-Parties:** Aggregates and displays unique third-party domains contacted, helping users understand exposure rather than raw request volumes.

## How uBO Scope Works

Behind the scenes, uBO Scope leverages browser APIs to monitor web requests across all tabs. It:

1. Tracks each network request's URL and outcome (success, block, redirect).
2. Identifies the originating tab and the domain of requested resources.
3. Categorizes domains into groups based on request outcomes.
4. Displays summarized data in a popup UI with:
   - Hostname information
   - Count of unique connected domains
   - Lists of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains

This unobtrusive approach guarantees minimal performance impact while delivering high-fidelity connection data.

## Key Value Propositions

- **Empower your privacy decisions with real data:** Instead of guessing, see exactly which third parties your browser connects to.
- **Validate and compare content blockers:** Use uBO Scope to verify if your blockers are effective and which actually reduce third-party exposures.
- **Identify stealth blocking:** Catch blocking actions that other tools mask, helping highlight blocker stealth techniques.
- **Simple interface:** Just click the toolbar icon to get immediate, readable insights about your current tab’s network activities.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine visiting a news website you trust. Traditional content blockers might show a high block count badge — but what if most third-party connections still happen undetected by the blocker?

When you open uBO Scope’s popup, you see the exact count and list of third-party servers contacted, including those that slipped through or were stealthily blocked. Armed with this data, you can adjust your filtering rules or choose more stringent blockers, knowing you’re basing decisions on what truly matters.

## Common User Goals Achieved

- **Monitor which third-party domains receive traffic per tab.**
- **Understand if DNS or stealth blocking reduces connections effectively.**
- **Validate filter list performance beyond visible blocking events.**
- **Debunk misleading 'adblock test' sites that don't reflect real-world browsing.**

## Getting Started Preview

To start using uBO Scope:

1. Install the extension from your browser’s official addon store.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon while browsing any webpage.
3. View the popup summary showing connected domains, separated into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories.

No complex configuration required — just immediate access to the network facts behind your browsing sessions.

## Tips and Best Practices

- A **lower badge count** indicates fewer third-party servers accessed, generally signifying higher privacy.
- Understand that some third-party connections are necessary and benign — e.g., content delivery networks (CDNs).
- Use uBO Scope alongside uBlock Origin or other blockers to see how filtering affects your network exposure.
- Regularly check connections on sensitive or new websites to monitor privacy implications.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="FAQs and Troubleshooting">  
<Accordion title="Why does my badge count differ from other blockers?">  
The badge count here represents the number of distinct third-party domains connected to, not the number of blocked requests. Other blockers show raw block counts, which can be misleading.  
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="What is stealth blocking and why does it matter?">  
Stealth blocking refers to network requests intercepted or redirected silently without explicit block notifications. Identifying stealth blocking reveals connections that are prevented in subtle ways.  
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Does uBO Scope block connections itself?">  
No, uBO Scope only reports connection outcomes. The blocking itself is done by your installed content blockers or browser.  
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Are all my connections shown here?">  
uBO Scope reports connections visible to the browser's webRequest API. Some network activity outside browser scope may not appear.
