# Key Features & User Value

uBO Scope empowers you with transparent, real-world visibility into your browser’s network activity by reporting all remote server connections initiated within your tabs. This page outlines the core features of uBO Scope, demonstrates how it brings clarity to network outcomes, and explains why this level of insight is critical for privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers alike.

---

## Core Features at a Glance

- **Connection Count Badge**: The toolbar icon dynamically displays the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser tab connects to, allowing a quick health check of your web session’s network exposure.
- **Comprehensive Network Event Reporting**: uBO Scope tracks connection outcomes across the board — connections that succeed (`allowed`), those stealthily blocked by content blockers (`stealth-blocked`), and explicitly blocked ones (`blocked`).
- **Cross-Browser Transparency**: Works seamlessly on Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers, adapting to their specifics while ensuring accurate network visibility.
- **Compatible with All Content Blockers**: Because it monitors network requests via the browser’s native `webRequest` API, uBO Scope delivers reliable measurements irrespective of which content blocker you use or any DNS-level blocking in place.
- **User-Friendly Popup Interface**: The popup visually organizes connected domains into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked sections, letting you drill down easily into connection counts for each third-party domain.

## Why These Features Matter

### Real-World Network Visibility
Modern websites pull resources from numerous third-party servers, often obscured by content blockers or browser mechanisms. uBO Scope lifts this veil by reporting direct connection attempts and their outcomes in real-time. 

This means you see:

- Which domains your browser is reaching out to while loading or interacting with a page.
- Where content blockers may be silently blocking connections (stealth blocking).
- Which requests were explicitly prevented.

This granular insight enables you to verify privacy effectiveness and comprehend your network footprint beyond block counts alone.

### The Badge as Your Quick Guide
Instead of misleading raw block counts, the badge represents the **count of distinct third-party domains successfully connected to**. A lower number indicates a smaller attack surface or tracking exposure, which aligns more closely with privacy goals.

### Popup UI: Clarity on Connection Outcomes
The popup breakdown into three sections helps you: 

- **Allowed**: Domains from which your browser successfully fetched resources.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were stealthily intercepted — useful to understand hidden blocking behavior that many content blockers use.
- **Blocked**: Domains with requests explicitly prevented. 

Each domain is listed alongside the count of connections, helping you pinpoint which third parties are most active.

### Cross-Browser and Content Blocker Agnostic
uBO Scope operates through the browser’s `webRequest` API, providing consistent and dependable monitoring across supported browsers. This ensures that results are not skewed by browser-specific content blocker implementations or background filtering techniques.

## Using uBO Scope: A Real Scenario

Imagine you've installed your favorite content blocker but wonder how effective it really is in limiting third-party connections:

1. You load an informative news site.
2. The uBO Scope badge shows '7' — indicating seven distinct third-party origins your browser connected with successfully.
3. Opening the popup, you quickly discover some familiar content delivery networks under **Allowed**, a few stealth-blocked advertising domains, and some explicitly blocked tracking domains.
4. You realize your content blocker stealthily blocked several connections, which explains a lower number of cookie or script injections.

This immediate clarity helps you trust your privacy tools or fine-tune filters.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Interpreting the Badge**: Remember, a lower badge count is preferable. A higher count doesn't necessarily mean more blocking— it could mean more third-party connections allowed.
- **Understand Stealth Blocking**: Many blockers silently block without showing explicit cues. The _stealth_ category shines a light on this behavior.
- **Refresh the Tab**: Network connections reset with page reloads; close and reopen tabs to get current data.
- **Leverage for Filter List Tuning**: Use uBO Scope to validate filter list effectiveness, especially on devices with limited developer tools.
