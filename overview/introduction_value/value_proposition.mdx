# Product Value Proposition

## Unlocking True Insight into Your Privacy Exposure

Every day, the websites you visit connect to numerous third-party servers—some necessary, some intrusive. uBO Scope delivers a clear, unbiased count of these distinct third-party connections, empowering you to understand exactly who your browser is talking to — beyond what traditional content blockers reveal.

## Why Accurate Counting of Third-Party Connections Matters

Traditional indicators like block counts or test pages can mislead. uBO Scope measures the unique third-party domains your browser connects with, no matter content blockers or DNS filtering, so you gain an accurate picture of your web exposure.

- **True Privacy Exposure:** See the exact number of third-party servers contacted, helping you gauge how much of your browsing data might be potentially shared.
- **Cut Through Myths:** Challenge common misconceptions spawned by block count badges or synthetic ad blocker test pages.
- **Make Informed Decisions:** Use real data to evaluate content blockers and refine your privacy settings.

## How uBO Scope Changes the Privacy Narrative

### Debunking Common Misunderstandings

- **'Higher block counts mean better blocking'** is false: uBO Scope shows the *number of distinct third-party servers accessed*. A blocker with fewer connections allowed but a higher block count may be more effective.
- **Ad blocker test pages are unreliable:** They create fake, unreal-world connection attempts and cannot detect stealth blocking by extensions. uBO Scope sees through this, providing real-world, meaningful data.

### Empowering Users and Maintainers

Whether you are an individual privacy advocate or a filter list maintainer, uBO Scope offers clarity:

- Users can see an honest tally of third parties their browser accesses.
- Filter list maintainers get an independent tool to verify block performance, even in environments with limited browser access.

## Key Benefits at a Glance

- **Unfiltered Visibility:** Accurately reports attempts and successes of all remote server connections, unaffected by content blockers that may hide or obscure information.
- **Simplicity and Clarity:** Presents only the essential metric—unique third-party domains connected to—allowing quick privacy assessment.
- **Cross-Browser Support:** Available on major browsers (Chromium, Firefox, Safari) with consistent data handling.
- **Lightweight and Transparent:** Operates silently in the background, using browser-provided APIs without adding complexity.

## Real User Scenario

Imagine browsing your favorite news site. You see the uBO Scope badge indicating ‘7’—meaning seven distinct third-party domains were connected. Without uBO Scope, you’d rely on your content blocker's block count badge, which may show a high number like ‘20’ but obscure that fewer overall third parties got through. With real insight into third parties, you decide to adjust your blocker or avoid sites that connect excessively.

## How This Fits Into Your Privacy Toolbox

uBO Scope is specialized for a focused privacy metric—the number of unique remote servers your browser actually connects to. It complements your existing tools by offering transparency beneath the surface-level block counts or browser console logs.

<Callout type="info">
For developers and users interested in the technical background, the extension leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to listen for all network requests, counting distinct domains across allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked categories. Visit the [System Architecture Overview](/overview/architecture_features/system_architecture) for a conceptual deep dive.

## Code Snippet: Badge Count Logic Simplified
```javascript
// Sets badge with count of unique allowed third-party domains
function updateBadge(tabId, domainCount) {
    browser.action.setBadgeText({
        tabId: tabId,
        text: domainCount > 0 ? `${domainCount}` : ''
    });
}
```
