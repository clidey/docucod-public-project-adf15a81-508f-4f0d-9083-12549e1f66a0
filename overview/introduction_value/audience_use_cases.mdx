# Target Audience and Use Cases

## Who Is uBO Scope For?

uBO Scope is crafted with a clear focus on making third-party network activity transparent, providing meaningful insights into your browser's external connections. Its intended audience includes three primary groups:

- **Privacy Advocates:** Individuals deeply concerned about their online privacy who want to verify and understand every third-party server their browser contacts during everyday web browsing.
- **Curious Users:** Those who want an easy, trustworthy way to see which external servers their browser interacts with, beyond what typical ad blockers or browser tools reveal.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Experts and maintainers responsible for curating blocklists who need accurate data on network request outcomes, especially when browser debugging tools or detailed inspection is limited or unavailable.

By focusing on these groups, uBO Scope empowers users and maintainers alike to cut through common confusions and false assumptions about network requests.

## Understanding the User Intent

Each user group comes with distinct goals, all addressed effectively by uBO Scope:

- **Privacy Advocates:** They want to reduce their exposure to extraneous third-party tracking and data collection. uBO Scope reveals the actual count and identity of remote domains your browser connects to, helping users validate if their privacy tools are truly effective.

- **Curious Users:** They seek clarity on what their browser does in the background. uBO Scope's simple and distinct reporting of network request outcomes illuminates hidden connections that often go unnoticed.

- **Filter List Maintainers:** They require trustworthy, fine-grained feedback about domain connection outcomes, including not just blocked requests but also stealth-blocked and allowed connections, to improve and test their blocking rules.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Debunking Misleading Metrics

Users often assume that extensions showing a higher number of blocked requests are better. However, a higher block count can mean more domains are contacted in the first place. uBO Scope clarifies this by counting **unique third-party domains actually contacted**, showing the true surface of privacy exposure.

**Example:** A user notices two blockers with very different badge counts. uBO Scope reveals that the blocker with the lower count is actually blocking more distinct third-party servers, proving it more effective despite the smaller number.

### 2. Clarifying Browser Behavior in Complex Environments

Browsers and content blockers sometimes engage in stealthy blocking or redirection, causing typical metrics to be inaccurate or misleading. uBO Scope tracks all network request outcomes, including:

- **Allowed Connections:** Confirmed open connections to third-party domains.
- **Stealth-Blocked Connections:** Requests that the browser intercepted and redirected to prevent loading without immediately showing as blocked.
- **Blocked Connections:** Failed or explicitly blocked requests.

This comprehensive visibility enables users and developers to understand what the browser truly does, even in stealth scenarios.

### 3. Supporting Filter List Maintenance

Filter list maintainers can use uBO Scope to assess the real impact of their rules in environments where browser developer tools might be too constrained or unavailable (e.g., on mobile devices or in restricted systems). The extension presents clear domain-level insights about network request outcomes over time, facilitating iterative rule development and validation.

### 4. Educating Users on the Limitations of "Ad Blocker Tests"

Many so-called ad blocker test web pages produce artificial network requests, which do not mirror real-world browsing patterns. uBO Scope acts as a reality check by revealing actual remote connections behind everyday browsing, highlighting that such test pages do not provide reliable measurements.

**Example:** Users frustrated by test pages showing poor results can depend on uBO Scope's real connection data to gain an accurate view of their protection status.

## How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Workflow

Imagine you open a news site with multiple embedded ads, analytics, and content delivery networks (CDNs). Typical content blockers give you a block count, but what does it really mean?

With uBO Scope:

1. You open the extension popup instantly after page load.
2. See a clear summary: the number of third-party domains your browser contacted.
3. Review three distinct sections: "not blocked" (allowed), "stealth-blocked" (intercepted redirects or other stealthy blocks), and "blocked".
4. Quickly identify if unexpected domains are contacted or allowed.
5. Use this knowledge to tweak settings, adjust filter lists, or simply monitor network activity for your peace of mind.

By structuring information around outcomes and domain counts, uBO Scope speaks your language rather than overwhelming you with raw technical logs.

## Practical Tips for Users

- **Lower badge count means less exposure:** Pay attention to the number shown on uBO Scope's badge; fewer connected third-party domains indicate better privacy.

- **Monitor stealth blocking:** If you see many stealth-blocked domains, be aware that some requests are being quietly intercepted; understanding this helps avoid overestimating what was allowed.

- **Use in conjunction with other blockers:** uBO Scope provides complementary insights rather than replaces your existing content blockers.

- **For filter list maintainers:** Regularly observe allowed and stealth counts to verify if your block rules yield expected results across sites.

- **Avoid relying on ad blocker test pages:** Use uBO Scope's real network data as your benchmark for content blocking effectiveness.

---

## Troubleshooting and Common Pitfalls

- **Why is the badge sometimes empty?** If no third-party connections were detected for the current tab, the badge shows no number. This can happen on simple pages or those with strict blocking.

- **Stealth-blocked count seems high—should I worry?** Some blocking strategies rely on stealth techniques to avoid revealing block activity. This count helps you understand such behavior but does not necessarily mean exposure.

- **Data not updating immediately?** uBO Scope batches network request processing for efficiency. Wait a second after page load for accurate numbers.

- **Difference with other blocker metrics?** Counts differ because uBO Scope counts unique domains that your browser contacts, not the total of network requests.
