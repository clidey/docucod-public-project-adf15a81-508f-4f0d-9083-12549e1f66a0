# Feature Walkthrough

uBO Scope transforms your browser into a transparent observer, delivering real-time insights into every remote server connection your browser attempts or completes. This page gives you a clear, practical guide to the primary features that make uBO Scope indispensable for anyone aiming to understand and monitor network activity with precision and clarity.

---

## Real-Time Connection Tracking

From the moment you activate uBO Scope, it continuously monitors all outgoing network requests initiated by your browser. This real-time tracking ensures that you never miss a connection — whether it’s an expected first-party request or a surprising third-party call.

- **Live Monitoring:** Every connection attempt to remote servers is caught instantly, providing an up-to-the-second view.
- **Distinct Server Counting:** Instead of misleading block counts, uBO Scope counts unique third-party servers, revealing the true extent of external exposure.

### Practical Scenario
Imagine browsing to a news site: uBO Scope immediately lists all third-party servers the page tries to contact, including trackers and analytics services that may otherwise remain hidden behind content blockers.

---

## Badge Count Logic

The extension's badge, visible on the browser toolbar, displays a dynamic number that accurately reflects the count of distinct third-party remote servers your browser connected to or attempted to connect to.

- **Count Precision:** The badge counts unique hostnames rather than raw connections or blocked items to provide meaningful exposure data.
- **Updated Instantly:** Changes as network requests begin or complete, giving you a live snapshot of current network behavior.

### User Benefit
Instead of confusing block counts or imprecise metrics, the badge delivers a trustworthy privacy signal, empowering smarter browsing decisions.

## Categorization of Request Outcomes

uBO Scope categorizes all detected connections into three exclusive groups, each with clear semantic meaning:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Connections permitted by content blockers or no blocking rules applied.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that are blocked silently to avoid detection, important when testing filter efficacy.
- **Blocked:** Connections actively blocked and reported.

This categorization helps you understand the real status of each remote server interaction.

### Popup Dashboard Sections
The popup UI breaks down connected domains into these three sections with counts and details, enhancing transparency.

<AccordionGroup title="Domain Categorization">  
<Accordion title="Not Blocked (Allowed)">  
Displays all domains contacted without blocking. Useful to verify which third-parties are actively allowed.  
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Stealth-Blocked">  
Identifies connections filtered quietly to evade detection, revealing subtle blocker behavior.  
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Blocked">  
Lists domains where requests were intercepted and prevented outright, providing clear visibility on blocking actions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Cross-Browser Compatibility Notes

uBO Scope is designed to work seamlessly across the major browsers (Chromium, Firefox, Safari), adapting to their capabilities without compromising core functionality.

- **Broad Permissions:** Uses the webRequest API broadly to ensure comprehensive request capture.
- **Unified User Experience:** Despite platform differences, the UI and behavior remain consistent.

### Important Considerations
Browser version support requirements are documented in the Getting Started section, ensuring users know the minimum criteria for smooth operation.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Refresh the Page to Reset Data:** The connection counts and domain lists are session-based and update on page reloads.
- **Use Alongside Content Blockers:** Leverage uBO Scope’s visibility to validate that your blocker is working as expected.
- **Interpret Stealth-Blocked Carefully:** Some connections may be blocked without notification; understanding this improves privacy audit depth.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Badge Count Confusion:** Remember the badge reflects unique servers, not total requests or blocked entries.
- **Browser Version Mismatch:** Ensure the browser meets minimum version requirements to avoid missing features.
- **Expect No Configuration Necessary:** uBO Scope works out-of-the-box without setup, but advanced users should verify permissions.
