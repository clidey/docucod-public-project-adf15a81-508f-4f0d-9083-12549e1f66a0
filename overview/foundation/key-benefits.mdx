# Key Benefits & Typical Use Cases

uBO Scope provides a clear, concise snapshot of the remote connections a website attempts, distinguishing successful from blocked communication. This page highlights the core value propositions and practical scenarios where uBO Scope empowers users to gain unparalleled transparency and control over web network activity.

---

## Why Use uBO Scope?

Imagine browsing the web, but uncertain which external servers your current site is contacting—some essential, some possibly invasive. uBO Scope serves as your vigilant network detective, revealing every remote server involved in loading the page and clearly indicating which connections were allowed or blocked. This knowledge is crucial for:

- Enhancing privacy audits by uncovering hidden tracking domains.
- Validating the effectiveness of privacy or content blocking tools.
- Supporting filter list maintainers by providing accurate data in restricted environments.

By focusing solely on the outcome of network requests, uBO Scope gives you an unbiased, real-world view independent of your content blocker’s internal logic.

## Major Value Propositions

- **Comprehensive Connection Discovery**: Automatically identifies all remote servers that a website attempts to contact, grouping them by domain.

- **Clear Differentiation of Connection Status**: Distinguishes between allowed connections and those blocked or stealth-blocked, helping you quickly understand which third parties are active and which are prevented.

- **Privacy Audit Support**: Reveals unexpected or suspicious connections, assisting privacy-conscious users in discovering potential trackers or unwanted data sharing.

- **Filter List Developer Aid**: Acts as a reliable tool to validate blocking rules and domain whitelisting, even on devices where traditional browser developer tools are unavailable or limited.

By offering these features, uBO Scope makes visible the often invisible network activity underpinning web page loads.

## Typical Use Cases

### 1. Privacy Auditing
You want to confirm if a website is contacting third-party trackers or data collectors beyond those explicitly blocked by your content blocker. Using uBO Scope, you observe the full set of remote servers, categorized by connection outcomes, giving you a direct way to verify that privacy protections are working as intended.

### 2. Assessing Content Blocker Effectiveness
When switching content blockers or filter lists, it's hard to measure real-world effectiveness. Since uBO Scope tracks the exact number of distinct third-party servers contacted and shows which were blocked, you can objectively compare configurations. A lower count of "not blocked" domains signals tighter, more effective blocking.

### 3. Filter List Maintenance
Filter list maintainers or developers can use uBO Scope to gather accurate connection data about popular sites and verify that their rules are correctly blocking or allowing required servers. This is particularly helpful on devices or platforms that do not have full developer tool access, such as mobile or limited environments.

### 4. Working on Restricted Devices
On devices with limited tooling, such as kiosk setups, smartphones, or legacy systems with fewer debugging options, uBO Scope provides critical insight into network activity via its lightweight browser extension, bypassing the need for complex external monitoring tools.

## Real-World Example

Consider you visit an e-commerce site. The site loads product images and price data, but also silently connects to multiple analytics and advertising servers. uBO Scope’s popup lists:

- **Not blocked** domains like `cdn.example.com` for legitimate content delivery.
- **Stealth-blocked** domains where the content blocker silently prevented connections to tracking servers.
- **Blocked** domains explicitly rejected due to configured rules.

This clear categorization enables you to verify if your privacy settings are actively protecting you or if unexpected connections slip through.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Regularly check the badge count on the extension icon during browsing. A higher number indicates more third-party connections, which may warrant investigation.
- Use the popup overview to gain granular insights into which domains are allowed versus blocked.
- Combine uBO Scope's feedback with your content blocker or filter lists for customized, adaptive privacy control.
- Remember that a small number of legit third-party domains (typically Content Delivery Networks) is normal; focus on unexpected or suspicious entries.

<Warning>
The extension reports based on browser `webRequest` API. Network requests made outside this scope (e.g., some native app requests) will not appear.
</Warning>
