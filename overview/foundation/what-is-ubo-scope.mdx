## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension that acts as your window into the network behaviors of webpages. Instead of relying solely on what content blockers display, it independently monitors and reports all network connection attempts to third-party servers. This includes attempts that are successfully blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed.

By harnessing real-time network events via the browser’s `webRequest` API, uBO Scope reveals the *true* picture of what happens when you load a webpage. It counts *distinct* remote servers contacted and categorizes them, allowing you to quantify and assess the risk surface of each site.

### Solving the Visibility Problem

Most content blockers only show what they block or allow within their ruleset, which can be incomplete or misleading. uBO Scope solves this by observing *all* network requests passing through the browser, reporting on the *distinct* third-party servers involved regardless of blocking techniques.

This clarity empowers users and analysts to:
- Accurately understand exposure to external domains.
- Validate the effectiveness of their blocking tools.
- Detect stealth blocking happening silently.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

- **Independence from Blockers:** Works alongside any content blocker without interference.
- **Inclusion of DNS-level Filtering:** Reports accurately even when filtering occurs outside the browser’s extension APIs.
- **Simple, Lightweight Design:** Focused solely on connection visibility without adding complexity.
- **Open Source & Trusted:** Developed by Raymond Hill, known for uBlock Origin, under a GPL license.

## Key Features at a Glance

- **Third-Party Domain Counting:** Shows how many distinct third-party domains a webpage attempts to contact.
- **Connection Outcome Classification:** Categorizes connections as “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” or “blocked.”
- **Real-Time Badge Count:** Reflects the number of distinct allowed third-party domains on the browser toolbar.
- **Detailed Popup View:** Dive deeper into connection counts per domain inside the popup panel.
- **Cross-Browser Support:** Available for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

### Real-World Scenario

When opening a news site, uBO Scope will display not just the ads it blocks, but every tracker and third-party service the site tries to contact. If a tracker is stealth-blocked by your content blocker, uBO Scope will categorize it accordingly, giving you confidence in your protection layers.
