# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Understanding your browser’s network activity is pivotal in today’s web landscape, where privacy, performance, and security take center stage. uBO Scope caters to a diverse audience, each seeking clarity about remote server connections in their own unique contexts. This page helps you determine if uBO Scope aligns with your needs and explains why it’s an indispensable tool for many.

## Target Audience & Users

### Privacy-Focused Users
If you prioritize keeping your browsing private, uBO Scope offers the transparency needed to audit which third-party servers your browser connects to. It reveals the distinct domains involved in network requests — highlighting allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections — so you can better understand your exposure.

These users benefit from:
- Real-time awareness of how many and which external servers receive your data
- Insight that helps adjust privacy setups, browser extensions, or filter lists
- Validation that content blockers and filters truly reduce third-party connections

### Filter List Maintainers
Maintainers of filter lists for content blocking gain unparalleled value by using uBO Scope to validate their filtering strategies in real-world browsing sessions.

Key advantages include:
- Verifying the actual network impact of their filters beyond theoretical matches
- Identifying stealth-blocked requests, helping refine filter stealthiness and effectiveness
- Gathering statistics on distinct servers triggered by their filters to balance blocking and user experience

### Web Security Researchers
Researchers investigating web tracking, remote connections, or network-based threats are empowered to examine granular request outcomes.

Use cases here include:
- Measuring how different websites and tabs behave in terms of network connections
- Debunking assumptions about content blockers by comparing allowed vs. blocked connection counts
- Studying how stealth-block mechanisms influence what network requests succeed or get rerouted

### Browser & Network Defense Validators
Anyone evaluating or benchmarking browser network privacy defenses will find uBO Scope an objective lens.

Why you should consider it:
- Confirm whether the reported badge counts on toolbar icons truly reflect third-party connections
- Test claims about which content blocker or privacy tool is more effective
- Use real traffic data instead of synthetic or fabricated 'ad blocker test' pages

## Common Use Cases

### Debunking Badge Count Myths
It’s a common mistake to equate a high block count badge with better privacy or blocking effectiveness. uBO Scope clarifies this misconception by reporting the number of distinct third-party servers _allowed_ after blocking.

For example:
- A higher block count may coincide with more third-party servers being contacted, revealing less actual blocking.
- Conversely, a lower badge count means fewer unique remote connections, indicating stronger privacy or filtering.

### Evaluating Network Privacy Posture
uBO Scope helps illustrate your browser’s true network footprint, enabling you to:
- See which third-party domains your active tab actually connects to
- Understand the balance of allowed versus blocked domains
- Detect stealth-blocked connections that might otherwise go unnoticed

### Examining the Effect of webRequest Filtering
By monitoring the outcomes of network requests via the `webRequest` API, uBO Scope shows how browser-level request filtering impacts actual traffic.

This insight allows users to:
- Analyze how stealth blocking modifies the connection surface
- Confirm that DNS or network-level blocking is reflected in request outcomes
- Understand scenarios where blocked requests may still attempt redirections

## Before and After: With and Without uBO Scope

| Scenario | Typical Experience Without uBO Scope | Experience With uBO Scope |
|----------|------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Browsing Privacy Insights | Users have no direct visibility of how many third-party servers are contacted. Block counts on extensions may be misunderstood. | Users see exact counts of distinct allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains per tab, using transparent metrics unrelated to block counts alone. |
| Filter List Validation | Difficulty measuring if filters reduce actual connections; reliance on block counters. | Direct feedback on filter effectiveness through observed network outcomes, helping improve filter quality. |
| Browser Network Defense Testing | Reliance on synthetic ad blocker test pages with unrealistic network behaviors. | Real-world connection data clarifies which blocking approaches genuinely reduce third-party communications. |

---

## Practical Tips

- Use uBO Scope alongside your favorite content blocker to validate actual blocking results and adjust filters intelligently.

- Pay attention to the _stealth-blocked_ category, which reflects requests that are blocked in a way designed to be less detectable by websites.

- When troubleshooting unexpected third-party connections, check uBO Scope's popup for clear domain counts and details.

- Keep in mind that lower distinct server counts often correspond to better privacy outcomes.
