# Core Features at a Glance

Discover how uBO Scope brings full transparency to your browser’s network activity by breaking down its fundamental capabilities. This page highlights the key functions that enable you to visualize and understand third-party server connections – regardless of the content blocking tools or DNS-level filters you may have in place.

## Unveiling the True Network Footprint

Browsers often contact many third-party servers during browsing sessions, many of which you may not realize. Content blockers and DNS filters attempt to block or hide some of these connections, but their results can be misleading. uBO Scope reveals the full picture by accurately counting distinct third-party servers your browser contacts and categorizing those connections by their outcome.

### What This Page Covers
- Counting unique third-party servers contacted per browser tab
- Displaying details of domains and requests broken down by tab
- Badge reporting directly on the browser toolbar for quick insight
- Independence from any specific content blocker or DNS filter solution

## Core Capabilities Explained

### 1. Counting Unique Third-Party Servers

uBO Scope tracks the number of distinct remote third-party servers your browser attempts to connect with during a browsing session. This count reflects servers actually contacted or attempted, giving you a realistic sense of your browsing privacy exposure.

> **Why it matters:** 
> A lower unique server count means fewer external parties are involved in loading your webpages, which often aligns with better privacy and performance.

### 2. Tab-Scoped Domain and Request Insights

Every active browser tab generates its own network footprint. uBO Scope organizes network connection data by tab, showing:

- The domains contacted
- The hostnames involved
- The number of requests per domain

This breakdown helps you isolate which tabs contribute to high third-party network activity and investigate them individually.

### 3. Outcome-Based Categorization

uBO Scope classifies each third-party request into three categories:

- **Allowed:** Network requests that completed successfully.
- **Blocked:** Requests prevented from completing, often by content blockers or network filtering.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests prevented in a way that leaves no visible trace to web content, an advanced form of blocking.

This provides clarity on not just what your browser tries to do, but what actually happens behind the scenes.

### 4. Toolbar Badge Reporting

The extension’s icon badge displays the count of unique third-party domains contacted for the active tab. This live feedback lets you instantly gauge the extent of third-party network activity without opening the popup panel.

### 5. Content Blocker Agnostic Operation

uBO Scope works independently of any specific content blocker or DNS-level filtering solution. It listens to the browser’s `webRequest` API and reports the outcome of network requests irrespective of the filtering layer involved. This means:

- You get a truthful view of network connections even when multiple blockers or DNS filters are applied.
- Results expose the browser’s actual network behavior, debunking myths from superficial block counts or fake 'ad blocker test' sites.

## Real-World Flow: How uBO Scope Shows What Happens

Imagine you have multiple tabs open, some loading complex websites with numerous third-party resources:

- For a tab loading a news site, uBO Scope counts 12 unique third-party domains contacted
- It reports 8 allowed, 2 blocked by your content blocker, and 2 stealth-blocked
- The popup panel breaks down the list of domains per outcome with precise counts
- The toolbar badge instantly shows “12” to indicate all unique third-party domains accessed

This flow lets you deep dive into the tab’s network footprint and confirm how effective your privacy setup is in real time.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use the toolbar badge as a quick privacy health indicator; a rising count can signal increased tracking surfaces.
- Open the popup for detailed investigation into which domains are contacted and whether requests are blocked or allowed.
- Combine uBO Scope data with your content blocker’s settings to fine-tune filters and achieve better privacy.
- Remember that some third-party servers (such as CDNs) are legitimate and common, so a nonzero count is expected.

<Warning>
The count includes all remote servers contacted or attempted, regardless of whether the content blocker blocked or stealth-blocked requests. Do not confuse a higher number alone with poor privacy without context.
</Warning>

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Badge Count Not Updating

If the toolbar badge does not display or update the unique third-party server count:

- Ensure uBO Scope has active permissions for your browser version.
- Confirm you have opened at least one tab with network activity.
- Refresh the tab or restart the browser to reinitialize network tracking.

### 2. Unexpectedly High Counts

- Some legitimate domains like CDN providers or analytics may cause higher counts.
- Investigate the domains through the popup panel before making filter decisions.

### 3. No Data in Popup Panel

- Make sure the browser supports the `webRequest` API and that uBO Scope is correctly installed.
- Network requests made outside browser tabs or by extensions may not appear.
