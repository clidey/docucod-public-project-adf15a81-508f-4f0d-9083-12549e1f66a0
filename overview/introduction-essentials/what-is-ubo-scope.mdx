# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Third-Party Connection in Your Browser

uBO Scope is a browser extension designed to reveal every attempted or successful connection made to third-party remote servers when you browse the web. Think of it as a diagnostic magnifying glass, lifting the veil on the often opaque network activities that occur behind the scenes of any visited webpage.

### Why Does This Matter?

Modern web pages frequently load resources from a myriad of external sources—advertisers, analytics services, content delivery networks (CDNs), and more. While some connections are essential, many could impact your privacy or page performance without your knowledge.

uBO Scope empowers you to understand exactly which third-party servers your browser talks to, highlighting whether those connections are allowed, stealthily redirected, or blocked by your content blockers or privacy tools.

## What is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a transparent auditing and diagnostic tool for anyone who cares about understanding the third-party network requests made by their browser. It tracks and reports every outgoing network request, categorizing them based on whether they were allowed, blocked, or redirected ("stealth-blocked").

Unlike typical content blockers that focus on blocking, uBO Scope focuses on **measurement** — revealing what truly happens in real-time under the hood.

### Core Purpose

- To **reveal all outgoing connections** to third-party remote servers, whether they are successful, blocked, or redirected.
- To provide **clarity and transparency** around content blocking effectiveness without bias.
- To help users and privacy-conscious individuals fact-check browser behaviors and content blocking claims.

### What Problem Does uBO Scope Solve?

It can be difficult to assess how many third-party servers your browser connects to, especially when content blockers employ stealth or evasive tactics.

uBO Scope cuts through the noise by providing:

- A **clear snapshot** of all network requests initiated by the current tab.
- A precise **count of unique third-party domains contacted**, giving you a more meaningful metric than simple block counts.
- A way to track connections **independent of which content blocker is in use**, allowing for unbiased auditing.

### Key Differentiators

- **Transparency Over Blocking**: Instead of helping you block, it helps you **see** what others block or allow.
- **Independence**: It works alongside any content blocker or privacy tool; it doesn't block itself.
- **Accurate Reflection**: Uses low-level `webRequest` listeners, giving detailed, real-time insights.
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Available for Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari, using respective modern WebExtension APIs.

### How Does uBO Scope Work?

At a high level:

1. **Monitoring Network Requests:** It hooks into the browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor every network request initiated by web pages.
2. **Classifying Outcomes:** Each request is categorized as `allowed`, `blocked`, or `stealth-blocked` (redirected) based on its result.
3. **Grouping by Domain:** Requests are grouped by their third-party domains for easier interpretation.
4. **Real-Time Reporting:** Data is aggregated and displayed in a popup panel that updates live as you navigate.

The extension also keeps track of the distinct count of third-party domains contacted and presents it prominently on the toolbar icon badge, enabling quick visibility without opening the panel.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine visiting a news website. Many invisible network requests are made in the background—to advertising networks, analytics providers, CDNs, and more. uBO Scope reveals all these connections in one clear list. It shows which domains were fully allowed to load resources, which were blocked (and thus prevented from loading), and which connections attempted stealthy redirection.

This empowers you to:

- Gain **real awareness** of the third parties your browsing interacts with.
- Verify your content blocking extensions are working as intended.
- Detect suspicious or unexpected third-party connections that may impact your privacy.

## Practical Tips

- **Interpret the Badge Wisely:** The badge number shows how many distinct third-party domains currently connect with the active tab. A lower number generally indicates fewer third-party requests.
- **Use Alongside Content Blockers:** uBO Scope complements blockers like uBlock Origin by revealing their real-world impact.
- **Understand That Not All Third-Parties Are Bad:** Some third parties, like content delivery networks (CDNs), serve necessary resources.

**Note:**
uBO Scope reports every network request through the browser API. Some network requests made outside this API's reach (such as DNS requests or connections made by other apps) are not visible to the extension.
