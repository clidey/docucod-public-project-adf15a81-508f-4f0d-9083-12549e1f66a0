title: "What is uBO Scope?"
description: "Learn what uBO Scope is, its core value proposition, and why it exists. This page covers the extension’s principal mission: revealing all attempted or successful connections to remote servers on a webpage, regardless of which content blockers or DNS filters are in play. Users will gain context about the product’s origins and the real-world challenges it solves for power users, privacy advocates, and filter list maintainers."

# What is uBO Scope?

Discover the companion extension that brings clarity to your web browsing by revealing every remote connection a webpage attempts or completes. uBO Scope answers the critical question: exactly which third-party servers does your browser contact, beyond the reach of traditional content blockers or DNS filtering?

## Introducing uBO Scope: Your Window Into Web Connections

Web browsing today is a complex web of network requests. A single webpage often reaches out to dozens of remote servers — some essential, some questionable. But how can you truly know which connections are attempted or allowed, especially when content blockers silently interfere? uBO Scope sheds light on this invisible network activity.

Built as a companion to uBlock Origin, uBO Scope focuses on **measuring** network events rather than blocking them. Its primary mission: to reveal every attempt, success, or failure to connect to remote servers triggered by the active webpage, no matter which content blocking or DNS-based filtering is running.

### Why uBO Scope Exists

- **Transparency**: Understand which third-party domains your browser communicates with, independently of any content blocker.
- **Unbiased Reporting**: See network requests as they truly occur, avoiding misleading counts or claims from content blocker testing websites.
- **Support for Power Users and Maintainers**: Provide detailed connection data to privacy advocates and filter list authors who require accurate network visibility.

## What Problems Does uBO Scope Solve?

Imagine you are curious whether a content blocker is truly effective. Or you want granular insight into which external connections a webpage is making to assess privacy risks. Common testing sites may produce unreliable or artificially constructed results, while browser tools can be limited or opaque. uBO Scope fills this gap by delivering raw, reliable data on all attempted and successful network communications, including those blocked stealthily by DNS or advanced filters.

### Real-World Challenges Addressed

- Webpages often make stealthy third-party requests that evade detection by simplistic tools.
- Content blockers vary widely in approach; number of blocked requests alone is a poor metric for effectiveness.
- DNS-based blocking can silently block connections without the browser or web page being aware.
- Filter list maintainers benefit from concise network details without needing full browser dev tools access.

## Inside the Popup UI: How uBO Scope Shows You Connection Data

When you click the uBO Scope extension icon, a clean popup displays:

- The current page's hostname and domain, clearly separated.
- A summary count of all distinct connected domains from that page.
- Domains categorized by outcome:
  - **Not Blocked**: Connections the browser successfully made.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Connections blocked silently (e.g., DNS filtering).
  - **Blocked**: Connections explicitly blocked (errors observed).

Each category lists domain names along with the number of successful or attempted connections, providing immediate insight into your browsing footprint.

### Practical Example

Suppose you visit a news website. The popup might reveal:

- 8 distinct third-party domains connected.
- 5 domains successfully contacted (e.g., ad networks, CDNs).
- 2 domains stealth-blocked by DNS filters.
- 1 domain explicitly blocked by content blocking rules.

This breakdown helps you decide if the site is reaching out to more trackers than you expected, or if your filters are working effectively.

## Why You Should Care About uBO Scope

### Primary Benefits

- **Achieve True Visibility**: No more guessing about your browser’s network activity.
- **Cut Through Misleading Metrics**: Don’t rely on block counts alone to judge privacy or blocker quality.
- **Augment Filter Lists**: Use reliable data to improve or tune content blocking rules.
- **Understand Network Behavior in Real Time**: Immediately see connections as pages load and interact.

### Who Benefits Most?

- **Power Users** wanting granular network insight beyond basic blocking.
- **Privacy Advocates** needing evidence of third-party connections.
- **Filter List Maintainers** who want accurate data to validate block efficacy.

### Before and After Using uBO Scope

| Without uBO Scope | With uBO Scope |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Blind to which third-party domains are contacted | Clear, categorized list of connected domains |
| Misinterpreting block counts as quality indicators | Informed understanding of network activity regardless of blockers |
| Difficulty troubleshooting stealthy DNS blocking | Visibility into stealth-blocked connections |

## Getting Started with uBO Scope

### Quick Preview

1. Install uBO Scope from your browser’s official extension store.
2. Visit any webpage.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open its popup.
4. Observe the displayed domains and connection outcomes.

### Prerequisites

- Modern browser supporting WebExtension APIs with `webRequest` capabilities (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- At least one active content blocker or DNS filtering method (optional, but useful).

## Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls

- The badge count on the toolbar icon represents the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected to; fewer is typically better.
- Not all third-party connections are harmful—many are legitimate CDNs or essential services.
- Network requests outside the reach of the browser’s `webRequest` API (e.g., certain proprietary protocols) will not be reported.
- Some content blockers may stealthily block without obvious failures. uBO Scope reveals these stealth blocks.

---

## Troubleshooting

If uBO Scope shows no data:

- Ensure the extension is properly installed and enabled.
- Confirm your browser supports the required WebExtension APIs.
- Check that you have browsed to a valid webpage (not a local file or about:// page).

If badge counts seem unexpectedly high or low:

- Understand the difference between blocked, stealth-blocked, and allowed connections.
- Visit the popup UI for detailed domain breakdown.
