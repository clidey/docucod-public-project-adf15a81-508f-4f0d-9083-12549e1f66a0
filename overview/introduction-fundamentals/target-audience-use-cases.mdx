## Who Benefits Most From uBO Scope?

uBO Scope caters primarily to a niche yet critical set of users who value transparency and accuracy in understanding web connections:

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Individuals determined to minimize or control the number of third-party servers their browser connects to. uBO Scope helps them verify just how many distinct remote servers accessed their browsers during web browsing, empowering informed decisions about privacy layers.

- **Filter List Maintainers:** Professionals who create and maintain filter lists for content blockers. For them, uBO Scope provides reliable network request data—even on devices where standard browser development tools might be limited—helping maintain the efficacy and accuracy of filters.

- **Researchers & Analysts Debunking Content Blocking Myths:** Some users investigate claims regarding blocking effectiveness made by various content blockers or webpages claiming to test blockers. uBO Scope offers a ground-truth view of what connections actually occur and which are blocked, bypassing inaccurate or misleading metrics.


## Practical Scenarios: How Different Users Leverage uBO Scope

### 1. Privacy-Conscious User Evaluates Browser Exposure
Jane is concerned about her online privacy and wants to see exactly which third-party domains her browser contacts while visiting popular websites.

**Workflow:**
- She installs uBO Scope alongside her existing content blocker.
- Browses to a news website.
- Opens the uBO Scope popup to review the distinct remote servers contacted.
- Notes the count and inspects which domains were allowed through, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

**Outcome:** Jane gains a concrete view of her exposure, beyond simple block counts, enabling her to adjust filters or settings accordingly.


### 2. Filter List Maintainer Performs Remote Server Analysis
Alex develops and maintains filters used by millions. He needs robust, accurate network connection data to validate his filter lists and ensure no unexpected third parties are slipping through.

**Workflow:**
- Uses uBO Scope on test pages and real-world sites across browsers.
- Gathers connection metrics including those that content blockers might mask in subtle ways.
- Cross-references these insights with filter effectiveness.

**Outcome:** Alex can enhance filters with confidence and quickly identify false positives or overlooked resources.


### 3. Researcher Debunks Misleading Content Blocker Comparisons
Morgan reads forums where users claim that 'high block counts mean a better blocker.' Morgan suspects this is a misconception.

**Workflow:**
- Installs uBO Scope alongside different content blockers.
- Navigates the same site under each blocker.
- Uses uBO Scope to observe actual distinct third-party connections regardless of reported block counts.

**Outcome:** Morgan conclusively shows that higher block counts don’t always equate to fewer connections, providing evidence to help the community understand content blocker effectiveness more accurately.


## Why These Use Cases Matter

Without tools like uBO Scope, users rely heavily on indirect or flawed metrics to judge privacy and filtering efficacy. This page underscores how uBO Scope fills a crucial gap:

- Offers **transparent, objective data** on third-party connections.
- Supports **informed privacy decisions and filter development**.
- Helps dismantle popular **myths** around blocking metrics and test pages.


## Tips & Best Practices

- **Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker** to get a clear picture of network connections, not just block numbers.
- **Regularly check the extension’s popup UI** to monitor connections on different sites.
- **Combine insights from uBO Scope with other tools** for comprehensive analysis.
- **Understand stealth-blocked connections** as attempts to block resources that might not trigger classic blocking events.


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t equate raw block counts from other blockers with true effectiveness – uBO Scope reveals the reality of network connections.
- Avoid relying on 'ad blocker test' websites alone — they simulate unrealistic scenarios that rarely reflect actual browsing patterns.
- Remember that some legitimate third-party connections are normal (like CDNs). Use uBO Scope to decide what's acceptable for your use case.


## Looking Ahead

The extension is planned to gain additional features aiding especially filter list maintainers, such as more granular network request details. This will further enhance its utility across all user groups described here.
