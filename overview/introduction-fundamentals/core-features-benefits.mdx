# Core Features & Benefits

Discover how uBO Scope empowers you to gain unparalleled insight into the third-party connections that webpages make during browsing. This page focuses on the key features that make uBO Scope a vital companion tool for anyone serious about privacy, web security, or understanding web resource flows.

---

## Why uBO Scope Matters

Every website you visit interacts with numerous servers to load resources — some essential, others potentially intrusive. uBO Scope reveals exactly which remote servers your browser contacts, showing connections that content blockers or DNS filters might conceal. 

By focusing on third-party network requests and their outcomes, uBO Scope helps you easily see and understand the web’s hidden connections.

## Core Features

### 1. Precise Third-Party Connection Counting

You see an accurate count of **distinct third-party domains** your browser connected to when loading a webpage. This count appears directly on the toolbar badge, making it easy to gauge how many external servers a site contacts—critical for privacy-conscious users.

> **Benefit:** Quickly identify sites with excessive or unexpected third-party contacts, highlighting privacy risks.

### 2. Categorization of Network Requests

uBO Scope classifies network requests into three meaningful categories:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully made, showing domains that delivered resources.
- **Blocked:** Requests that failed due to blocking or errors.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Redirected requests or those silently blocked before reaching the server.

This detailed classification is displayed in the popup UI, clearly listing domains under each outcome.

> **Benefit:** Understand not just how many requests succeeded or failed, but how they were managed, providing transparency beyond typical blockers.

### 3. Browser-Native `webRequest` API Utilization

uBO Scope leverages the browser’s built-in `webRequest` APIs, ensuring it monitors requests across all types of content (including script-based, DNS-filtered, or disabled resources) without bias.

> **Benefit:** Receive true, source-agnostic insights regardless of what extensions or filters affect your network activity.

### 4. Domain and Hostname Distinction

The extension differentiates between hostnames (specific servers) and their domain grouping using the public suffix list, ensuring counts and listings reflect meaningful, consolidated entities.

> **Benefit:** Avoid inflated or misleading counts caused by subdomains or hosts, focusing instead on principal domain entities.

### 5. Real-Time Updates and Badge Counts

Network request outcomes are processed continuously in the background, with the toolbar badge updating in real-time to reflect the current number of connected third-party domains.

> **Benefit:** Stay informed at a glance without manual refreshes.

### 6. User-Friendly Popup Interface

The popup provides:
- A clear summary of total connected domains
- Sections for each category of request outcome
- Counts per domain to highlight which third-party servers are most active

> **Benefit:** Effortlessly explore detailed connection data when you want, with intuitive visuals and organization.

## How These Features Benefit You

- **Enhanced Privacy Awareness:** Spot unexpected or potentially unwanted third-party connections that might compromise privacy.
- **Insight into Content Blocking:** See beyond block counts and verify which third parties are actually blocked or allowed.
- **Filter List Maintenance Support:** Identify domains involved in network activities useful for fine-tuning blocklists or evaluating content blockers.
- **Debunk Common Ad-Blocker Myths:** Understand that block counts don’t tell the whole story, using uBO Scope to see actual third-party connections.

### Real-World Scenario
Imagine browsing your favorite news site. With uBO Scope, you see that while only a handful of resources were blocked, numerous stealth connections occur silently. This insight alerts you to tracking attempts or hidden data flows you would otherwise miss.

---

## Tips for Best Use

- Regularly check the toolbar badge for sites with unexpectedly high third-party connections.
- Use the categorized popup lists to distinguish between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Remember that a **lower third-party connection count is generally better** for privacy and security.

---

## Practical Example: Interpreting Popup Data
Within the popup:

- The header shows the current webpage's domain.
- The **domains connected** count summarizes third parties reached.
- Domains under **not blocked** are active connections.
- Domains under **stealth-blocked** indicate requests redirected or silently blocked.
- Domains under **blocked** account for failed or prevented requests.

This structure guides your understanding of the complexity behind web connections in a straightforward way.

## Summary
uBO Scope's features provide a precise, transparent view of third-party network requests, making it an indispensable tool for privacy advocates and filter list developers alike. By bridging the gap left by traditional content blockers, it offers a holistic understanding of web connections and their outcomes.
