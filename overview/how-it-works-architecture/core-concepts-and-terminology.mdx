# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the key terms used within uBO Scope is essential to effectively interpret the data shown in the popup interface and toolbar badge. This page explains core concepts and terminology such as 'third-party remote server', and the connection statuses: 'allowed', 'blocked', and 'stealth-blocked'. These distinctions provide crucial insight into your browser's network activity, privacy assessment, and the real-world effectiveness of content blocking.

## What Are Third-Party Remote Servers?

When you visit a webpage, it often loads content not only from its own domain (first-party) but also from other domains (third-party). These third-party remote servers can provide resources such as ads, analytics, social media widgets, or content delivery services.

A **third-party remote server** is any server that belongs to a domain different from the website you are currently visiting. For example, visiting `example.com` might load scripts or images from `cdn.examplecdn.com` or `analytics.thirdparty.com` — these are considered third-party.

Being able to detect and understand connections to these servers is critical for assessing your privacy exposure because third parties often track user behavior or deliver unwanted content.

## Connection Statuses Explained

The uBO Scope popup and badge classify remote server connections into three outcome categories that reflect the extension’s assessment of the request's status:

### 1. Allowed (Not Blocked)

- **Definition:** These are requests that successfully connected to third-party servers without being blocked by your content blocker or DNS-level filtering.
- **What This Means:** Resources from these domains were downloaded and integrated into the page.
- **User Impact:** While legitimate services often rely on such connections (e.g., content delivery networks), a high number of allowed third-party connections could also indicate extensive tracking or ad delivery.
- **Privacy Implication:** These connections potentially expose you to third-party tracking or additional network requests that could affect your privacy.

### 2. Blocked

- **Definition:** Requests actively prevented from completing by the content blocker or DNS filtering.
- **What This Means:** These third-party servers were contacted but their network requests were halted before any data was transmitted or received.
- **User Impact:** Blocking reduces unwanted content like ads or tracking scripts from loading.
- **Privacy Implication:** An effective block count helps reduce privacy risks and network load by stopping connections to potentially harmful or privacy-invasive servers.

### 3. Stealth-Blocked

- **Definition:** These are requests intercepted and hidden by the content blocker using stealth techniques, usually through redirects where the original request is silently diverted.
- **What This Means:** Unlike visible blocking, stealth blocking prevents detection by the webpage itself, protecting the user without alerting the site.
- **User Impact:** Stealth blocking balances page functionality with privacy by avoiding broken webpage elements or anti-blocker scripts.
- **Privacy Implication:** Stealth-blocked requests enhance privacy by concealing blocking activity and keeping tracking attempts hidden.

## Why Do These Distinctions Matter?

Modern content blockers often use different techniques to handle unwanted third-party requests. By showing these discrete statuses, uBO Scope gives you a transparent and actionable view of:

- Exactly which domains your browser connects to while browsing,
- Which third-party connections are successfully made,
- Which are blocked outright, and
- Which are stealthily blocked without page detection.

This clarity empowers you to make informed decisions about your browser's privacy settings and better understand the effectiveness of your content blocker.

<u>**Example:** Suppose you visit a popular news website. The popup shows 30 allowed third-party domains, 10 stealth-blocked, and 5 blocked. You realize many connections are allowed, some stealthily blocked, and some visibly blocked. This nuanced insight helps you understand your exposure and blocker performance beyond simplistic block counts.</u>

## How Core Terms Appear in the Interface

The popup interface categorizes domains under headings matching these statuses:

- **Not blocked (Allowed):** Lists third-party domains whose connections succeeded.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Lists domains whose requests were silently redirected/blocked.
- **Blocked:** Lists domains whose network requests were actively prevented.

The toolbar badge shows a count of distinct allowed third-party domains — a live indicator of your web session's third-party exposure.

---

## Practical Tips for Users

- **Focus on the allowed count:** The toolbar badge reports the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected. A lower count generally signals a tighter privacy stance.
- **Understand stealth blocking's role:** Some blockers stealthily suppress requests to prevent detection or site breakage, enhancing your experience without sacrificing privacy.
- **Interpret blocked counts carefully:** A higher block count does not necessarily mean better blocking; it might indicate more attempts from third parties targeting your browser.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Asked Questions">
<Accordion title="Why might some third-party requests be marked as stealth-blocked?">
Stealth-blocking prevents webpages from detecting blocking by using indirect methods like redirects or silent failure. This helps maintain site functionality while still blocking unwanted connections.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does the badge count exactly represent?">
The badge shows the number of distinct third-party remote server domains where connections were allowed (not blocked). It directly reflects your current session’s exposure to third parties.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can some connections be missed or unreported?">
Yes. Connections initiated outside the browser’s `webRequest` API scope (such as those from some browser internals) cannot be detected or reported by uBO Scope.
