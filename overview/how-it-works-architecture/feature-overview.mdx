# Feature Overview

## Real-Time Tracking of Remote Server Connections

At the core of uBO Scope lies its ability to monitor network activity in real time, reporting every connection a web page attempts or successfully establishes with remote servers. Unlike traditional content blockers that merely show blocked counts, uBO Scope reveals the distinct third-party servers your browser interacts with, regardless of whether those requests were allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked. This transparency empowers users and filter list maintainers to understand actual network exposure rather than relying on potentially misleading block counts.

## Toolbar Icon Badge: Instant Network Exposure Insight

The extension prominently features a badge icon on the browser toolbar that displays the number of unique third-party remote servers a given web page has connected with. This count updates dynamically as you navigate and interact with pages:

- **Allowed connections:** Servers your browser successfully communicated with.
- **Blocked connections:** Servers whose requests were stopped.
- **Stealth-blocked connections:** Requests stopped in ways that are hidden from the web page itself.

The badge count focuses on **allowed** third-party servers only, signaling your real network exposure. A lower number indicates fewer third-party connections and thus a smaller privacy footprint.

## Differentiating Request Outcomes for Deeper Clarity

Understanding the fate of network requests provides invaluable insight into your browsing privacy. uBO Scope categorizes connections into three distinct outcomes:

- **Allowed:** Requests that completed successfully.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly prevented by content blockers or other blocking mechanisms.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests blocked silently to avoid revealing blocking activity to the web page.

This differentiation enables users to identify which third parties have truly been prevented from loading content and which are still active, despite any appearance otherwise.

## Multi-Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope supports the major modern browsers, ensuring consistent experience across your preferred platform:

- **Google Chrome**: Available via the Chrome Web Store, leveraging the latest MV3 framework.
- **Mozilla Firefox**: Supports recent Firefox versions, including Firefox for Android.
- **Apple Safari**: Requires Safari 18.5 or later for full compatibility.

This cross-browser reach allows privacy-conscious users and filter maintainers to apply the tool wherever they browse.

## How It Works: From Network Request Capture to User Feedback

uBO Scope uses browser `webRequest` listeners to intercept and monitor network requests made from web pages. It captures connection attempts and their outcomes, including redirects, errors, and successful responses. Each request is examined to extract its hostname and associated domain, grouping them to report distinct third-party servers.

By aggregating this data per browser tab, the extension updates the toolbar badge with the current count of allowed third-party domains connected to by the active tab. Meanwhile, detailed outcomes categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked are displayed within the extension's popup UI for user review.

<Tip>
You can instantly gauge your privacy exposure simply by glancing at the badge count on the toolbar icon — a powerful metric far more meaningful than raw block counts shown by traditional blockers.

## Typical User Flow

1. **Navigate to any website:** uBO Scope begins monitoring third-party connections immediately.
2. **Observe badge icon:** The number indicates how many distinct third-party servers have been connected to.
3. **Open popup:** View detailed breakdowns of allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
4. **Analyze privacy exposure:** Understand which third parties are present and which are blocked.

## Practical Example

Imagine visiting a news website known for extensive ads and trackers. While a content blocker may report high block counts, uBO Scope shows the actual number of third-party servers your browser connects to. This often reveals that despite blocking many requests, the browser still contacts multiple distinct third-party servers. Using this insight, you can make more informed decisions about privacy tools or filter list efficacy.

## Summary of Core Features

- **Real-time network connection tracking:** Captures every attempted and successful network connection for active tabs.
- **Distinct third-party server count badge:** Reflects the number of unique servers accessed, focusing on privacy significance.
- **Outcome classification:** Separately reports allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked requests for nuanced insight.
- **Multi-browser support:** Works seamlessly across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **Persistence and session handling:** Maintains accurate state even as tabs open, close, or navigate.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

- **Badge remains empty despite browsing:** Ensure your browser supports the required `webRequest` API; note some browsers have hidden or limited functionality.
- **Unexpectedly high server counts:** Some legitimate third parties, such as CDNs or embedded widgets, naturally require connections. Compare counts across sites to establish your baseline.
- **Interpreting stealth-blocked vs blocked:** Stealth-blocking means requests are blocked in a manner hidden from the page scripts; blocked requests are explicit.

## Next Steps

To get started quickly with uBO Scope, consult the [Quick Start & Validation](https://yourdocs.url/guides/core-usage/quick-validation) guide. To deepen your understanding, explore the [Interpreting the Icon Badge Count](https://yourdocs.url/guides/core-usage/interpreting-badge-count) for detailed explanation of badge metrics.

For filter list maintainers, the extension provides invaluable data about third-party presence on the web for testing and refinement.
