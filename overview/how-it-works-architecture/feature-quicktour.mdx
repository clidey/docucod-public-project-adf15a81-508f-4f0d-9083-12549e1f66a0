# Quick Feature Overview

## See Your Privacy Exposure at a Glance

uBO Scope offers a concise yet powerful feature set that lets you instantly understand third-party connections made by your browser — regardless of your content blocking setup. This page summarizes the most important features you’ll interact with daily and explains how they help you monitor and manage your online privacy effectively.

---

## Key Features & What You Can See

### 1. Browser Toolbar Badge Showing Third-Party Connection Counts

- **What it does:** The extension icon on your browser toolbar displays a dynamic badge showing the number of distinct third-party remote servers your current tab has connected to.
- **Why it matters:** This real-time count lets you judge your exposure to external domains quickly. A lower badge number indicates a cleaner, less privacy-invasive browsing experience.
- **Example:** If your badge shows “5” while visiting a news site, it means five unique third-party domains have been contacted — providing a straightforward metric for tracking third-party requests.

### 2. Real-Time Popup with Detailed Connection Statistics

- **What it does:** Clicking the extension icon reveals a popup detailing network connections made by the active tab.
- **How it helps:** The popup categorizes connections by their outcome (allowed, blocked, stealth-blocked), giving you transparency about what your browser tried and what was successfully blocked or hidden.
- **At a glance:** The popup shows:
  - The current tab’s hostname and domain.
  - A summary count of *all* distinct connected domains.
  - Separate lists of domains by connection outcome, including the number of requests per domain.

### 3. Categorization of Connection Outcomes

- **Allowed:** Resources loaded successfully from third-party servers.
- **Blocked:** Requests actively blocked by content blockers.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were stealthily blocked or redirected, which may not be visible through conventional tools.

This breakdown empowers you to understand exactly how many and which third parties your browser interacts with, even when stealth blocking is in effect.

### 4. Compatibility with All Content Blockers

- **Full visibility:** uBO Scope works independently of any content blockers you use, such as uBlock Origin, ensuring it captures all observed network activity.
- **Benefit:** You gain a truthful and unfiltered picture of connection attempts, unlike relying on blocker-specific UI which might omit stealth-blocked or DNS-blocked connections.

## How It Works Behind the Scenes (Simplified User View)

While primarily focusing on user-facing features, it’s helpful to know that:

- The extension leverages browser network APIs to monitor every network request your browser attempts.
- It efficiently counts and categorizes these requests by domain and outcome.
- This data syncs instantly with the popup display and updates the badge count on your toolbar.

This architecture supports real-time insights without slowing down your browsing experience.

## Practical User Flow Example

Imagine you open a news article:

1. Your badge instantly updates to show how many third-party domains the page connects to.
2. Clicking the badge opens the popup where you see the domains separated into:
   - Allowed (e.g., ads, analytics services that loaded)
   - Blocked (e.g., trackers your blocker stopped)
   - Stealth-blocked (blocks that are hidden from usual blocker counts)
3. You spot an unexpected domain in the allowed list. With this insight, you decide to check your filter lists or blocking rules.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Watch Your Badge:** Use the numeric badge as a quick sanity check of your privacy exposure.
- **Monitor Popup Regularly:** Check the popup to learn what domains your favorite sites connect to and how effectively your blockers are working.
- **Understand Stealth Blocking:** Note that some connections aren’t plainly blocked but stealth-blocked; these subtle blocks contribute to your privacy without obvious signs.
- **Combine With Other Tools:** Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker’s dashboard to maximize your knowledge and control.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Badge Doesn’t Update:** Ensure your browser supports the extension’s required APIs and that uBO Scope has permission to access network requests.
- **Popup Shows No Data:** This can happen if the active tab hasn’t initiated network connections or if there’s a temporary delay — try refreshing the tab.
- **Inconsistent Counts Across Sites:** Different sites use different third-party services; the counts vary naturally based on site complexity and tracking.
