# Core Concepts & Terminology

Welcome to the foundational guide that defines and explains the essential terms and concepts for understanding and using uBO Scope effectively. This page is designed to help new users quickly get familiar with the language and metrics uBO Scope uses to provide clear and actionable insights on web network connections.

---

## What You Need to Know First

Before diving into uBO Scope’s interface or detailed features, it’s crucial to understand the following core concepts. These terms shape how the tool tracks, classifies, and reports network connections made by your browser when visiting webpages.

---

## Third-Party Remote Servers

### Definition
A *third-party remote server* is a server that hosts resources (like scripts, images, or data) loaded by the webpage you are visiting but does not belong to the primary site’s domain.

### Why This Matters
Webpages often rely on external services for functionality, analytics, advertising, or content delivery. Tracking third-party servers helps you understand your actual network exposure and the reach of external entities interacting with your browser.

### Example
If you visit `example.com` and it loads an image from `cdn.examplecdn.com`, then `examplecdn.com` is a third-party server relative to `example.com`.

---

## Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth-Blocked Requests

uBO Scope classifies network requests into three main outcomes to let you know precisely what happened to each connection:

### Allowed Requests
- **What:** Requests that successfully connected to a third-party remote server.
- **User Value:** These represent actual network connections where data was exchanged.

### Blocked Requests
- **What:** Requests explicitly prevented from connecting by a content blocker or other network filters.
- **User Value:** Shows which connections have been actively stopped from loading.

### Stealth-Blocked Requests
- **What:** Requests that are blocked in a way that is stealthy or transparent, typically to prevent detection by websites without altering behavior noticeably.
- **User Value:** Helps you grasp the subtleties of filtering where the request is silently cancelled or spoofed rather than explicitly denied.

Understanding these distinctions helps assess the effectiveness of ad blockers or privacy tools combined with uBO Scope.

## Badge Count on the Toolbar Icon

### What It Represents
The badge count visible on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon shows the number of **distinct third-party domains from which your browser successfully loaded resources on the current webpage**.

### Why This Metric
- This count is a direct measure of your exposure to third-party servers.
- A **lower count** means fewer third-party connections and typically better privacy.
- It reflects the distinctness of domains, not the total number of requests, providing a meaningful privacy metric over basic block counts.

### Practical Insight
Instead of simply counting blocked requests, this third-party domain count helps users see the real impact of content blockers on their browsing.

---

## Public Suffix List (PSL)

### Role in uBO Scope
uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List to accurately determine the *owner domain* of each hostname. This prevents subdomains from inflating the third-party count unnecessarily.

### What is the PSL?
A public suffix is a domain under which internet users can directly register names, such as `.com`, `.co.uk`, or `.github.io`. The PSL defines these suffixes to identify the registrable domains correctly.

### Why PSL Is Important
For example, `images.examplecdn.com` and `videos.examplecdn.com` resolve to the same public suffix domain `examplecdn.com`. uBO Scope counts this as a single third-party domain despite different hostnames.

---

## Hostname vs Domain

- **Hostname:** The full address of a web resource, e.g., `ads.tracker.example.com`.
- **Domain:** Derived from the hostname using the PSL, e.g., `example.com`.

uBO Scope uses the domain to group third-party connections meaningfully.

---

## webRequest API

### What is it?
The `webRequest` API is a browser feature that allows extensions like uBO Scope to observe and analyze network requests initiated by the browser.

### How uBO Scope Uses webRequest
- Listens to network events such as **redirects**, **successes**, and **errors**.
- Collects data about requests including URL, status, IP, and request type.
- Classifies each request into allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked outcomes.

### Limitations
- uBO Scope cannot monitor network requests made outside the scope of this API.
- If a browser or system uses other methods to block or hide requests beyond the webRequest API’s view, those requests won’t be reported.

---

## Network Request Outcomes

The extension tracks three event types from the webRequest API:

| Event Type | Meaning | User Implication |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| `success`  | Request completed successfully. | Connection established with third-party server. |
| `redirect` | Request was redirected to another URL. | Connection change tracked as stealth-blocked. |
| `error`    | Request failed or blocked. | Blocked or failed connection recorded. |

### Why Differentiate?
This classification helps you understand the real-time behavior of network requests and the presence of stealthy blocking techniques.

---

## Practical Example of Terminology in Use

Imagine browsing a news website:

1. The main page (`news.com`) loads.
2. It requests ad scripts from `ads.adnetwork.com`, analytics from `trackers.analytics.net`, and images from `cdn.imageservice.org`.
3. uBO Scope logs:
   - `news.com` as the primary domain.
   - `adnetwork.com`, `analytics.net`, `imageservice.org` as third-party remote servers.
   - Counts allowed requests for each third-party domain.
   - If an ad blocker blocks `ads.adnetwork.com` scripts, it logs a blocked request.
   - Any silent blocking of requests is logged as stealth-blocked.
4. The toolbar badge updates to the count of distinct allowed third-party domains.

This insight helps you visualize the reach of third parties and the blocking impact.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Interpret Badge Values Carefully:** A low badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, aligning with better privacy.
- **Remember the Role of Stealth Blocking:** Some content blockers block requests silently; these are logged differently to reflect that subtlety.
- **Use PSL for Accurate Domain Grouping:** By understanding domains, not just hostnames, you get a true picture of distinct third-party servers.
- **Check Browser Compatibility:** uBO Scope relies on the webRequest API; verify your browser supports this.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions & Issues">
<Accordion title="Why is the badge count different from my content blocker’s block count?">
The badge shows how many distinct third-party domains successfully connected, not how many requests were blocked. Block counts can be misleading if many requests come from the same domain.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is the difference between allowed and stealth-blocked?">
Allowed requests connected normally, stealth-blocked are blocked silently to avoid detection. Both affect privacy but are reported differently to give nuanced insights.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why might some network requests not appear in uBO Scope?">
uBO Scope only reports requests visible via the webRequest API. Some browser internals or plugins might make requests that the API cannot observe.
</Accordion>
