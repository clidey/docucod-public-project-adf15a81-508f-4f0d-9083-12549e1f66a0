# Key Terms and Concepts

Understanding how uBO Scope presents data and categorizes network requests is vital for accurately interpreting the information it provides. This page clarifies some crucial terms and concepts such as **sanctioned domains**, **blocked connections**, **stealth-blocking**, and how badge counts relate to distinct third-party remote servers. Additionally, it explains the differences between attempted, successful, and stealth-blocked requests to give you a firm grounding in the extension’s reporting.

## Sanctioned Domains

Sanctioned domains refer to third-party domains that have successfully resolved network requests during the current browsing session under your content blocker settings. These are domains your browser attempted to reach when loading a webpage and were permitted to connect. 

- **Why It Matters:** Seeing sanctioned domains helps you identify which external servers are actively communicating with your browser as you browse.

- **User Scenario:** For instance, when visiting news.yoursite.com, uBO Scope might show domains the page loads resources from, like analytics or ad servers, that are allowed by your filtering rules.

## Blocked Connections and Stealth-Blocking

### Blocked Connections
Blocked connections are network requests that your content blocker (or any filtering mechanism) has identified and prevented from completing due to matching blocklists or rules.

- **Characteristics:** These requests are typically visible as denied attempts and may be associated with standard blocking methods.

- **User Impact:** Blocked connections ensure certain third-party servers do not receive requests or data, enhancing your privacy.

### Stealth-Blocking
Stealth-blocking refers to a subtle form of blocking where requests are intercepted and suppressed without exposing obvious error responses or notifications to the target server.

- **Invisible to Blockee:** Unlike outright blocking, stealth-blocked requests do not generate apparent network errors—creating a “stealth” effect.

- **uBO Scope Representation:** These stealth-blocked requests are separately categorized and surfaced distinctly so you can differentiate them from allowed or plainly blocked requests.

- **Example:** When a tracking pixel is stealth-blocked, the requesting server receives no indication the request was denied, preserving a quieter browsing footprint.

## Badge Counts and Domain Tracking

The badge count displayed on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon shows the number of **distinct domains** that have been contacted by the active tab during your browsing session.

- **What Counts as a Domain?** Domains are calculated at the effective second-level domain level, based on the public suffix list (e.g., `example.com`, not sub.example.com).

- **Why Domains, Not Requests?** This approach avoids inflating the count by multiple resource requests from the same domain, providing a cleaner view of unique third-party connections.

- **How Badge Counts Change:** 
  - When a new domain is contacted and allowed, the count increments.
  - Domains associated with stealth-blocking or blocking do not increase the badge count.

- **Practical Tip:** Use the badge count as a quick gauge of the number of different third-party domains involved in the page you’re viewing.

## Attempted, Successful, and Stealth-Blocked Requests

### Attempted Requests

All network requests initiated by your browser are **attempted** requests, regardless of whether they succeed or fail.

- These include main frame loads, sub-resources (scripts, images), and redirects.

### Successful Requests

Successful requests are those that completed with a valid network response (non-error HTTP status, IP resolution, etc.) and were allowed by your content blocker.

- These successfully retrieved resources contribute to the **allowed domains** displayed in uBO Scope.

### Stealth-Blocked Requests

As described above, stealth-blocked requests were stopped quietly — the remote server does not get an error, but the request results are suppressed locally.

- These are tracked separately to highlight connections that did not complete but without explicit failure.

- You can review these domains in the 'stealth-blocked' section inside the popup UI.

## Summary of Outcomes Shown in uBO Scope Popup
- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Third-party domains where requests were successful.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests silently suppressed without exposing error to the server.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly blocked by your content blocker.

Each category lists domains alongside counts reflecting how many times requests were made to them within the session.

---

## Practical Interpretation Example
Imagine you visit a video streaming site. uBO Scope might show:

- **Allowed Domains:** `videohost.com` (video source), `cdn.example.net` (content delivery), `analytics.tracker.com` (tracking)
- **Stealth-Blocked:** `tracker.blockedtracker.com` (tracking pixel stealth-blocked)
- **Blocked:** `ads.adserver.net` (ads explicitly blocked)

The badge count will show the number of unique domains contacted successfully (e.g., `videohost.com`, `cdn.example.net`, `analytics.tracker.com`). Blocked or stealth-blocked domains do not raise this count but are still visible in their respective categories.

---

## Best Practices and Tips
- Use the **allowed domains** to understand what third-party services are active and potentially track you.
- Review **stealth-blocked** domains to gauge where your content blocker quietly intervenes without alerting remote servers.
- Remember badge counts indicate **unique allowed domains only**, so a low badge count with many requests might mean extensive blocking.
- When troubleshooting connection issues, check the **blocked** category to verify if specific domains are prevented.

## Spotlight: Domain Counting Logic (Simplified)

Here’s a practical pseudocode illustrating the core of how domains are counted and categorized:

```javascript
// For each network request made in the current tab
for (const request of networkRequests) {
    const hostname = extractHostname(request.url);
    const domain = getPublicSuffixDomain(hostname);

    if (request.isAllowed && request.completedSuccessfully) {
        allowedDomains.add(domain);
    } else if (request.isStealthBlocked) {
        stealthBlockedDomains.add(domain);
    } else if (request.isBlocked) {
        blockedDomains.add(domain);
    }
}

// Badge count = size of allowedDomains set
const badgeCount = allowedDomains.size;
```

With this logic, you get a clean, intuitive picture of your browsing session’s domain exposure.
