# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the foundational terms and concepts used within uBO Scope is critical to interpreting its network connection insights correctly and gaining meaningful value from the extension’s reports. This page explains essential terminology such as 'third-party remote servers,' 'badge count,' and the different connection outcomes: allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked. Mastery of these terms empowers you to make informed privacy and content filtering decisions.

---

## What Are Third-Party Remote Servers?

In the context of uBO Scope, a **third-party remote server** is any network server that is distinct from the main web page's primary domain that your browser attempts to connect to while loading a webpage.

- These servers provide resources such as images, scripts, fonts, analytics, or advertisements.
- Not every third party is malicious or unnecessary; many are legitimate services like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).

**Example:**

If you visit `example.com` and your browser makes requests to `cdn.example-cdn.com` or `ads.adnetwork.com`, these remote servers are considered third parties because their domain differs from `example.com`.

## Understanding the Toolbar Badge Count

The **toolbar badge count** shown on uBO Scope's browser extension icon represents the **number of distinct third-party domains to which the browser successfully connected** during the current tab session.

- A **lower count indicates fewer third-party connections**, which often correlates with a higher level of privacy and reduced tracking potential.
- The badge does **not** count individual requests but unique third-party domains.

**Important:** The badge is an actionable, **privacy-focused metric** rather than a block count. A higher badge count means your browser contacted more different third-party domains.

---

## Connection Outcomes: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth-Blocked

uBO Scope classifies each third-party connection into one of three clear outcome categories reflecting what happened during the network request:

### 1. Allowed
- These are third-party connections that were **successfully established and not blocked** by any content blocking or filtering policy.
- These connections can represent legitimate content loading or tracking.

### 2. Blocked
- Connections that were **explicitly prevented** from completing by a content blocker or due to a network error.
- This category includes failed requests detected as blocked by the browser’s webRequest API.

### 3. Stealth-Blocked
- Connections where the network request was **intercepted and redirected in a way that is not obvious to the content** on the page.
- Often resulting from techniques that prevent the connected resource from loading without triggering visible errors.
- This reflects a subtle blocking outcome that can avoid breaking websites but still blocks undesired content.

## How uBO Scope Defines Third-Party Domains and Hostnames

- **Hostname:** The full subdomain and domain of a network request origin (e.g., `ads.example.net`).
- **Domain:** The registered effective top-level domain plus registry-controlled domain (e.g., `example.net`).

uBO Scope uses the **Public Suffix List** (a reliable open-source data set) to accurately determine which portion of a hostname counts as the domain.

**Why this matters:**
- Aggregating counts and connections at the domain-level helps you understand the breadth of third-party connections.
- It avoids counting multiple subdomains from the same service as entirely separate entities.

---

## Why Mastering These Terms Matters

- Accurately interpreting the **badge count** and **popup insights** requires understanding what distinct third-party domains are and their connection status.
- Differentiating between **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth-blocked** connections grants a nuanced view of what content loading is actually permitted or prevented, beyond what typical ad blocker stats show.
- Enables effective **privacy assessment, filter list evaluation, and troubleshooting**.

## Practical Examples

### Scenario: Viewing the Popup Panel

When you open the uBO Scope popup for the active tab, you see three sections:

- **Not Blocked**: Lists third-party domains successfully connected.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Lists domains where requests were silently redirected or filtered.
- **Blocked**: Lists domains where network requests failed or were visibly blocked.

This classification helps you quickly grasp which parties your browser contacted and which ones were stopped by your filters.

### Scenario: Toolbar Badge Count Interpretation

Suppose the badge shows a value of **5** when visiting a news website:

- You know that five distinct third-party domains were contacted.
- If you increase filtering and the badge goes down to 2, fewer distinct third parties were contacted — indicating stronger filtering.

---

## Tips and Best Practices

- Use the badge count as a quick reference of **third-party exposure per tab**, not as a block count.
- Check the popup panel for a detailed breakdown of connection statuses.
- Remember that **not all third parties are harmful**—review the domains and assess their legitimacy.
- If you see frequent stealth-blocked third parties, this may indicate advanced filtering at work.
- Use these insights to calibrate your privacy and filtering settings.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Pitfalls & Clarifications">
<Accordion title="Why is the badge count not the same as my ad blocker's block count?">
The badge count on uBO Scope reflects **distinct third-party domains connected**, regardless of blocking, while ad blockers often count **number of blocked requests**. These metrics serve different purposes and are not directly comparable.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are all third-party connections harmful?">
No. Many third parties serve essential resources like fonts or content delivery networks. uBO Scope surfaces all connections for transparency but does not label them as good or bad.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if network requests are made but don't appear in uBO Scope?">
uBO Scope relies on the browser's `webRequest` API. Requests made outside this scope, such as some browser internal APIs or extensions, are not reported.
</Accordion>

## How This Fits Into the Documentation

This page builds foundational understanding necessary for:

- Making sense of connection data shown in the [Understanding the Popup](https://your-doc-site/guides/core-workflows/understanding-the-popup) guide.
- Interpreting badge counts as explained in the [Toolbar Badge Guide](https://your-doc-site/guides/core-workflows/toolbar-badge-guide).
- Advanced concepts in [System Architecture](https://your-doc-site/overview/product-architecture/architecture-overview).

Master these terms to unlock the full potential of uBO Scope in your privacy and content control workflows.
