## Understand Your Audience

uBO Scope shines a light on all remote server connections initiated by the pages you visit. By revealing these behind-the-scenes connections, it empowers users to see what is really happening on the web—beyond what is blocked or hidden by traditional content blockers.

### Primary Audiences:

- **Privacy-Focused Individuals:**
  People who care deeply about protecting their online privacy and want to detect trackers, third-party requests, and potential data leaks.

- **Tech-Savvy Users:**
  Those who understand the importance of network transparency and want to audit, investigate, or learn more about web requests and their origins.

- **Filter List Maintainers:**
  Contributors who create or maintain content blocking lists benefit from accurate visibility into network connections, allowing for improved blocking rules.

### Secondary Audience:

- **Casual Users Concerned with Third-Party Activity:**
  Even if you're not a technical expert, if you want to know which servers your browser is talking to when visiting a site, uBO Scope helps you gain that insight with minimal setup.

## Why This Matters

### For Privacy Fans
You might already use ad blockers or privacy extensions, but they only show what they block or claim to block. uBO Scope goes further by reporting every network connection attempted — whether blocked, allowed, or stealthily redirected — providing a true picture of real-world web tracking and data exchange.

### For Developers and Researchers
When auditing network behavior or debugging third-party integrations, seeing each request's domain and frequency helps pinpoint issues and confirm data flows. uBO Scope offers a trustworthy, independent source of connection data, free from the limitations of filter lists.

### For Filter List Maintainers
Rule accuracy depends on knowing what's actually connecting and when. uBO Scope provides detailed, unbiased insights into both blocked and allowed domains, assisting maintainers in refining and validating filtering criteria based on comprehensive network activity.
