uBO Scope is crafted to serve a diverse range of users who share a common need: clear, trustworthy visibility into network connections made by webpages, regardless of content blocker configurations.

## Privacy Advocates

Privacy advocates require absolute transparency about what happens behind the scenes whenever they visit a website. They want to know which remote servers their browser connects to, whether those connections are permitted or blocked, and if any stealth blocking is obscuring visibility.

- **What They Achieve:**
  - See all remote server connections actively or stealthily blocked.
  - Understand exactly how third parties interact with the browser during page loads.
  - Gain confidence that no hidden requests are slipping through unnoticed.

> *Scenario:* Imagine a privacy advocate browsing a news site that includes multiple third-party trackers. With uBO Scope, they immediately see a breakdown of all domains contacted and how each request was handled—even if the tracker tried to evade detection. This ensures the advocate’s privacy tools are effective and trustworthy.


## Everyday Browser Users Seeking Clarity

For casual users, the complex inner workings of web connections are a mystery. uBO Scope empowers these users by making remote connections visible in an intuitive popup panel, helping them understand how many and which third-party domains are active on any given page.

- **User Benefits:**
  - Quick insight into the total number of distinct third-party remote servers.
  - Easy identification of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.
  - Assurance about their content blocker’s effectiveness without diving into complicated technical details.

> *Scenario:* A user wondering if their adblocker is working can open the uBO Scope popup and see the actual third-party domains contacted. Seeing a low number of distinct allowed domains confirms their protection, offering peace of mind through clear facts instead of guesswork.


## Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining filter lists for content blockers demands precise, dependable data on how lists perform in real-world browsing scenarios. uBO Scope acts as an invaluable tool to measure the impact of filters and find gaps or false positives.

- **Advantages for Maintainers:**
  - Accurate and unfiltered data about network request outcomes regardless of the content blocker’s stealth techniques.
  - Visibility into stealth-blocked connections that could otherwise mislead measurements.
  - Ability to verify the exact domains and number of times requests are blocked or allowed.

> *Scenario:* A filter list maintainer debugging an issue where some ads appear despite filters applied can use uBO Scope to see if the culprit domains are truly blocked or silently allowed. This aids in refining filter rules for better accuracy and performance.


## Why These Users Should Care

Understanding the nuances of network requests is essential to trust content blockers and maintain internet hygiene — and uBO Scope provides unmatched clarity:

- **Transparency:** Never second-guess what content blockers are blocking or letting through.
- **Accuracy:** Reliable measurement that respects stealth blocking mechanisms.
- **Empowerment:** Enables informed decisions by everyday users and filter list experts alike.
