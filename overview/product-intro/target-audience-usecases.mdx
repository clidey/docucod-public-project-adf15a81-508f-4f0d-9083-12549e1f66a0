# Who is it For? Common Use Cases

uBO Scope is a specialized tool designed to provide transparency into the network connections your browser initiates while visiting websites. This page explores who benefits most from using uBO Scope and highlights typical real-world scenarios where this extension becomes indispensable.

## Empowering Privacy-Conscious Users

If you care deeply about your online privacy, uBO Scope gives you direct insight into every remote server your browser talks to when loading a webpage. Instead of relying solely on block counts or indirect indicators, uBO Scope **shows you the distinct third-party domains that your browser connects to** — the core metric that truly matters for privacy.

- **See exactly which remote servers receive your data.**
- **Identify unexpected or excessive third-party connections.**
- **Make informed decisions about which connections to allow or block.**

Imagine visiting your favorite news website. While the main content may come from a trusted source, uBO Scope reveals a range of other domains contacted behind the scenes—advertisers, trackers, CDNs, or analytics providers. Knowing this empowers you to adjust your filters or browsing habits.

## Supporting Filter List Maintainers

For those who maintain content blocking lists, especially on platforms where built-in browser developer tools or telemetry data is limited or unavailable, uBO Scope is a valuable companion.

- **Gain access to detailed connection data independent of browser diagnostics.**
- **Identify stealthy or elusive third-party connections that bypass simpler tools.**
- **Validate filter effectiveness by comparing allowed vs blocked domains.**

By aggregating domain-level network request outcomes for active tabs, uBO Scope allows maintainers to see the complete landscape of network interactions associated with page loads. This helps filter list creators optimize their rule sets and ensure thorough blocking coverage.

## Debunking Ad-Blocking Myths

Many users and developers encounter misleading claims about ad blocker effectiveness based on superficial block counts or contrived ad blocker test sites. uBO Scope offers an **objective, real-world perspective that clarifies these misconceptions.**

- **Understand that a higher block count does not necessarily mean better blocking.**
- **See the true number of distinct third-party servers allowed by your content blocker.**
- **Avoid being deceived by unrealistic network requests generated by 'ad blocker test' pages.**

Using uBO Scope, you can verify genuine connection activity rather than relying on misleading tests. This strengthens both individual understanding and community discussions around ad blocking.

## Real-World Use Case Examples

### 1. Privacy Audit During Web Browsing

You visit a popular shopping site and want to check how many and which third-party services are contacted. Open uBO Scope’s popup, and instantly see lists of domains:

- **Allowed:** Domains your browser contacted successfully.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains whose requests were redirected silently.
- **Blocked:** Domains whose requests were prevented.

By reviewing these lists, you can identify trackers or ad networks and decide whether additional blocking rules are needed.

### 2. Filter List Rule Verification

As a filter list maintainer, you deploy your list on a test machine that has limited developer tool access (e.g., mobile or locked-down environment). You use uBO Scope to monitor:

- What domains are still allowed after your filters apply.
- Unexpected domains slipping through the filter.
- Domains stealth-blocked by mechanisms like redirects.

This direct measurement boosts confidence that your list accurately balances blocking with usability.

### 3. Educational Insight for Browser Users

Many users believe that block counts reported by various content blockers define which is better. Using uBO Scope, you collect real data about distinct connection domains rather than misleading block counts or artificial tests. Sharing these insights helps:

- Dispel myths about ad blockers.
- Promote privacy awareness based on factual data.
- Encourage better content blocking strategies focused on meaningful metrics.

---

## Why Use uBO Scope?

- **Clarity:** It reveals the true count and identity of third-party domains contacted, beyond simple block totals.
- **Transparency:** Users and maintainers see exactly what happens at the network level during page loads.
- **Independence:** Operates irrespective of specific content blockers, relying on the browser's webRequest API.

**Lower counts mean fewer third-party connections, which is generally better for privacy and security.**
