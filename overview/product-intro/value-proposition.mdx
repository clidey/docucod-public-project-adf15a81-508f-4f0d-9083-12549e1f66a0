# Why Use uBO Scope?

Discover unparalleled transparency into your browser's network activity with uBO Scope. This section explains how uBO Scope empowers you to see the full picture of remote connections a webpage attempts, regardless of content blockers' claims, enabling you to take control of your privacy and filter list management.

## Experience True Network Visibility

Every webpage you visit initiates multiple network connections—some essential, some unwanted, and others stealthy. Unlike traditional content blockers that only show what they block or allow, uBO Scope reveals **all** attempted remote server connections. This transparency sheds light on the reality of web traffic:

- **See the entire network landscape:** including allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections.
- **Debunk misleading claims:** Understand what your content blockers truly permit and what slips through unnoticed.
- **Visualize the unknown:** Identify unexpected or stealthy connections that evade standard blockers.

Imagine browsing a news site with a content blocker enabled. uBO Scope exposes that while some trackers are blocked, many others establish connections invisibly, often misrepresented by filter lists.

## Why This Matters to You

### Protect Your Privacy with Confidence

Privacy-conscious users demand clarity on their exposure. uBO Scope provides an unfiltered view, revealing:

- **Which domains your browser contacts:** across all network events.
- **Which connections are stealthily redirected or silently blocked:** helping you spot privacy leaks.
- **The real impact of your filter lists:** ensuring your defenses are as effective as you believe.

### Optimize Your Content Blocking Strategy

Maintainers of filter lists and advanced users benefit greatly by:

- **Identifying loopholes and stealth techniques:** that evade traditional blocking.
- **Fine-tuning filters precisely:** with data-backed insights to maximize privacy and performance.
- **Comparing blocker effectiveness:** validating claims with actual connection data.

### Uncover Stealth-blocked Connections

The extension distinguishes connections that were blocked silently — without typical visible indicators. This insight prevents the false sense of security common when blockers silently intercept requests without alerting the user.

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Perform a privacy audit** of any website by instantly seeing all network connections.
- **Validate claims from content blockers and filter lists** by correlating the allowed and blocked domains.
- **Diagnose unexpected traffic** in your browser, making it easier to react and adjust your settings.
- **Educate yourself or your team** on how web tracking operates beyond traditional block notifications.

## The Outcome: Empowered Control Over Your Browsing

Using uBO Scope transforms your web experience from blind trust into informed control. No more guessing about what’s happening behind the scenes — you receive **actionable, transparent, and accurate data** on your browser’s remote server connections.
