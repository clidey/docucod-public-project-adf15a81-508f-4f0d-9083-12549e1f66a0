# Target Audience & Use Cases

## Understanding Who Benefits from uBO Scope

uBO Scope is designed with distinct user groups in mind—each with unique needs and goals related to understanding and controlling web network activity. Recognizing these audiences helps you appreciate how uBO Scope delivers value and addresses common challenges in privacy and content blocking.

### Primary User Groups

- **Privacy-Conscious Users**: Individuals who want transparent visibility into all remote server connections initiated by websites they visit, ensuring they understand which third parties receive data and how many distinct remote servers are contacted.

- **Filter List Maintainers**: Professionals responsible for creating and refining content blocking lists who need detailed insights about network requests, including stealth-blocked and allowed connections, especially on devices where typical web developer tools are limited or inaccessible.

- **Technical Analysts & Security Auditors**: Experts requiring reliable data on network requests and outcomes to audit web traffic, validate content blockers’ effectiveness, or diagnose issues when browser developer tools don’t provide sufficient detail.

## Common Scenarios Where uBO Scope Excels

### Debunking Content Blocking Myths

Many users and analysts rely on toolbar badge block counts or simplistic "ad blocker test" pages as measures of content blocker effectiveness. uBO Scope challenges these misconceptions by revealing the actual number of distinct third-party servers contacted—which is the meaningful indicator of exposure.

> **Scenario:**
> A user notices one content blocker shows many network block counts but suspects it might still allow more third-party connections. Using uBO Scope, they can see the unique third-party domains truly contacted, clarifying the extension’s real-world blocking impact.

### Understanding Third-Party Trackers

Websites often load resources from multiple third parties—some benign, some trackers or advertisers. Privacy-conscious users can use uBO Scope to gain a clear, tab-specific snapshot of all third-party hosts connected to during browsing.

> **Scenario:**
> A privacy-sensitive user evaluates a news website. With uBO Scope, they identify domains allowed through despite active blocking rules, helping them tailor their blocking preferences or filter lists more effectively.

### Auditing Network Requests When Browser Tools Are Unavailable

Certain devices, locked-down environments, or limited browsers may restrict access to powerful developer tools. uBO Scope fills this gap by leveraging the browser's `webRequest` API to provide network request transparency independently.

> **Scenario:**
> A filter list maintainer debugging network requests on a restricted device uses uBO Scope to collect data without needing developer tools, enhancing their ability to maintain accurate and effective filters.

## Why You Should Care

- **Maintain Full Visibility**: Know exactly which remote servers receive your web traffic, independent of active blockers or DNS-level filtering.

- **Make Informed Privacy Decisions**: Understand the real extent of third-party exposure on each tab, not just aggregate block counts.

- **Enhance Content Blocker Evaluation**: Move beyond deceptive metrics by focusing on unique remote server connections—a more truthful measure of network privacy.

- **Support Filter List Development**: Gain actionable insights to improve filter rules with clear information on which domains are allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.

- **Simplify Auditing in Constrained Environments**: Use a lightweight tool when conventional browser developer tools are unavailable or insufficient.

## Real User Flow Examples

### Privacy-Conscious User Flow

1. Install uBO Scope from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).
2. Browse a website.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup, which summarizes distinct third-party domains contacted in the current tab.
4. Review lists showing **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** domains.
5. Use this data to adjust blocking extensions or privacy settings.

### Filter List Maintainer Flow

1. Deploy uBO Scope extension in testing browsers or devices.
2. Visit sites under filter list review or development.
3. Access the popup data to confirm what domains are missed or incorrectly allowed.
4. Correlate results with existing filter lists.
5. Use findings to refine lists, particularly when developer tools are inaccessible.

### Technical Analyst Workflow

1. Use uBO Scope to collect tab-specific network data during audit or analysis.
2. Identify suspect third-party connections that might be hidden or bypass usual tools.
3. Document stealth-blocked domains (those connections redirected or suppressed without outright block indication).
4. Provide a clear report based on unique third-party domains and network outcomes rather than just blocked request counts.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Regularly check uBO Scope's badge count to get a high-level indicator of third-party exposure per tab.
- Use the categorized domain lists to distinguish between fully blocked, stealth-blocked (redirected or filtered in a subtle way), and allowed connections for nuanced understanding.
- For filter list maintainers, pairing uBO Scope data with filter testing tools accelerates debugging and list improvement.
- Remember that third-party connections aren’t inherently malicious; some (like major CDNs) are necessary for websites to function smoothly.
- Use uBO Scope in combination with content blockers for comprehensive network visibility.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- If the badge count does not update, ensure the extension’s permissions include access to all HTTP and WebSocket URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`, `ws://*/*`, and `wss://*/*`).
- Keep in mind that requests occurring outside the browser's `webRequest` API visibility (e.g., certain WebSocket or fetch requests bypassing extension APIs) may not be reported.
- On browsers or platforms without full support for `webRequest` API, uBO Scope’s reporting may be incomplete.
