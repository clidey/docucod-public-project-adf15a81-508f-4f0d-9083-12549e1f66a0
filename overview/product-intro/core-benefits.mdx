# Core Benefits and Value of uBO Scope

Unlock true transparency into your web browsing network activity with uBO Scope. This lightweight browser extension delivers unparalleled insight into every connection — blocked or allowed — that webpages attempt to make to remote servers. It empowers you to see through the noise of content blocker statistics and understand exactly what is happening behind the scenes.

## Why uBO Scope Matters

Web users, privacy enthusiasts, and web professionals face a common challenge: knowing which third-party servers their browser actually communicates with during web navigation, especially in the face of content blockers and network-level filtering. uBO Scope answers this challenge by providing **clear, accurate reporting of remote server connections regardless of blockers in place**, enabling you to make informed decisions about your online exposure.

Unlike typical content blockers that only show counts of blocked requests, uBO Scope reveals the full landscape:

- Connections allowed
- Connections stealth-blocked
- Connections outright blocked

This holistic view transforms the way you understand network behavior and blocker effectiveness.

## Transparent Badge Reporting

The toolbar badge count on uBO Scope represents the **number of distinct third-party remote domains with which your browser successfully connected for the active tab**. A lower badge number indicates fewer third-party connections reached, which is generally preferable for privacy and security.

This design choice avoids the misleading practice of using block counts as a quality measure for content blockers. Instead, uBO Scope directs your attention to the true network outcomes — what was allowed through rather than just what was blocked.

## Busting Common Myths

### Myth 1: _'Higher block count means a better content blocker.'_  
uBO Scope clarifies this misconception by showing that a high block count can coincide with more third-party servers being contacted. In other words, a content blocker might block many requests but still allow stealthy connections to numerous remote servers.

### Myth 2: _'Ad blocker test pages provide reliable effectiveness measurements.'_  
Such test pages are often unrealistic and fail to represent real-world browsing patterns. uBO Scope helps validate blocker behavior against genuine network requests seen in natural browsing, sidestepping artificial or fabricated test scenarios.

## Real-World Scenarios Where uBO Scope Excels

- **Privacy Auditing:** Identify all third-party domains your browser contacts on any webpage, regardless of which content blocker you use.
- **Blocker Effectiveness Diagnosis:** Determine if a high block count on your blocker correlates with fewer or more third-party connections.
- **Filter List Maintenance:** Use uBO Scope's insights to refine or debug filter rules based on observed network connections.
- **Myth Debunking:** Validate claims about content blockers and testing tools by seeing actual network outcomes.

## How uBO Scope Delivers These Benefits

### Holistic Network Request Tracking

uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network requests at all stages:

- Before redirection
- On error
- On successful response

By capturing these events and categorizing them into allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked, it builds a comprehensive picture of network activity.

### Accurate Domain Classification

uBO Scope uses a robust public suffix list and domain parsing logic to accurately identify distinct third-party domains, grouping hostnames appropriately. This enables precise badge counts and informative UI breakdowns in the popup panel.

### User-Friendly Popup UI

The popup displays:

- Total unique connected domains
- Domains grouped by outcome:
  - Allowed
  - Stealth-blocked
  - Blocked

This intuitive presentation makes it easy to scan and understand the connection landscape for the current tab.
