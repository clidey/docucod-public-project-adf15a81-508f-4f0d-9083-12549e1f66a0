# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

uBO Scope offers invaluable insight into your browser’s network activity and remote server connections, serving multiple distinct audiences with unique needs. Whether you’re a privacy-conscious user, a filter list maintainer, or simply curious about what happens behind the scenes every time you load a web page, uBO Scope equips you with clear, actionable visibility.

## Target Audiences

### Privacy-Minded Users

If protecting your privacy online is paramount, uBO Scope empowers you by revealing all third-party connections your browser attempts or succeeds in making, regardless of your content blocker or DNS settings. Unlike many tools that only show blocked or allowed requests, uBO Scope provides a transparent view into these connections, helping you:

- Understand exactly which external domains your browser talks to when visiting websites.
- Assess whether your existing content blockers effectively limit third-party resource loading.
- Gauge exposure to potential trackers or unwanted network calls hidden behind stealth-blocking techniques.

### Ad and Content Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining reliable and effective filter lists demands real-world data and observability. uBO Scope is tailored for professionals and enthusiasts in this domain by:

- Providing an accurate count of distinct third-party remote servers contacted.
- Revealing stealth-blocked requests that can evade detection by standard filter lists.
- Enabling easier validation of filter rules effectiveness in live browsing sessions.
- Offering a session-persistent view of network outcomes to identify unexpected or missed blocking.

### Curious Users and Web Developers

Anyone interested in demystifying what happens during webpage loading benefits from uBO Scope’s straightforward insights. Whether you want to debug network connections, verify browser extensions’ behavior, or understand the dynamics of content blocking, uBO Scope:

- Reports on network request outcomes independently of specific blocking techniques.
- Enables comparison of blocking approaches by exposing allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.
- Serves as a tool to debunk misconceptions about content blocker behavior and webpage reporting.

## Practical Use Scenarios

### Verify Content Blocker Effectiveness

By showing precisely which third-party domains yielded allowed connections, blocked requests, or stealth-blocked attempts, uBO Scope allows you to validate your content blocking strategy. You can quickly discover if your filter is inadvertently allowing unintended connections or if stealth blocking is in effect but not reported by webpages. The toolbar badge indicates the number of unique allowed third-party servers, offering an at-a-glance measure of exposure.

### Debunk Network Transparency Myths

Many users and testers rely on web-based "ad blocker test" sites or badge counts from blockers alone to judge effectiveness. uBO Scope reveals that these can be misleading by directly monitoring network requests using the browser's `webRequest` API. It surfaces common misunderstandings such as:

- Higher block counts don’t necessarily mean better blocking.
- Webpages cannot always detect stealth blocking or all blocker effects.
- Fabricated test pages don’t reflect real-world blocking outcomes.

### Audit Site Privacy

Before submitting privacy complaints or choosing filter lists, auditing actual network connections is vital. uBO Scope shows connections per tab/session, categorized by blocking outcome, enabling privacy audits based on accurate network data rather than assumptions or incomplete web reports.

## What You Will Achieve with uBO Scope

- **Complete Visibility:** See all network server connections your browser attempts, gaining a comprehensive understanding
- **Informed Decisions:** Choose or adjust content blockers and filter lists based on concrete data
- **Better Troubleshooting:** Identify stealth blocking and other subtle network behaviors with easy-to-read reports
- **Educational Insight:** Learn valuable details about your browser's network activity and content blocking performance

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- Use uBO Scope alongside your existing content blocker for deeper network insights.
- Regularly check the toolbar badge count to monitor changes in third-party exposure.
- Leverage uBO Scope when testing filter list updates or new blocking rules.
- Combine uBO Scope with other diagnostic tools for comprehensive analysis but rely on it for network-level truth.

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not rely solely on ad blocker test sites or blocker badge counts to assess blocking reliability.
- Remember that network requests outside the `webRequest` API scope (e.g., some DNS blocks) will not appear in reports.
- Avoid interpreting a higher number of blocked requests as better privacy protection without considering allowed connections count.
