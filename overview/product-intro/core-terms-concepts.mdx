# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the foundational terms behind uBO Scope is essential to fully leverage its insights. This page introduces the key vocabulary related to network connections, how these terms are represented in the extension’s interface, and the significance behind each concept. With clarity on these terms, you will be empowered to interpret the data uBO Scope reveals with confidence and precision.

## What You Will Learn

- The distinction between **third-party servers** and first-party connections
- What uBO Scope means by network request **outcomes** like allowed, blocked, and stealth
- How the **webRequest API** integrates and tracks network activity
- The role and meaning of the **badge count**
- Differentiation between **allowed vs. blocked connections** and what they reveal
- How these concepts visually manifest in the extension popup

## Third-Party Servers: What Are They and Why Do They Matter?

In the context of uBO Scope, a **third-party server** is any remote server your browser attempts to connect to that is different from the website you are currently visiting (the first-party). This distinction is crucial because resources from third parties often represent tracking, advertising, or external content inclusion.

### Why Focus on Third Parties?

Your browsing experience typically involves more than the website you directly request. Many websites load fonts, scripts, ads, analytics, and other resources from external domains. Identifying and quantifying these third-party connections helps you:

- Understand the full scope of external network activity
- Identify potential privacy risks from trackers or data collectors
- Evaluate the effectiveness of content blockers

uBO Scope explicitly counts **distinct third-party remote servers** for each site visited, making third-party awareness its central focus.

## Network Request Outcomes: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth

Each network request your browser makes to a remote server concludes with an **outcome** that uBO Scope categorizes into three groups:

- **Allowed (not blocked)**: Requests that successfully completed, meaning the connection was permitted by the browser and any content blockers.
- **Blocked**: Requests that the browser or content blockers actively prevented from completing.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Requests handled in a way that obscures their blocking, often by redirect or silent fail methods to avoid webpage breakage or detection.

### Understanding These Outcomes

- **Allowed connections** represent the external servers actively contacted and serving resources, which affect privacy and page behavior.
- **Blocked connections** denote resources intentionally restricted, signaling the content blocker’s effectiveness but not necessarily the number of unique third parties prevented.
- **Stealth blocking** highlights advanced blocking techniques where the request may seem allowed to some parts of the browser or page, but actually prevented from delivering unwanted content.

This nuanced categorization helps you differentiate between visible blocks and subtle blocking methods.

## The webRequest API: How uBO Scope Sees Network Traffic

uBO Scope leverages the browser's **webRequest API**, a built-in interface that captures network request details initiated by webpages. This API reports every request's initiation, redirection, success, or failure, providing a comprehensive picture regardless of which content blocker is active.

### Key Points for Users:

- uBO Scope reports connections independently of content blockers, including those acting at DNS or system level.
- Only network requests visible to the webRequest API can be tracked; some browser internals or extensions may bypass this.
- This API provides essential metadata like URLs, request types, response status, and redirects, which uBO Scope uses to categorize outcomes.

Understanding the API’s role reassures that uBO Scope provides accurate real-time connection data.

## Badge Count: What the Number on Your Toolbar Means

The uBO Scope toolbar icon displays a **badge count**, reflecting the number of distinct third-party domains your browser connected to for the active tab.

### What This Number Represents:

- The **unique count of third-party domains allowed (i.e., requested and not blocked)** during the page load or interaction.
- A **lower badge count is better**, indicating fewer external servers contacted and potentially less tracking exposure.

### Why Not Just Count Requests or Blocks?

A simple block count is misleading; an extension might block many requests but still allow connections to numerous unique third parties. Conversely, a lower block count can mean fewer distinct third parties were contacted, which is more privacy-friendly.

The badge focuses on **distinct third-party domains** rather than raw request counts for meaningful insight.

---

## Allowed vs. Blocked Connections: Visualizing the Differences

Within the popup interface, uBO Scope distinctly presents third-party domains according to their connection outcome:

- **Allowed section:** Lists domains your browser successfully contacted without interruption.
- **Blocked section:** Shows domains where connections were actively prevented.
- **Stealth-blocked section:** Contains domains where blocking happened quietly or via redirection.

Each domain is accompanied by a count badge indicating how many network requests were made to that domain, providing insight into intensity or frequency.

This visual segmentation helps you quickly grasp which external parties are active, blocked, or stealthily suppressed.

---

## How These Concepts Appear in uBO Scope UI

When you open the uBO Scope popup on a tab, you see:

- The **tab’s hostname and domain** prominently displayed.
- A **summary** of how many distinct domains were connected.
- Three outcome sections with headers: **not blocked**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.
- Each section lists third-party domains with their respective request counts (badges).

This structured layout transforms complex network data into understandable, actionable information about your browsing activity.

---

## Practical Scenario: Using Terminology for Analysis

Imagine you visit an unfamiliar news website.

- The badge count shows 25 third-party domains connected.
- Opening the popup, you see 18 domains in the allowed section, 3 in stealth-blocked, and 4 blocked.

From this, you learn:

- The site loads resources from many external domains, some likely trackers.
- Some content blockers silently blocked 3 domains without obvious effects.
- 4 domains were explicitly blocked, reducing exposure.

Understanding this terminology guides you to assess privacy risks and consider additional blocking strategies if desired.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- Regularly check the badge count for sites to monitor external connections.
- Dive into the popup to distinguish where blocking happens stealthily or clearly.
- Use the terminology to communicate precisely about connections when reporting issues or seeking support.
- Remember that some third-party connections (like CDN providers) are common and necessary; focus on questionable or unknown domains.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Terminology Questions">
<Accordion title="Why doesn't the badge count match the number of requests I see elsewhere?">
The badge counts unique third-party domains, not total HTTP requests. Many requests might be made to the same domain, which counts once for the badge.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is 'stealth-blocked' and why is it separate?">
Stealth blocking uses methods like redirects or silent drop to avoid breaking websites or being detected by the page. It’s visually separated to highlight these subtler block types.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope show all network requests, including those from non-web content?">
No, uBO Scope relies on the browser's webRequest API, so only requests made by web content visible to that API are tracked.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
