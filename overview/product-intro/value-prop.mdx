# Why uBO Scope Matters: Key Value and Use Cases

## Unveiling True Network Transparency

In today’s complex web ecosystem, countless background connections occur silently—often without your knowledge or consent. uBO Scope addresses this blind spot by revealing all remote server connections that any webpage attempts or successfully makes. It provides an unvarnished view of your browser’s network interactions, empowering you with actionable insight.

This transparency is invaluable: it arms privacy-conscious users, developers, and filter list maintainers with data they can trust and act upon. Unlike traditional content blockers or ad blockers that report what they block, uBO Scope shows you what actually transpired on the network, independent of any installed content blockers or DNS filtering.

## Debunking Common Myths About Content Blocking

### Myth #1: “More blocking means better content blocking”

Many users see a high block count on their toolbar icon and assume their blocker is superior. However, uBO Scope reveals this assumption is misleading. The badge count reflects **the number of distinct third-party remote servers from which content was successfully fetched** — a lower count indicates fewer third-party connections, which is more desirable for privacy.

**Why it matters:** A content blocker that blocks more requests may still allow connections to **more unique third-party servers**, thereby exposing the user to greater data leakage and tracking. uBO Scope’s independent reporting enables you to see beyond block counts and evaluate blockers by their true impact on third-party connections.


### Myth #2: “Ad blocker test pages provide reliable evaluations”

Specialized “ad blocker test” websites often attempt to benchmark blockers by deploying synthetic requests. However, these sites:

- Use fabricated, unrealistic network requests that websites rarely perform in real life
- Cannot detect stealthy blocking techniques content blockers use to avoid webpage breakage

uBO Scope sidesteps these weaknesses by monitoring **real-world network requests made by your browser**, giving you grounded, accurate insights.

## Who Benefits Most from Using uBO Scope?

### 1. Privacy Enthusiasts and Security-Conscious Users

Want to monitor and minimize your exposure to third-party trackers? Use uBO Scope to observe every server connection initiated by webpages you visit. Armed with this knowledge, you can make informed decisions about your content blocking strategy.

### 2. Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining accuracy in filter lists requires precise data about network activity—beyond what regular browser developer tools can deliver, especially on locked-down environments.

uBO Scope offers:

- Persistent tracking across tabs and sessions
- Aggregated counts of unique third-party connections
- Visibility even when blockers stealthily modify or suppress requests

This helps maintainers tune filters effectively and verify their impact in real browsing scenarios.

### 3. Developers and Analysts

Developers who want to understand how their site or app communicates with remote services can utilize uBO Scope to audit network requests in real time, independent of interference by other extensions or DNS filters.

| Scenario                                                          | Without uBO Scope                                      | With uBO Scope                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Evaluating Content Blockers**                                  | Rely on block counts from blocker UI only             | See exact counts of unique third-party servers connected, clarifying true network exposure|
| **Debugging Hidden or Stealthy Network Requests**                | Miss stealthy connections bypassing some blockers     | Detect all network requests and their outcomes on the browser’s network layer|
| **Filter List Effectiveness Validation**                         | Difficult to verify what was truly blocked             | Track distinct domains successfully connected vs. blocked|
| **Privacy Auditing on Locked Devices or Non-Developer Browsers** | Limited or no access to developer tools                  | Use extension popup to see first-party and third-party network activity in real time|

<Tip>
Regularly comparing network connection counts before and after applying different blocking filters with uBO Scope gives you meaningful insight into their effectiveness.
</Tip>

<Warning>
uBO Scope’s data depends on the browser's `webRequest` API. Some network requests outside of this API’s scope (e.g., those by native apps or browser features outside the extension API) will not be reported.
</Warning>
