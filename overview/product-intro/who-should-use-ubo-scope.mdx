# Who Should Use uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a powerful yet straightforward tool crafted for users who demand clear, accurate insight into the remote connections their browsers make. Understanding who benefits most from this extension unlocks its full potential and guides users toward making smarter privacy and content blocking decisions.

## Audience Overview

### Privacy-Conscious Web Users
For individuals determined to maintain their online privacy, uBO Scope offers an unparalleled glimpse into what actually happens behind the scenes when browsing the web. It identifies every third-party remote server your browser attempts to connect with — regardless of your content blocker's filters or DNS-level restrictions. This transparency empowers users to verify that their blockers do not silently allow connections, reinforcing confidence in their privacy tools.

### Filter List Maintainers and Content Blocker Developers
Maintaining effective filter lists is a complex task that requires real-world data on which third-party domains are contacted by browsers. uBO Scope serves as an essential companion for filter maintainers by providing reliable, unfiltered counts and categorizations of remote connections visible within the browser environment. This is especially valuable on devices or platforms where traditional development tools or network inspection aren’t accessible.

### Anyone Evaluating Content Blockers
Many users struggle to assess whether their content blockers are truly effective. uBO Scope debunks common myths about block counts and test page results by focusing on fundamental metrics: the number of distinct third-party domains **actually connected to**. This provides a practical, dependable metric for objectively comparing blockers’ real-world performance, beyond misleading or synthetic test results.

## Typical Use Cases

### Confirming Blocker Effectiveness
When you install or switch content blockers, you want to verify they are doing their job effectively — not just reporting high block counts but genuinely minimizing connections to unwanted third parties. Using uBO Scope’s badge count and detailed popup interface, you can directly observe the number and identity of connected domains in real time to confirm blockers are not allowing excessive remote connections.

### Inspecting Website Connection Behavior
Developers, privacy advocates, or curious users can explore the fingerprint of any website’s third-party connection footprint. uBO Scope reveals which domains the browser connects to, sorted by whether they were allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked. This insight helps identify unwanted trackers or poorly behaving scripts that might otherwise be hidden.

### Working on Restricted or Constrained Platforms
On some browsers or systems, tooling like developer consoles or network monitoring tools may be limited or unavailable. uBO Scope’s lightweight, browser-extension approach provides a simple alternative to evaluate network connections directly within the browser, aiding troubleshooting and analysis where other tools fail.

## Benefits for Users

- **Transparency:** See every distinct third-party server your browser attempts to contact, regardless of blocking method.
- **Accuracy:** Trust reported counts because they reflect actual network connections observed via browser APIs.
- **Independence:** Operates alongside any content blocker, unaffected by filter-specific behaviors or DNS filtering.
- **Simplicity:** Easy-to-understand badge and detailed popup interface present connection data clearly.
- **Support for Maintainers:** Helps filter list developers tune and validate their lists using real browsing data.

## How to Leverage uBO Scope Effectively

1. **Install the Extension:** Available for Chromium, Firefox, and Safari browsers. [See Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/installing-extension)
2. **Browse Normally:** Use the web while uBO Scope monitors your active tab’s network connections.
3. **Check the Badge:** The extension icon badge shows the count of distinct connected remote servers (a lower count signals fewer third-party connections).
4. **Open the Popup:** Click the toolbar icon to view detailed domains categorized as allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
5. **Interpret Results:** Use data to verify your content blocker’s effectiveness, investigate unusual connections, or aid filter development.

## Common Scenarios Where uBO Scope Shines

| Scenario                                 | Description                                                                     |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Curious about privacy exposure           | Understand exactly which third parties websites connect to beyond just ads.     |
| Evaluating competing content blockers    | Compare blockers on actual third-party connection reduction, not just block counts. |
| Debugging content blocker behavior       | Identify if network requests are truly blocked or only hidden by filters.        |
| Filter list tuning and validation        | Gain granular real-world insights for improving filter lists.                     |
| Browsing on platforms without dev tools | Use uBO Scope to gain connection details when other network inspection tools aren't available. |

## Important Considerations

- Not all third-party connections are harmful or unwanted; some relate to legitimate content delivery and site functionality.
- The badge count reflects distinct remote servers connected **successfully or attempted**, providing a realistic view of exposure.
- uBO Scope depends on browser support for the `webRequest` API to reliably report network events.
