# What is uBO Scope?

## Empower Your Privacy: See Every Remote Connection Your Browser Makes

uBO Scope is a powerful yet lightweight browser extension designed to **reveal every attempted or successful connection your browser makes to remote servers**. Unlike typical ad blockers that only show you blocked or allowed content, uBO Scope goes deeper — it **provides transparent visibility into network activity** that often remains hidden. This makes it an invaluable tool for anyone serious about privacy, security, or filter list maintenance.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Uncover all network connections** including those allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked beyond standard content blocking.
- **Reveal distinct third-party servers contacted by your browser**, helping you understand exactly what's happening behind the scenes.
- **Validate the effectiveness of content blockers** without relying on misleading metrics like block count badges or unreliable ad-blocker test sites.
- **Support filter list maintainers** with transparent insights into browser network activity, even on restricted devices.

### Who Benefits from uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users looking to monitor third-party connections made by browsers.
- Developers and filter list maintainers needing precise data on network requests beyond block counts.
- Security experts wanting detailed insight into remote server communications.

## What is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a **browser extension** that listens to your browser's network activity and reports all connections attempted or established with remote servers. It leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to track requests — regardless of what your content blocker is doing — and categorizes them based on their outcome:

- **Allowed:** Connections that succeeded.
- **Blocked:** Connections that failed or were actively blocked.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were silently redirected or altered.

This granular insight empowers you to *see through the veil* of typical network monitoring tools.

### The Core Problem uBO Scope Solves

Traditional ad blockers and network monitors often:

- Display only the number of blocked requests — a misleading metric.
- Fail to distinguish between multiple third-party servers behind connections.
- Are blind to network requests blocked outside of the extension (DNS-based blocking).

uBO Scope cuts through these limitations by reporting **all connection attempts aggregated by distinct third-party servers**, giving you a truthful picture of your browser's communication.

### What Sets uBO Scope Apart?

- **Universal visibility:** It reveals requests no matter which content blocker is active, as long as the browser supports the `webRequest` API.
- **Third-party focus:** The toolbar badge shows the count of distinct third-party servers contacted, not just a block count.
- **Myth-busting:** It debunks misconceptions like "higher block count means better blocking" and unreliable "ad blocker test" pages.
- **Simplicity and transparency:** A straightforward tool without unnecessary complexity or frequent updates, focused on reliability and clarity.

## How uBO Scope Works — A High-Level Overview

1. **Monitoring:** uBO Scope hooks into the browser's `webRequest` listeners to observe every HTTP(S) and WebSocket request your browser attempts.
2. **Categorization:** Each network request is categorized as either allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked based on its outcome.
3. **Aggregation:** Requests are grouped by hostname and public domain using an internal public suffix list to normalize domains.
4. **Display:** The extension's toolbar icon displays the count of distinct third-party domains contacted for quick reference.
5. **User Interface:** Clicking the icon shows a panel listing connected domains with counts of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked requests for the active tab.

This workflow runs silently in the background, constantly updating to keep you informed.

## Real-World Example: Understanding Your Browser's Connections

Imagine you visit a news website that loads content from multiple CDNs, ad services, analytics platforms, and social media widgets. While traditional blockers tell you how many connections were blocked, uBO Scope reveals **how many unique third-party domains the page actually contacted** across different categories.

This helps you validate whether your content blocker truly limits your browser’s exposure to external servers or whether it might be allowing requests from many distinct third parties despite a high block count.

## Practical Tips for Getting the Most From uBO Scope

- **Interpret the badge count as privacy quality:** A *lower* number indicates fewer third-party servers accessed — generally better for privacy.
- **Use alongside your favorite content blocker:** uBO Scope complements blockers by showing what passes through them.
- **Avoid relying on ad-block test sites:** uBO Scope discourages the use of manipulated test pages; real network data is more reliable.
- **Leverage for filter list maintenance:** If you maintain or audit filters, use uBO Scope to observe real network outcomes.

## Summary

uBO Scope gives you **complete, no-nonsense insight** into your browser’s network behavior. By focusing on distinct third-party remote servers and transparently reporting each connection’s outcome, it strengthens your privacy toolkit and challenges common misconceptions about content blocking effectiveness.
