## Understanding the Audience

uBO Scope serves a focused and discerning audience who seeks more than just traditional content blocking. If you:

- **Want to know exactly which remote servers your browser attempts or succeeds in contacting for each webpage**;
- **Are concerned about third-party connections that might track, profile, or otherwise compromise your privacy**;
- **Maintain filter lists and require precise tools to validate and improve your filters' effectiveness**;
- **Desire to bust myths surrounding badge counts or block statistics in content blockers**;
- **Need to monitor or test network behavior on constrained or specialized devices where developer tools might be limited**;

then uBO Scope is purpose-built for you.

## Primary User Profiles and Their Goals

### 1. Privacy Advocates and Informed Users

You value your online privacy and want to be certain about what connections your browser initiates or allows. Typical content blockers show cached or inferred data, but uBO Scope shows all _real-time_ network requests—including those that sneak past other blockers or evade typical reporting.

**Benefits:**
- Real-time visibility of every distinct third-party server contacted
- Clear differentiation between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections
- Accurate badge counts that reflect distinct third-party connections, not just blocked requests

### 2. Filter List Maintainers and Researchers

You craft or audit filter lists to enhance content blockers. uBO Scope provides detailed, unbiased data about network requests the browser sees under all conditions—irrespective of what other blockers claim or report.

**Benefits:**
- Tool to verify what third-party domains requests touch, helping refine filter precision
- Works independently of any content blocker, providing a reliable baseline report
- Enables testing on less flexible platforms (mobile, constrained devices) where developer tools might be unavailable

### 3. Users Testing Content Blockers and Debunking Myths

You want to assess content blockers accurately and cut through misleading marketing claims such as “higher block count means better protection.” uBO Scope helps reveal the truth behind these misconceptions.

**Benefits:**
- Shows actual allowed third-party connections, the critical metric for privacy
- Demonstrates how high block counts can coincide with more third-party connections
- Exposes limitations of “ad blocker test” webpages that give unrealistic results

### 4. Anyone Seeking Transparency in Web Browsing

If you simply want a clearer picture of your web browsing footprint and the domains contacted behind the scenes, uBO Scope puts that information front and center.

**Benefits:**
- Intuitive badge counts summarize third-party connection volume at a glance
- Popup interface breaks down allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains clearly
- Empowers better decision making about privacy and content blockers

## Use Cases for uBO Scope

These scenarios illustrate how and why the core audience finds value in uBO Scope:

- **Routine Browsing Audit:** Quickly check any webpage for third-party domains it connects to, helping identify unexpected or suspicious connections.
- **Filter List Validation:** Monitor real browser network activity to test the effectiveness of custom or updated filter lists.
- **Myth Debunking:** Use real network data to correct misunderstandings based on badge counts or block metrics.
- **Testing on Constrained Devices:** Gather accurate network request reports even on platforms where development tools are limited or unavailable.

## Why This Focus Matters

Many users assume that content blockers fully expose network interactions, or that block count badges reflect privacy protection levels. Often this is not true. Some connections are blocked stealthily or outside the browser’s standard content blocker APIs, while others occur due to DNS-level filtering or other indirect mechanisms.

uBO Scope’s transparent, webRequest-based monitoring fills this gap by:

- Reporting _all_ attempted network connections, successful or not
- Categorizing connections to provide actionable insight
- Being independent of any blocking rules or DNS settings

This transparency enables users and maintainers alike to make informed choices about browsing privacy and security.

## Practical Tips for Audience Engagement

- If you maintain filter lists, consider uBO Scope your reliable audit companion on multiple platforms.
- Privacy-conscious users should regularly use uBO Scope to verify third-party connections and adjust blockers accordingly.
- When evaluating blockers, compare the actual _allowed_ third-party domains, not the blocked count badge.
- Be cautious about trusting ad blocker testing sites—use uBO Scope for accurate real-world network visibility.
