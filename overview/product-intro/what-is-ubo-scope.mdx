# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Remote Server Connection Made by Web Pages

uBO Scope is a specialized browser extension designed to transparently reveal **all attempted and successful remote server connections per web page**. Unlike traditional content blockers that only show what they actively block, uBO Scope empowers privacy-conscious users and filter maintainers by exposing the full scope of network requests—whether allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- Instantly see **how many distinct third-party servers** a web page attempts to contact, helping you understand its network footprint.
- Detect connections **beyond what typical content blockers reveal**, including requests that content blockers stealthily block or do not report.
- Empower yourself with insights for **better privacy decisions** and enable filter list maintainers to refine blocking rules more effectively.
- Provide a clear, no-nonsense view of web page network activity, independent of any content blocker’s internal counting methods.

### Who Benefits Most?

- Privacy-conscious users curious about or monitoring third-party connections invoked by websites they visit.
- Filter list maintainers who need accurate visibility into network activity to improve content blocking rules.
- Researchers and security professionals analyzing web behavior and third-party resource loading.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a **browser extension** that listens to all network requests initiated by browser tabs and records the remote servers contacted by each page—whether these requests were allowed, blocked silently ('stealth-blocked'), or failed.

At its core, uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to collect comprehensive data about network activity, regardless of which content blocking tools or DNS-level filters are active. This means it provides a truthful and transparent view into web pages’ remote network connections, independent of filtering layers.

### What Problem Does uBO Scope Solve?

Content blockers typically only expose resources they block or allow, but often fail to provide a **complete and transparent report** of all network requests—including requests blocked by stealth or at the DNS level. This leaves users in the dark about the actual servers that web pages attempt to contact.

uBO Scope fills that gap by:

- Revealing **all remote connection attempts** from each web page
- Reporting counts of **unique third-party remote servers** contacted
- Differentiating between allowed connections, stealth-blocked connections (those blocked without user-visible effects), and fully blocked connections

This transparency helps users debunk common misconceptions about content blockers and their effectiveness.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

Unlike many tools that rely solely on content blocker internal counts or webpage-visible resources, uBO Scope works purely from the browser's network request data, offering:

- **Independence from content blockers**: Works correctly regardless of which blocker is installed or how it operates.
- **Complete visibility into network events**: Reports every connection attempt, including redirects and errors.
- **Third-party domain focus**: Highlights the actual third-party domains contacted rather than just resource hits.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### Comprehensive Network Request Monitoring
uBO Scope hooks into the browser’s networking APIs to gather details on every network request made by web pages, including HTTP and WebSocket connections.

### Distinction of Request Outcomes
- **Allowed**: Requests allowed and successfully completed.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Requests silently blocked, often by content blockers trying to avoid detection.
- **Blocked**: Requests explicitly blocked, with errors.

### Real-Time Badge Count
The extension toolbar icon dynamically displays the **number of distinct third-party remote servers** contacted by the current tab, offering an immediate privacy metric.

### Popup Interface with Detailed Reporting
Clicking the toolbar icon opens a detailed popup showing domain counts categorized by their request outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked). This lets users analyze per-tab activity easily.

### Persistence During Sessions
Network request data is maintained throughout browser sessions, capturing detailed results for each tab and persisting through page navigations.

## Why Should I Care?

Using uBO Scope helps you transform opaque network activity into **clear, actionable insights**:

- **Understand all remote connections** a web page attempts, improving your privacy awareness.
- **Debunk myths about blockers** that focus on block counts rather than successful connections.
- Audit and validate content blockers by comparing what uBO Scope reports versus what your blocker reports.
- Gain tools filter maintainers appreciate for **refining host blocking and allowing lists**.

### Common Scenarios Where uBO Scope Excels

- Investigating unexpected third-party connections on popular web sites.
- Monitoring the privacy footprint of social media or news websites.
- Validating and comparing content blocker behavior.
- Analyzing redirects and stealth blocking attempts.

### The uBO Scope Advantage Over Conventional Tools

| Before uBO Scope | After uBO Scope |
|------------------|----------------|
| Blind trust in content blocker block counts. | Transparent understanding of connection outcomes to each third-party server. |
| Reliance on unreliable 'ad blocker test' pages. | Accurate, real-world network connection data for every page. |
| Guesswork about stealth-blocking and DNS-level filtering. | Clear insights separating allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains. |

## Getting Started Preview

Getting started with uBO Scope is straightforward:

1. **Install the extension** from the appropriate browser add-on store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Safari, etc.).
2. **Navigate to any website** and click the uBO Scope toolbar icon.
3. **View the popup panel** that lists third-party domains contacted, sorted by outcome.
4. **Interpret the badge count** as the number of unique third-party remote servers contacted.


For detailed installation guidance and interface walkthroughs, please refer to the sections under "Getting Started" in this documentation.

## Practical Tips

- A **lower badge count is usually better**, indicating fewer third-party connections.
- Remember that **not all third-party servers are malicious or undesirable;** many are legit providers such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).
- Use uBO Scope alongside your favorite content blocker to get a **full picture of network activity**.

## Common Pitfalls

- uBO Scope can only report requests visible through the browser's `webRequest` API; requests outside this scope (e.g., service worker fetches outside `webRequest` reach) might not be seen.
- The badge count reflects distinct third-party servers; pages with many legitimate third-party resources (analytics, CDNs) naturally show higher counts.
