# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlocking Transparency in Web Connections

uBO Scope is a lightweight, yet powerful browser extension designed to give you complete visibility into all the network connections your browser attempts and completes when you visit any webpage. More than just revealing a block count, uBO Scope focuses on tracking the number of distinct third-party servers your browser contacts — a crucial metric that matters for your privacy and control.

- **See every connection attempt:** Whether a connection is allowed, blocked, or stealthily redirected, uBO Scope lays it all bare.
- **Focus on third-party servers:** Understand exactly how many unique external servers a webpage communicates with — fewer is better.
- **Enhanced privacy insights:** Know which domains your data might be shared with or fetched from.
- **Non-intrusive, simple interface:** Quickly grasp connection data without overwhelming technical jargon.

This extension is crafted for privacy-conscious users, security professionals, and filter list maintainers who want to measure the effectiveness of content blockers or simply want to understand the network footprint of their browsing.

## What Is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a browser extension companion to uBlock Origin — but it functions independently to monitor and report all remote server connections initiated by webpages. Instead of passively counting blocked elements or scripts, it reveals the true landscape of network activity by reporting every unique third-party domain connected to, regardless of blocking outcomes.

### Solving the Real Problem

Many users assume that a higher number of blocked requests means better privacy, but this isn’t always true. Block counts don’t reflect the diversity of third-party servers accessed. A webpage might load resources from multiple distinct third parties despite blocking many individual requests. This results in more data exposure than block counts suggest.

uBO Scope fills this gap by focusing on the distinct third-party servers rather than just the raw count of blocked items. This clarity enables users to make better privacy decisions and assess content blocker reliability more accurately.

### What Sets uBO Scope Apart

- **True third-party server tracking:** Counts distinct domains instead of just block hits.
- **Works with any content blocker:** Reflects connections reported via the browser’s webRequest API, regardless of the blocking method.
- **Tracks connection outcomes:** Differentiates between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections to give a nuanced view.
- **Minimal performance impact:** Efficiently monitors network requests without slowing your browsing.

## How uBO Scope Works — At a Glance

Without going deep into implementation, here’s the user-centric flow:

1. When you open or navigate a tab, uBO Scope monitors all network requests made by the page.
2. It logs the hostnames of each attempted connection and groups them into allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked.
3. The badge icon on your browser toolbar shows the count of unique third-party domains successfully connected.
4. Clicking the popup reveals detailed lists of all connected domains, grouped by outcome, complete with connection counts.

This transparency empowers you to identify privacy leaks and measure the effectiveness of your content blockers.

## Why Should You Care About the Number of Third-Party Servers?

Tracking single block events can be misleading. What truly affects your privacy is how many unique third-party servers have access to your browsing data or deliver content.

By monitoring distinct third-party domain connections, uBO Scope helps you:

- **Understand your privacy exposure:** Identify sites sharing data with multiple trackers.
- **Measure blocker effectiveness:** A lower number means fewer third parties are contacted.
- **Debunk myths around blocker quality:** Block count alone doesn’t tell the full story.

### Real-World Scenarios Where uBO Scope Excels

- You visit an online store and see a high number of allowed third-party domains, revealing aggressive tracking despite your blocker.
- You want to verify that a filter list is actually preventing connections to tracker domains, not just blocking some cookie calls.
- As a filter list maintainer, you need a reliable tool to audit filter impact on real-world websites.

### Before and After Using uBO Scope

| Without uBO Scope                     | With uBO Scope                                         |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Rely on block counts as privacy metric | Understand that multiple third-party connections happen despite block statistics |
| Cannot differentiate stealth blocking | See stealth-blocked connections that could be privacy-relevant  |
| Blind to network connection details  | Transparent view of connection outcomes in simple, actionable format |

## Getting Started Preview

To start benefiting from uBO Scope:

1. **Install the extension** from your browser’s official add-on store.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup and review connection summaries for your active tab.
3. Use the toolbar badge count to gauge distinct third-party contacts at a glance.

<u>All that’s needed is the extension’s permission to observe network requests — no complicated setup required.</u>

<Tip>
Keep in mind that the badge number represents distinct third-party *domains* your browser connected to. This serves as a more meaningful privacy metric than just the number of blocked requests.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Because uBO Scope relies on the browser’s webRequest API, connections made outside this scope (like some WebSocket or specialized network calls) might not be captured.
</Warning>
