# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Connection Your Browser Attempts — Transparently and Lightly

Imagine browsing the web with a clear window into every network interaction your browser initiates. uBO Scope is your simple yet powerful companion that reveals every connection attempted or successfully established with remote servers as you navigate the internet. No complexity, no heavy interfaces — just straightforward visibility that empowers you to understand your browsing footprint.

### At a Glance: Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Complete Connection Visibility:** See all remote server connection attempts—both those allowed and those blocked—giving you a crystal-clear picture of your browser's network activity.
- **Lightweight & Non-Intrusive:** A minimalist browser extension designed to efficiently expose connection data without disrupting your browsing experience.
- **Insightful Badge Indicator:** The toolbar icon’s badge dynamically counts the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted, helping you gauge your exposure at a glance.
- **Independent of Content Blockers:** Accurately records network request outcomes regardless of any content blocker active in your browser, including DNS-level filters.
- **Supports Real-World Analysis:** Helps debunk common myths about content blocking by revealing actual network connections instead of raw block counts or fabricated test results.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Whether you're a privacy-conscious user, a filter list maintainer, or a web security analyst, uBO Scope gives you indispensable transparency into the unseen connections your browser makes. If you want to truly understand your exposure to third-party servers during browsing, this tool is built for you.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a straightforward browser extension that listens to all outgoing network requests made by your browser. It records whether each connection attempt to remote servers succeeded, was stealth-blocked by filters, or was explicitly blocked by your content blockers or network.

### The Problem it Solves

Web pages today communicate with a myriad of servers behind the scenes—some necessary, some tracking, and some irrelevant. Most browsers and content blockers offer only limited insight into these connections. uBO Scope fills that knowledge gap by providing a clear, authoritative view of these remote interactions in real time.

### How uBO Scope Works

- It hooks into the browser's `webRequest` API, capturing detailed events about each network request.
- Connections are categorized as **allowed (successful)**, **stealth-blocked** (blocked quietly by stealthy filters), or **blocked** (explicitly stopped).
- It keeps track of domains and hostnames contacted, aggregating data by individual tabs.
- The extension provides a popup interface summarizing this data, with counts and domain listings.

### What Makes uBO Scope Stand Out?

- **Simplicity:** No complicated settings or bulky dashboards—just focused data presented efficiently.
- **Precision:** Uses actual browser network request data for reliability, not guesswork or webpage-based metrics.
- **Complementary:** Acts as a perfect companion to content blockers like uBlock Origin without interfering with their operations.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### Real-Time Network Connection Monitoring

uBO Scope continuously records every network request your browser makes, classifying them based on their outcome and relation to your current browsing tab.

### Distinct Badge Count Indicator

The extension badge displays the count of distinct third-party domains contacted, instantly informing you about the breadth of external connections for the active tab.

### Categorized Outcome Reporting

- **Allowed:** Domains and hostnames where connections succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Requests silently intercepted by stealth blocking features.
- **Blocked:** Requests explicitly halted by content blockers or network errors.

This categorization helps you understand which servers your browser interacts with and which ones are being restricted.

### Tab-Specific Data Aggregation

Connection data is tracked per browser tab, keeping your analysis organized and contextual to the webpage.

### Lightweight Data Storage & Session Continuity

Connection records persist during your session without heavy local storage, ensuring quick data recall and responsiveness.

### Simple, Readable Popup Interface

Click the extension icon to see a neat summary of connected domains and their counts organized by outcome. This direct feedback empowers quick insight without requiring menus or complex configuration.

## Why Should You Care?

### Gain Full Transparency

Know every server your browser tries to reach. This level of visibility helps you make informed decisions about your privacy and network security.

### Detect Hidden Tracking & Unwanted Connections

uBO Scope reveals stealth connections that your blocker might silently allow or your browser doesn't explicitly report elsewhere, exposing potential privacy risks.

### Debunk Misleading Metrics

Rather than rely on block counts or test pages that may mislead, use uBO Scope’s factual network data to evaluate content blockers and filters objectively.

### Improve Your Browsing Hygiene

Identify unexpected third-party domains contacted during normal web usage and tailor your blockers or filters accordingly to reduce exposure.

### Lightweight & Non-Disruptive

All of this insight comes without slowing down your browser or interfering with your normal web experience.

## Getting Started Preview

### Quick Launch

1. Install uBO Scope from your preferred browser's extension store.
2. Browse the web normally.
3. Click the uBO Scope icon to open the popup showing the domains your browser connected to for that tab.

### Prerequisites

- A modern Chromium, Firefox, or Safari browser supporting extensions with `webRequest` API availability.
- Permissions to monitor web requests (granted on installation).

### Next Steps

Explore the popup interface to familiarize yourself with domain categorizations and badge counts. Then, continue with detailed guides on interpreting the data for your privacy workflows.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If no data appears in the popup, ensure your browser supports the required APIs and permissions are granted.
- Badge counts update dynamically but may briefly lag behind network activity—refresh the tab or reopen the popup if needed.
- Understand that uBO Scope cannot monitor network requests made outside the `webRequest` API scope (some native apps or encrypted DNS may bypass this).
