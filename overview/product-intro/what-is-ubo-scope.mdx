# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Remote Connection Your Browser Makes

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to reveal every connection your browser attempts or successfully completes to remote servers when loading webpages. Unlike typical content blockers that only show blocked resources, uBO Scope exposes *all* third-party connections — whether allowed, stealthily blocked, or fully blocked — regardless of which content blocker is in use.

This unique insight helps you understand exactly where your browser is communicating, shedding light on the often invisible web traffic underlying your browsing experience.

### Key Benefits of uBO Scope

- **Complete Visibility:** See every remote connection your browser issues on a given tab, not just those blocked.
- **Content Blocker Agnostic:** Works alongside any existing content blocking solution without interference.
- **Accurate Counting:** Reports the number of distinct third-party servers contacted, providing a reliable measure of your online exposure.
- **Empowers Privacy Audits:** Make informed decisions by identifying stealth connections and unexpected network requests.
- **Supports Filter List Maintenance:** Valuable tool for developers maintaining content blocking filter lists.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- Everyday users curious about what happens behind the scenes of their web browsing.
- Privacy-conscious individuals who want to verify the effectiveness of their content blockers.
- Filter list maintainers and privacy auditors who need precise data on network connections.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension companion to uBlock Origin, created to measure and report network requests initiated by webpages. It tracks attempted and successful connections to remote servers, organizing them by outcome: allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked. 

By leveraging the browser's `webRequest` API, uBO Scope collects detailed data on network requests regardless of filtering extensions or DNS-level blocking.

This extension answers the question: "Who is my browser really talking to?"


## Core Purpose

Many users rely on content blockers to reduce tracking and unwanted content, but they often have no visibility into what connections are made or blocked under the hood. 

uBO Scope fills this gap by providing transparent, actionable insight into all remote server connections your browser tries when loading pages. It reveals the true network footprint of webpages you visit, helping you:

- Understand the third-party servers involved.
- Detect stealth connections that some blockers may hide.
- Evaluate content blocker's real-world impact beyond raw block counts.


## Unique Positioning

Unlike tools that focus only on blocking, uBO Scope emphasizes measurement and monitoring. It:

- **Tracks all results:** allowed, stealth (redirected or stealth-blocked), and fully blocked requests.
- **Counts distinct domains:** highlighting how many unique third-party services are contacted.
- **Remains neutral:** it doesn’t block or modify content but reports outcomes for your informed choices.

This makes uBO Scope an indispensable tool for assessing privacy exposure and filter list effectiveness with unmatched clarity.


## How uBO Scope Works (High-Level)

1. When you navigate to a webpage, uBO Scope listens to all network requests your browser makes.
2. It categorizes each request based on its outcome — allowed, stealth (e.g., redirected), or blocked.
3. These results are aggregated per-tab and presented in a clear, domain-based summary.
4. The toolbar badge shows the count of distinct third-party domains successfully connected.
5. Opening the popup reveals detailed lists of domains by connection outcome.

## Real-World Impact: Why uBO Scope Matters

### Challenge the Myths

- **"Higher block count means better blocking"?**

  uBO Scope demonstrates that the count of blocked requests alone doesn't reflect blocking quality. A higher block count may actually mask more third-party connections, indicating less effective blocking.

- **Ad blocker test pages are misleading.**

  Many widely used test pages fabricate network requests and cannot detect stealth blocking techniques, rendering them unreliable. uBO Scope reports real, in-browser network activity.


### Empower Yourself

With uBO Scope, you can:

- Validate that your content blocker is truly reducing unwanted third-party connections.
- Identify stealth connections that slip through unnoticed.
- Understand the true number of distinct third-party domains your browser contacts, enabling more informed privacy decisions.

### Aid Filter List Maintainers

Filter list developers gain a powerful diagnostic and measurement tool to fine-tune their lists, ensuring fewer false positives and improved blocking accuracy.
