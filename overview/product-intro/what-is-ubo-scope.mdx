# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Remote Connection Your Browser Makes

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to transparently reveal all remote server connections — both attempted and successful — that any web page makes while you browse. By exposing these network requests in real time, it empowers you to understand exactly which third-party servers are involved with each page you visit.

### Why uBO Scope Matters to You

- **Enhances transparency:** See all remote servers contacted by webpages you visit, not just what content blockers report.
- **Empowers privacy-conscious users:** Identify all third-party domains your browser communicates with, helping you spot tracking or unnecessary connections.
- **Supports filter list maintainers:** Provides detailed, accurate data on network requests under various content blocking conditions.
- **Cross-blocker visibility:** Tracks connections regardless of which content blocking or DNS filtering method is in effect.
- **Helpful network diagnostics:** Shows attempted, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections for full insight.

### Intended Users

uBO Scope is intended for any user curious about the network behavior of web pages, especially privacy advocates, developers, security researchers, and filter list maintainers who require an accurate snapshot of network activity unaffected by extension stealth tactics or incomplete blocker metrics.

## What Is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a companion browser extension to content blockers like uBlock Origin. It listens to your browser’s `webRequest` API to monitor and record every remote server connection that webpages make. This includes connections that succeed, are explicitly blocked by your content blocker, or are stealth-blocked (attempted but hidden).

Unlike traditional content blocker metrics that only show block counts or rely on page heuristics, uBO Scope provides a definitive list of distinct third-party domains contacted, giving you clarity on what’s actually happening "under the hood".

### What Problem Does It Solve?

Many users believe a higher block count means a more effective content blocker. uBO Scope clears this misconception by showing that what truly matters is the count of unique third-party domains contacted, rather than raw block numbers that can be misleading.

It also debunks unreliable "ad blocker test" websites by providing real-world accurate data rather than synthetic test conditions.

### Unique Value

- **Complete visibility independent of blocking method** — tracks connections through DNS-based blocking or extension-level content blockers.
- **Aggregated detailed domain statistics** — aggregates domains contacted with counts for allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked categories.
- **Non-intrusive, lightweight, and reliable** — runs quietly in the background without interfering with page loads or blocker operations.

## How uBO Scope Works (at a High Level)

When you visit a web page, uBO Scope starts tracking network requests through the browser's `webRequest` API. It categorizes these network requests based on successful connections, blocks, and redirects.

- For the main document load, it resets previous state for fresh tracking.
- It maintains detailed maps of each domain and hostname contacted, counting each occurrence.
- Updates its badge icon with the count of unique third-party domains successfully connected.
- Presents a popup panel showing domains grouped by their outcome: not blocked, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

All this occurs in real-time, giving you immediate feedback about the network activity associated with the current tab.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Real-Time Network Monitoring:** Instantly detects and categorizes all remote server requests made during page loads.
- **Distinct Domain Counting:** Counts unique third-party domains to reflect true exposure rather than raw request numbers.
- **Categorization of Connection Outcomes:** Groups requests into "allowed" (successful), "stealth-blocked" (redirected or suppressed connections), and "blocked" (explicitly blocked).
- **Browser Badge Indicator:** Updates the extension toolbar icon with a badge displaying the number of distinct allowed third-party domains.
- **User-Friendly Popup Panel:** Displays a clear summary with domain names and occurrence counts, making it easy to assess each page’s external connections.

### Example Scenario
Imagine browsing a news site with many embedded advertising, tracking, and analytics domains. uBO Scope will list:

- Third-party content that was allowed (e.g., CDN domains)
- Requests that were blocked (e.g., ad networks)
- Requests that were stealth-blocked by content blockers or DNS policies

This transparency helps you decide if your current blocker configuration is effective or if you want to tailor filter lists further.

## Why Should I Care?

### Primary Benefits
- **Gain full transparency** into every external connection a webpage attempts, helping you identify unwanted tracking or data leakage.
- **Make informed decisions** about your content blocking setup by understanding its real impact beyond block counts.
- **Avoid myths and misinterpretations** often seen in blocker testing and comparison claims.
- **Support content blocker and filter list development** by providing accurate network data.

### Common Use Cases
- Privacy-conscious users verifying the extent of tracking on different websites.
- Filter list maintainers validating effectiveness of their rules across browsers and devices.
- Security professionals auditing page behavior for unauthorized or suspicious remote connections.
- Developers and power users who want detailed insight into page network activity without debugging tools.

### Before and After
Before uBO Scope, users might rely on vague block counts or misleading test sites to infer blocker performance. After uBO Scope, they see an accurate, comprehensive view of network connections per page, enabling smarter privacy and security decisions.

## Getting Started Preview

Getting started with uBO Scope is straightforward:

1. **Install the Extension:** Available on Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, and Safari Extensions.
2. **Start Browsing:** The extension automatically tracks connections for active tabs.
3. **View Badge and Popup:** Click the toolbar icon to reveal a detailed list of all third-party domain connections categorized by their outcome.

### Prerequisites
- A modern browser supporting the WebExtensions `webRequest` API (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Permissions to observe web requests (`webRequest`, `activeTab`, `storage`).

### Next Steps
- Learn how to interpret the badge counts and popup panel in [Understanding the Badge Count and Popup Panel](https://example.com/guides/interpreting-results/badge-and-popup-guide).
- Explore recommended practices and common pitfalls in [Interpreting Results: Myths, Pitfalls, and Best Practices](https://example.com/guides/interpreting-results/mythbusting-and-best-practices).

## Additional Information

### What the Badge Count Means
The badge count on uBO Scope’s toolbar icon represents the number of distinct third-party remote servers from which resources were successfully fetched during the active tab’s lifecycle. A lower count implies fewer third-party connections and potentially better privacy.

### Limitations
Some network requests made outside the scope of the `webRequest` API cannot be tracked by uBO Scope, such as those initiated by native apps or certain browser features.
