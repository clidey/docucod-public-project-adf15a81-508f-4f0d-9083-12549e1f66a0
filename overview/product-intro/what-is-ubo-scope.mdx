# What is uBO Scope?

## Unveiling Your Browser's Network Activity with Transparency and Precision

uBO Scope is a powerful browser extension designed to reveal every attempted or successful network connection initiated by your browser tabs. Regardless of which content blocker or DNS filter you use, uBO Scope exposes the full scope of remote server connections, empowering you to understand exactly what your browser is reaching out to in real time.

### Key Benefits of uBO Scope
- **Complete Transparency:** Shows all third-party remote servers involved in loading your webpages, not just those blocked or allowed by content blockers.
- **Content Blocker Agnostic:** Operates independently of content blockers and DNS filters, measuring actual network activity as reported by the browser’s webRequest API.
- **Accurate Reporting:** Counts distinct remote servers connected per tab, providing a reliable metric to assess connection exposure.
- **Debunks Common Myths:** Helps clarify misunderstandings around block counts and ad blocker effectiveness by focusing on network outcomes.
- **Developer & Maintainer Friendly:** Offers actionable insights for developers, filter list maintainers, and privacy-conscious users.

### Who Should Use This Page?
This page targets anyone seeking a clear, unbiased view of their browser’s real network connections—whether you are a developer wanting to audit web requests, a privacy advocate verifying third-party exposure, or a filter list maintainer validating effectiveness in real browsing environments.

## What Is uBO Scope?

At its simplest, uBO Scope is a browser extension that listens to your browser’s network requests and reports on every connection made to remote servers from your browsing tabs. It is a companion tool to content blockers like uBlock Origin, focused on measurement rather than blocking.

The primary purpose is to give you comprehensive insight into the "who" and "how many" of third-party connections involved in loading web content. These connections may include legitimate services such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), analytics providers, or advertising servers.

uBO Scope does this by leveraging the browser’s `webRequest` API to track network requests as they occur. Because it operates at a low level, it can report actual network activity regardless of any content blocking or DNS filtering in place. This ability makes uBO Scope a uniquely objective tool for auditing and verification.

### Why Was uBO Scope Created?

Many users and filter list maintainers face confusion and misinformation about how content blockers battle tracking and ads. Block counts or test webpages may misrepresent real-world network scenarios or fail to encompass stealth blocking techniques. uBO Scope was created to restore clarity by showing what really happens behind the scenes — which remote servers are contacted and how often.

By providing an accurate count of connected third-party domains, the extension enables smarter evaluation of privacy tools and cleaner analysis of network traffic.

### Core Differentiators
- Unlike simplistic block counters, uBO Scope quantifies distinct third-party servers connected, a clearer indicator of privacy exposure.
- Operates independently of any content blocker’s internal heuristics, avoiding false positives or miscounts.
- Supports multiple browsers and platforms with consistent behavior.

## How Does uBO Scope Work?

Behind the scenes, uBO Scope installs itself as a browser extension with permissions to listen to network requests (`webRequest` API). For each browser tab, it:

1. **Monitors Network Requests:** Tracks every request made by web pages, including redirects, successful fetches, and errors.
2. **Categorizes Requests:** Classifies these requests as **allowed**, **blocked** (by external factors, not uBO Scope), or **stealth-blocked** (requests that silently fail or are redirected).
3. **Aggregates Domains:** Maps hostnames to their respective registered domains using the Public Suffix List to count distinct entities.
4. **Updates the UI:** Shows a badge on the toolbar icon with the count of distinct allowed third-party domains, and detailed breakdowns in a popup.

This mechanism gives users a precise snapshot of the third-party network landscape per active tab.

## Real-World Impact: What You Can Achieve with uBO Scope

Imagine you want to verify your browser’s exposure while visiting your favorite website:

- Without uBO Scope, you might only see what your content blocker claims it blocked or allowed.
- With uBO Scope, you see the **real count of distinct third-party domains connected**, regardless of any blocking layers.

This lets you confirm if low block counts actually correspond to fewer third-party connections, or if stealthy services bypass your blocker unnoticed.

Filter list maintainers benefit by analyzing real-world effectiveness of filters, identifying connections that evade blocking, and refining rules based on actual traffic.

Privacy-conscious users gain confidence by understanding connections made during browsing, empowering informed decisions.

## Common Scenarios Where uBO Scope Excels

| Scenario                                                  | How uBO Scope Helps                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Assessing the real-world impact of different content blockers | Counts actual distinct third-party servers contacted, clarifying blocker effectiveness. |
| Diagnosing suspicious network connections                  | Helps pinpoint domains transparently, revealing suspect activity.  |
| Verifying stealth blocking techniques                       | Distinguishes between visible blocks and silent (stealth) blocking outcomes. |
| Supporting filter list maintenance                          | Provides data-driven insights on rule effectiveness in live environments. |

## Important Insights from uBO Scope’s Design Philosophy

- **Badge Count Is Not a Block Count:** The badge on the toolbar icon reflects the number of distinct connected third-party domains—lower is better.
- **Don’t Trust “Ad Blocker Test” Pages:** These synthetic webpages don’t reflect real browsing and cannot assess stealthy extension behavior.
- **Real Network Requests Matter:** Only actual network events, as reported by the browser’s API, meaning uBO Scope reports the truth about connectivity.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If the badge count does not update as expected, verify that your browser supports full `webRequest` API permissions.
- Remember that network requests outside the `webRequest` API’s scope (e.g., outside browser tabs) will not be reported.
- The first version focuses on connection counts; future updates may include richer network details.

<u>Use uBO Scope to confidently uncover your browser’s real network footprint.</u>
