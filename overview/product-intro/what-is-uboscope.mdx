# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover the Invisible Web of Network Connections

uBO Scope is a lightweight, browser extension designed to show you every network connection—whether attempted or successful—that webpages make when you visit them. Unlike typical content blockers that focus only on blocking or allowing certain content, uBO Scope reveals the real-time network activity happening behind the scenes, empowering you with transparency and insight.

- **Visualize all third-party connections** your browser attempts to make on each webpage.
- **Understand the true network footprint** beyond what content blockers report.
- **Expose stealthy redirects and blocked requests** that often go unnoticed.
- **Benefit from a minimal, non-intrusive interface** with zero configuration.

**Ideal for:** Web users seeking full visibility into connection activity, privacy-conscious individuals, filter list maintainers, and anyone curious about third-party domains their browser communicates with.

## What Is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a simple yet powerful extension that reports all remote server connections initiated by webpages you visit. While most content blockers concentrate on blocking ads, trackers, or other unwanted content, uBO Scope’s mission is purely about transparency—showing what connections actually occur.

Every network request, whether allowed, stealthily redirected, or blocked, is recorded and presented in an easy-to-understand format. This insight allows you to see the full scope of third-party domains your browser contacts.

### Why uBO Scope?

Typical content blockers emphasize what they block, often providing limited or misleading information about network activity. uBO Scope fills this gap by providing detailed visibility, ensuring you can:

- Detect connections that content blockers let slip through unnoticed.
- Distinguish between outright blocked domains and those that succeed in connecting.
- Gain an accurate understanding of your browser’s network behavior—no guesswork required.

uBO Scope does not block or interfere with connections itself; instead, it relies on browser APIs to report precisely what has happened.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### Comprehensive Network Connection Reporting
uBO Scope listens to your browser’s network events and tracks the outcome of each remote server request. It classifies these connections into three clear categories:

- **Not Blocked**: Domains to which connections were successfully made.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Connections that were redirected or altered stealthily by content blockers.
- **Blocked**: Requests that were outright blocked or resulted in errors.

This breakdown helps you understand the effectiveness of your content blockers and the true reach of third-party tracking.

### Browser Toolbar Badge
The extension’s icon badge dynamically shows the number of distinct third-party domains contacted on the active tab. This count reflects successful connections, encouraging you to seek lower numbers to improve privacy.

### User-Friendly Popup Interface
Click the extension icon to open a popup that categorizes domains with counts of connections, clearly differentiating allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains in separate sections for quick analysis.

### Broad Browser Support
uBO Scope works with Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari, leveraging standardized browser APIs for consistent behavior across platforms.

### Zero Configuration Needed
Installation is straightforward, with no setup or user configuration required. Upon visiting a webpage, uBO Scope immediately begins recording network activity.

## Why Should You Care?

### Gain Full Visibility into Network Activity
Understanding which third parties your browser connects to is vital for privacy and security. uBO Scope makes invisible web connections visible, helping you make informed decisions about which domains to trust or block.

### Debunk Content Blocker Myths
Many users misunderstand what ‘block counts’ mean in common ad blockers. uBO Scope clarifies this by showing connections regardless of blocking status, helping you see:

- How high block counts don’t always mean better protection.
- That some content blockers may allow connections to more third parties even with higher block numbers.
- Why commonly used ‘ad blocker test’ websites are unreliable benchmarks.

### Empower Filter List Maintainers
Filter list creators benefit by seeing exactly which third-party domains are contacted, enabling better tuning of lists to improve blocking effectiveness without breaking websites.

### Increase Privacy Awareness
By constantly monitoring and visualizing network connections, uBO Scope encourages better privacy practices and awareness, helping users minimize exposure to unnecessary trackers.

## Getting Started Preview

Once installed, uBO Scope requires no additional setup:

1. **Install the Extension** from your browser’s extension store.
2. **Visit Any Webpage** and watch the badge count on the toolbar icon update to reflect real network connections.
3. **Click the Icon** to open the popup panel and explore detailed domain connection statistics categorized by connection outcome.

Successful visualization means the extension is actively monitoring and reporting network activity for the current tab.

For detailed installation and usage tips, see related documentation on [Installing uBO Scope](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Scope) and [Quick Validation](../getting-started/usage-validation/quick-validation).

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use uBO Scope alongside your existing content blockers to get a clearer picture of what is actually connecting.
- Monitor the badge counts to gauge privacy risks on different sites.
- Regularly review the domains listed under ‘Not Blocked’ to identify unexpected or suspicious connections.
- Understand that not all third-party domains are harmful—CDNs and legitimate services often appear as third parties.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- uBO Scope depends on the browser’s `webRequest` API; network requests outside its scope (e.g., certain DNS-level blocks) will not be captured.
- If the badge count stays at zero or no data appears in the popup, ensure the extension is enabled and your browser supports the required API for your platform and version.
- Network requests made from outside of tabs (e.g., background service workers or other sources) are not accounted for.

Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../getting-started/usage-validation/troubleshooting-installation) guide for assistance.

## Summary

uBO Scope transforms the way you visualize web network connections by revealing every third-party server contact made by webpages. It’s an essential tool for anyone serious about understanding and controlling their web privacy footprint with clarity and precision.
