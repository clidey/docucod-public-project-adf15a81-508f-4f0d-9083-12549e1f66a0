# Value Proposition & Use Cases

## Unlocking Web Transparency Like Never Before

uBO Scope delivers an unprecedented level of insight into the network connections your browser makes — successful or blocked — independent of any content blocking tools in place. Whether you're a privacy-conscious individual, a developer, or a filter list maintainer, this extension empowers you to see beyond traditional metrics and truly understand the web’s underlying communications.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?
- **Comprehensive Visibility:** Monitors and classifies every third-party remote server your browser attempts to connect to, regardless of blocking mechanisms.
- **Accurate Connection Outcome Reporting:** Distinguishes between connections that were allowed, stealth-blocked (silently prevented via redirects), or fully blocked.
- **Real-Time Badge Indicator:** Keeps you immediately informed of the distinct count of third-party domains connected on the current tab through an intuitive badge.
- **Independent of Content Blocker Logic:** Does not rely on any content blocker’s internal blocking counters or heuristics — offering an unbiased, accurate picture.

### Who Benefits From uBO Scope?
- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Gain clear insight into which third parties your browser is communicating with, helping identify hidden trackers or unnecessary connections.
- **Web Developers & QA Teams:** Verify that content filtering and network requests behave as expected across different browsing sessions.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Access dependable network connection data even on environments where developer tools or other sophisticated monitoring options are restricted.

## Primary Use Cases

### 1. Discovering Third-Party Connections on Webpages
As you browse, uBO Scope reveals all the distinct third-party remote servers your browser communicates with. This helps you answer questions like:

- "Which external domains is this site reaching out to?"
- "Am I connecting to more third parties than I expected?"

By presenting counts and domains grouped by outcome (allowed, stealth-blocked, blocked), you can immediately evaluate your exposure to third-party services.

### 2. Evaluating Content Blocker Effectiveness from a Network Perspective
Instead of focusing on block counts reported by extensions—which can be misleading—uBO Scope shows the actual number of distinct third-party domains your browser fetched resources from. This allows you to:

- Assess whether your content blocker effectively reduces third-party connections.
- Avoid false assumptions based on block counts, which can be inflated or manipulated.

This clarity refines your decision-making around privacy tools and their real impact.

### 3. Filter List Maintenance Under Limitations
Filter list maintainers often work on devices with limited access to developer tools. uBO Scope’s ability to:

- Report domain-level connection outcomes.
- Operate independently of the content blocker’s internal state.

Makes it invaluable for verifying filter performance and auditing network requests in constrained environments.

### 4. Debunking Common Myths About Blocking and Testing
Many believe high block counts indicate better protection or that specialized test webpages reliably evaluate blockers. uBO Scope reveals why these beliefs are flawed by showing the genuine connection picture, helping users and maintainers avoid misleading conclusions.


## How Users Interact With uBO Scope

1. **Install and Enable the Extension:** Quickly add uBO Scope to your favorite browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
2. **Browse Normally:** uBO Scope passively collects connection data for the active browser tab.
3. **Open the Popup:** Click the extension icon to view a detailed breakdown of all encountered domains, categorized by outcome:
   - *Not Blocked:* Domains where connections succeeded.
   - *Stealth-Blocked:* Domains where connections were silently redirected or prevented.
   - *Blocked:* Domains explicitly blocked with errors.
4. **Interpret the Badge:** The toolbar badge number represents the count of distinct third-party domains with allowed connections—your direct measure of third-party exposure.


## Best Practices for Maximizing uBO Scope’s Value

- Regularly monitor your browsing sessions to identify unusual or unexpected third-party connections.
- Use the detailed domain lists to verify the presence or absence of tracking or advertising domains.
- Combine uBO Scope observations with your content blocker's whitelist/blacklist to fine-tune privacy settings.
- For filter maintainers, analyze stealth-blocked and blocked domains to validate filtering rules.


## Troubleshooting & Common Questions

### Why is the badge count different from my content blocker's block count?
uBO Scope counts the number of distinct third-party domains your browser successfully connected to, independent from how many requests were blocked. A lower badge count means fewer third-party connections, which is a more reliable privacy indicator.

### Can uBO Scope detect network requests blocked by DNS or firewall?
As long as the browser reports the network request through its `webRequest` API, uBO Scope can register outcomes. However, network requests completely blocked outside the browser (like DNS-based blocking) may not be observed.

### What does "stealth-blocked" mean?
Stealth blocking refers to connection attempts that the browser silently redirects or prevents without an explicit error. These are partially hidden from typical network tools but are reported accurately by uBO Scope.

### My extension popup shows "NO DATA" for some tabs. Why?
Data is only available for tabs with active monitored network requests. If a tab has no active network requests or the extension is starting up, data may be temporarily unavailable.
