# Key Features of uBO Scope

Discover at a glance the essential capabilities that empower you to monitor and understand the network activity of your browser in real time. This page summarizes the principal features of uBO Scope’s popup interface, focusing on how it reports distinct remote server connections, categorizes domain access outcomes, and provides transparency regardless of any content blocker employed.

---

## Clear Badge Count of Distinct Remote Servers

The toolbar icon badge number represents the count of unique third-party remote servers your browser connects to during a browsing session. This single metric provides a powerful indicator of your exposure footprint:

- **Lower count** means fewer third-party connections, generally indicating a more private browsing experience.
- **Higher count** alerts you to increased exposure to external services.

This count updates dynamically, reflecting the current tab's network activity and aiding you in making informed decisions about your web interactions.

_Tip: This count is unaffected by content blockers and shows actual connections attempted or established, not just blocked requests._

## Categorization of Network Activity by Domain Outcome

uBO Scope classifies all remote domains contacted into three distinct categories, displayed clearly in the popup interface:

- **Allowed Domains**: Third-party servers that your browser successfully connects to without interference.
- **Stealth-Blocked Domains**: Requests blocked silently by content blockers to prevent detection or webpage breakage, keeping these connections hidden from the page.
- **Blocked Domains**: Requests explicitly blocked by content blockers, alerting you to prevented network activity.

This categorization offers complete visibility into how network requests are treated, making it easy to understand what traffic is passing through and what is being intercepted.

### How Domain Counts Are Presented

For each category, you see:

- **Domain names**: A list neatly organized for quick scanning.
- **Badge counts**: Showing the number of distinct hosts or requests under that domain.

This structured view helps you spot which domains are most active or most frequently contacted.

## Network Activity Reporting Independent of Content Blockers

One of uBO Scope’s standout features is its ability to report network requests and their outcomes regardless of which content blocker is active or whether blocking occurs at the DNS or browser level.

- It leverages the browser’s `webRequest` API, ensuring all connection attempts—allowed, stealth blocked, or blocked—are recorded and presented.
- It works even if your content blocker uses stealth or DNS-level blocking, giving you an unfiltered picture.

This transparency is invaluable for users seeking to validate the effectiveness of their privacy tools or filter list maintainers monitoring real-world network behaviors.

## Tab-Specific Aggregation of Network Requests

uBO Scope focuses reporting on a per-tab basis, so you get:

- Insight into the network activity tied only to the active tab, filtering out unrelated background requests from other tabs.
- The domain and hostname of the page you are currently viewing, setting the context for the displayed connections.

This localized data enables precise troubleshooting and evaluation, empowering you to detect unexpected third-party activity specific to each webpage.

## Practical Example: Reading the Popup Interface

Imagine you open a news website in your browser. The uBO Scope icon badge shows “8,” indicating eight different third-party remote servers connected.

Clicking the icon opens the popup:

- You see the main site’s domain at the top.
- The sections show 'not blocked' domains (e.g., cdn.example.com), 'stealth-blocked' (e.g., trackers silently blocked), and 'blocked' domains (e.g., known ad servers).
- Each domain shows a count of how many hosts under it were contacted.

You realize the site loads resources from legitimate CDNs while stealthily blocking many trackers, all clearly presented.

<AccordionGroup title="Best Practices and Tips for Using Key Features">
<Accordion title="Interpreting the Badge Count">
Always consider the badge count as an indicator of exposure, not a measure of blocking effectiveness. A lower number reflects fewer distinct connections to third-party domains, helping you achieve better privacy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Reviewing Domain Categories">
Use the categorization to identify suspicious or unexpected domains in the allowed or stealth-blocked lists. Frequent stealth-blocked domains might indicate aggressive tracking attempts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Handling Stealth Blocking Insights">
Understand that stealth-blocked domains do not cause webpage breakage but represent connections silently blocked. Use this insight to appreciate the nuances of stealthy content blockers.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **No badge shown or zero count**: This may happen if the tab has no network connections yet or the extension has just been installed. Reload the tab and verify connectivity.
- **Unexpected high count of distinct domains**: Could indicate embedded third-party scripts or trackers. Use the categorized domain lists to assess which domains are allowed.
- **Domains missing in the popup**: The extension relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API. Some network requests outside this scope, such as those from service workers or non-browser network layers, may not be reported.

For detailed troubleshooting, see the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../getting-started/quick-start-usage-validation/basic-troubleshooting) page.
