# Product Value and Benefits

## Gain Clear Visibility into Your Web's Network Activity

When you browse the web, your browser silently communicates with many servers behind the scenes. Among these, third-party servers play a major role in shaping your experience — sometimes responsibly delivering content, sometimes tracking your activity, or even slowing down your page load. Understanding exactly which remote servers your browser connects to can be challenging without specialized tools.

**uBO Scope** shines precisely here: it offers you **transparent, real-time insight into third-party network activity**, empowering you to see who your browser is talking to, and what’s happening with those connections.

### Why This Matters
- **Know every third-party connection:** Spot all remote servers your browser contacts, both allowed and blocked.
- **Evaluate content blockers better:** Instead of guessing, rely on accurate data about network outcomes.
- **Enhance your privacy awareness:** Discover stealthy connections that might be tracking or profiling you.
- **Support filter maintainers:** Use detailed connection reports to improve ad/tracker blocking lists.

### Who Benefits Most
- Privacy advocates striving to understand web tracking.
- Filter list maintainers seeking real-world network data.
- Power users wanting to audit third-party connections.
- Security-conscious individuals evaluating blocking effectiveness.


## What Is uBO Scope Offering?

**uBO Scope** is a lightweight browser extension designed to **reveal all network connections initiated during your browsing sessions** — not only those that succeed but also those blocked or stealthily redirected. It focuses keenly on remote third-party servers, breaking down the connections your active tabs make.

### Core Value delivered by uBO Scope:
- **Unfiltered transparency:** Understand what the browser tries to connect to, regardless of what content blocker you use.
- **Accurate connection outcomes:** It reports whether connections were allowed, silently rerouted (stealth-blocked), or outright blocked.
- **Clear focus on third parties:** By analyzing domains and hostnames, you get summarized data on distinct servers contacted.

This data gives you a clearer picture of your exposure to third-party content, making it easier to make informed decisions about your privacy tools and settings.


## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Real-time badge count:** The toolbar icon dynamically shows the number of distinct third-party servers your current tab contacted — a direct indicator of your page’s network footprint.

- **Popup summary interface:** A straightforward UI breaks down domains into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories, letting you quickly assess which servers are communicating with your browser.

- **Comprehensive network monitoring:** Listens to browser webRequest events to capture all relevant outcomes, including redirections and errors.

- **Domain and hostname aggregation:** Organizes results by domain, helping you distinguish between unique source servers and subdomains.

- **Cross-browser support:** Available for Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari, adapting to each environment's capabilities.

- **Persistent session data:** Keeps track of your browsing session's network activity, allowing you to resume or analyze your connection history.


## Why Should You Care?

Without clear insight, third-party connections remain a mystery, leaving you blind to potential privacy risks or inefficiencies in your content blockers. uBO Scope arms you with the knowledge needed to understand these hidden activities.

### Real Benefits You Gain:
- **Increased privacy control:** Spot risky or unnecessary third-party connections and block or filter accordingly.
- **Smarter content blocker evaluation:** Don’t rely on block counts alone; see actual distinct server connections to judge blocking quality.
- **Improved browsing performance awareness:** Recognize when too many third-party servers slow your browsing.
- **Reliable data for filter development:** Help maintainers deliver better, more effective blocking lists.


### Common Use Cases
- You load a webpage and want to see exactly which third parties are contacted.
- You suspect your content blocker misses certain connections and want verification.
- You maintain or assess filter lists and require precise server connection data.
- You wish to debunk misleading metrics like high block counts that don’t translate into real privacy gains.

## Getting Started Preview

Getting started with uBO Scope means installing the extension and opening its popup to instantly see the number and categories of third-party domains connected to your active tab.

### Prerequisites
- Supported browsers include modern Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge), Firefox, and Safari (minimum versions specified).
- Permissions required are minimal and focused on network request observing.

### Initial Steps
- Install uBO Scope from your browser’s extension store.
- Open any website and click the toolbar icon to reveal the popup interface.
- Observe the badge count for a quick connection summary.

For detailed installation and use, see the [Installation Instructions](/getting-started/introduction-installation/installation) and [Understanding the Popup and Toolbar Badge](/guides/getting-started/understanding-the-ui) pages.


## Practical Tips and Best Practices
- Use uBO Scope alongside your existing content blocker to get detailed feedback on which third parties are genuinely contacted.
- Pay attention to the 'stealth-blocked' category to understand server connections that might bypass naive blocking.
- Regularly check your badge count to monitor any changes in third-party exposure as you browse different sites.
- Filter list maintainers can leverage session data to refine rules based on real browsing patterns.


## Troubleshooting Common Issues
- **No badge count appearing:** Ensure the extension has the required permissions and is enabled.
- **Popup shows 'NO DATA':** Network monitoring starts when you load or reload browser tabs; refresh the active tab.
- **Counts seem high or unexpected:** Third-party servers can include legitimate CDN or service providers; evaluate context before blocking.

### Code Example of uBO Scope Highlight

You can programmatically query the extension for your active tab’s network connections:

```javascript
// Example of message to retrieve tab data
browser.runtime.sendMessage({ what: 'getTabData', tabId: currentTabId }, response => {
    const tabDetails = JSON.parse(response);
    console.log('Allowed domains:', [...tabDetails.allowed.domains.keys()]);
    console.log('Stealth-blocked domains:', [...tabDetails.stealth.domains.keys()]);
    console.log('Blocked domains:', [...tabDetails.blocked.domains.keys()]);
});
```

This sample showcases the clarity and granularity of the network connection data collected by uBO Scope.
