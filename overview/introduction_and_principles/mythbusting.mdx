# Common Myths and Realities

Understanding why network transparency matters is crucial when evaluating content blockers and the tools designed to measure them. This page addresses widespread misconceptions about content blocker reliability and the value of ad blocker test pages, empowering you to interpret badge counts and testing results with clarity.

---

## Why This Matters

If you use uBO Scope to evaluate your browser’s content blocking effectiveness, you may encounter conflicting impressions based on metrics like block counts or test webpage results. This guide clarifies the reality behind these numbers and helps you focus on what truly impacts your privacy and browsing safety.


## Myth #1: "Higher Block Count Means Better Blocking"

Many users assume that a content blocker reporting a higher block count on its badge or interface is delivering stronger protection. This is a common but misleading interpretation.

### The Reality

- The **block count on a badge** measures the number of network requests blocked, **not** the number of distinct third-party domains from which connections were prevented.
- A blocker can show a high block count **yet still allow connections to more third-party domains**, which means more potential tracking or ads slipping through.
- Ultimately, the critical metric is the **number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser successfully connects to**—the fewer, the better.

### What uBO Scope Tracks

uBO Scope reports the **number of distinct third-party domains your browser connects to**, including:

- Allowed connections
- Stealth-blocked (requests that were blocked in a way that browsers/websites cannot easily detect)
- Blocked connections (explicit rejections/errors)

By focusing on unique third-party domains rather than raw block counts, you gain an accurate picture of your exposure.


## Myth #2: "Ad Blocker Test Pages Are Reliable Indicators"

You might have encountered webpages that claim to test your ad blocker or content blocker for effectiveness. They might display messages like "Your ad blocker is working!" or "Ads detected."

### The Reality

- Many extension-based content blockers, including popular ones, use advanced stealth techniques that make blocking requests invisible to such test pages.
- These test pages rely on **artificial, contrived network requests** that do not reflect real-world browsing.
- Test pages **cannot see or simulate** the full range of browser network activity, especially asynchronous or stealth-blocked requests.
- Hence, their results are often **inaccurate or misleading**.

### Why You Should Ignore Them

Using uBO Scope to observe *actual* network traffic is vastly more informative. It displays real-time data about all remote servers your browser talks to, bypassing illusions created by simplistic tests.


## Practical Tips for Evaluating Network Blocking

- Focus on the **distinct domains count shown by uBO Scope's badge and popup**, not just on block counters.
- Use **real browsing sessions** to assess connection patterns instead of relying on test sites.
- Understand that a low number of allowed third-party servers typically means stronger privacy protection.
- Consider the **presence of "stealth-blocked" entries** as a sign of effective, subtle blocking.


## Common Pitfalls When Using Badge Counts and Test Sites

- **Interpreting high block numbers as a sign of better privacy** can be counterproductive if the blocker allows connections to many distinct third parties.
- **Test pages may trigger detections or responses unique to their design, which do not align with real web behavior.**
- Using shortcut conclusions from test results can lead to **misjudging the effectiveness of your blockers and filters.**


## Summary

This page emphasizes transparency and correct interpretation of network connection data. By dispelling myths around blocker reliability and test pages, it helps you make informed decisions based on actual network activity rather than flawed proxies.

<Note>
Remember: uBO Scope's badge count reflects the **number of distinct third-party domains contacted** by your browser tab during normal browsing, not a simple block tally. Lower counts mean fewer external servers contacted, which contributes to better privacy and load performance.
