# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Remote Server Connection in Your Browser

In today’s web, your browser frequently communicates with numerous remote servers, often without your explicit knowledge. **uBO Scope** puts you in control by revealing all attempted and successful remote server connections during any browsing session. This transparency empowers you to understand who your browser talks to—whether for delivering content, tracking, or other purposes.

### Why This Matters
- **Enhance Your Privacy**: Identify and assess third-party servers your browser contacts, allowing you to reduce unwanted exposure.
- **Improve Security Awareness**: Spot suspicious or unexpected remote connections that might indicate threats.
- **Boost Browser Performance**: Recognize excessive third-party requests that may slow down your browsing experience.

### Who Is uBO Scope For?
- Privacy-conscious users wanting clear visibility into network activity.
- Security analysts and enthusiasts tracking potentially risky connections.
- Web developers and filter list maintainers needing data on external resource requests.

## What Exactly Is uBO Scope?

At its core, uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to **monitor and report every network request your browser makes to remote servers**. Unlike generic blockers or network monitors, it uniquely focuses on the *presence* of connections rather than blocking or modifying them.

- It captures both successful and attempted (including blocked or redirected) network connections.
- It tracks connections by domain and hostname, enabling granular insight.
- The extension integrates seamlessly with browsers via the standard `webRequest` API.

Unlike tools that only report total numbers or block counts, uBO Scope shows the *actual distinct third-party servers* your browser contacts, providing deeper contextual awareness.

## How uBO Scope Works

When you navigate the web, your browser issues many network requests. uBO Scope actively listens to these requests via the browser's network API. It records:

- Requests that succeed and load resources.
- Requests that fail or are blocked.
- Redirects that occur during requests.

This data is organized per browser tab, grouping connections by domain and hostname, and categorizing them into **allowed** (successful), **blocked**, or **stealth** (redirected) connections.

This approach offers a clear view of external connections impacting your current browsing activity, regardless of any other content blockers in place.

## Real-World Examples

- When visiting a news site, uBO Scope might reveal connections to content delivery networks (CDNs), advertisement servers, and analytics platforms, distinguishing trusted third-party services from potential trackers.
- For developers testing a new webpage, it uncovers exactly which domains are being fetched, assisting in debugging or optimization.
- For privacy advocates, seeing the actual remote servers accessed helps validate the effectiveness of blocker lists or DNS filters.

---

## Practical Benefits at a Glance

- **Accurate Third-Party Detection**: Reports the number of distinct third-party servers contacted per tab.
- **Transparency Beyond Blocking**: Even when content blockers or DNS filters intervene, uBO Scope reveals blocked or redirected connections.
- **Myth Busting**: Clarifies misconceptions about content blocker effectiveness, focusing on distinct remote connections rather than raw block counts.

## Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The badge icon in your browser toolbar dynamically shows the **count of distinct third-party servers your current tab has connected to**. Lower numbers indicate fewer third-party exposures, which often translates to improved privacy and performance.

> **Tip:** Not all third-party connections are harmful. Many legitimate services (like well-known CDNs) will usually appear, so focus on identifying unusual or excessive connections.

---

## What uBO Scope Is Not

- It is **not a content blocker**; it does not prevent connections.
- It is **not an ad-blocking test tool**; evaluation should not rely on fabricated test sites.
- It does **not block DNS level connections** outside the browser's network API visibility.

Its sole purpose is to provide you honest, real-time insight into your browser’s network behavior.
