# Quickstart: Your First Minute with uBO Scope

Welcome to uBO Scope—your essential companion for instant visibility into the network connections made by any webpage you visit. This guide takes you step-by-step through your very first interaction: from installing the extension to interpreting the data it uncovers.

---

## Get Ready: Install and Activate uBO Scope

Start by installing the uBO Scope extension from your browser's official add-on store:

- **Chrome**: [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp)
- **Firefox**: [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)

Once installed, you’ll see the uBO Scope icon in your browser toolbar. This icon is your gateway to detailed network connection insights.

Ensure your browser supports the required APIs (like `webRequest`)—uBO Scope relies on these to accurately track network activity.

## Step 1: Open a Popular Webpage

Visit a commonly used website with multiple third-party resources—think news sites, social media platforms, or popular blogs. These sites typically load content from various remote servers, making them perfect for your initial test.

## Step 2: Click the uBO Scope Toolbar Icon

Click on the toolbar icon to open the popup panel. This panel displays a summary of all network connections the active tab has engaged with since loading.

### What You See in the Popup Panel

- **Hostname and Domain**: The panel shows the main site’s hostname and its registered domain, helping you identify the page you are analyzing.
- **Domains Connected Summary**: A real-time count of distinct remote domains the page connected to.
- **Connection Outcomes Sections**:
  - **Not Blocked**: Domains from which resources were successfully fetched.
  - **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains where connections were redirected or modified stealthily by your content blocker.
  - **Blocked**: Domains where requests were explicitly blocked or failed.

Each domain entry is accompanied by a request count, showing how many attempts or connections were made.

<Info>
The badge number on the toolbar icon corresponds to the count of distinct *not blocked* third-party domains the page contacted. A lower number generally signals fewer third-party connections and often better privacy.
</Info>

## Step 3: Interpret Badge and Popup Data

### Using the Badge

- If the badge shows **0 or is empty**, your active tab made no distinct third-party connections.
- A **higher number** indicates multiple third-party domains were connected, which might impact privacy or load times.

### Using the Popup

- **Quickly assess** which remote servers are involved and whether they were allowed or blocked.
- **Spot stealth-blocked domains**, which represent requests that were affected in ways invisible to some blockers.

### Real-World Example

Say you visit example.com and see a badge count of 8. Opening the popup, you discover that 5 domains were allowed, 2 stealth-blocked, and 1 fully blocked. This insight helps you understand your exposure and the effectiveness of your content blocker instantly.

## Practical Tips for Your First Use

- Reload or navigate to a new tab and watch the badge update dynamically.
- Use the popup list to identify potential unwanted third-party trackers or ad servers.
- Compare different sites’ badge counts to gauge their network footprint.

<Tip>
You can immediately start evaluating the number and nature of third-party connections on any page — no setup beyond installation is needed.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Quickstart Troubleshooting">
  <Accordion title="The uBO Scope icon doesn't show or respond">If the toolbar icon doesn’t appear, verify the extension is enabled in your browser extension manager, and your browser supports required background permissions.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Badge count is not updating or zero on sites with many resources">Some network requests might not be captured if the website uses obscure protocols or if browser APIs are restricted. Refresh the page and check your browser version supports the latest content blocking APIs.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Popup panel shows 'NO DATA'">This typically means no network activity has been tracked yet, possibly because the tab just loaded or cursor focus is elsewhere. Reload the page and try again.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
