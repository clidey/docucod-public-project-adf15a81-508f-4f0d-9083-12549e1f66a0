# Features at a Glance

## Unlock Complete Transparency Into Your Network Connections

uBO Scope is designed to bring you full visibility of all network connections initiated by your active browser tab. Whether a connection was allowed, blocked, or concealed through stealth blocking, uBO Scope reveals this clearly in its intuitive popup interface and toolbar badges — no complex setup needed.

### What You See — and Why It Matters

- **Full Tracking of Network Requests:** Every network connection made by the active webpage, successful or otherwise, is tracked.
- **Clear Outcome Categorization:** Domains are distinguished by outcome — _allowed_, _blocked_, or _stealth-blocked_ — so you immediately understand what your browser is connecting to.
- **Informative Badge Counts:** The toolbar badge dynamically displays the number of distinct third-party domains successfully connected, encouraging you to keep this count low for better privacy.
- **Content Blocker Agnostic:** Works independently of any installed content blockers, reflecting true network activity even when other layers of blocking are present.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Seamlessly supports Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari, offering consistent insights no matter your platform.

## How Features Surface in the User Interface

### The Popup Panel

When you click the uBO Scope icon, a panel opens, breaking down network connections into three distinct sections:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Shows domains your browser successfully connected to, along with badge counts for how many times connections occurred.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Lists domains where connections were stealthily redirected or otherwise silently blocked, helping you detect hidden filtering.
- **Blocked:** Displays hosts where connections failed due to explicit blocking or errors.

Each section lists domains neatly with real counts, enabling granular understanding and quick assessments.

### Toolbar Icon Badge

The numeric badge on the toolbar icon is a powerful at-a-glance summary:

- Indicates the _number of distinct third-party remote domains_ your browser connected to for the current tab.
- A lower badge count means fewer third-party connections, a key indicator of improved privacy and reduced third-party tracking.
- This count reflects actual network traffic regardless of other content blockers' block counts or configurations.

## Real-World Scenario: Assessing a News Website

Imagine visiting a major news outlet. Without uBO Scope, you only see the page. With uBO Scope open:

- The popup shows **allowed** third-party domains like content delivery networks (CDNs) that deliver images and scripts.
- You notice a few stealth-blocked domains, indicating some trackers were silently blocked.
- Blocked domains confirm that certain ads or trackers were explicitly prevented from loading.
- The toolbar badge number gives you a quick sense of how many distinct third parties were involved in the page load.

This transparency empowers you to validate if your content blocker setup is effectively limiting unwanted connections.

## Practical Tips to Maximize Value

- **Regularly check the popup after loading important sites** to understand all third-party activity.
- **Monitor your badge counts over time** — unusually high counts may signal additional tracking or changed site behavior.
- **Use stealth-blocked listings** to uncover trackers that operate beneath conventional blocking layers.
- **Cross-verify with installed content blockers** to debunk misleading block count claims and understand true network exposure.

## Why uBO Scope's Features Matter

- It is the **only reliable way to see every network connection outcome** your browser processes, bypassing guesswork around content blockers.
- By highlighting stealth-blocked domains, it **exposes hidden filtering mechanics** that typical tools miss.
- The **badge count’s focus on distinct remote domains** is a meaningful privacy metric far superior to opaque block counts.
- Its **independent operation across browsers** lets you maintain consistent network awareness regardless of platform.


## Exploring the Popup UI: Structure and Flow

The popup panel organizes data intuitively:

  B --> D[Stealth-Blocked Domains Section]
  B --> E[Blocked Domains Section]
  C -.-> F[Count of Allowed Domains]
  D -.-> G[Count of Stealth Domains]
  E -.-> H[Count of Blocked Domains]

## Getting Started Preview

To explore these features yourself:

1. **Install uBO Scope** from your browser's official extension store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Safari Gallery).
2. **Click the uBO Scope icon** in your toolbar after loading any webpage.
3. **Review the popup panel** to see allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains per tab.
4. **Watch the badge count** as sites load to monitor your distinct third-party connections.

For detailed installation and quickstart instructions, refer to [Quickstart: Your First Minute with uBO Scope](../feature-summary/quickstart-experience).

## Troubleshooting

If the popup shows 'NO DATA' or a zero count unexpectedly:

- Ensure you have uBO Scope properly installed and enabled.
- Check that your browser supports the `webRequest` API; some private browsing modes or restrictive settings may block this access.
- Reload the page and open the popup again to refresh connection data.

For further assistance, consult [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](../../getting-started/first-use-and-validation/troubleshooting-setup).
