# Key Concepts and Terminology

Understanding the fundamental terms used throughout uBO Scope's user interface and documentation is essential for effective use and accurate interpretation of its data. This page clarifies what uBO Scope measures, explains the terminology for different request outcomes, and ensures a shared vocabulary so users know exactly what the extension reports.

---

## What Is a Distinct Third-Party Remote Server?

A *distinct third-party remote server* represents any unique external server that your web browser attempts to connect with during browsing. These servers are considered "third-party" when they differ from the domain of the site you are visiting.

For example, when visiting `example.com`, connections to `cdn.example.com` are first-party (same site), while connections to `analytics.tracker.com` are third-party since it is a completely separate domain.

This concept is central because uBO Scope's badge count reports the number of such unique third-party servers involved, helping you gauge your privacy exposure and web resource loading.

---

## Badge Count Explained

The toolbar badge on the uBO Scope extension icon shows a **count of distinct third-party domains** with successful connections during the current browser tab session.

- A higher count means **more third-party remote connections**, often implying greater tracking or content loading from external sources.
- A lower count indicates **fewer third-party connections**, which is typically better for privacy and page speed.

> **Important:** Do not confuse the badge count with the total number of network requests. Many requests can go to the same domain, but only unique domains are counted.

## Network Request Outcomes in uBO Scope

uBO Scope categorizes every network request observed into three distinct outcomes for clarity and analysis:

| Outcome Type   | Description                                                                 | What It Means for You                                         |
| --------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Allowed**   | The request to a third-party server was successful and not blocked.           | Resources were fetched from these servers; part of page load. |
| **Blocked**   | The request was blocked by content blocking mechanisms or failed to connect. | These servers did not deliver content to the page.            |
| **Stealth**   | Redirect or stealth blocking happened, hiding the request from detection.    | Requests intercepted or redirected to hide tracking or avoid detection by the website. |

### Allowed Requests

These are the network requests that completed successfully. They represent real third-party connections that your browser made and the page used resources from.

### Blocked Requests

Requests that were blocked or failed (e.g., DNS block, extension block, or network error). These represent servers that the browser tried to connect with but were prevented, enhancing your privacy or performance.

### Stealth Requests

These indicate requests that were manipulated—usually redirected or stealthily blocked—to prevent detection by websites trying to track or measure content blocking.

This category is critical in debunking common myths about ad blocker effectiveness by revealing how blocking might happen without obvious counts.

## What Is the WebRequest API?

uBO Scope uses the browser's native **webRequest API** to observe and classify all network requests initiated by webpages in real time.

This API:
- Notifies the extension of every network request's lifecycle event: when it starts, redirects, fails, or succeeds.
- Enables uBO Scope to gather data regardless of which content blocker or DNS-level filtering is applied.

Because it operates at this deep browser level, uBO Scope can provide an accurate picture of actual network activity rather than relying on webpage-level heuristics or indirect signals.

---

## Why Is This Terminology Important?

Ensuring everyone speaks the same language is vital to:

- Accurately understand what uBO Scope reports and how to act on it.
- Avoid misinterpreting badge counts or blocked request data.
- Discuss findings with other privacy-conscious users and filter list maintainers with clarity.

Using these terms consistently throughout documentation and the UI guarantees that the insights you gain from uBO Scope reflect reality, empowering you to make informed decisions about privacy, filtering, and browsing security.

---

## Practical Example: Reading the Popup Data

When you open the uBO Scope popup while browsing a page, you see a summary of third-party connections:

- A total count of all distinct third-party domains connected.
- Lists divided into **not blocked (allowed)**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** domains.

For instance, if the badge shows "5", the popup will detail exactly which five third-party domains were contacted successfully (allowed), which ones were stealth-blocked, and which were explicitly blocked.

This helps you immediately understand the third-party landscape of your current browsing context.

---

## Tips for Success

- Understand that not all third-party servers are malicious or harmful; many legitimate services (like CDNs) are common.
- Use badge count as a privacy indicator, aiming for lower counts on sensitive browsing.
- Recognize stealth requests as subtle blocking mechanisms that keep more accurate track of what happens behind the scenes.
- Familiarize yourself with the distinction between hostnames and domains to interpret lists correctly—uBO Scope aggregates counts by **domains**.

## Troubleshooting Common Misunderstandings

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions about Terminology">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count differ from the number of requests I see elsewhere?">
The badge count reflects distinct third-party domains with *successful* connections, *not* the total number of all requests. Multiple requests to the same domain count only once.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What exactly are stealth requests and why do they matter?">
Stealth requests represent ways content blockers avoid detection by redirecting or hiding network request outcomes to websites, ensuring blocking is effective yet undetectable. They can reduce the apparent 'blocked' count but indicate effective privacy protection.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope see every network request?">
No. uBO Scope relies on the browser's webRequest API. Some network requests made outside standard browser protocols or via service workers may not be visible to uBO Scope.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are all third-party servers dangerous?">
No. Many third-party servers belong to content delivery networks (CDNs) and essential service providers. uBO Scope helps you differentiate how many unique third parties a page connects to but does not label them as good or bad.
</Accordion>
