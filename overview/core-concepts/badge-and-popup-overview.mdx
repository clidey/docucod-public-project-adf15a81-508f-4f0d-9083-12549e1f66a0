# Badge & Popup: Immediate Insights

## Understand Your Web Connections at a Glance

When browsing the web, your browser often connects to multiple remote servers, some of which belong to first-party sites, others to third-party services. uBO Scope transforms this complex network activity into clear, immediate insights through its toolbar badge and popup panel. These UI elements provide a concise summary of the distinct third-party connections your current tab has made — empowering you to quickly understand privacy impacts, track unwanted connections, and dive deeper when needed.

## What You See: The Badge and Popup Panel

### Toolbar Badge: Your Instant Privacy Metric

At the forefront is the toolbar badge, a small but powerful numeric indicator displayed on uBO Scope's extension icon. This badge shows **the number of unique third-party remote servers successfully connected to by the active tab**. Unlike simple block counts, this figure reveals the *actual distinct external servers* for which network communication occurred.

- **Why unique third-party servers?**
  Because a single third-party server may handle many resource requests, the badge filters out duplicate connections from cluttering your view.
- **Lower is better:**
  A smaller count indicates fewer external remote servers your tab communicated with, aligning with better privacy practices.

> The badge count **does not** display raw request counts or block counts — it delivers meaningful information showing *successful* distinct third-party connections only.


### Popup Panel: Detailed Breakdown on Demand

Clicking the extension icon opens the popup panel, which expands on the badge insight with a categorized domain list:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains your browser connected to successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were silently intercepted or redirected by content blockers or browser features.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts failed due to explicit blocking.

Each category lists the domains and the number of times each was encountered, arming you with a clearer picture of your browsing footprint.

### Relevance of the Categorization

This UI setup reflects uBO Scope’s core mission of transparency:

- **Not Blocked domains** represent the actual third-parties your browser communicated with, impacting your privacy.
- **Stealth-Blocked domains** highlight potentially hidden blocking behavior that may evade typical detection.
- **Blocked domains** show content that was attempted but prevented from loading.

This categorization offers both breadth and granularity so you can identify and verify the effectiveness of your content blockers and privacy tools.

## Why This Matters: Beyond Block Counts

Traditional content blockers often display how many requests they blocked, but these block counts can be misleading when assessing privacy or security:

- A higher block count might mean more requests were made, but not necessarily better blocking performance.
- Conversely, a lower number of distinct connected third-party servers truly indicates fewer external points of contact.

uBO Scope's badge addresses this nuance, focusing on *distinct* third-party servers that had successful connections, regardless of how many individual requests were made.

This gives you a more accurate and understandable metric of your exposure to third-party tracking or data leakage.

Keeping the badge count low helps maintain a tighter privacy boundary by reducing your browser’s network exposure.

## How the Badge & Popup Work Together

The badge offers a quick, actionable summary — a privacy compass at a glance. When you want more context:

- Open the popup panel for a detailed connection outcome breakdown.
- See which domains are allowed through and which are blocked or stealthily handled.
- Use this information to identify unexpected connections or to validate your filter lists and blockers.

This seamless UI flow fits naturally into a user’s browsing routine: quick awareness from the badge, deeper inspection on demand.

## Real-World User Workflow

1. **Start browsing a site:** The toolbar badge updates dynamically with the distinct count of third-party servers contacted.
2. **Notice a high badge count:** Maybe on a site you expect to be privacy-friendly.
3. **Click the extension icon:** The popup reveals which domains are active under the hood.
4. **Analyze connection types:** Is a stealth-blocker in action? Are unexpected domains appearing in the allowed list?
5. **Take action:** Adjust your content blocker settings, report suspicious domains, or simply gain reassurance about your current setup.

This flow turns complex network data into empowered decision-making.

## Practical Tips for Maximizing Insight

- **Watch the badge frequently:** It reacts live as you browse; a sudden spike can hint at embedded third-party content loading.
- **Understand domain relationships:** Recognize common CDNs or service providers to distinguish harmless from potentially risky domains.
- **Use the popup as a diagnostic tool:** Regularly inspect domains in each category to ensure your blockers are functioning as expected.
- **Remember the badge resets per tab:** This ensures context-specific insights relevant to the page you are currently viewing.

## Troubleshooting Common UI Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common FAQs and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge sometimes show zero even on complex sites?">
The badge counts distinct third-party servers with successful connections on the current tab. If your content blockers or browser block many requests or if the site has very few third parties, the count can be zero.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does stealth-blocked mean in the popup list?">
Stealth blocking refers to connections that were blocked or redirected silently by content blockers or browser mechanisms without raising obvious errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some domains appear in both allowed and blocked categories?">
Domains can have requests with different outcomes - some requests might pass through successfully, others get blocked or stealthily handled.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How often does the badge update?">
The badge updates approximately every second to reflect recent network activity in the active tab, providing near real-time feedback.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can the badge count be trusted as a privacy score?">
While not a score, the badge is a valuable indicator of distinct external connections, giving you direct insight into your exposure footprint.
</Accordion>

## Summary

The toolbar badge and popup panel are your frontline tools in understanding the complex web of third-party connections your browser makes on each tab. By focusing on the number of unique third-party remote servers connected, rather than raw request or block counts, uBO Scope provides you a meaningful, actionable privacy metric.

This UI duo transforms opaque network activity into transparent, trustworthy data that supports your privacy goals and bolsters confidence in your content blockers.
