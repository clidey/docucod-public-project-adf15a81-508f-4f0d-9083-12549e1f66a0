# Integration and Extension Compatibility

## Understanding uBO Scope's Role in the Browser Ecosystem

As you integrate uBO Scope into your browsing environment, it's essential to understand how it fits alongside other content blockers and system-level DNS filtering. This page explains the boundaries of uBO Scope’s capabilities, its interaction with other blockers, and the supported platforms for seamless operation.

---

## Why Integration Matters

Users often run multiple layers of privacy and content-blocking solutions simultaneously—such as uBlock Origin, other extensions, or even system-level DNS filters—to maximize control over web content and connections. uBO Scope is designed to **work alongside these tools without conflict**, reporting on network requests independently by leveraging the browser’s `webRequest` API.

This setup enables you to:

- Gain transparent, **unbiased visibility** into all remote server connections regardless of active blockers.
- Verify the **actual outcome** of network requests beyond what a specific blocker claims.
- Debunk common misconceptions based on block counts or synthetic ad-blocker tests.


## How uBO Scope Works With Other Content Blockers

uBO Scope itself is a monitoring and reporting companion tool and **does not block or interfere** with network requests. Instead, it:

- Listens to browser network events using the `webRequest` API.
- Records outcomes of requests as **allowed**, **blocked**, or **stealth-blocked**.
- Aggregates and surfaces data in the popup interface for your review.

This independence means:

- If you run uBlock Origin or another blocker alongside uBO Scope, both coexist peacefully without overlap in function.
- uBO Scope reports the **final state of network requests**, reflecting any blocking or filtering already in place.
- Data from uBO Scope remains reliable even when DNS filtering or system-level network controls prevent some requests.


## Interaction with System-Level DNS Filtering

System-wide DNS filters, such as those configured in your operating system or router, can block network requests before they reach the browser. uBO Scope captures network request outcomes reported **only by the browser**, so:

- Requests blocked by DNS filtering **may not appear** in uBO Scope's reports if the browser never attempts the connection.
- However, if the browser reports an error or failed request due to DNS-level blocking through the `webRequest` API, uBO Scope will note it as **blocked**.
- uBO Scope's insight complements system-level filtering but focuses on what actually **passes through or is intercepted by the browser**.


## Supported Platforms and Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope is fully supported on the following platforms, reflecting its reliance on browser APIs and manifest configurations:

| Browser Platform | Notes |
|------------------|-------|
| Chromium (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.) | Supports both HTTP and WebSocket protocols; uses service workers in manifest v3.
| Firefox and Firefox Android | Supports HTTP and WebSocket; requires Firefox 128.0 or newer.
| Safari | Limited to HTTP protocols due to platform constraints; requires Safari 18.5 or newer.


### Platform-Specific Permissions and Limitations

| Platform | Host Permissions | WebSocket Support | Manifest Details |
|----------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Chromium | http://*/*, https://*/*, ws://*/*, wss://*/* | Full support | Manifest v3 with service_worker background script.
| Firefox | http://*/*, https://*/*, ws://*/*, wss://*/* | Full support | Manifest v3 with background scripts.
| Safari | http://*/*, https://*/* | No WebSocket support | Manifest v3 with background scripts.


## Integration Boundaries: What uBO Scope Does NOT Do

To set clear expectations, uBO Scope:

- **Does not block or modify network requests**. It only measures and reports them.
- **Cannot report on network activity outside the browser scope**, such as network traffic by other applications or browser internals bypassing the `webRequest` API.
- **Does not replace full content-blocking extensions**; it is best used as a diagnostic and validation companion to blockers like uBlock Origin.


## Practical Tips for Optimizing Your Setup

- Run uBO Scope **alongside your primary content blocker** to validate which third-party connections are genuinely blocked vs. allowed.
- Use uBO Scope to detect the **effectiveness of system-level DNS filters**, understanding which requests are truly blocked before reaching the browser.
- Regularly check the popup interface for insights into the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted per page.
- Understand that a **lower badge count in uBO Scope means fewer third-party connections**, which is desirable for privacy and bandwidth savings.


## Troubleshooting Common Integration Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions About Integration">
<Accordion title="Why don't I see some network requests in uBO Scope?">
Requests blocked by system-level DNS filtering or those that never reach the browser's networking stack will not be visible to uBO Scope. This limitation is due to the extension's reliance on the browser `webRequest` API. If the network request is never initiated in the browser, it won't appear in reports.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope cause conflicts with other extensions?">
uBO Scope is designed solely for observation and reporting, not blocking, so it does not conflict with content blockers or other extensions manipulating network traffic.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are WebSocket requests always tracked?">
WebSocket requests are tracked on Chromium and Firefox platforms, but Safari currently does not support the necessary APIs for monitoring WebSocket connections.
</Accordion>

## Summary

uBO Scope provides clear visibility into network request outcomes as reported by the browser, irrespective of other content blockers or system-level filtering. It acts as a transparent observer that complements your existing privacy and security layers, without blocking or interfering with traffic.

This understanding ensures you can better interpret the connection summaries in uBO Scope, optimize your protection strategies, and effectively diagnose the behavior of multiple filtering layers in your browsing environment.
