# Key Terms and Concepts in uBO Scope

Understanding the terminology used in uBO Scope is essential for interpreting its connection reports accurately and effectively. This page explains the critical terms like **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth-blocked** requests, what constitutes a **third-party remote server**, and why these distinctions matter for your network privacy insights.

---

## Overview

uBO Scope categorizes network requests initiated by webpages into distinct groups to help you understand exactly which connections are occurring, which are blocked, and which are stealth-blocked — a nuanced status unique to uBO Scope’s observation capabilities.

These terms convey actionable insights into how your browser interacts with remote servers, which affects privacy, security, and the transparency of resource loading.

## Core Terminology

### Allowed Requests

- **Definition:** These are network requests successfully completed without interference or blocking.
- **Why It Matters:** Allowed requests indicate the third-party and first-party servers your browser connected to and fetched resources from.
- **Usage:** The extension counts unique domains in this category to inform you about the number of distinct servers legitimately contacted.

### Blocked Requests

- **Definition:** Requests that were explicitly prevented from completing, typically by content blocking mechanisms active in your browser.
- **Why It Matters:** This provides an indication of the servers or resources your blocking rules have intercepted or prevented.
- **Note:** A higher count here does not necessarily mean better blocking—it may imply more attempts to contact diverse servers.

### Stealth-Blocked Requests

- **Definition:** Requests that appear to be blocked by content blockers but are hidden from webpages or report mechanisms to avoid detection.
- **Why It Matters:** This category captures stealth blocking behavior commonly employed by advanced content blocking extensions to remain undetectable by websites.
- **Value:** Helps debunk misleading metrics from ad blocker test pages that don’t capture stealth blocking.

### Third-Party Remote Servers

- **Definition:** Any remote server contacted by a webpage that is different from the primary domain of the current page.
- **Why It Matters:** Tracking third-party servers is crucial for privacy analysis because these domains often deliver ads, trackers, or analytics.
- **Example:** When visiting `example.com`, a connection to `cdn.example.net` qualifies as third-party.

## Why These Distinctions Are Crucial

uBO Scope focuses on **distinct remote server connections**, not merely counting requests or blocks. This subtle distinction helps users and developers:

- **Gain Accurate Visibility:** Understand which servers are ultimately contacted versus just which requests are blocked.
- **Avoid Misleading Metrics:** Recognize that a high block count alone is not a reliable indicator of effectiveness.
- **Identify Stealth Techniques:** Detect stealth blocking which might otherwise hide from traditional network logs.

---

## How uBO Scope Uses These Terms

When you open the uBO Scope popup, you will see the domains sorted into three sections:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains and requests that succeeded without blocking.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where blocking occurred quietly, without webpage awareness.
- **Blocked:** Domains where blocking was detected and reported explicitly.

Each section displays the distinct domains contacted along with a count of network requests, providing you with an intuitive snapshot of network activity.

---

## Practical Example

Imagine you visit a news site where:

- The main domain (`news.example.com`) loads completely.
- Several requests to ad networks (`ads.tracker.net`) are blocked.
- Some connections to analytics providers (`analytics.stealthblock.com`) are stealth-blocked.

In uBO Scope,

- You will see `news.example.com` under **Not Blocked**.
- `ads.tracker.net` under **Blocked**.
- `analytics.stealthblock.com` under **Stealth-Blocked**.

This clear categorization demonstrates the effectiveness and behavior of your content blocking setup much more transparently than block counts or generic network logs.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Focus on Domain Counts:** The badge count reflects unique third-party domains accessed, not total requests or blocks—aim for a lower number here for better privacy.
- **Don’t Rely on Block Counts Alone:** A high block count might indicate multiple connection attempts to many domains, not necessarily superior blocking.
- **Understand Stealth Blocking:** Knowing stealth blocking exists helps contextualize why some requests might not appear blocked on web pages or in simpler tools.
- **Use as a Learning Tool:** Analyze the network domains grouped in each category to fine-tune your filter lists or validate blocking behavior.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Understanding the Reporting Categories">
  <Accordion title={'Why are some domains in "Allowed" even when I use a content blocker?'}>
    Sometimes content blockers allow certain domains, especially first-party or CDN domains, as blocking them may break website functionality. uBO Scope accurately reports what was actually connected, regardless of user filter settings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title={'What is the difference between "Blocked" and "Stealth-Blocked"?'}>
    "Blocked" means the blocking event was overt and observable, while "Stealth-Blocked" means the blocking was done quietly, hidden from the webpage, making it harder for sites to detect that blocking occurred.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does uBO Scope block content itself?">
    uBO Scope does not itself block requests; it reports the outcomes of network requests as observed through browser APIs and the active content blocking extensions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

By fully understanding these key terms and their roles in uBO Scope’s reporting, you gain an accurate lens into your browser’s network behavior, detect privacy leaks, and evaluate the true impact of content blocking techniques.
