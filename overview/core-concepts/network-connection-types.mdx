# Understanding Network Connections

## Overview

Every web page you visit involves connections to various remote servers. These connections can be categorized into two main types based on their relationship to the site you’re visiting:

- **First-party servers:** Servers that belong directly to the domain you are visiting.
- **Third-party servers:** Servers that belong to domains different from the one you’re visiting.

Understanding these distinctions is crucial to interpreting the connection data shown by uBO Scope and to grasp why some connections matter more than others.

## First-Party vs. Third-Party Servers

- **First-party servers** represent the core content provider for the website you are visiting. For example, if you visit `example.com`, connections to servers under `example.com` (or subdomains thereof) are considered first-party.

- **Third-party servers** are external domains that a webpage requests resources from, such as ads, analytics, CDNs, or embedded widgets. Continuing the example, if `example.com` loads content from `cdn.examplecdn.com` or `tracker.adnetwork.com`, these are third-party connections.

<u>Why this matters:</u>

- Third-party connections introduce external entities that can track, serve ads, or gather data across different websites.
- Monitoring third-party connections provides insight into your true network exposure beyond just the site you visit.

## How uBO Scope Counts Servers

uBO Scope breaks down remote connections into _distinct_ remote servers by counting unique domains and categorizing them accordingly. This counting is not simply a tally of requests, but identifies unique third-party servers that the browser connected to during page load.

- The count displayed on the extension's badge reflects the **number of distinct third-party remote servers that made at least one connection**.
- Allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked states reflect outcomes of these connections, but the badge count emphasizes unique allowed third-party domains.

### Example Scenario

Imagine visiting a news website:
- The main site server is first-party.
- The page loads images and scripts from the site’s CDN (considered first-party if it shares the same domain base).
- Ads are served from a known advertising network domain.
- Analytics data is sent to a tracking domain.

uBO Scope would count the advertising network and tracking domain as two distinct third-party connections. This reveals third-party exposure even if some content is blocked.

## Why Number of Unique Third-Parties Matters

Users often misinterpret block counts or total network requests as the true measure of exposure or privacy risk.

- **Block counts** show how many connection attempts were prevented but may not correlate directly to the number of unique third-party servers.
- A higher block count does not guarantee better privacy. It can mean the blocker detected many requests but the page may still connect to numerous third-party servers.
- **Unique third-party connection count** is a more accurate reflection of network exposure and potential tracking surface.

This is why uBO Scope focuses on the unique number of allowed third-party connections rather than simply block totals. It's the diversity and distinct entities connected to that impact privacy and security, not just the number of blocked requests.

## Common Misconceptions Clarified

### Misconception 1: "More blocks mean better blocking"  

In reality, a content blocker that shows a high number of blocks may still allow connections to many distinct third-party servers. uBO Scope helps debunk this by showing the actual number of remote servers connected to, not just blocked request counts.

### Misconception 2: "Ad blocker test sites accurately represent blocker effectiveness"  

Such test pages often perform unrealistic or artificial network requests that don’t reflect real-world web browsing. uBO Scope reports network requests made during actual browsing, offering a truthful overview.

## Practical Tips for Using uBO Scope

- Focus on the **badge count of unique third-party connections** to gauge your real network exposure.
- Use the detailed popup panel to review which domains are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- Understand that some third-party connections, such as those to CDNs, may be legitimate and necessary.
- Combine these insights with your content blocker settings for informed privacy management.

## Summary

uBO Scope provides a transparent view of web page network activity by revealing and counting unique, distinct remote servers connected to during browsing. Distinguishing between first-party and third-party servers and focusing on unique third-party connections helps users better assess privacy exposure beyond simplistic block counts and unreliable test metrics.

<Warning>
Do not rely solely on block counts or so-called "ad blocker tests" to measure content blocker effectiveness. Use uBO Scope’s unique connection data for a clearer picture.
