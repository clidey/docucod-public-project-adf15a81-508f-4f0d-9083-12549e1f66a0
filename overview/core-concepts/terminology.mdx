# Key Terms Explained

Understanding the fundamental terms used in uBO Scope is essential to fully grasp the insights provided by the extension. This page clarifies critical concepts such as ‘allowed domains,’ ‘blocked domains,’ ‘stealth domains,’ and the idea of a ‘third-party server.’ Knowing these terms anchors your comprehension when reviewing connection data in uBO Scope’s popup and badge indicators.

---

## Allowed Domains

- **Definition:** Allowed domains are those remote servers to which network connections were successful and not blocked by any content blocking mechanism.
- **What it means to you:** These domains represent the sources from which your browser actually fetched resources while loading or interacting with a webpage.
- **How uBO Scope tracks them:** Every network request your browser successfully completes to a distinct domain is counted and categorized under allowed.

**Example:** If you visit a news site and it loads images and scripts from `cdn.example.com` without interference, `cdn.example.com` will appear as an allowed domain.

---

## Blocked Domains

- **Definition:** Blocked domains are those remote servers for which network requests were attempted but ultimately failed due to blocking. Blocking can come from browser extensions, DNS-level filtering, or other content blocking methods.
- **Why this matters:** These domains represent connections your browser tried to initiate but were prevented, helping you identify which third-party servers are being filtered out.
- **Tracking method:** uBO Scope listens to browser network request outcomes and flags domains where requests resulted in error or blockage events.

**Practical Tip:** A high number of blocked domains might indicate aggressive filtering but does not necessarily mean better protection—what really matters is how many distinct allowed third-party servers remain.

---

## Stealth Domains

- **Definition:** Stealth domains are those involved in redirect events during network requests. These are intermediate servers where traffic passes through but may not be explicitly visible in normal browsing.
- **User impact:** Stealth connections reveal behind-the-scenes redirections or proxying which can affect privacy and security.
- **How uBO Scope reports them:** Redirect events flagged by the browser's network API are captured and domains involved are shown as stealth.

**Real-World Scenario:** Some ad trackers use stealth redirects to obscure their presence; uBO Scope surfaces these attempts enabling greater transparency.

---

## Third-Party Server

- **Explanation:** A third-party server is any remote domain that is different from the primary domain of the website you are visiting.
- **Why it matters:** These servers are typically used for content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics, advertising, or other external services.
- **Identification:** uBO Scope calculates the 'registrable domain' (see below) to determine if a domain is third-party relative to the main website.

**Concrete Example:** While visiting `news.example.com`, a connection to `ads.adnetwork.com` is a third-party connection since it belongs to a different domain.

---

## Domain vs. Hostname

- **Hostname:** The full domain name including subdomains, e.g., `images.cdn.example.com`.
- **Domain (Registrable Domain):** The main domain under which subdomains fall, typically obtained by removing known public suffixes, e.g. `example.com`.
- **uBO Scope usage:** The extension derives the registrable domain using the Public Suffix List to properly group requests and identify third parties.

---

## How Domains Are Derived and Grouped

uBO Scope uses the Public Suffix List (PSL) to extract meaningful domains from hostnames. This is crucial because a domain like `example.co.uk` behaves differently than `example.com` and grouping connections accurately enables better filtering and reporting.

- **Public Suffix List:** A maintained list of domain suffixes (e.g., `.com`, `.co.uk`) used to determine the registrable domain.
- **Effect:** This means that requests to `sub.example.co.uk` and `example.co.uk` are grouped under the same base domain.

## Summary of Term Relationships

| Term            | Meaning                                              | Importance                                   |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Allowed Domains | Domains where resource loading succeeded              | Shows sources that deliver content          |
| Blocked Domains | Domains where requests were prevented                 | Highlights filtered or blocked connections  |
| Stealth Domains | Domains involved in redirect chains                   | Exposes behind-the-scenes redirections      |
| Third-Party Server | Domains different from the main visited site       | Central to understanding privacy context    |
| Hostname        | Full domain including subdomains                       | Used to identify precise network endpoints  |
| Registrable Domain | The main domain deduced by PSL rules                | Groups connections to the same organizational entity |

## Why Understanding These Terms Matters

These key terms form the foundation to interpreting what uBO Scope reports:

- They **empower you** to distinguish between benign and potentially tracking or unwanted network connections.
- Understanding classifications helps **debunk misconceptions** about blocking effectiveness (see the value proposition).
- You gain clarity on the meaning of the **badge count** and popup listings that organize domains by connection outcomes.

By grounding your knowledge in these terms, you can effectively use uBO Scope to monitor your browser’s network activity with confidence and precision.

---

## Practical Tips for Users

- Regularly check the list of allowed domains to spot unexpected third parties.
- Use the blocked domains list to verify if your content blocker or security tools are working properly.
- Pay attention to stealth domains as they can indicate subtle redirects and proxying that might bypass typical blockers.
- Remember that not all third-party connections are harmful; many legitimate services use CDNs and external APIs.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Term Confusions">
<Accordion title="Why is a domain showing as both allowed and blocked?">
Some domains appear with mixed connection results because different requests to the same domain may succeed or fail depending on timing, resource type, or network conditions. uBO Scope reports counts reflecting all such events.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does uBO Scope differentiate third-party from first-party?">
uBO Scope compares the main tab’s registrable domain with connected domains using the Public Suffix List to accurately identify third parties instead of relying on naive substring matching.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does ‘stealth’ mean exactly in redirects?">
Redirects are network responses that lead browsers to request another URL. Stealth domains are those that appear only during such redirects, not always visible in the final resource load chain.
</Accordion>
