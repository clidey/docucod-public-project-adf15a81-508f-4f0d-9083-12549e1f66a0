# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the core terminology and key concepts behind uBO Scope is essential for effectively interpreting its reports and visual indicators. This page introduces important terms like **third-party server**, **allowed**, **blocked**, and **stealth-blocked**, explaining their precise meanings within uBO Scope's context. It also clarifies how these distinctions are reflected in the extension's popup interface and badge count.

---

## What Is a Third-Party Server?

In the context of uBO Scope, a **third-party server** is any remote server that a webpage connects to which does **not** belong to the main domain being visited by the user.

For example, if you visit `example.com` and the page loads an image from `cdn.examplecdn.com`, that server is considered third-party if it does not share the same base domain as `example.com`.

uBO Scope uses the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/list/) to precisely determine base domains, ensuring accurate identification of third parties by resolving complex domain structures and suffixes.

---

## Connection Outcomes: Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth-Blocked

uBO Scope categorizes every observed network connection based on its outcome:

- **Allowed (not blocked):**
  These are connections to third-party servers that succeeded. They represent external resources your browser has fetched.

- **Blocked:**
  These connections were explicitly blocked by a content blocker based on filter rules or network errors indicating the blocking. Resources from these domains never loaded.

- **Stealth-Blocked:**
  Certain connections are blocked in a way that makes it indistinguishable from a successful connection from the viewpoint of the webpage itself. This stealth blocking avoids detection by scripts on the page that try to find out if resources were blocked.

This distinction is crucial for understanding how your content blocking setup behaves. Stealth-blocked connections, for example, confirm that blocking is happening quietly, preventing anti-adblock detection by sites.

## How uBO Scope Reports and Visualizes These Outcomes

### The Popup Interface

When you click the uBO Scope toolbar icon, the popup displays a detailed breakdown of all third-party servers contacted by the current active tab. The UI organizes data into three distinct sections:

- **Not Blocked:**
  Lists all allowed third-party domains successfully connected to.

- **Stealth-Blocked:**
  Shows third-party domains where requests were stealth-blocked.

- **Blocked:**
  Contains domains whose requests were blocked outright.

Each section lists domains along with the count of connection attempts made during the current browsing session.

Example of domain listing in each section:

```html
<section class="outcome allowed">
    <h3>not blocked</h3>
    <div class="domains">
        <div class="row"><span class="domain">cdn.example.com</span><span class="count badge">12</span></div>
        <!-- more rows -->
    </div>
</section>
```

### The Toolbar Badge

The toolbar icon badge displays a **single number** representing the count of **distinct third-party remote servers from which connections have been allowed (not blocked)**. 

This count offers a quick, at-a-glance view of a page's external exposure.

> **Important:** A lower badge count is generally preferable as it means fewer external third parties are contacted, potentially increasing privacy and performance.

---

## Domain Resolution and Grouping

To avoid confusion and clutter, uBO Scope aggregates connection counts by domain rather than by individual subdomains or hostnames.

For instance, connections to `ads.tracker.example.com` and `cdn.example.com` are grouped under their base domains as identified via the Public Suffix List, ensuring meaningful and accurate reporting.

By using this approach, uBO Scope ensures you see the big picture without being lost in domain intricacies.

---

## Practical Tips for Users

- **Interpreting the Badge:** Remember, it counts only allowed domains. Blocked or stealth-blocked domains do not add to the badge number.
- **Reviewing the Popup:** Use the popup to investigate which domains are blocked and which are allowed, helping you understand your current content blocker’s effectiveness.
- **Stealth Blocking Insight:** Domains listed under stealth-blocked are quietly blocked to avoid detection, which can be important to prevent site anti-blocker tactics.
- **Session Scope:** Data shown refers to the current browsing session of the active tab and updates dynamically with network activity.

## Common Scenarios and User Workflows

### Scenario 1: Evaluating Privacy Exposure on a Website

1. Navigate to a site.
2. Click the uBO Scope icon.
3. Observe the badge count indicating the number of third-party domains allowed.
4. Open the popup;
   - View ‘not blocked’ third parties to assess which external domains are contacted.
   - Check ‘blocked’ and ‘stealth-blocked’ sections for domains prevented from loading.
5. Use this data to decide if you want to tweak your content filter lists or block additional domains.

### Scenario 2: Diagnosing Unexpected Content Loading

If you notice content or trackers loading:

- Use uBO Scope's popup to identify allowed third-party domains.
- Investigate domains in the ‘not blocked’ section that you expected to be blocked.
- Adjust your filters accordingly or debug your content blocking setup.
