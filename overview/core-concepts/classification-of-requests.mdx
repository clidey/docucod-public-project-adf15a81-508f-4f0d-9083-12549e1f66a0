# Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth-Blocked

## Understanding How uBO Scope Classifies Network Requests

When you use uBO Scope, the network activity you observe for any webpage is presented with precise categorizations: **Allowed**, **Blocked**, and **Stealth-Blocked**. This page explains what these categories mean, why they matter, and how they reflect the real state of network connections regardless of which content blockers or filtering mechanisms are active in your browser.

---

## Why Classification Matters

Webpages routinely make numerous network requests to various remote servers — some necessary, some third-party, and others optionally blocked by privacy or content filtering tools. Understanding the outcome of each request is critical to determine exactly which connections were successfully established and which were prevented, revealing the true nature of web traffic.

The classification system in uBO Scope provides an unfiltered view of network requests, independent of blockers, DNS filtering, or browser quirks.

## What Are Allowed, Blocked, and Stealth-Blocked Requests?

### Allowed Requests

- **Definition:** Network requests that successfully reached remote servers and received a response.
- **What This Means for You:** These are the connections your browser made and resources it received, reflecting real data loads from external sites.
- **Example:** A webpage fetching images from a content delivery network (CDN) or loading JavaScript from a trusted third party.

### Blocked Requests

- **Definition:** Requests that were actively prevented from reaching the remote server by content blockers or due to errors during fetching.
- **What This Means for You:** These connections were stopped; no data was loaded or received.
- **Example:** An ad tracker or known malicious domain blocked by your content blocker before any network traffic occurred.

### Stealth-Blocked Requests

- **Definition:** A special class of requests that were redirected or suppressed in ways that make the block invisible or stealthy to the webpage but detectable by uBO Scope.
- **What This Means for You:** These requests never completed successfully but appear differently than outright blocked requests. Stealth-blocking techniques often circumvent detection by webpages to avoid breakage or reveal blocking.
- **Example:** A request silently redirected to a local fallback or dropped without browser errors, commonly used by advanced content blockers to reduce website breakage.

## How uBO Scope Detects and Categorizes Requests

uBO Scope leverages browser APIs (primarily the `webRequest` API) to listen and record real network events including success, failures, and redirects. It monitors the entire lifecycle of requests and logs their outcomes accurately, regardless of the presence or type of content blocking.

When a request is initiated by the browser, uBO Scope tracks:

- **The URL and hostname of the remote server requested**
- **The event outcome:** success, error, or redirect event
- **The frame and tab context:** distinguishing main and sub-requests

By doing so, uBO Scope builds a comprehensive map of all network activity grouped by whether connections were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.

## Visualizing Request Categories In Real Scenarios

| Category        | Description              | Real World Example                                 |
|-----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Allowed         | Successful connection    | Loading images from `cdn.example.com`              |
| Blocked         | Request stopped outright | Ad servers like `ads.tracker.com` blocked          |
| Stealth-Blocked | Redirected or invisible block | Requests redirected internally to avoid detection |

This classification helps users and filter maintainers understand what third-party domains the browser actually connected to, what was blocked, and which requests were silently blocked to maintain website functionality.

## Practical Tips for Using This Classification

- **Use the "Allowed" list to verify true exposures:** A lower count of allowed third-party domains generally means better privacy.
- **Review blocked domains to audit content filter effectiveness:** Understanding what your blocker stops helps fine-tune rules.
- **Pay special attention to stealth-blocked domains:** These may indicate more subtle filtering that doesn’t manifest as errors but still protects your privacy.
- **Remember:** A high number of blocked or stealth-blocked requests does *not* necessarily mean better blocking; what truly matters is the count of allowed third-party connections.

## Troubleshooting Common Misunderstandings

<AccordionGroup title="Common Misunderstandings About Request Classification">
<Accordion title="Is a higher blocked count always better?">
No. A higher block count may correlate with allowing connections to more unique third-party servers overall. Focus instead on the allowed connections count to understand real exposure.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some requests show as stealth-blocked instead of blocked?">
Many content blockers use stealth techniques to avoid webpage breakage and detection. This results in redirected or suppressed requests that don’t trigger error events but never succeed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are all blocked requests caused by content blockers?">
Not always. Some blocked requests can result from network errors, DNS failures, or policies outside content blocking.

## Getting Started with Connection Classification

1. **Install and activate uBO Scope** as described in the [Installation & Setup](../../getting-started/installation-overview/browser-installation) guide.
2. **Browse your favorite sites** and open the uBO Scope popup to see how requests are classified.
3. **Use the allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked sections** to audit your network exposure and content blocker effectiveness.
