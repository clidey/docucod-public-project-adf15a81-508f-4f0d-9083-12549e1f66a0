# Features at a Glance

Discover what makes uBO Scope an essential tool for anyone seeking clarity and control over their browser's network connections. This page distills uBO Scope’s essential features into actionable insights, showcasing the extension’s power in transparency, measurement accuracy, and utility for privacy-focused users and filter list maintainers alike.

## Core Capabilities

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**  
  uBO Scope is built to support major browsers including Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari. This ensures that users enjoy consistent functionality and experience regardless of their preferred platform.

- **Comprehensive and Transparent Network Connection Reporting**  
  The extension reveals *all* network connections initiated by webpages — both those allowed and those blocked by content blockers or DNS filtering. This transparency lets users confidently understand exactly what servers their browser interacts with.

- **Unbiased Measurement of Third-Party Connections**  
  uBO Scope's toolbar badge shows the precise number of *distinct third-party domains* successfully connected to, delivering a clearer privacy metric. This metric is immune to misleading block counts and ad blocker test webpage traps.

- **Session-Based Tracking and Data Persistence**  
  Each browser tab session tracks allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked connections independently. This granular data management provides users with detailed insights while maintaining accurate session state even as tabs are opened and closed.

- **Myth-Busting and Reliable Insights**  
  Through its transparent reporting and classification of connections, uBO Scope debunks common misconceptions around block counts and test page results. Users gain clarity on what truly matters for privacy and content blocking effectiveness.

- **Support for Filter List Maintainers**  
  By exposing network request outcomes beyond the reach of typical browser tools, uBO Scope empowers filter list maintainers with actionable data to improve blocker rules and strategies.

## Visibility in the User Interface

- **Toolbar Badge**: Displays a live count of distinct allowed third-party domains per tab, providing immediate privacy insights.

- **Popup Panel**: Presents categorized lists of connected domains, separated into "Not Blocked", "Stealth-Blocked", and "Blocked" groups, along with their respective request counts.

  - This detailed breakdown supports quick understanding and troubleshooting of connection outcomes within each active tab.

- **Real-Time Updates**: The popup dynamically reflects the current state of network connections, updating as pages load or change.

---

## Underlying Files and Components

- **Manifest Files (`manifest.json`)**: Manage cross-browser extension metadata and permissions, ensuring compatibility and proper API access.

- **Background Script (`background.js`)**: Monitors all network requests using `webRequest` API listeners, categorizes outcomes, persists session data, and updates the badge count.

- **Popup Script (`popup.js`)**: Retrieves tab-specific recorded data and renders the categorized domain lists in the extension popup interface.

- **Supporting Libraries**: Handles serialization/deserialization, public suffix list parsing for domain extraction, and Unicode domain name decoding (Punycode). These provide accurate domain analysis and internationalized domain name support.

- **User Interface (`popup.html` and `popup.css`)**: Defines the structured, clean popup layout and styling for intuitive browsing of connection data.

## Practical Examples

### Seeing the Badge in Action
While browsing a site, the uBO Scope badge at the toolbar updates to show how many unique third-party domains your browser connected to. For example, a lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections, signaling tighter privacy controls in effect.

### Exploring the Popup Details
Click the extension icon to open the popup panel. Here you find:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains your browser connected to successfully.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where requests were silently blocked, without visible evidence to the page.
- **Blocked:** Domains with failed connection requests detected.

This breakdown helps instantly identify what third parties were contacted, which were blocked, and the effectiveness of your privacy tools.

---

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Always check the badge count as a privacy indicator rather than raw block counts.** A lower count means fewer third-party connections, which correlates with stronger privacy.

- **Use the popup details when investigating unexpected connections or troubleshooting filter lists.** The categorized lists make it easy to spot anomalies.

- **Keep your browser updated to maintain compatibility.** uBO Scope requires browser versions supporting Manifest V3 and `webRequest` API.

- **Regularly update your filter lists and privacy configurations alongside using uBO Scope.** The extension aids in verifying their effectiveness.

## Notes on Technology

- uBO Scope uses the browser `webRequest` API exclusively, ensuring no interference with active content blockers while passively measuring connection outcomes.

- The domain extraction is powered by an integrated Public Suffix List to accurately identify registered domains versus subdomains.

- Unicode domain names are translated for readability using Punycode decoding.

- The extension persists session data per tab using browser storage APIs, ensuring accurate badges and popup content.
