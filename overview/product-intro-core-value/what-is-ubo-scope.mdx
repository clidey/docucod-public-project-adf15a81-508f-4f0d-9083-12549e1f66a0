# What is uBO Scope?

## Unlock Complete Visibility into Web Connections

Every web page you visit silently reaches out to various remote servers—sometimes trusted, sometimes not. uBO Scope is a lightweight, independent browser extension designed to peel back the curtain on these network connections. Unlike traditional content blockers that focus on blocking ads or trackers, uBO Scope gives you total transparency by reporting all attempted and successful outbound connections initiated by pages.

This means uBO Scope empowers you to see exactly which servers your browser is trying to talk to—not just what’s blocked or filtered. It reveals a precise count of unique third-party domains contacted, helping you grasp the true scope of external requests made by websites.

### Why Choose uBO Scope?

- **Complete Connection Transparency:** Tracks all outbound requests, including allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked network calls.
- **Content Blocker Independent:** Works alongside any content blocker without relying on its block count or heuristics.
- **Real Third-Party Focus:** Highlights distinct third-party server domains, giving you an accurate picture of external connections.
- **Myth Busting:** Helps debunk common misconceptions and misleading metrics related to ad blockers and block counts.
- **Privacy & Security Insight:** Allows anyone to audit their browser’s network exposure with clarity.

### Who Benefits From uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users wanting a clear audit of third-party network activity.
- Security researchers auditing network behaviors of sites.
- Filter list maintainers evaluating the real-world impact of blocking rules.
- Users comparing content blockers on a meaningful metric—actual external connections.

## Understanding uBO Scope: Purpose and Value

### What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a minimalistic browser extension that listens to all web requests triggered by content you visit. Its sole purpose is to measure those network connections to remote servers, regardless of whether another content blocker allows or blocks them. It showcases the actual external domains contacted by web pages, giving clarity beyond the noisy block counters other extensions display.

### The Problem it Solves

Traditional content blockers show block counts that can be misleading. Block counts often do not equate to effective blocking because a higher block count might still allow more unique third-party connections. uBO Scope solves this by focusing on the real-world outcome: the list and count of distinct third-party domains your browser reaches out to during page loads.

This approach provides:

- A meaningful indicator of exposure to third-party networks.
- A way to verify how well your content blocker truly limits external connections.
- Transparent data not influenced by stealth blocking techniques or DNS-level blocking.

### Unique Advantages Over Alternatives

- **Independence:** uBO Scope is not tied to any specific content blocker like uBlock Origin. It passively measures network requests reported by the browser’s `webRequest` API.
- **Accurate Third-Party Domain Counting:** Instead of counting requests, it counts distinct domains, highlighting the breadth of third-party reach.
- **Visibility Into Stealth Blocking:** It can show connections affected by stealthy blocking that typical tools miss.
- **Non-Intrusive:** It does not interfere with requests, only observes.

This makes it a trustworthy tool for anyone looking to understand their browser's network footprint without guessing or relying solely on block metrics.

## How uBO Scope Works at a High Level

uBO Scope integrates with your browser’s `webRequest` API, listening to all network events like redirects, errors, and successful responses. It records each distinct domain contacted during your browsing session.

Here’s a simplified user flow:

1. **Network Monitoring:** uBO Scope continuously listens for all outgoing web requests executed by the active tab.
2. **Domain Parsing:** It derives the hostname and corresponding registrable domain (e.g., example.com) from each request URL.
3. **Outcome Categorization:** Requests are classified into three categories:
   - **Allowed:** Successful connections.
   - **Blocked:** Requests that failed or were explicitly blocked.
   - **Stealth:** Connections affected by stealth blocking techniques.
4. **Session Tracking:** Data is maintained per browser tab, resetting when navigation begins on a new main frame.
5. **User Interface:** The popup UI presents a dynamic badge count showing the number of distinct third-party domains connected, along with categorized domain lists.

This design guarantees that you always see an up-to-date, accurate representation of network connections made, independent of how your content blockers work behind the scenes.

## Real-World Example: From Web Page Load to Domain Count

Consider you visit a news website:

- The page’s main HTML comes from `news.example.com`.
- The page loads scripts and images from several other domains including `cdn.examplecdn.com`, `tracker.badactor.net`, and `analytics.goodservice.org`.

uBO Scope captures each network event triggered and determines:

- Which connections succeeded (allowed).
- Which requests were blocked (explicitly or by stealth).
- How many unique third-party domains were contacted.

Once the page fully loads, the toolbar badge might read “3” indicating three unique third-party domains connected. The popup interface shows these domains grouped by outcome. This transparent insight allows you to make informed decisions about your content-blocking setup.

## Practical Tips for Getting the Most from uBO Scope

- Check the badge count regularly to monitor the number of remote servers connected.
- Open the popup to see detailed lists of domains by allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked outcomes.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your existing content blocker to confirm its effectiveness.
- Remember: a lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections — a good privacy indicator.
- Be mindful that legitimate CDNs and service domains often appear; not all third-party connections are harmful.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Asked Questions about uBO Scope">
  <Accordion title="Why doesn't uBO Scope block any requests?">
    uBO Scope is a monitoring tool, not a blocker. Its role is to report connection attempts, not to interfere or block them. Use it with your chosen content blocker to assess real connection outcomes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why is the badge count sometimes zero on some pages?">
    Some pages may not generate any third-party connections during load, or connections could be initiated outside the browser’s `webRequest` API (e.g., via OS-level services), which uBO Scope cannot capture.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does uBO Scope handle stealth blocking?">
    uBO Scope tracks stealth-blocked requests separately, revealing connections affected by blockers doing evasive or indirect blocking, providing unique insights standard counters miss.
