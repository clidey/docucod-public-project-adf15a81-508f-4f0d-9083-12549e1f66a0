## Who Is uBO Scope For?

### Privacy-Conscious Users
If you aim to understand exactly which third-party domains your browser connects to when you visit websites, uBO Scope is your indispensable tool. It sheds light on all remote server connections, allowing you to see what happens beneath the surface, regardless of any content blocking in place.

### Filter List Maintainers
Maintaining filter lists requires a clear and accurate overview of real-world network requests. uBO Scope empowers you with detailed insights into third-party connections, even on devices where access to traditional browser developer tools is limited.

### Evaluators and Comparers of Content Blockers
Many users seek to compare how well different content blockers perform. uBO Scope provides transparent network connection data independent of any blocking, helping you discern the actual exposure rather than misleading block counts or unreliable test pages.

## Common Scenarios Where uBO Scope Makes a Difference

### Monitoring Genuine Third-Party Requests
Spot exactly which third-party domains your browser interacts with during regular browsing. This helps you identify excessive tracking or unexpected connections that might signal privacy risks.

### Debunking Content Blocking Myths
Avoid falling for common misconceptions like:
- A content blocker with a higher block count is necessarily better.
- 'Ad blocker test' pages reliably measure content blocker effectiveness.

uBO Scope reveals the reality, showing that a high block count can mean more distinct connections allowed and that synthetic test scenarios may not reflect true web behavior.

### Troubleshooting and Supporting Filter Lists
Filter list creators can validate which connections remain unblocked or stealth-blocked, allowing for smarter, targeted improvements. uBO Scope provides valuable feedback without requiring complex setups or advanced tools.

## Real-World Example

Imagine you're browsing your favorite news site. The site loads content and, silently, several third-party analytics and advertising domains are contacted. Your content blocker may report the number of blocked requests, but how many distinct third parties were actually reached?

With uBO Scope, opening its popup reveals the exact count and categories of third-party domains:
- **Not Blocked:** Domains from which content was successfully loaded.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were prevented.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were interrupted or redirected transparently.

This granular visibility helps you make informed decisions about your privacy settings and content blockers.

---

## Tips for Users

- Always interpret the toolbar badge as the number of _distinct_ third-party domains contacted — fewer is better for privacy.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your existing content blockers to see the full picture of network requests.
- Avoid relying on ad blocker test pages; instead, trust the real data that uBO Scope surfaces.

---

## Best Practices for Filter List Maintainers

- Leverage uBO Scope to analyze network activity in environments where developer tools are unavailable.
- Use insights on stealth-blocked connections to improve filter strategies.
- Share findings with your community to drive collaborative improvements.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Misinterpreting a high block count as effective blocking without checking distinct third-party domains.
- Relying on synthetic test websites that do not represent actual browsing traffic.
- Assuming all third-party domains are harmful; some are necessary infrastructure like CDNs.
