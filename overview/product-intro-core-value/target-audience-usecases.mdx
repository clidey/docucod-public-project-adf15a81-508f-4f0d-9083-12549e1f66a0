# Target Audience & Key Use Cases

## Who Benefits from uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is crafted to serve a community deeply invested in privacy and network transparency. Its core users fall into three primary categories:

- **Privacy-Conscious Individuals:** Users who want to understand and reduce the number of third-party connections their browser makes, thus safeguarding their online footprint.
- **Filter List Maintainers:** Professionals or hobbyists building and refining content blocking filter lists who need a trustworthy, real-world tool to verify blocking effectiveness beyond mere block counts.
- **Users Seeking Transparency in Network Activity:** Those curious or concerned about what remote servers a webpage actually contacts, regardless of whether content blockers interfere or not.

By delivering an insightful view into network connections, uBO Scope empowers these users with actionable data that reveals hidden exposures and verifies blocking realness.

## Common Real-World Scenarios Where uBO Scope Excels

Understanding the typical use cases helps reveal why uBO Scope matters beyond traditional content blockers:

### 1. Verifying the Actual Efficacy of Content Blockers

Many users assume that a higher block count on content blockers means better protection. uBO Scope debunks this myth by showing the number of **distinct third-party remote servers that actually received connections**. A higher block count may hide the fact that the browser contacted more third parties overall, meaning less effective privacy protection.

#### Example:

- You install two different blockers and see that Blocker A claims to block 200 requests, Blocker B blocks 150.
- With uBO Scope, you discover that despite the higher block count, Blocker A allows connections to 30 distinct third-party domains, versus only 10 with Blocker B.
- This knowledge helps you understand that Blocker B provides more meaningful privacy by limiting network exposure.

### 2. Debunking Misleading "Ad Blocker Test" Webpages

uBO Scope reveals why ad blocker testing websites can be unreliable:

- These test sites use fabricated network requests not common in the real world.
- Many content blockers use advanced stealth techniques that evade detection by these test pages.
- uBO Scope monitors actual network requests exposed through the browser API, providing a genuine picture.

This makes uBO Scope a far superior tool for assessing content blocking performance in practical, everyday browsing environments.

### 3. Assessing Exposure to Third-Party Servers

Webpages often connect to numerous third-party domains (CDNs, analytics, trackers, advertising, social widgets). Users want to:

- Understand how many third-party servers are contacted during browsing.
- Identify which requests are blocked, stealthily blocked, or allowed.
- Gain transparency into potential data-sharing points or privacy leaks.

This helps users adjust their blocker settings or browse more safely with full awareness.

### 4. Assisting Filter List Maintainers

Those maintaining or testing filter lists appreciate uBO Scope because:

- It reports outcomes of network requests independent of the blocker UI.
- Users can validate that their rules effectively reduce third-party connections.
- On devices with limited tools, it offers a simple yet powerful view of network activity.

Planned enhancements aim to provide even deeper insights for these expert users.

## Why uBO Scope’s Badge Count and Reporting Matter

A key feature is the toolbar badge displaying the number of distinct third-party servers contacted:

- **Low Badge Count Is Good:** It means fewer distinct external domains are contacted, reducing privacy risks.
- **Block Count Is Misleading:** Traditional block counts from blockers do not reflect true exposure.
- **Dynamic Visibility:** The badge updates per active tab, reflecting real-time network requests you should care about.

This mechanism shifts the focus from counting blocked requests to measuring **effective network exposure**.

---

## Summary

- **Target Audience:** Privacy users, filter list maintainers, and those wanting in-depth transparency in web network connections.
- **Key Use Cases:** Verifying real blocking effectiveness, exposing misleading block metrics and test sites, auditing third-party server exposure, and supporting filter list development.
- **Core Value:** Provides trustworthy, privacy-focused insight into what remote servers are contacted in real browsing, beyond typical content blocker metrics.
