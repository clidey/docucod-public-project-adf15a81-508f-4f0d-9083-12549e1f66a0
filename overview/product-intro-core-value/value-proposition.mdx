# Why Use uBO Scope?

Discover the unique value uBO Scope brings as a transparency and privacy tool in the crowded landscape of browser content blockers. This page explains how the badge count reflects privacy exposure, what it truly measures, and how it empowers you to assess and compare the effectiveness of different filtering strategies across browsers and settings.

## Understanding the Badge Count: Your Privacy Indicator

The badge displayed on the uBO Scope icon is not just a number—it tells a critical story about your browsing privacy. This count represents the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser has connected to from the active webpage. 

**Why does this matter?** Because each connection to a third-party server can potentially expose your data, tracking behavior, or other privacy risks.

### What the Badge Does and Does Not Indicate

- **It shows distinct third-party domains contacted:** The count increases when your browser communicates with unique domains outside the first-party site.
- **Lower counts signify better privacy:** Fewer third-party connections generally mean less exposure to external tracking or data sharing.
- **Not a direct blocker effectiveness measure:** A higher block count in other blockers might paradoxically mean more connections are actually allowed — uBO Scope illuminates that nuance.

### Real-World Example

Imagine visiting an online news site:

- With a strict content blocker, the badge might show "3" because only essential CDNs and the site itself are contacted.
- With a looser filter, you might see "15" indicating many third-party trackers or ads, which means more privacy exposure even if your blocker shows more individual blocks.

<u>Through the badge, you gain a higher-level, practical insight into your privacy footprint than traditional block counts provide.</u>

## Reliable Privacy Comparison Across Browsers and Setups

uBO Scope is consistent in measuring what truly counts — the number of unique third-party servers reached — no matter which browser or blocking extensions are active.

### Why This Matters for Privacy-Conscious Users

- **Browser-independent:** Whether you use Chrome, Firefox, or another supported browser, uBO Scope offers a uniform metric.
- **Filter-agnostic:** It reveals privacy impact regardless of your content blocker’s technology or DNS filtering techniques.
- **Debunks common misconceptions:** Don’t trust simplistic block counters or unreliable "ad blocker test" websites.

## Busting Common Myths with uBO Scope Insight

Many users misinterpret content blocker statistics, and some websites provide misleading information on blocker effectiveness.

<u>uBO Scope helps you navigate these misunderstandings clearly:</u>

- **Myth 1: Higher block count means better blocking.**
  - Truth: A blocker might block many requests but still allow connections to numerous third-party servers, increasing privacy exposure.
  - uBO Scope shows the total distinct connections, clarifying actual third-party reach.

- **Myth 2: Popular "ad blocker test" sites are accurate.**
  - Truth: These sites often use fabricated network calls and can’t detect stealthy blocking techniques, misleading users.
  - uBO Scope measures real network connections regardless of such tricks.

## How uBO Scope Empowers You

- **Gain transparency:** Visualize all third-party network connections attempted or made by a webpage.
- **Assess your privacy footprint instantly:** The badge count is a clear signal of how much you're exposed.
- **Make informed choices:** Compare blocker configurations and browser setups based on real connection data.
- **Identify stealth-blocking activity:** uBO Scope distinguishes blocked, stealth-blocked, and allowed connections so you can analyze filter effectiveness deeper.

## Practical Scenarios Where uBO Scope Shines

- You want to understand how many third-party servers a news or social media site contacts.
- You aim to evaluate different content blockers or DNS filtering setups on the same browser for privacy.
- You require a consistent measurement tool across devices and browsers.
- You seek to debunk misleading ad-blocking test results and better calibrate your filters.

## Best Practices for Maximizing Value

- **View the badge after fully loading pages:** The count stabilizes post-page load for accuracy.
- **Examine the popup for domain-level detail:** Identify which domains are contacted and their connection status.
- **Use across sessions:** Compare results with your usual browsing to spot changes.
- **Do not rely solely on block counts:** Use uBO Scope’s data as a higher-level privacy indicator.
