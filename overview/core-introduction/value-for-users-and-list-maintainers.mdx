# Value for Users and List Maintainers

uBO Scope goes beyond traditional content blockers by offering transparent, actionable insights into third-party connections your browser attempts or completes. This page highlights why these insights matter to you, whether you are an everyday user concerned about your online privacy or a filter list maintainer looking for nuanced connection data.

## Empowering Users: Debunking Common Myths About Ad Blockers

Many users rely on content blockers without fully understanding what metrics truly indicate effective blocking. uBO Scope sheds light on common misconceptions:

- **Block Count Misinterpretation**: Don’t be misled by toolbar block counts. A higher number of blocked requests does not necessarily mean better blocking. Instead, the essential metric is the number of distinct third-party domains your browser actually connects to without being blocked. uBO Scope’s badge shows this count — a lower number reflects stronger protection.

- **Unreliable Ad Block Tester Webpages**: Many ‘ad block tester’ sites generate artificial and unrealistic network requests, which don't reflect real-world browsing. uBO Scope exposes these inaccurate results by showing actual network connections and their outcomes, providing a trustworthy perspective on what your extension does.

By helping you see the complete picture of third-party connections, uBO Scope empowers you to make informed decisions about your privacy settings and blockers.

## Enabling Users to Judge Connection Risk Independently

Every website’s behavior is unique, and not all third-party connections are equally benign or risky. uBO Scope:

- Transparently lists all distinct third-party remote servers contacted during your browsing session.
- Categorizes network outcomes into **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked** connections to help you understand which third parties are successfully serving resources, which are being hidden or redirected, and which are outright blocked.
- Provides a detailed view within the extension popup, showing domains along with the frequency of connections, enabling you to spot recurring trackers or less obvious connections.

Imagine browsing a news site and seeing how many and which third parties your browser connects to. This insight helps you judge for yourself what risks exist rather than relying on proxy indicators.

## Actionable Data for Filter List Maintainers

Filter list maintainers face the challenge of identifying potentially harmful third-party domains amidst a complex web of allowed, stealthy, and blocked requests. uBO Scope offers:

- A granular report of network connections as seen by the browser, including those on platforms where browser developer tools may be unavailable or limited.
- Distinction between network request outcomes that can inform better tuning of filters.
- A foundation for enhancements that will incorporate even more detailed network request metadata in future versions.

This level of insight supports maintaining more precise, effective filter lists, improving privacy tools for all users.

## Breaking Through Platform Restrictions

Many privacy tools rely heavily on browser developer tools and APIs with limited availability on some platforms or in specific browsing modes. uBO Scope operates effectively:

- Using the browser’s `webRequest` API, it reports network request outcomes regardless of how content blocking may be applied — whether by built-in browser blockers, DNS-level blocking, or external tools.
- Providing real-time reports and maintaining session data, so you get consistent, reliable data on third-party connections even on locked-down platforms.

## Practical Example: Making Sense of Your Browsing Connections

When you visit a website, uBO Scope immediately starts logging all third-party network events. You see:

- How many and which third-party domains are contacted without blocking (allowed).
- Which connections were stealth-blocked (redirected or hidden to avoid detection).
- Which connections were blocked outright by your content blocker or other blocking mechanisms.

By digging into these categories, you learn which servers serve ads, trackers, or essential third-party content (like CDNs). This knowledge equips you to adjust your privacy settings or contribute to filter lists with confidence.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Use uBO Scope Alongside Your Content Blocker**: It complements blockers like uBlock Origin by revealing what those blockers actually allow or block on a domain level.
- **Pay Attention to Distinct Domain Counts**: Focus on reducing allowed third-party domains rather than just maximizing blocked requests.
- **Review Stealth-Blocked Sections**: These are connections that might bypass normal detection — understanding these helps in refining filters and improving privacy.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Do not equate badge block counts with total privacy — uBO Scope educates users to avoid this error.
- Avoid relying on third-party ad block tester pages as truth sources.
- Remember uBO Scope cannot report network requests fully outside browser APIs, such as some encrypted or sandboxed connections — but it covers the vast majority relevant for privacy.

## Getting the Most From uBO Scope

1. **Install and enable the extension (see [Installing and Setting Up uBO Scope](/guides/core-workflow/install-setup))**.
2. **Use the popup to monitor live connections for active tabs (see [Monitoring Third-Party Connections](/guides/core-workflow/monitor-connections))**.
3. **Interpret connection data with knowledge from [Key Concepts and Terminology](/overview/core-introduction/key-concepts-and-terminology)**.
4. **If you maintain filter lists, use the data to investigate evasive or stealthy network requests (see [Supporting Filter List Maintainers and Power Users](/guides/practical-usage/support-filter-list-maintainers))**.

The real power of uBO Scope comes from this combination of transparency, actionable detail, and reliability — a tool that changes how you perceive and control your web privacy.
