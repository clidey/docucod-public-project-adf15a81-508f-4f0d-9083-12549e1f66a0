# Key Concepts and Terminology

Understanding the foundational terms and concepts in uBO Scope is essential to effectively interpret its reports and leverage its insights into your browser's network activity. This page clarifies the most important terminology, providing clear definitions and practical context to empower you in evaluating third-party connections and their privacy implications.

---

## Third-Party Remote Servers

A _third-party remote server_ refers to any external server contacted by your browser during webpage loading that is different from the website you are visiting (the first-party). These encompass scripts, images, trackers, or resources delivered from domains outside the main website's domain.

In uBO Scope, third-party servers are the primary focus because they represent potential privacy exposure points and vectors for advertising or tracking.

**Why care?**
- Monitoring third-party connections helps reveal hidden external communications.
- Identifies possible trust boundaries crossed during browsing.

---

## Badge Count

The badge count is the numeric indicator shown on the uBO Scope toolbar icon. It represents **the number of distinct third-party domains for which at least one connection was made and allowed during the page lifecycle**.

**Key insight:**
- A lower badge count is generally better, indicating fewer external connections and hence potentially fewer privacy risks.
- The badge count reports _allowed_ connections, not blocked ones.

**Practical tip:** Use the badge count to see at a glance how many distinct third-parties interact with each page.

---

## WebRequest API

The WebRequest API is a browser feature that allows extensions like uBO Scope to monitor and intercept network requests your browser makes.

**In uBO Scope:**
- It listens to all HTTP and WebSocket requests and responses.
- Determines the outcome of each request: allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked (redirected).

**Why it matters:**
- Enables accurate reporting of all network connection attempts, regardless of the blocking mechanism applied.
- Includes connections blocked by other content blockers or DNS-level blocking as long as the browser emits the event.

---

## Domain Groupings: Allowed, Stealth, and Blocked

uBO Scope classifies network connections into three primary categories to provide clarity on the fate and context of each third-party request.

- **Allowed:** Connections that were successfully established, with network requests completed without errors.
- **Stealth (Stealth-Blocked):** Requests that were redirected, effectively preventing resource loading while potentially remaining undetected by webpage scripts.
- **Blocked:** Network requests that failed or were explicitly blocked, resulting in errors or no connection.

These groupings help you understand not only what was blocked but how and whether stealth strategies are employed.

**Example scenario:**
- If a tracker’s request is redirected invisibly, it appears in the stealth group rather than outright blocked.

---

## Session Tracking

Within uBO Scope, _session tracking_ refers to the ongoing management and association of network connection data with specific browser tabs and page sessions.

- For every open tab, uBO Scope maintains detailed records of domains contacted, categorized by allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked.
- This tracking enables the extension to accurately update badge counts and popup statistics dynamically during browsing.

**User benefit:**
- Stay informed about the evolving network footprint of each tab as you interact with webpages.
- Easily reset or discard data when tabs are closed, ensuring fresh contextual reporting.

---

## How These Concepts Relate to Privacy and Site Analysis

Together, these key terms form a framework that lets users see beyond superficial blocking numbers to truly understand network exposures:

- Recognizing third-party domains and grouping their requests clarifies the scope of potential third-party tracking.
- Understanding allowed vs. stealth vs. blocked connections reveals how content blockers operate in practice — including stealth approaches which can be harder to detect.
- The badge count objectively summarizes how many third-party domains are genuinely active per page, cutting through misleading block count comparisons.
- Session tracking links this information directly to your browsing context, making privacy considerations actionable and transparent.

## Practical Examples

**Example 1: Understanding Badge Counts**

You navigate to a news website. The uBO Scope badge shows “3”. This means your browser made allowed connections to three distinct third-party domains. By inspecting the popup, you discover two are common CDNs delivering scripts, one is an advertising network.

**Example 2: Domain Groupings in Action**

Some third-party requests appear in the 'stealth-blocked' category, indicating the requests were redirected (blocked silently). This technique helps avoid webpage breakage while still protecting privacy.

**Example 3: Using Session Tracking Data**

You keep a tab open on an e-commerce site and notice the badge count growing as the page dynamically loads content from various third parties. uBO Scope's session tracking enables this live update, providing you with timely awareness.

---

## Tips for Success

- Regularly check the badge count to gauge your exposure to third-party connections.
- Use the popup domain groupings to identify which third parties are allowed, stealth-blocked, or outright blocked.
- Understand that stealth-blocking is a protective approach that differs from traditional blocking.
- Combine insights from uBO Scope with your content blocker’s settings for optimal privacy.

Remember, a high block count in an ad blocker doesn't necessarily mean better privacy. Focus on the number of distinct third-party connections allowed instead.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count only show allowed connections?">
By design, uBO Scope's badge count highlights the number of distinct third-party remote servers your browser actually connected to. Blocked connections don't count because the goal is to spotlight potential privacy exposures rather than what was denied.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is the difference between stealth-blocked and blocked?">
Stealth-blocked connections are those silently redirected, preventing resource loading without alerting the webpage. Blocked connections are explicitly failed requests, which may be detectable by the webpage.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope show connections blocked by DNS-level filters?">
As long as the browser reports network requests through the WebRequest API, uBO Scope will receive and reflect the outcome, including blocking by DNS-based methods.
