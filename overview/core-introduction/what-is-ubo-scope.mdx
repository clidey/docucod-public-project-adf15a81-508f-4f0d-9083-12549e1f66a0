# What is uBO Scope?

## Discover Every Network Connection Your Browser Makes

uBO Scope is a specialized browser extension designed to reveal all network connections—both attempted and successful—that your web browser establishes with remote servers. Unlike typical content blockers or network inspectors that filter or hide some requests, uBO Scope’s core mission is transparency: it exposes the full picture of every third-party request your browser makes.

### The Heart of uBO Scope's Mission

When you visit a website, your browser often connects to multiple remote servers—not just the site you’re visiting. These connections might be content, ads, trackers, or legitimate third-party services like CDNs. uBO Scope shines a light on these connections by reporting:

- The exact third-party domains involved
- Whether the requests were allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked
- A distinct count of these third-party servers on your toolbar icon

This empowers you to understand the true behavior of your browser’s network activity.

## What Makes uBO Scope Different?

Unlike traditional content blockers that focus on blocking unwanted content, or network inspectors that require deep technical know-how, uBO Scope provides a clear, user-friendly overview of all remote server interactions. Its approach is neutral and comprehensive, giving you unbiased data regardless of which content blocker you use. This makes it indispensable for users, privacy-conscious individuals, and filter list maintainers alike.

### Key Distinctions

- **Unfiltered reporting:** Shows all connections, including those made despite blocking, stealth-blocking, or DNS filtering.
- **Third-party focus:** Counts connections to third-party domains, the key privacy metric rather than just block counts.
- **No false positives:** Based solely on the browser’s `webRequest` API, reflecting actual network activity.

## How uBO Scope Works At a Glance

Behind the scenes, uBO Scope listens to the browser's network activity through the `webRequest` API, capturing events such as request redirects, successful responses, and errors. It categorizes each connection outcome into three main buckets:

- **Allowed:** Connections successfully established
- **Stealth-blocked:** Requests silently blocked or redirected
- **Blocked:** Requests actively blocked with errors

It aggregates the domains per tab and dynamically updates the toolbar badge showing the number of distinct third-party domains contacted.

### User Flow Example

1. You load a webpage.
2. uBO Scope intercepts network requests made by the page.
3. Each request’s destination domain is analyzed and categorized.
4. The browser action icon updates with a badge counting distinct third-party domains.
5. Clicking the icon opens a popup detailing allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

This continuous feedback loop helps you visualize a website’s true network footprint.

## Why Trust uBO Scope?

Many content blockers exaggerate block counts or focus solely on preventing requests rather than showing what actually happens. uBO Scope avoids marketing hype and delivers factual insight directly from your browser’s network stack. It exposes the real number of distinct third parties your browser connects to, which is the more meaningful metric for privacy and performance.

Because it tracks every connection reported via `webRequest`, it even reveals connections that bypass filtering mechanisms, helping debunk common misconceptions about content blockers.

## Practical Benefits of uBO Scope

- **Privacy Awareness:** See exactly which external domains your browser talks to, helping you make informed decisions.
- **Filter List Validation:** Maintain and test filter lists by verifying which domains are truly blocked or allowed.
- **Debunk Myths:** Confirm that higher block counts don't always mean stronger blocking.
- **Cross-Content Blocker Insight:** Gain a unified view unaffected by the particular blocking extension in use.

## Get Started Quickly

To start using uBO Scope, simply install it from your browser’s add-on store. Once active, open any webpage and click the toolbar icon to inspect a categorized summary of all remote server connections for that tab.

For a detailed walkthrough of key concepts and terminology, as well as the extension’s features and architecture, see the related documentation sections.

## Example: Toolbar Badge Indicator

```plaintext
[Toolbar Icon] 3
```
This badge shows that the current tab has connected to three unique third-party domains. A lower number indicates fewer third-party connections—typically a desirable state for privacy-conscious users.
