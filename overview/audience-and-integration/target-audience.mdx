## Overview: Finding the Right Users for uBO Scope

Whether you are new to privacy tools or an expert filter list maintainer, uBO Scope offers meaningful insights that empower you to see beyond surface-level metrics and questionable tests. Its compatibility with *any* content blocker and straightforward reporting makes it uniquely valuable across diverse user profiles.

### Ideal Users Include:

- **Privacy-Conscious Web Users:**
  - You want clear visibility into what third-party domains your browser connects to, regardless of which content blocker you use.
  - You value unbiased data over misleading block counts or synthetic ad-block tests.
  - You seek to ensure that your chosen blocker effectively limits third-party tracking.

- **Filter List Maintainers and Content Blocker Researchers:**
  - You need accurate, real-world data on allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked network requests.
  - You encounter limitations with browser tools or want a companion extension to validate your filter lists.
  - You require data independent of any specific content blocker’s internal reporting.

- **Security and Privacy Researchers:**
  - You investigate network behaviors, stealth blocking techniques, or the accuracy of content blockers.
  - You examine browser network flows to detect anomalies or stealthy communications.
  
- **Anyone Questioning Content Blocker Metrics or Ad-Block Test Pages:**
  - You’ve noticed inconsistencies or suspect that block counts and test pages don’t tell the whole story.
  - You want to ground your work or personal use on actual network request outcomes rather than manipulated figures.

## Why This Matters: User Pain Points Addressed

Modern content blockers and privacy tools can report misleading information. For example:

- Block counts may increase while actual third-party connections rise, making a blocker appear more effective than it is.
- Ad-block test webpages often create unrealistic scenarios that don’t reflect everyday web browsing.
- Browser-built-in tools may be limited or hard to interpret easily.

uBO Scope tackles these challenges by:

- Reporting **distinct remote servers connected to**, not just generic block or allow counts.
- Providing results in a clear, per-tab user interface showing allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.
- Remaining compatible **with any blocker** or even without one, as it hooks into the browser’s webRequest API.

## Use Case Walkthroughs

### 1. The Privacy-Conscious User’s Journey

Imagine you browse your favorite news site while running a content blocker. The toolbar badge shows a number that claims to be the number of blocked requests — but what does it really mean? Using uBO Scope, you can:

- Open the extension popup to see *exactly* what third-party domains your browser contacted and whether they were allowed or blocked.
- Confirm that your blocker minimizes third-party connections, supporting your privacy goals.
- Recognize stealth blocking where some requests are silently blocked without web page detection.


### 2. Filter List Maintainer’s Workflow

You maintain filter lists for various content blockers. To refine your lists:

- Employ uBO Scope to gather real-world network request data from multiple browsers/devices.
- Analyze allowed domains that may need blocking and stealth-blocked domains that reflect more sophisticated blockers or network conditions.
- Validate filter list improvements by retesting with uBO Scope before publishing.


### 3. Researcher Verifying Content Blocker Metrics

Content blockers claim high block counts, but you want to verify accuracy:

- Use uBO Scope alongside your blocker to monitor actual distinct third-party connections.
- Identify discrepancies between block count badges and real network behavior.
- Disprove or confirm the validity of popular ad-block test pages, which often don't represent authentic network scenarios.

## Key Benefits Tailored to User Needs

- **Transparency:** See all network connections clearly categorized by their blocking status.
- **Compatibility:** Works irrespective of your content blocker choice, or even if none is installed.
- **Accurate Metrics:** Badge and popup represent unique third-party domains contacted, a more meaningful measure than raw block counts.
- **User-Friendly:** Simple popup UI aggregates data per tab for quick insight.
- **Developer & Maintainer Friendly:** Facilitates deep dives into blocker effectiveness and network flows for fine-tuning.

## Getting the Most Out of uBO Scope

### Best Practices

- Combine uBO Scope usage with your preferred content blocker to independently assess blocking effectiveness.
- Use the popup UI to spot unexpected third-party connections that may indicate privacy leaks.
- Regularly monitor stealth blocking sections to understand how some requests are handled silently.

### Common Pitfalls

- Don’t rely solely on toolbar badge numbers without checking the detailed popup data; the badge is a high-level indicator.
- Understand that uBO Scope only detects requests visible through the browser’s `webRequest` API; some network requests made outside this scope may not be detected.
