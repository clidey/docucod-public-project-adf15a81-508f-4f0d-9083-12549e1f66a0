# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding uBO Scope starts with grasping its key domain-specific terms and the meaning behind its core metrics. This page explains important concepts such as **allowed domains**, **blocked requests**, **stealth blocking**, and why the toolbar badge count reports **distinct remote servers** rather than raw block counts. Mastery of these concepts will empower you to correctly interpret the data and insights presented in the extension's popup panel and overall UI.

## Remote Server Connections: The Heart of uBO Scope

uBO Scope's primary function is to reveal every distinct remote server your browser **attempts** or **succeeds** in connecting to. Rather than focusing on the total number of blocked or allowed network requests, it emphasizes the count of unique third-party domains involved in these connections.

### What Does "Remote Server" Mean Here?
- A remote server refers to any server outside the browser's origin site that the browser contacts to load web resources.
- These servers often belong to third parties such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

### Why Focus on Distinct Domains Instead of Total Requests?
- Many network requests can target the same domain repeatedly; counting every request inflates the perception of third-party exposure.
- By counting distinct domains, uBO Scope provides a clearer picture of how many **unique third-party entities** were contacted.
- This approach better correlates with privacy risk and resource load.

## Key Terminology

### Allowed Domains
- These are third-party domains from which network requests have **successfully completed**.
- Requests to these domains were not blocked, either because they are whitelisted, allowed by your content blocker, or essential resources.
- Monitoring allowed domains helps you understand which external servers your browser communicates with during page loads.

### Blocked Requests
- Network requests which failed due to blocking policies enforced by your content blocker or network layer.
- uBO Scope tracks these as **blocked**, counting the domains of such requests separately.
- Knowing blocked domains lets you verify that unwanted connections are being prevented effectively.

### Stealth Blocking
- Some requests are **stealth-blocked**, meaning the blocking occurs in a way intended to be invisible or silent to web pages.
- These might be redirects or network attempts that fail quietly, preventing detection by websites.
- uBO Scope categorizes these requests distinctly to highlight requests that are blocked, sometimes by stealth techniques.

### Badge Count
- The number displayed on the extension's toolbar icon badge reflects the **number of distinct third-party remote servers for which there was a connection**.
- This count represents allowed domains only, meaning **requests that succeeded**.
- A lower badge count typically indicates fewer third-party connections, aligning with improved privacy and reduced tracking exposure.

<Info>
The badge count is **not** a block count. A higher block count might correlate with allowing connections to more distinct domains, a paradox users should be aware of.

## Why These Concepts Matter

### Correct Interpretation of the Popup Panel
- The popup UI divides domain connections into three distinct sections: 
  - **Not blocked (Allowed domains):** Domains from which requests completed
  - **Stealth-blocked:** Domains where requests were blocked in a concealed manner
  - **Blocked:** Domains where requests were outright blocked or failed
- Understanding these categories helps you analyze the extension's real-time data output accurately.

### Accurate Privacy Assessment
- Focusing on distinct allowed domains helps you spot unnecessary third-party contacts.
- Differentiating stealth-blocked from blocked domains reveals subtle filtering behaviors.
- Recognizing the badge count's meaning prevents misjudgment of extension effectiveness based on raw block numbers.

### Debunking Common Myths
- **Myth:** More block counts mean better blocking.
- **Reality:** The true measure is how many distinct third-party servers are contacted, which uBO Scope surfaces transparently.
- Detailed domain-based reporting avoids being misled by superficial statistics often shown by other blockers or test pages.

## Practical Scenario: Reading uBO Scope's Data

Imagine visiting a news website. Multiple network requests fire off to embed content, advertisements, analytics, and CDN resources.

1. uBO Scope identifies distinct domains contacted;
2. Some requests successfully load (`allowed`), others are silently stopped (`stealth-blocked`), and some show errors due to outright blocking (
`blocked`);
3. The popup panel lists these domains in categorized lists, with counts indicating how many requests went to each domain;
4. The toolbar badge shows the number of allowed distinct third-party domains, giving you a quick privacy-relevant summary.

Using this insight, you can:
- Detect if too many third parties are contacted.
- Confirm your content blocker’s effectiveness.
- Investigate stealth-blocked connections that might otherwise evade detection.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Check the Badge Often:** Use the badge count as a high-level indicator of third-party exposure on sites.
- **Explore the Popup Details:** Regularly review allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains to get granular visibility.
- **Don’t Rely on Block Counts Alone:** Avoid judging content-blocker reliability based on block counts from other extensions or websites.
- **Use for Filter List Maintenance:** uBO Scope’s domain visibility helps filter list maintainers tune their rules precisely.
- **Understand the Limits:** Network requests outside the browser's `webRequest` API scope are not captured.

## Troubleshooting Terminology Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions About Core Terms">
<Accordion title="Why is the badge count sometimes lower than expected?">
This is because the badge count shows unique allowed third-party domains, not total requests or block counts. If multiple requests target the same domain, it only counts once.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is the difference between stealth blocking and blocked?">
Stealth blocking occurs silently, often via redirects or hidden mechanisms, so the web page cannot detect it directly. Blocked requests fail openly, detectable by the page or browser.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope see all network connection attempts?">
No. The extension relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API. Requests outside this scope (e.g., some WebSocket connections or browser internals) may not appear.
