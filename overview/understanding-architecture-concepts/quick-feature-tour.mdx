# Feature Overview (in the UI)

Discover how uBO Scope presents detailed, actionable insights about domain connections directly in its popup UI. This guided walkthrough introduces you to the main panels, indicators, and layout you’ll encounter when analyzing any browser tab’s network connections with uBO Scope.

---

## At a Glance: What You See in the Popup

When you open uBO Scope’s popup panel, you are greeted with a clear, focused summary of the current tab's remote server connections. This interface brings together three primary sections:

- **Hostname Header:** Shows the page’s full hostname and its base domain.
- **Summary:** Displays the count of distinct domains connected in the current tab.
- **Connection Outcome Sections:** Separate lists for domains categorized by their connection outcome — **allowed**, **stealth-blocked**, and **blocked**.

Each section is designed to keep you informed at a glance, making complex network data easy to understand.

---

## Understanding the Hostname Header

At the top of the popup, the hostname header displays:

- The **full hostname** (e.g., `assets.example.com`), telling you exactly which part of the site you are examining.
- The **base domain** (e.g., `example.com`), shown next to or beneath the full hostname for context.

This distinction is crucial: the full hostname reveals subdomains that might initiate network connections differently, while the base domain helps identify the main organization behind those domains.

**How this helps you:** Quickly recognizing the base domain versus subdomains empowers you to spot third-party domains or unexpected network connections easily.

---

## The Summary Section: Your Network Snapshot

Directly under the hostname header, uBO Scope provides a concise summary:

- Displays the total number of **distinct domains** connected by the current tab.
- This count reflects unique domains, not raw request or block counts — highlighting real third-party reach.

**Why domain count matters:** Many users confuse block counters with actual domain connectivity. This domain-based measure offers a more meaningful indicator of network exposure.

---

## Outcome Sections: Allowed, Stealth-Blocked, and Blocked

The popup organizes domain data into three intuitive outcome sections, each clearly labeled and visually distinct:

### 1. Allowed

- Lists all domains that were contacted successfully without being blocked.
- Each domain entry shows the number of connection attempts.
- Helps you see which servers your browser is openly communicating with.

### 2. Stealth-Blocked

- Displays domains where requests were redirected or altered to obscure them rather than outright blocked.
- Useful for identifying stealthy behaviors and subtle network activity affecting your privacy.

### 3. Blocked

- Shows domains whose connections were explicitly blocked by the extension.
- Provides counts of attempts per domain, letting you understand how actively your content blocker is protecting you.

Each section dynamically updates as you browse, making it easy to monitor and analyze connections in real-time.

---

## How Domain Rows Work

In each outcome section, domains are presented in rows showing:

- The domain’s **name**, rendered in easy-to-read Unicode if internationalized.
- A **count badge** showing how many connections were observed for that domain within the tab.

This compact layout balances detail and readability, enabling you to quickly scan the data.

---

## The User Flow: From Tab to Insight

The popup UI is your real-time window into network activity:

1. **Open Popup:** When active on a tab, the popup immediately loads current connection data.
2. **Hostname & Domain Display:** Confirms the tab’s site context.
3. **Summary:** Shows total domains connected.
4. **Outcome Lists:** Breaks down connection results to highlight allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains.

This intuitive flow is designed so you can move from broad overview to specific domains effortlessly.

---

## Practical Tips for Using the Popup Effectively

- **Refresh the Popup:** Opening and closing the popup refreshes data, helping you examine network changes across page loads.
- **Focus on Domains, Not Raw Counts:** Use domain counts to prioritize which connections to investigate rather than total request numbers.
- **Watch Stealth Blocked Closely:** Stealth blocking often reveals subtle privacy impacts; understanding this category can improve your filter tuning.
- **Use the Badge Count:** The browser toolbar badge reflects the number of allowed domains per tab—this popup expands on that for granular insight.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **No Data Displayed:** If the popup shows 'NO DATA', ensure you are on a fully loaded tab with visible network activity.
- **Misinterpreting Counts:** Remember the counts relate to unique domains, not total requests or blocked hits.
- **Popup Not Updating:** Try toggling the popup or reload the page to force fresh data.

For persistent issues, consult related troubleshooting documentation.

## Code Sample: Rendering Domain Rows in the Popup

Here’s an excerpt showing how domain rows are rendered for one of the outcome sections, illustrating the simplicity and clarity of the UI construction:

```javascript
const rowTemplate = document.querySelector('template#domainRow');
const allowedSection = document.querySelector('.outcome.allowed .domains');

allowed.forEach(([domain, count]) => {
    const row = rowTemplate.content.cloneNode(true);
    row.querySelector('.domain').textContent = domain;
    row.querySelector('.count').textContent = count;
    allowedSection.appendChild(row);
});
```

This approach underpins all three outcome lists, maintaining a consistent and user-friendly layout.
