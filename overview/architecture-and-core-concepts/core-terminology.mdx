# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding uBO Scope’s popup interface and reports requires familiarity with several core terms unique to its function. This page introduces essential vocabulary such as ‘allowed domain’, ‘blocked domain’, ‘stealth blocking’, ‘third-party remote server’, and ‘badge count’. These definitions enable you to accurately interpret the popup UI, make sense of reported network activity, and gain meaningful insights into your browsing privacy.

## Key Terms Defined

### Allowed Domain
An allowed domain represents a remote server domain that your browser successfully connected to during a webpage load or interaction.

- **What It Means for You:** These are servers that your content blocking settings permitted communication with.
- **How It's Displayed:** Listed under the **not blocked** section in the popup UI.
- **Example:** If a webpage loads images from `cdn.example.com` and those requests complete successfully, `example.com` counts as an allowed domain.

### Blocked Domain
A blocked domain is a remote server domain whose network connections were stopped by content blocking rules or errors preventing access.

- **What It Means for You:** These requests were prevented from reaching their servers, reflecting restrictive content blocking.
- **How It's Displayed:** Listed under the **blocked** section in the popup UI.
- **Example:** A tracking server domain such as `ads.tracker.com` may appear here if uBlock blocks its requests.

### Stealth Blocking
Stealth blocking refers to connections that were intercepted during redirects or failures, often silently preventing certain requests without explicit user notification.

- **What It Means for You:** These are domains whose requests were redirected or failed, likely due to stealth methods of blocking.
- **How It's Displayed:** Listed under the **stealth-blocked** section.
- **Example:** An ad script that attempts to load but is redirected to a blank or no-response URL.

### Third-Party Remote Server
A third-party remote server is a server domain different from the website you're directly visiting.

- **What It Means for You:** These servers often handle analytics, ads, CDNs, or other embedded services.
- **Importance in uBO Scope:** It distinguishes between first-party requests (to the website itself) and third-party requests (to other domains), vital for privacy audits.

### Badge Count
The badge count is the number displayed on the browser action icon (extension button) representing the number of unique allowed domains currently detected for the active tab.

- **What It Means for You:** It provides an at-a-glance summary of how many distinct domains your browser connected to for that webpage.
- **How It's Updated:** Automatically refreshed as uBO Scope tracks network events.

## How These Concepts Fit Together

When you open uBO Scope's popup UI for any tab, you see a breakdown of domains categorized by outcome:

- **Not blocked (Allowed):** Domains where your browser's requests completed successfully.
- **Stealth-blocked:** Domains whose requests were redirected or stealthily blocked.
- **Blocked:** Domains which were explicitly stopped by content blocking.

This categorization helps you understand the actual network footprint of the current webpage, revealing not just what was allowed, but the presence of stealthy or explicit blocking.

This vocabulary is the foundation for interpreting the detailed domain-level data uBO Scope reports.

## Practical Tips for Making Sense of Terminology

- **Focus on the Domain, Not the URL:** uBO Scope summarizes by domain rather than individual URLs, helping you spot which services are involved.
- **Identify Stealth Blockers:** Presence of stealth-blocked domains signals some requests were blocked quietly, which might be missed by other tools.
- **Use Badge Count as a Quick Metric:** If the badge count inflates unexpectedly, it may indicate many allowed third-party connections.
- **Look for Unexpected Blocked Domains:** This can reveal trackers or unwanted third-party content your blocking rules caught.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Confusing Hostname with Domain:** uBO Scope uses Mozilla’s Public Suffix List to identify registrable domains, not just hostnames. For example, for `news.bbc.co.uk`, the domain is `bbc.co.uk`.
- **Ignoring Stealth Blocking:** Stealth blocking may cause a network request to fail silently; do not overlook these when auditing network connections.
- **Assuming Allowed Means Safe:** Allowed domains may still pose privacy concerns; uBO Scope reports connections but does not classify domain safety.

---

## Behind the Scenes: Domain Parsing

uBO Scope relies on an advanced domain parsing library using Mozilla's Public Suffix List of recognized domain suffixes.

- This lets uBO Scope correctly determine the **registered domain** portion of any hostname.
- Accurate domain identification is crucial for grouping connection counts and badge reporting.

<u>For example:</u>

- The URL `https://sub.example.co.uk/path` extracts `example.co.uk` as the domain.
- Requests are tracked and aggregated at this domain level.

This approach ensures meaningful summaries aligned with real internet domain structures.

## Troubleshooting Glossary Confusion

If you notice unexpected results in the popup UI:

- **Empty Sections:** If a section like `blocked` or `stealth` shows no domains, that category had no recorded network events.
- **Badge Not Updating:** Requires the browser tab to have active network activity recognized by uBO Scope.
- **Domains Listed with Unicode Characters:** uBO Scope converts punycode-encoded domains into Unicode for readability.
