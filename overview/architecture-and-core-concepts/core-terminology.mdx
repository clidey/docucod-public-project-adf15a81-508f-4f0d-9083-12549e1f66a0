# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding key terms used throughout uBO Scope empowers you to accurately interpret the extension's data display, analyze its badge counts, and grasp the decision-making insights it provides. This glossary clarifies the foundational vocabulary appearing in the popup UI and documentation so you can navigate the tool confidently.

## What You Will Learn Here

- Definitions of fundamental terms like **allowed domain**, **blocked domain**, and **stealth domain**
- How these concepts relate to what you see in the user interface
- The meaning behind badge counts and how outcomes are determined for network requests

By mastering these concepts, you gain the vocabulary needed to make effective use of uBO Scope’s reports.

## Key Terminology Explained

### Allowed Domain

An **allowed domain** is a remote server domain from which your browser successfully fetched resources on the current webpage without any blocking interference. 

**Why it matters:** This count reflects the distinct third-party servers that actually delivered content to your browser, providing insight into what data you are truly retrieving during browsing.

**How you see it:** In uBO Scope’s popup interface, domains under the “not blocked” section represent allowed domains.

### Blocked Domain

A **blocked domain** corresponds to a remote server domain where your browser attempted to fetch resources, but the requests failed because a content blocker or another mechanism prevented those connections.

**Why it matters:** Blocked domains show you which remote servers tried to respond but were actively stopped, helping you understand what was filtered out during page load.

**How you see it:** These domains appear in the “blocked” section in the popup UI.

### Stealth Domain

**Stealth domains** represent connections that were intercepted invisibly or redirected without being reported as outright blocked by the content blocker. This may occur via stealth blocking techniques that alter requests before they complete, reducing detectability.

**Why it matters:** This category reveals requests that may have been suppressed silently by blockers trying to avoid detection by the webpage.

**How you see it:** You will find stealth domains listed under the “stealth-blocked” section in the popup.

## Additional Concepts

### Network Request Outcome

Every network request your browser initiates receives an outcome classification based on what happens:

- **Success:** The request completes and data is returned (allowed domain).
- **Error:** The request fails to complete due to blocking or network error (blocked domain).
- **Redirect:** The request is redirected, often used in stealth blocking (stealth domain).

Understanding these helps you interpret the extension’s reporting and how domains are categorized.

### Tab Details

uBO Scope tracks network activities on a per-browser-tab basis. Each tab maintains details including:

- The primary domain and hostname currently loaded
- Sets of domains classified as allowed, blocked, or stealth

This separation by tab enables precise correlation of connections to your browsing context.

### Badge Count

The number displayed on the extension’s toolbar icon is the count of **distinct allowed third-party domains** connected to on the active tab.

**Key insight:** A *lower* badge count means fewer unique third-party remote servers delivered content, indicating potentially better privacy or fewer external connections.

### Domain vs. Hostname

- **Hostname:** The full address part of a URL, such as `images.example.com`.
- **Domain:** The registrable domain derived from the hostname, for example `example.com`.

uBO Scope generally aggregates counts at the domain level for clearer analysis but retains hostname details internally.

## Practical Example Putting Concepts Together

Imagine you visit a news site:

- The popup shows the main site domain and subdomains actively connected.
- Under **allowed domains**, you see `cdn.newsprovider.com` and `analytics.partner.com`.
- Under **blocked domains**, you spot `tracking.adnetwork.com` which your content blocker stopped.
- Stealth domains could include `redirect.stealthblocker.local` representing requests silently intercepted.

The toolbar badge might read `2`, indicating two distinct third-party domains successfully loaded resources.

---

## Tips for Interpretation

- Don’t mistake a *high* block domain count for better blocking — focus on how many **allowed** third-party domains are contacted.
- Stealth domains may explain behaviors where requests don’t appear as blocked but were manipulated.
- Domains reported reflect actual connections at the network level, independent of webpage scripts.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Assuming all blocked domains are “bad” — some may be necessary for site functionality.
- Confusing hostname with domain — the extension normalizes and groups by domain for clearer insights.
- Ignoring stealth domains — these can indicate more subtle blocking mechanisms at work.
