# Key Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the core terms used in uBO Scope is essential for interpreting the extension’s reports accurately and making informed decisions about your browsing privacy. This page introduces the fundamental vocabulary — such as 'allowed connection', 'blocked connection', 'stealth connection', 'badge count', and 'third-party remote servers' — that shape your mental model when using uBO Scope.

## Allowed Connection

An allowed connection is a network request initiated by a webpage that successfully reaches a remote server without being blocked by any content blocker or network-level filtering. These connections represent resources or data that your browser actually downloads or exchanges.

- **Why It Matters:** Identifying allowed connections helps you know which external servers your current webpage communicates with, revealing real-world exposure and privacy implications.
- **Example:** When visiting a news site, allowed connections may include the main site’s servers, CDN nodes serving images, or analytics services.

## Blocked Connection

A blocked connection is a network request that was intercepted and prevented from reaching its intended remote server by content blocking mechanisms, such as uBlock Origin filters, DNS-level blocking, or browser security features.

- **User Benefit:** Seeing blocked connections lets you verify that your blocking tools are active and effective, ensuring unwanted tracking or ads are not loaded.
- **Important Note:** A high block count does not always mean better blocking quality; what truly matters is reducing allowed connections to unwanted third-party servers.

## Stealth Connection

Stealth connections are network requests that a content blocker has obscured from the webpage or other detection methods, making them invisible or disguised to prevent detection or circumvention of blocking.

- **Clarification:** uBO Scope reveals these stealth-blocked connections to give you full transparency beyond what regular blocker UIs provide.
- **Benefit:** Helps users and filter list maintainers monitor hidden activities undetectable by webpages or other tools.

## Badge Count

The badge count is the numerical indicator displayed on the uBO Scope toolbar icon. It reports **the number of distinct third-party remote servers** with which network connections were established on the active tab.

- **Key Insight:** The badge count focuses on the **number of unique third-party servers**, not the total number of requests or blocked items.
- **Privacy Implication:** A lower badge count typically reflects a more privacy-respecting browsing experience, with fewer external servers involved.
- **Note:** Third parties often include CDNs, analytics, ad networks, or other external hosts.

## Third-Party Remote Servers

These are servers that are external to the main website domain you are visiting and usually serve content such as ads, trackers, analytics, or cloud resources.

- **Why Third Parties Matter:** Connections to many third-party servers increase your digital footprint and potential privacy risks.
- **Legitimate Third Parties:** Not all are harmful; some provide essential services like content delivery (e.g., CDN providers).

## How These Concepts Fit Together

When you open uBO Scope's popup for a tab, it categorizes all observed network connections into these distinct groups—allowed, blocked, and stealth—giving you a clear snapshot of your browsing session’s exposure. The badge count offers a quick-at-a-glance privacy metric centered on the diversity of contacted third-party hosts.

Understanding these terms equips you to interpret the detailed connection lists shown and empowers you to better assess the effectiveness of your content blockers.

## Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- **Don't Rely Solely on Badge Count:** While a low badge count is good, always review connection details to understand which servers are contacted.
- **Stealth Connections Reveal Hidden Activity:** If you see stealth connections, that indicates network requests your content blocker handled silently.
- **Blocked Does Not Always Mean Better:** A higher block count can sometimes indicate more connections allowed that are then blocked, not necessarily stricter privacy.
- **Third-Party Connections Are Varied:** Verify the nature of third parties—some are safe while others may track or serve unwanted ads.
