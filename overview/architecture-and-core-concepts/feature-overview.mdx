# Quick Feature Overview

Discover the core features of uBO Scope through an intuitive mapping between its powerful capabilities and the seamless user interface. This page offers a concise, benefit-driven summary of how uBO Scope monitors and reports domain-level network requests, visualizes badge analytics, and delivers real-time per-tab statistics—all aligned with the main UI components users interact with. For technically curious users, we also briefly identify the key files that implement these features.

## Core Features at a Glance

### 1. Domain-Level Network Request Monitoring

uBO Scope continuously tracks all network requests initiated by browser tabs, focusing on the distinct remote domains accessed rather than individual requests. This domain-centric monitoring enables users to understand their exposure to third-party servers during browsing sessions.

- **User Experience:** Behind the scenes, the extension listens to network events such as request successes, errors, and redirects, categorizing them into allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked outcomes.
- **UI Mapping:** The "domains connected" summary count shown prominently in the popup interface reflects the number of distinct third-party domains contacted for the active tab, providing a straightforward privacy exposure metric.

**Example:** When you open a website, uBO Scope aggregates all third-party domains contacted across the page’s network requests, keeping an accurate count regardless of which content blocker you use.

**Implementation:** This functionality is primarily implemented in `js/background.js`, which leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to gather and categorize network request data per tab.

### 2. Badge Analytics on Toolbar Icon

The toolbar icon’s badge dynamically displays a count of distinct third-party domains that have successfully connected in the current tab. This real-time snapshot helps users quickly assess their privacy posture without opening the popup.

- **User Experience:** The badge updates reactively as page loads progress, growing or shrinking based on the domains that remain accessible.
- **UI Mapping:** This count is visible directly on the extension’s toolbar icon, serving as a compact privacy indicator.

**Example:** Navigating to a news site that loads resources from multiple ad networks results in a higher badge count, alerting you to the potential privacy impact.

**Implementation:** Badge updates are managed inside `js/background.js` using the browser’s action API, specifically via `browser.action.setBadgeText()`, triggered after network request analysis.

### 3. Per-Tab Statistics User Interface

uBO Scope offers a detailed breakdown of network connections for the active tab categorized by connection outcome, reflecting the underlying network observations in a clean, understandable format.

- **User Experience:** Through the popup UI, users see three distinct sections — **Not Blocked**, **Stealth-Blocked**, and **Blocked** domains — each listing domains with the number of requests made. This granular visibility helps users identify exactly which domains are contacted and how those connections are treated.
- **UI Mapping:** The main popup window (`popup.html`) presents this data using styled sections and a dynamic domain list with counts. The UI follows a modern, responsive design supporting light and dark modes seamlessly.

**Example:** Exploring the popup while on an e-commerce site reveals allowed domains such as CDN providers and payment gateways, stealth-blocked domains potentially related to trackers hidden from web pages, and fully blocked trackers.

**Implementation:** Rendering the UI components is handled by `js/popup.js`, which requests tab-specific data from the background script, deserializes it, and updates the DOM accordingly using helpers from `js/dom.js`. Styling and layout are managed by `css/popup.css`.

## Feature Implementation Structure

Below is a simplified view of how the main features correspond to the codebase structure:

| Feature                     | Main Implementing Files        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Network Request Monitoring  | `js/background.js`             |
| Badge Count Reflecting Domains | `js/background.js`          |
| Popup UI with Per-Tab Stats | `popup.html`, `js/popup.js`, `js/dom.js`, `css/popup.css` |

This clear separation allows each component to specialize: the background script efficiently captures and processes network data, while the popup handles presenting information in a user-friendly manner.

## Practical User Flow

1. **Browsing a Website:** As you navigate, uBO Scope invisibly records all network requests, focusing on third-party domains and their connection outcomes.

2. **Immediate Feedback:** Watch the toolbar badge update live, indicating how many distinct third-party domains are currently involved in the page’s network activity.

3. **In-Depth View:** Click the toolbar icon to open the popup. There, explore detailed domain lists divided by allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked categories, helping you assess the privacy exposure comprehensively.

4. **Continuous Monitoring:** Data updates continuously with browsing, and session persistence ensures your tracking data remains accurate until tabs are closed or refreshed.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Use Badge as Quick Indicator:** The badge count is your fastest way to gauge third-party network activity on any tab, allowing you to focus only on tabs with potentially high privacy exposure.

- **Explore Connections in the Popup:** Use the categorized domain lists to identify unexpected or suspicious third parties. This insight can inform your decisions on stricter blocking or custom filtering.

- **Understand Stealth-Blocked Domains:** Domains listed as stealth-blocked indicate connections that were prevented from fully loading to avoid web page detection, a nuanced privacy layer worth understanding.

- **Keep uBO Scope Updated:** While updates are rare, maintaining the latest version ensures the most accurate network visibility and integration with evolving browser APIs.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If the badge count does not update or the popup shows 'NO DATA':

- Ensure you have proper browser permissions enabled, especially the `webRequest` permission.
- Confirm you are viewing the network activity for an active and supported tab (tabs like extensions or internal pages may not provide data).
- Check for conflicts with other extensions that might block or hide network requests outside the API’s visibility.
- Restart your browser or reload the extension if problems persist.
