# Feature Overview of uBO Scope

## Instant Visibility into All Network Connections

uBO Scope brings you a clear, comprehensive snapshot of every network request your browser makes when you visit a webpage. Whether requests are allowed, stealth blocked, or outright blocked by content blockers or network rules, uBO Scope tracks and reports them in real-time.

### What You Get:
- Full tracking of **all network requests** initiated by webpages in your browser.
- Clear distinction between requests that are allowed, blocked, or stealth blocked.
- A clean, intuitive popup UI that summarizes connection details and domain counts.
- Toolbar badge showing the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected.
- Broad compatibility with major browsers — Chromium, Firefox, and Safari.

This feature set empowers you to gain unparalleled insights into the privacy and security status of your web browsing immediately upon installing the extension.

## Tracking Every Network Request

uBO Scope hooks into your browser's `webRequest` API to observe all outgoing network requests from webpages, regardless of the content blocker or blocking method in use. This means it:

- Includes connections that are allowed through.
- Captures connections that are blocked, including stealth blocking techniques.
- Reports outcomes consistently, so you see the full picture.

By leveraging browser APIs, uBO Scope guarantees the accuracy of connection status as reported by the browser itself.

## Outcome Reporting and Categorization

Requests are neatly categorized into three groups in the popup UI:

- **Allowed:** Requests that were permitted and successfully connected.
- **Blocked:** Requests blocked outright by content blockers.
- **Stealth Blocked:** Requests blocked in a way that hides blocking signals from webpages.

Each category lists the remote domains connected along with the count of requests to each, giving you actionable insight at a glance.

### Real-World Scenario:

Imagine you're visiting a news website. uBO Scope instantly reveals connections allowed to CDNs delivering images and scripts, blocks to common ad trackers, and stealth blocks protecting you from invisible tracking. This clarity helps you confidently gauge the site's network activity and your privacy level.

## Popup UI: Your Analytical Dashboard

By clicking the uBO Scope toolbar icon, you open a popup interface designed for quick understanding:

- Displays the base domain you are viewing.
- Shows the total count of distinct remote domains connected.
- Segregates connections by outcome with expandable lists.
- Presents Unicode domain names for readability.

This UI keeps information accessible yet detailed enough for experts and casual users alike.

> The badge count on the toolbar icon represents the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted — a lower count often indicates fewer trackers and better privacy.

---

## Badge Count Logic

The toolbar badge reflects **the number of distinct third-party remote servers that your browser connected to during the current tab's session**.

- Third-party means any domain external to the website you are visiting.
- The count accounts for both allowed and blocked connections.

This insightful metric allows you to quickly assess the third-party network footprint of the website you’re browsing.

### Why It Matters:

Many users mistakenly judge content blocker quality by raw block counts, which can be misleading. uBO Scope’s badge focuses instead on distinct connections, emphasizing actual third-party exposure — the true determinant of privacy impact.

---

## Browser Compatibility

uBO Scope works seamlessly across major browser platforms:

- **Chromium-based browsers:** Chrome, Edge, Brave, and others supporting Manifest V3.
- **Mozilla Firefox:** Full support with webRequest API.
- **Safari:** Compatible with Safari 18.5+ via Safari Web Extension APIs.

This ensures a consistent and dependable experience across your favorite browsers.

## From Installation to Daily Use

Upon installing uBO Scope, the extension immediately starts monitoring network connections for any active tab.

### Typical User Flow:
1. Install uBO Scope from your browser's extension store.
2. Open a webpage; uBO Scope automatically tracks all network requests.
3. Click the toolbar icon at any time to view the popup summary.
4. Review categorized connection lists and understand which third parties are active.
5. Use badge counts to get quick privacy signals without interrupting your browsing.

This workflow integrates effortlessly into your routine, enhancing browsing transparency without extra effort.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Remember that a lower badge count is better; many legitimate sites use few third-party servers (e.g., popular CDNs).
- Use uBO Scope alongside your content blocker to validate blocking effectiveness from a third-party connection perspective.
- If you notice unexpected high counts, dive into the popup to identify domains to investigate or block.
- The stealth blocking category helps uncover invisible protections your content blocker applies.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **No data shown in popup:** Ensure the active tab has completed some network activity; reload if necessary.
- **High badge counts despite blocking:** Some sites legitimately contact many servers; review connections for suspicious domains.
- **Limited data on some connections:** Network requests outside browser API scope (like native apps) aren’t reported.
