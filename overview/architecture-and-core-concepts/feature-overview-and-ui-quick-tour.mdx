# Feature Overview & Quick UI Tour

Discover how uBO Scope provides instant, actionable insights into your browsing activity through its intuitive interface and real-time indicators. This page guides you through the main features you'll encounter right after installation—enabling you to understand connection counts, domain lists, badge indicators, and filtering results effortlessly.

## Explore the Real-Time Domain Connection Analytics

uBO Scope actively tracks network requests per browser tab, categorizing remote server connections into three distinct outcomes: allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked. This real-time analytics capability empowers you to see exactly which third-party domains your browser communicates with on each page—and how these connections are being handled.

When you click on the uBO Scope toolbar icon, a popup interface displays detailed domain connection data for the currently active tab—giving you transparent insight directly at your fingertips.

## The Badge Indicator: Your At-a-Glance Summary

One of uBO Scope's core usability features is the badge indicator that appears on the toolbar icon. This badge shows a count of distinct third-party domains that your browser connected to _and allowed_.

- A **lower number** signals fewer active connections to third-party servers, aligning with stronger privacy.
- The badge updates **in real time** as each tab's network activity changes during browsing.

This simple visual cue enables immediate understanding of connection activity without opening the popup.

<Tip>
Keep in mind the badge reflects _allowed_ distinct domains, not blocked or stealth-blocked ones. This helps you focus on what data could realistically be shared with third parties.

## Popup UI: Rapid Domain Inspection and Filtering Results

Clicking the toolbar icon opens the popup UI, where you get a comprehensive breakdown of domain connections for the active tab:

- **Hostname & Domain Header:** The top section shows the full hostname and the base domain for the current webpage, helping you contextualize the network data.

- **Summary Count:** Displays the total number of unique domains connected to in this tab.

- **Domain Lists by Outcome:** Domains are grouped into three categories:
  - **Not Blocked (Allowed):** Domains your browser connected to without issue.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains that were blocked in a way designed to be stealthy to the webpage.
  - **Blocked:** Domains outright blocked.

Each list shows domain names along with a badge count indicating how many requests were made to that domain.

### How to Interpret Domain Counts

Each badge next to a domain represents the number of requests made to that domain within the active tab, helping you gauge the intensity or frequency of connections at a glance.

### Filtering and Results Intuition

- Domains listed as **allowed** indicate where content was fetched successfully.
- The **stealth-blocked** list highlights connections blocked in stealth, subtle but impactful for understanding hidden filters.
- The **blocked** section explicitly shows which domains were prevented from connecting.

This transparent categorization affords you a clear understanding of your browser’s network behavior at the domain level without needing deep technical analysis.

## Example Scenario: Immediate Benefit From Installation

Suppose you load an online news site. Right away, uBO Scope's badge might show a count like “4” on the active tab icon, indicating four unique third-party domains were contacted.

Click the icon:
- You see the main site's domain at the top.
- The allowed list includes the news site's CDN and analytics providers.
- The stealth-blocked section shows trackers silently blocked.
- The blocked list reveals ad servers prevented from loading.

This instant visibility gives you confidence about the privacy filters in action and what your browser is communicating.

## Practical Tips for Effective Use

- **Check the badge count frequently** as you browse to identify unexpected third-party connections.
- **Open the popup on any suspicious site** to inspect domains and see which connections are allowed or blocked.
- **Use the detailed domain breakdown** to inform which network patterns seem typical or intrusive.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- _Misinterpreting badge counts as total network requests:_ The badge counts unique _domains_, not every single request, to offer a meaningful privacy indicator.
- _Ignoring the stealth-blocked category:_ This subtle blocking can be easy to overlook but is key to understanding filtering behavior.

## Getting Started Preview

To experience these features:

1. Install uBO Scope from the appropriate web store for your browser.
2. Browse to a website and observe the badge update on your toolbar icon.
3. Click the icon to open the popup UI and explore the categorized domain lists.
