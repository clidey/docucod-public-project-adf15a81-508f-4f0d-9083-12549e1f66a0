# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the key concepts and terminology used in uBO Scope is essential to effectively interpret its network connection reports. This page explains the definitions and contexts of critical terms such as 'third-party remote servers,' 'badge count,' 'blocked/allowed/stealth domains,' and the role of `webRequest` monitoring. By mastering these, you will gain clarity on how uBO Scope reveals your browser's real network activity and the underlying data the extension reports.

---

## Third-Party Remote Servers

At the heart of uBO Scope's reporting is the notion of _third-party remote servers_. These are servers outside of the domain you are currently browsing that your browser connects to in order to load resources like scripts, images, ads, or trackers.

- **Definition:** A third-party remote server is identified by its _domain_, distinct from the domain of the website currently loaded in the browser tab.
- **Why domains matter:** uBO Scope groups network requests by domain, resolving hostnames to their registered domains (using a public suffix list) to avoid counting subdomain variations as separate entities.
- **Example:** If you are visiting `example.com`, a request to `ads.tracker.com` counts as a third-party connection to the domain `tracker.com`.

This concept helps you understand exposure to external entities beyond the website you intentionally visit.

---

## Badge Count

The toolbar icon of uBO Scope displays a **badge count** which is a key, real-time indicator:

- **What it shows:** The badge number is the count of **distinct third-party domains that the browser has successfully connected to on the current tab**.
- **Significance:** A _lower_ badge count is better, indicating fewer third-party connections.
- **Important distinction:** This is not a count of blocked connections or filter-list hits; it reflects domains from which your browser has actually fetched resources.

For users looking to maintain privacy or audit network requests, the badge count provides an accurate summary upfront.

---

## Blocked, Allowed, and Stealth Domains

uBO Scope categorizes third-party domains based on the outcome of network requests:

- **Allowed domains:** These are domains your browser successfully connected to and fetched resources from.
- **Blocked domains:** Requests to these domains were blocked by content blockers or failed to load (e.g., due to network errors). These are domains that were prevented from serving content.
- **Stealth-blocked domains:** Domains where redirections or blocking mechanisms operate silently, often hiding the blocking action from web pages. These are detected through indirect network events like redirects.

These categories allow you to see a clear distinction between what was allowed and what was blocked, giving transparency to network activity regardless of the blocking method used.

---

## WebRequest Monitoring

uBO Scope leverages the browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network connections:

- **How it works:** The extension listens to events about network requests starting, redirects, errors, and responses.
- **Key events:** 
  - `onBeforeRedirect` to detect redirects (used to identify stealth blocking).
  - `onErrorOccurred` to detect failed or blocked requests.
  - `onResponseStarted` to detect successful connections.
- **Data gathering:** Network requests are queued and processed to update the extension's internal structures tracking domains by category.

Because it depends on `webRequest`, uBO Scope reports only on connections visible to this API. Requests made outside this scope (such as WebSocket connections in some environments) are not reported.

---

## Domain Resolution and Public Suffix List

To avoid inflating counts with subdomains, uBO Scope uses the public suffix list to accurately identify registered domains:

- **Public Suffix List:** A comprehensive list maintained to categorize which domain parts represent registrable domains versus public suffixes.
- **Role in uBO Scope:** Hostnames are parsed to extract the base registered domain for grouping network contacts.
- **Benefit:** This avoids counting multiple subdomains of the same service as distinct third parties, providing a more meaningful count.

For example, `cdn.example.com` and `assets.example.com` count as one domain: `example.com`.

---

## Tab Details Tracking

The extension maintains per-tab detail records capturing the network request outcomes:

- **Tab details include:** 
  - The main hostname and domain of the page.
  - Separate collections for allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains and hostnames.
- **Badge updates:** When the set of allowed domains changes, the badge count is updated to reflect the current number of unique allowed third-party domains.
- **Tab lifecycle:** Details are cleared when tabs are closed to free resources and avoid stale data.

This granular tracking ensures that uBO Scope's reporting is always relevant to the active tab context.

---

## Practical Interpretation Tips

- The badge count reflects _distinct third-party domains connected to_, not the number of requests or blocked resources.
- Stealth-blocked domains hint at requests that were blocked or redirected in ways not visible to web pages.
- Allowed domains usually include essential content delivery networks (CDNs) or third-party services necessary for site functionality.
- Monitor the detailed panel (popup) to see these categorized domains with counts of requests.

## Summary

Mastering these core concepts empowers you to:

- Reliably interpret the badge count and detailed domain lists.
- Understand the real network exposure your browser has on each tab.
- Differentiate between allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains for accurate privacy auditing.
- Navigate the limitations and capabilities of `webRequest` API-based monitoring.

This foundation prepares you for advanced workflows, such as using uBO Scope for filter list maintenance or privacy analysis.

<Tip>
Understanding the distinction between _allowed_, _blocked_, and _stealth-blocked_ domains greatly enhances your ability to interpret what uBO Scope reports and how it reveals the true network interactions behind the scenes.
</Tip>

<Warning>
uBO Scope relies on the browser’s `webRequest` API: any requests not visible to this API will not be reported. For full visibility, ensure your browser supports and exposes these events accurately.
