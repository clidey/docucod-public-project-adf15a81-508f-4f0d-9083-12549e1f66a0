# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the fundamental concepts and terminology behind uBO Scope empowers you to gain clear insights into how network connections are tracked and categorized. This knowledge is crucial to interpreting the data you see and making informed decisions about your web privacy and content filtering.

---

## What Are Third-Party Remote Servers?

In the context of uBO Scope, a _third-party remote server_ is any server that your browser connects to which is **not the main domain of the website you are visiting**. Typically, websites pull resources from multiple domains such as content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics providers, ad networks, or other external services.

For example, if you visit `example.com` and your browser also requests scripts from `cdn.example.com` or `tracker.adservice.com`, these external domains are considered third-party remote servers.

Being able to identify these servers matters because they represent various entities that your browser interacts with beyond the site you intentionally visit.

---

## What Does a Connection Mean?

A _connection_ here refers to **a network request initiated by the browser** to load resources (like images, scripts, or stylesheets) or establish communication (e.g., WebSocket connections) with a remote server.

uBO Scope tracks each connection and groups them by the corresponding remote server domains and hostnames.

The purpose is to provide visibility into what your browser is communicating with, helping you evaluate your exposure to third-party services.

---

## Connection Outcomes and Their Significance

uBO Scope categorizes each connection into one of three outcomes, each signaling a specific interaction with the remote server:

- **Allowed (Not Blocked):** The connection was successful and not interfered with by any content blocker.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** The connection was blocked silently and stealthily, meaning the content blocker prevented it without triggering typical error notifications.
- **Blocked:** The connection was explicitly blocked, resulting in a failed request.

These distinctions help you understand whether a third-party server is reachable, silently filtered out, or actively blocked.

Knowing this allows for an accurate assessment of your exposure rather than relying on simple block counts that can be misleading.

---

## Badge Count Explained

The badge count displayed on the uBO Scope extension icon is a **real-time indicator of the number of distinct third-party remote servers** contacted by the active tab.

### Why This Matters:

- **Low count = better:** Fewer third-party servers contacted means a smaller attack surface and potentially better privacy.
- **Independent of block count:** The count does not reflect how many requests were blocked but how many unique external domains were contacted.
- **Insight into efficacy:** Helps understand how many external servers your browsing session touches, regardless of the blocker used.

This gives you a straightforward metric for evaluating the “network hygiene” of your browsing habits and the effectiveness of content blockers.

---

## Importance of Neutral and Accurate Analytics

uBO Scope takes a **neutral and purely observational** approach by reporting connections regardless of content blockers’ internal logic.

### Why Neutrality is Critical:

- It avoids bias towards any content blocker’s block counts.
- It provides an unfiltered, factual view of third-party activity.
- Users and filter list maintainers get reliable data for decision-making.

This approach helps debunk common misconceptions such as "more blocks means better blocking" by focusing on **distinct third-party servers contacted** rather than raw block or allow counts or misleading ad blocker test pages.

---

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Exploring a News Website
You open a news site whose main domain is `news.com`. uBO Scope identifies:

- Allowed connections to CDN providers: `cdn.news.com`
- Allowed connections to social media widgets: `social.network.com`
- Stealth-blocked connection to an ad network: `track.adserver.com`
- Blocked connection to a known malicious site: `bad.domain.net`

The badge count shows a modest number reflecting these distinct third-party servers contacted, informing you about potential privacy exposures.

### Example 2: Shopping on an E-commerce Site
Browsing your favorite online store at `shop.com`, uBO Scope detects:

- Multiple allowed connections to payment gateways.
- Several stealth-blocked tracking domains.
- Blocked connections to aggressive ad networks.

Here, knowing the outcomes reveals how much tracking or advertising is bypassed or blocked silently versus outright failures.

---

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Use the badge count as a core metric to assess exposure:** Focus on how many unique third-party domains your browser contacts.
- **Interpret stealth blocks as stealthy filtering:** These don’t show up as errors but indicate a blocker silently prevented connections.
- **Don’t rely solely on block counts:** High block counts can mask increased network exposure.
- **Review allowed domains regularly:** Legitimate third-party servers like CDNs usually appear here and should be distinguished from tracking or advertising domains.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Misunderstanding the badge count as total requests blocked.
- Assuming that every blocked connection is equally harmful.
- Trusting ad blocker test pages without considering real-world network behavior.
- Ignoring stealth-blocked entries, which can be the key to understanding subtle blocking activity.

---

## How This Fits Into Your Workflow

When you open the uBO Scope popup for the active tab, you see categorized lists of domains based on their connection outcomes:

- **Allowed:** Domains successfully contacted.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains filtered silently.
- **Blocked:** Domains where requests failed due to blocking.

This classification helps you quickly assess your browsing session’s network footprint and investigate potentially unwanted network contacts.
