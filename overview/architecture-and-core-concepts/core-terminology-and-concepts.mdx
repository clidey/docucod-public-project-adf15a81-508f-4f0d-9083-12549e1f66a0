# Core Terminology & Concepts

Understanding the language and indicators used within uBO Scope is essential for effectively interpreting the data it presents. This page demystifies the key terms you'll encounter in the UI and explains what the extension monitors — and what it does not.

---

## Understanding Key Terms

### Distinct Servers

- **What It Means:** The count of unique third-party server domains that your active browser tab connects to during a browsing session.
- **Why It Matters:** Minimizing the number of distinct third-party connections reduces your exposure to trackers and unwanted solicitations.
- 
### Third-Party Domains

- **Definition:** Any domain that is different from the domain of the active tab's website. For example, if you visit `example.com`, connections to `cdn.anotherdomain.com` count as third-party.
- **Context:** Not all third-party domains are harmful; many deliver essential content like fonts or APIs. However, high counts often indicate extensive cross-site tracking.

### Allowed Requests

- **What You See:** These are network connections that were successfully established and allowed by the browser and content blockers.
- **UI Indicator:** Shown under "not blocked" in the popup interface.
- **Example:** When a webpage fetches images, scripts, or stylesheets from a CDN that your content blocker permits.

### Blocked Requests

- **Description:** Connections that were explicitly blocked by content blocking mechanisms — whether by uBO Origin, DNS-based blocking, or other filters.
- **UI Indicator:** Listed under "blocked" in the popup.
- **Implication:** These represent known or suspected unwanted third-party connections prevented from loading.

### Stealth-Blocked Requests

- **Meaning:** These represent network requests that were intercepted and blocked silently by covert or stealth techniques in content blockers.
- **UI Indicator:** Visible under "stealth-blocked".
- **Significance:** Indicates sophisticated blocking where the webpage is not aware that the requests were prevented, enhancing privacy without detection.

## Interpreting UI Indicators

The uBO Scope popup organizes domains connected by the active tab into three categories corresponding to the request outcomes:

- **Not Blocked:** Domains where connection attempts succeeded.
- **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were silently suppressed.
- **Blocked:** Domains where connections were actively denied and visible as such.

Each domain is accompanied by a count showing how many requests involved that domain, helping you gauge their activity intensity.

The **summary** at the top displays the number of distinct domains connected, providing a quick snapshot of your tab's third-party exposure.

## What uBO Scope Monitors

- **Network Requests:** The extension listens to browser network events using the `webRequest` API to track every HTTP, HTTPS, WS, and WSS connection initiated by the active tab.
- **Request Outcomes:** It classifies requests as allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked based on their actual behavior reported by the browser.
- **Third-Party Distinction:** Connections are grouped and counted by their registered domain using the Public Suffix List to accurately identify the base domain.

---

## What It Does *Not* Monitor

- **Requests Outside Browser Reporting:** Network operations not visible to the browser's `webRequest` API, such as some internal or extension-generated requests, remain unreported.
- **Content of Requests:** uBO Scope tracks metadata about connections and their results but does not inspect payloads or content for privacy reasons.

---

## Practical Example

Imagine you open a news website (`news.example.com`). Within seconds, the page loads content from multiple servers:

- The site’s own server (first-party).
- A CDN delivering images (`cdn.examplecdn.com`).
- An analytics domain (`track.analytics.com`).
- A social media widget (`widgets.socialmedia.com`).

uBO Scope reveals all these domains, grouping them under allowed or blocked based on your content blocking settings. If your blocker stealth-blocks `track.analytics.com`, it shows under stealth-blocked with request counts, giving you visibility into what was suppressed without breaking the site.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Aim for Fewer Allowed Third-Parties:** A lower count of distinct allowed third-party domains translates into reduced data leakage and fewer tracking vectors.
- **Understand the Difference Between Blocked and Stealth-Blocked:** Not all blocking is overt. Stealth-blocked requests prevent detection by websites and help avoid breakage.
- **Use Domain Counts Contextually:** High request count from a single domain might indicate essential assets, whereas many different third-party domains often signal aggressive tracking.
- **Remember the Extension’s Scope:** uBO Scope reflects what the browser reports; some network activity beyond its reach won't be shown.

## Terminology Recap

| Term                | Meaning                                                        |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Distinct Servers    | Unique third-party domains contacted by the active tab        |
| Third-Party Domain   | Any domain different from the active tab's base domain         |
| Allowed Requests     | Connections successfully made and permitted                    |
| Blocked Requests     | Connections explicitly prevented by blocking mechanisms        |
| Stealth-Blocked      | Connections silently intercepted and blocked without detection |

By understanding these terms and the context of network requests shown, you can interpret the data presented by uBO Scope with clarity and confidence, empowering you to make informed decisions about your privacy and browsing behavior.
