# Quick Feature Walkthrough

Welcome to the Quick Feature Walkthrough of uBO Scope. This page provides an at-a-glance preview of the extension's core functionalities, designed to quickly orient new users. You’ll see how uBO Scope keeps you informed about every outgoing browser connection, renders badge counts transparently and accurately, remains independent from blocking filters, and aggregates easy-to-understand statistics on a per-tab basis.

---

## What You Will See Here

This walkthrough centers on the live data presentation within the extension's popup panel — the primary user interface where you can inspect real-time connection outcomes. It highlights key features that enable you to understand your browser’s third-party exposure without needing to dive into complex settings or technical jargon.

---

## Core Features at a Glance

### 1. Comprehensive Outgoing Connection Reporting
- uBO Scope reports **all** network requests your browser attempts, whether they succeed, fail, or are stealth-blocked.
- Connections are grouped and counted by distinct remote third-party domains, helping you understand exactly which servers your browser communicates with.

### 2. Accurate and Meaningful Badge Indicators
- The extension’s toolbar icon displays a badge showing the **number of distinct allowed third-party domains** connected in the active tab.
- Unlike many blockers, this count is transparent and independent — it doesn’t inflate numbers based on blocked requests and is unaffected by other content blockers.

### 3. Independence From Blocking Mechanisms
- uBO Scope focuses strictly on **reporting outcomes**: it does not block or modify requests.
- This independence ensures your insights reflect the reality of network activity regardless of which content blockers you use.

### 4. Detailed Per-Tab Statistics for Focused Analysis
- Data is tracked and presented on a **per-tab basis**, allowing granular inspection.
- The popup UI categorizes domains by their connection outcome — allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked — so you can quickly see which domains are reaching your browser.

### 5. Intuitive Domain Grouping and Domain Name Decoding
- Domains are automatically grouped using the Public Suffix List ensuring that counting and aggregation are meaningful.
- Domain names are displayed in Unicode (decoded from punycode) for clear readability, including internationalized domain names.

## How the Popup Interface Works

When you click the extension icon, the popup panel displays:  

- **The tab’s hostname and domain:** Helping you confirm which webpage context you are analyzing.
- **Summary badge:** Shows the total number of distinct domains your browser connected to.
- **Outcome sections:** Three clearly labeled sections list all third-party domains broken down by connection outcome:
  - **Not Blocked:** Connections successfully made.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections blocked in a way that the browser still reports them indirectly.
  - **Blocked:** Connections that failed outright or were blocked.

Each domain is accompanied by a count indicating how many individual requests to that domain were made.

## Real User Flow Example

Imagine you have just opened a news website. You click on the uBO Scope icon to check how many third-party domains your browser communicated with:

1. **Observe the badge number** on the toolbar icon reflecting active connections.
2. The popup shows the exact domains grouped neatly under “not blocked”, “stealth-blocked”, and “blocked” categories.
3. You see the precise counts per domain helping you identify which domains are the most active.
4. You verify that stealth-blocked domains reflect requests blocked stealthily by your other blockers, giving you direct evidence about their effect.

This transparency empowers you to make informed decisions about privacy and blocker performance.

## Practical Tips for Users

- **Use per-tab statistics to isolate privacy issues:** If you see unexpected domains in a particular tab, investigate which scripts or page elements trigger them.
- **Compare badge counts with and without other blockers:** Confirm that a lower badge count aligns with fewer distinct third-party connections.
- **Remember stealth-blocked connections are significant:** They indicate hidden blocking activity that often escapes detection by regular blockers.
- **Regularly check domains’ actual outcomes:** Seeing what connected versus what was blocked helps avoid misconceptions about the effectiveness of various blockers.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t rely solely on block counts displayed by content blockers to judge their effectiveness.
- Avoid trusting ad blocker test sites; they often misrepresent real-world blocking scenarios.
- Don’t overlook stealth-blocked domains, as these connections can still carry privacy risks.
