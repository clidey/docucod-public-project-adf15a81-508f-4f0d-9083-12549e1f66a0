# What is uBO Scope?

## Introducing uBO Scope: Your Window into Web Connections

Imagine being able to see all the invisible pathways a web page uses behind the scenes — every remote server it tries to connect to, whether it succeeds or not. That’s the essence of uBO Scope, a purpose-built browser extension that reveals every connection attempt a web page makes, providing insight far beyond traditional content blockers.

## What Exactly Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed specifically to expose all network connections — both attempts and successes — originating from web pages you visit. Unlike conventional ad blockers which primarily report on blocked requests, uBO Scope focuses on reporting the actual network activity by listing distinct third-party remote servers involved in page loading.

### The Core Purpose

- To inform users exactly which remote servers are *contacted* by web pages, regardless of whether the request was blocked or allowed.
- To enable deeper understanding of network behavior during web browsing, helping users evaluate content blockers and filter lists more accurately.
- To serve as a reliable tool for filter list maintainers and privacy-conscious users, offering transparent visibility into cross-origin connections.

### What Sets uBO Scope Apart?

- **Connection-Centric Reporting:** Instead of counting blocked resource hits, it counts distinct third-party remote servers connected, providing a clearer picture of network activity.
- **Independent of Content Blocker Internals:** Works regardless of which content blocker is active, showing network events based purely on what the browser reports.
- **Myth-Busting Capabilities:** Helps debunk common misconceptions about blocker efficiency driven by block count badges or unreliable test pages.

### How Does It Work? (At a High Level)

uBO Scope utilizes the browser's `webRequest` API to listen to network events such as redirects, errors, and successful responses. Each page load accumulates a detailed map of hostnames contacted, categorizing them based on connection outcomes. This data is aggregated and reported back visually, enabling you to see every distinct remote server involved in the page’s network footprint.

## Key User Value

- **Total Transparency:** See the full landscape of network connections initiated by sites you visit — revealing legitimate infrastructure like CDNs and potential tracking or advertising domains.
- **Better Decision Making:** Understand how different blocking rules impact actual connections instead of just block counts, allowing smarter filter adjustments.
- **Trustworthy Indicator:** The toolbar badge shows a meaningful metric — the number of distinct third-party remote servers connected — making it easier to assess and compare content blockers.

## Real-World Scenario

Picture browsing a news site with multiple ad networks and tracking domains potentially loading in the background. With uBO Scope running, you get a clear list of every third-party server your browser actually contacted — including those that slipped past your content blocker or were stealthily blocked — along with counts of connections per domain. This empowers you to tune your filters more precisely or verify claims made by other blockers.

## Getting Started Preview

To begin exploring with uBO Scope, install the extension from your browser’s web store, then start browsing as usual. The extension’s toolbar badge reflects the current tab’s connected third-party servers count, while the popup panel breaks down the connections into allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked domains — helping you analyze each web page’s network footprint.

For detailed installation instructions and usage tips, refer to the **[Installing uBO Scope](#)** and **[Your First Scan: Interpreting Popup Results](#)** guides.

<Tip>
Always remember: a lower connection count signifies a tighter network profile and potentially better privacy protection.

##### Note

uBO Scope does not block or modify requests; it monitors and reports. It works with any content blocker or alone, focusing on the visibility of network traffic rather than intervention.
