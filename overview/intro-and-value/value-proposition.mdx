# Why Use uBO Scope?

Understanding the breadth and nature of third-party connections a website attempts or establishes is crucial in today's web landscape. This page explains why uBO Scope delivers unparalleled visibility into these network activities, helping you protect your privacy and make informed decisions about content blocking.

## Discovering True Third-Party Connections

Every webpage you visit interacts with numerous servers behind the scenes—some essential, others intrusive. Unlike typical content blockers that focus on counting blocked requests, uBO Scope provides insight into the actual number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted, regardless of whether the requests were blocked or allowed.

Imagine you’re visiting a news website. Behind the scenes, multiple third-party servers might be involved—advertising networks, analytics platforms, content delivery networks (CDNs), and more. uBO Scope shows a clear, accurate tally of these connections, helping you understand the true scope of external communication.

**Why this matters:**

- **Privacy Awareness:** Knowing exactly which third parties connect through your browser exposes potential privacy risks.
- **Effective Blocking:** A lower number of distinct third-party connections usually means better privacy protection, even if block counts are lower.
- **Myth Busting:** Not all content blockers report block events consistently; uBO Scope’s focus on third-party contact is a more reliable indicator.

## The Badge: A Real-Time Score of Exposure

uBO Scope uses its toolbar badge to display the number of distinct third-party domains your current tab connects to. This simple yet powerful metric acts as a privacy score indicator: the lower the count, the fewer external servers accessed by the page.

### Key aspects of the badge:

- **Distinct Domains Counted:** It counts unique third-party domains connected, not raw request numbers.
- **Universal Measurement:** Works regardless of which content blocker or DNS blocking method is active, as long as the browser’s `webRequest` API reports the network activity.

_Example:_

If you visit a minimal blog page relying only on a CDN for static assets, your badge might show “1” — indicating a single third-party connection, which is often reasonable. Conversely, a complex site filled with trackers and ads might show a high number like “20”, signaling a significantly higher exposure.

## The Popup: Insight Beyond Numbers

Clicking the badge reveals a detailed popup that breaks down these connections into three outcomes:

1. **Not Blocked:** Third-party servers from which connections were successfully made.
2. **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were intercepted and stealthily blocked (hidden from the website).
3. **Blocked:** Connections that were explicitly blocked and reported as errors.

This triage helps you:

- Understand exactly which external domains are communicating with your browser.
- See what content blockers or security measures are blocking behind the scenes.
- Recognize stealth blocking, which avoids web page breakage by quietly suppressing requests.

For filter list maintainers and privacy researchers, this granular insight is invaluable for tuning rules and understanding real-world network behaviors.

## Why Precision and Business Logic Matter

uBO Scope uniquely combines business logic to accurately categorize network requests and uses the public suffix list to correctly identify domains from raw hostnames. This ensures:

- **Accurate Domain Attribution:** Distinguishes subdomains from registrable domains correctly, avoiding misleading counts.
- **Clear Outcome Classification:** Separates allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked requests based on actual network events recorded.

This precision translates to actionable data that helps users and filter list maintainers make informed decisions, improving privacy without guesswork.

## Common Misconceptions Debunked

<u>Myth:</u> A higher block count means a better, more effective content blocker.

<u>Reality:</u> High block counts can indicate more network requests occurring, hence more potential third-party connections. uBO Scope focuses on unique third-party contacts, a better metric for actual exposure.

<u>Myth:</u> Ad blocker test websites reliably evaluate content blockers.

<u>Reality:</u> Such test pages do not reflect real-world web complexities, and stealth blocking interferes with these tests. uBO Scope reveals what happens in real browsing scenarios.

## Summary: Why You Should Care

- **Get an honest view** of third-party server contact, beyond just block counts.
- **Protect your privacy** by monitoring the true exposure of your browsing activity.
- **Optimize content blocking** by understanding stealth vs explicit blocking.
- **Empower filter list maintenance** with detailed real-world data.

<u>Use uBO Scope as your transparency tool to see what the web quietly does under your browsing session—knowledge is the first step toward privacy.</u>

## Tips for Success

- Use uBO Scope **alongside your content blocker** to gain awareness of third-party exposure independent of blocking techniques.
- Note that some legitimate sites rely on few third-party services like CDNs; a low count is normal and often safe.
- Watch for unexpected high counts on sites you use frequently; these might indicate unwanted tracking.
- Filter list maintainers can leverage the popup data for rule validation and refinement.
