## Understanding the Target Audience

### Privacy-Conscious Users

If your goal is to maintain your digital privacy, uBO Scope empowers you to see exactly which third-party servers your browser contacts as you navigate the web. Unlike generic content blockers that only report block counts, uBO Scope reveals the **unique number of distinct third-party remote servers** your device attempts to reach or successfully connects to.

This visibility helps you:
- Identify and minimize unwanted third-party connections
- Verify that your content blockers work as intended
- Gain confidence in your browsing security by observing real connection outcomes

### Filter List Maintainers and Content Blockers

As someone maintaining or curating filter lists, especially on devices with limited debugging tools, uBO Scope is indispensable. It:
- Provides detailed insights on which remote servers are contacted, successful, blocked, or stealth-blocked
- Helps validate the effectiveness of new or existing filters by monitoring actual network traffic
- Supports analysis across platforms and devices without requiring deep browser debugging environments

### Advocates for Browser Transparency

If you seek to debunk misleading claims and myths around content blocking, uBO Scope offers hard facts. It enables you to:
- Verify what network requests are truly made or blocked, independent of content blocker reporting inconsistencies
- Disprove misleading assumptions like "higher block count means better protection"
- Understand the limits of popular "ad blocker test" webpages by comparing their artificial scenarios with real-world traffic


## Practical Use Cases

**Debunking Content Blocker Myths:**
Many users trust content blocker ratings solely based on block counts, but uBO Scope reveals the reality behind these numbers by showing the actual distinct third-party connections allowed.

**Verifying Network Requests on Any Device:**
On mobile or other constrained devices where advanced debugging tools aren’t available, uBO Scope helps you audit and confirm network behavior within your browser.

**Improving Privacy Through Informed Decisions:**
See exactly which connections succeed or fail, empowering you to adjust settings or blockers with full knowledge of their impact.

**Filter List Refinement and Testing:**
Maintainers can monitor stealth blocking and errors, optimizing lists to produce the desired blocking behavior without false positives or breakage.
