# What is uBO Scope?

## See Every Network Connection on a Webpage—Instantly and Transparently

uBO Scope is a lightweight browser extension designed to reveal all attempted or successful network connections initiated by any webpage you visit. Operating quietly in the background, it provides a clear, real-time view of which remote servers your browser connects to, including those that content blockers might let slip through.

### Why uBO Scope Matters

- **Unmask Hidden Connections:** Discover every third-party server your browser communicates with, even those obscured by content blockers or DNS filtering.
- **Accurate Third-Party Server Count:** The toolbar badge shows the exact number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted on the current page—less is better.
- **Debunk Common Myths:** Understand why high block counts or ‘ad blocker test’ pages don't always reflect real world effectiveness.
- **Complement Your Security Toolbox:** Use it alongside content blockers for precise insight and troubleshooting.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

Anyone interested in gaining deep visibility into webpage network activity, including:

- Privacy-conscious users wanting transparency beyond what blockers report
- Security analysts auditing network connections
- Filter list maintainers needing accurate connection data on restrictive devices
- Developers and curious users eager to understand web traffic flows

## What Is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension—compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Safari—that tracks and exposes each network request a webpage makes, showing you which remote servers are contacted, whether connections were allowed, blocked, or stealthily redirected.

Its core functionality revolves around listening to the browser’s `webRequest` API to log every network event related to page loads, including successes, errors, and redirects. This lets it paint a transparent picture of network behavior independent of the specific content blocker or network filtering you might have in place.

Unlike many other tools, uBO Scope reports based on the actual network events your browser observes, giving you factual, unfiltered data rather than heuristic or inferred block counts.

### Core Purpose

The extension is built to solve a single but critical problem:

> How can users know with certainty which distinct third-party servers their browser connected to when loading a webpage?

By focusing exclusively on this visibility, uBO Scope helps users assess the impact of content blockers accurately and spot any unexpected or potentially unwanted connections.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

- **Direct Network Event Monitoring:** Uses the browser's native webRequest listeners to capture real-time network outcomes.
- **Third-Party Server Focus:** Reports on distinct external domains, not just the sheer number of blocked or allowed requests.
- **Myth Busting:** Helps clarify common misconceptions around blocker performance metrics.
- **Simplicity & Efficiency:** Lightweight with minimal configuration; designed for transparency rather than filtering.

### How It Works at a High Level

When you load or interact with a page, the extension:

- Monitors all relevant network requests made by the page, including HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket connections.
- Tracks the hostname and registered domain of each connection.
- Categorizes each outcome as **allowed**, **stealth-blocked (redirected/overwritten without user notice)**, or **blocked**.
- Updates the browser toolbar badge to show the number of unique third-party domains contacted.
- Provides a detailed popup panel where you can review the live summary of connections.^

## Key Benefits of uBO Scope

- **Gain Absolute Clarity:** Understand the true extent of a webpage's network footprint.
- **Evaluate Content Blockers Properly:** Judge blockers by how many distinct third-party servers remain connected, rather than simple block counts.
- **Identify Stealth Redirects and Obscured Requests:** Spot connections that might be redirected or stealthily handled by blockers.
- **Aid Filter List Development:** Supports filter list creators by providing accurate connection data even on devices with limited browser debugging capabilities.

## Real-World Scenarios Where uBO Scope Shines

- **Privacy Audits:** When visiting unfamiliar sites, see exactly what third-party domains your browser talks to.
- **Comparing Blockers:** Confirm whether a blocker truly reduces third-party connections or just inflates block counts.
- **Troubleshooting Network Issues:** Detect if certain connections are failing or redirected unexpectedly.
- **Filter List Maintenance:** Validate filter effectiveness by observing allowed vs blocked server counts directly.

## How User Experience Improves

Before uBO Scope, users relied on block counts or misleading test pages that do not reflect real-world browsing. With uBO Scope, the experience shifts from guesswork to grounded insight. Users gain:

- Immediate feedback via the badge count about the diversity of third-party connections.
- A straightforward popup panel breaking down connections into allowed, blocked, and stealth categories for easy inspection.
- Confidence in understanding their browser’s network activity without needing complex setup.

## Getting Started With uBO Scope

1. **Install the Extension**
   - Available on [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp), [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/), and Safari.

2. **Browse Normally**
   - uBO Scope runs silently, collecting connection data for every active tab.

3. **Check the Toolbar Badge**
   - The number displayed represents the count of unique third-party remote servers contacted.

4. **Open the Popup Panel**
   - Click the extension icon to see detailed breakdowns of connected domains categorized by request outcome.

5. **Interpret the Data**
   - Use this insight to better understand your privacy exposure or the effectiveness of your content blockers.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- A **lower badge count is more desirable**, indicating fewer third-party contacts.
- Not all third-party domains are harmful; some are essential infrastructure like CDNs.
- Use uBO Scope in conjunction with your existing blockers for comprehensive protection.
- Avoid relying on ‘block count’ badges from blockers alone to evaluate effectiveness; trust uBO Scope’s third-party count.

<Tip>
Remember, uBO Scope is a transparency tool—it does not block or modify requests but reveals what actually happens under the hood.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting & FAQs">
<Accordion title="Why does the badge count sometimes increase after installing a blocker?">
A blocker might inflate block counts while still allowing connections to more distinct third-party servers. uBO Scope’s unique count helps clarify this apparent paradox.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can uBO Scope detect all network requests?">
It reports all requests visible through the browser's `webRequest` API. Requests made outside this API's visibility cannot be detected.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is a high block count always better?">
No. A higher block count can coexist with a higher number of distinct 3rd-party servers contacted, indicating less effective blocking. Monitor third-party server counts instead.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does uBO Scope handle stealth blocking or redirects?">
Connections that are redirected or intercepted silently are categorized in the "stealth-blocked" section to help reveal hidden network behaviors.
