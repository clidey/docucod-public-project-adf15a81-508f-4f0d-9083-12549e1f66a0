# Who Is This For & Primary Use Cases

## Understanding the Audience for uBO Scope

uBO Scope is crafted to serve a distinct group of users who seek deep visibility and control over network connections initiated by web pages. Its specialized focus on reporting all remote server connections makes it particularly valuable to privacy-conscious individuals, filter list maintainers, and those evaluating content blockers beyond surface-level metrics.

### Core Audiences

- **Privacy-Conscious Users:**
  Individuals who want a transparent look at every network connection their browser attempts, helping them better understand third-party tracking and minimize unnecessary exposure online.

- **Filter List Maintainers:**
  Contributors to filter lists who rely on precise, real-world network data to craft more effective blocking rules, especially on devices where standard developer tools are constrained or unavailable.

- **Content Blocker Evaluators:**
  Those assessing the effectiveness and stealth capabilities of content blockers by verifying which connections are truly blocked, stealth-blocked, or allowed — cutting through misleading badge counts or unreliable test pages.

## Primary Use Cases: Bringing Transparency and Clarity

### 1. Evaluating Real Web Connections

uBO Scope reveals the actual third-party domains and hostnames a webpage connects to during browsing, enabling users to:

- See a comprehensive list and count of connected domains — not just blocked requests.
- Assess the legitimacy of third-party connections, differentiating essential content delivery networks (CDNs) from tracking or advertising domains.
- Gain insights that inform privacy decisions based on concrete, rather than assumed, network behavior.

### 2. Verifying Stealth Blocking

Many content blockers employ stealth techniques to avoid detection and reduce web page breakage. uBO Scope helps users and maintainers by:

- Reporting domains that are stealth-blocked — connections that are prevented without obvious browser-visible blocking.
- Clarifying which requests are silently intercepted, offering a truthful picture of content blocker performance.

### 3. Supporting Filter List Development on Restricted Platforms

Filter list maintainers benefit from using uBO Scope, especially when access to full browser devtools is limited or unavailable (e.g., on certain mobile platforms or locked-down environments):

- Access network request outcomes captured by the browser-level `webRequest` API.
- Make informed updates to filter lists based on real connection data, increasing filter efficacy.
- Rely on a lightweight, focused tool that complements development workflows without heavy overhead.

### 4. Avoiding Common Pitfalls in Assessing Content Blockers

uBO Scope debunks common misconceptions by showing users:

- The number of blocked requests alone is a poor indicator of blocker quality.
- How a high block count may mask a greater overall exposure to distinct third-party servers.
- Why ad-blocker test webpages often provide misleading results, unlike real-world traffic analysis.

## Typical Scenarios

- **A privacy enthusiast installs uBO Scope alongside their content blocker to see exactly which third parties their browser is connecting to and to evaluate how stealthy blocking is working.**

- **A filter list maintainer uses uBO Scope on a device with restricted developer tools to validate that their blocking rules successfully prevent unwanted domains from loading.**

- **A user assesses two content blockers by comparing the distinct allowed remote servers that remain visible during page loads rather than relying on toolbar badge numbers.**

- **Developers or researchers working on content filtering technologies gather network request outcomes directly from the browser-level API to analyze stealth and blocking behaviors under various conditions.**

## Practical Tips for Users

- Always interpret uBO Scope’s domain lists in context; a low distinct third-party count indicates better privacy.
- Use the differentiation between “not blocked,” “stealth-blocked,” and “blocked” to understand how your content blocker interacts with network requests.
- Combine uBO Scope’s insights with your content blocker settings to fine-tune privacy and functionality trade-offs.

## Summary

uBO Scope empowers users who demand clarity on what web connections are truly occurring in their browser. Whether you are guarding your privacy, maintaining effective filter lists, or rigorously testing content blockers, uBO Scope reveals network realities that other tools obscure. This focused visibility leads to better-informed choices and stronger privacy enforcement.
