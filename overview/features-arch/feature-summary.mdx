# Quick Feature Overview

Discover how uBO Scope delivers real-time transparency into the unique third-party connections initiated during your browsing sessions. This page summarizes the extension's core features that empower you to monitor, understand, and assess every remote server interaction without relying on or being limited by any particular content blocker.

---

## What You Will Gain from This Page

Gain a clear, benefit-driven snapshot of uBO Scope’s distinctive capabilities including how it tracks third-party domains, displays results through the toolbar badge and popup interface, and operates independently from existing content blockers and DNS filters. This knowledge will help you leverage uBO Scope effectively to achieve privacy-aware browsing and precise network request insight.

---

## Real-Time Tracking of Unique Third-Party Connections

At the heart of uBO Scope is its ability to monitor all remote network connections a webpage attempts or successfully establishes. Unlike simple block counters, uBO Scope:

- Tracks **distinct third-party remote servers** by domain, not just counts of blocked resource requests.
- Maintains this count independently of whether connections are allowed, blocked, or stealth-blocked by content blockers or DNS filtering.

This means you always know exactly how many unique third-party domains your browser is interacting with on any given page, giving you a more meaningful privacy metric.

### Why This Matters
Because many content blockers display block counts that can be misleading, uBO Scope’s focus on unique third-party domains helps you understand:

- The **true exposure** of your browsing activity to external domains.
- Whether a blocker allows connections from more domains despite a high block count.
- How many distinct sources are actually loaded, which is a stronger indicator of privacy risk.

## Detailed Network Request Reporting via Popup Interface

Clicking the toolbar icon reveals a **comprehensive popup** that breaks down all observed domains into three clear categories:

- **Not Blocked (Allowed)**: Domains from which connections were successful.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Domains that content blockers quietly blocked without obvious signals.
- **Blocked**: Domains where connections were explicitly blocked with errors.

Each section lists domains with an indication of how many requests were made to each, allowing you to drill down into the details of your page’s network behavior.

### Using the Popup Effectively
- Quickly identify domains that may be silently tracking you.
- Distinguish true blocks versus connections allowed through filter exceptions or stealth blocking.
- Assess the effectiveness of content blockers from a domain-level perspective.

---

## Independence from Content Blockers and Filters

uBO Scope implements monitoring using your browser’s `webRequest` API, which tracks network requests regardless of which content blockers or DNS filters are active. This enables:

- **Complete visibility** into network requests, capturing all allowed or blocked connections.
- Accurate counts that are not influenced by specific blocker implementations.
- Support for uncovering misleading blocker metrics or stealth blocking behaviors.

This feature frees you from dependency on any single blocker’s reporting mechanisms, offering unmatched transparency.

## Toolbar Badge: Your At-A-Glance Privacy Meter

The extension’s toolbar icon dynamically displays a **badge count** representing the number of distinct third-party domains with connections on the current tab. This badge:

- Updates in real time as you navigate and new requests occur.
- Encourages keeping the count low to reduce privacy risks.
- Serves as an immediate visual indicator of your browsing exposure.

### Practical Tip
If you see a high badge count on a site, use the popup to investigate exactly which domains are involved and understand what data might be shared.

## Summary of Core Features

- **Distinct third-party domain counting** — Track unique remote servers involved in page load.
- **Dynamic toolbar badge** — Real-time visibility directly from the browser interface.
- **Comprehensive popup interfaces** — Detailed domain lists categorized by connection outcome.
- **Content blocker agnostic** — Works regardless of installed ad blockers or DNS filters.
- **Insight into stealth blocking** — Reveals subtle network restrictions that typical tools miss.

---

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine you visit a news website. The toolbar badge shows 15 distinct third-party domains connected during page load. Opening the popup reveals:

- 10 domains successfully loaded (content, ads, analytics).
- 3 stealth-blocked domains indicating some fine-grained blocking.
- 2 explicitly blocked domains that your content blocker prevented.

With this data, you can decide whether your content blocker is allowing connections you didn’t expect or if stealth blocking is acting silently. This transparency supports better privacy decisions.
