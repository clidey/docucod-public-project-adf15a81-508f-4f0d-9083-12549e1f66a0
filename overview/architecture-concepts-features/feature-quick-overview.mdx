# Feature Quick Overview

Discover the core capabilities of **uBO Scope**—a powerful yet lightweight browser extension designed to provide instant clarity on your browser's network activity. This page offers a focused summary of the extension's primary features, enabling you to quickly grasp what it does and how it adds value every day.

---

## Real-Time Connection Tracking

At its heart, uBO Scope continuously monitors all network requests your browser makes while visiting webpages. It tracks these requests live, showing you up-to-the-second details about connection attempts to remote servers. This immediate feedback allows you to see network activity as it happens, empowering you to assess resource origins with confidence.

**Example:**
- When loading a news site, you instantly observe which third-party servers are contacted for ads, analytics, or content delivery.

## Distinct Third-Party Server Tallies

Instead of providing just a raw count of blocked or allowed requests, uBO Scope focuses on the number of *distinct third-party remote servers* engaged by each tab. This distinct count helps you understand your actual exposure to external entities without being misled by inflated request totals.

- A lower number signals fewer third-party connections, often translating to better privacy.
- The toolbar icon badge always reflects this distinct count, giving you a quick privacy snapshot at a glance.

## Visibility into Blocked and Allowed Requests

The extension categorizes remote connections into three clear outcome groups:

- **Allowed**: Requests that successfully connected to remote servers.
- **Stealth-Blocked**: Requests intercepted or redirected stealthily (often by content blockers).
- **Blocked**: Requests that failed or were explicitly blocked.

Inside the popup interface, you can explore detailed domain-level breakdowns within each category, helping you identify which third parties are active, which ones are blocked, and which operate stealthily.

## Compatibility Across Browsers and Content Blockers

uBO Scope works seamlessly with major browsers, including Firefox (minimum version 128), Chromium-based browsers (minimum Chrome 122), and Safari (minimum version 18.5). It supports content blocking at various layers—including extension-based blockers and DNS-level filtering—leveraging the browser’s `webRequest` API to reliably capture network events.

> **Note:** Network requests made outside the browser’s `webRequest` API reach (such as those in sandboxed or restricted contexts) cannot be reported.

## Designed for Daily Practical Value

Intended as a quick-scan overview, this feature summary sets clear expectations:

- Understand what uBO Scope monitors and reports without wading through technical jargon.
- Learn the significance of badge counts and domain tallies.
- Get a feel for how this tool fits into real-world workflows such as verifying content blocker effectiveness or troubleshooting unexpected network access.

## How uBO Scope Fits Into Your Workflow

1. **Install and enable the extension on your browser.**
2. **Browse as usual, and keep an eye on the toolbar icon badge.** The badge instantaneously reports the number of distinct third-party remote servers contacted.
3. **Click the toolbar icon to open the popup panel** and review detailed connection outcomes per domain, categorized by allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.
4. **Use this insight to evaluate privacy exposure** and the effectiveness of your content blockers.

## Practical Tips for Using These Features

- A *lower badge number* is generally better, indicating fewer third-party connections.
- Investigate domains listed under **Blocked** and **Stealth-Blocked** to understand how content blockers and stealth mechanisms protect you.
- Use uBO Scope alongside your existing content blockers to validate their practical impact.
- Remember uBO Scope reports connections as observed by the browser's network layer—some connections outside this scope aren't captured.

## Common Pitfalls and Guidance

- Don't equate a higher count of blocked requests with better blocking. Focus on distinct third-party server counts.
- Avoid relying on popular but unrealistic 'ad blocker test' pages to judge blocker performance; use uBO Scope’s real network insights instead.
