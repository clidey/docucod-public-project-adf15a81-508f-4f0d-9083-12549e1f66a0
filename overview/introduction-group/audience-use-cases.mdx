## Tailored for Privacy-Conscious Users

If you care deeply about your online privacy and want complete transparency over everything your browser attempts to connect to, uBO Scope is designed for you. It reveals every third-party remote server connection initiated by the webpages you visit, including those allowed, stealthily blocked, or outright blocked.

- **What you gain:**
  - Full visibility into third-party domains contacted during browsing.
  - Accurate insight into whether content blockers are effective.
  - Confidence in understanding privacy exposures with minimal technical overhead.

### Real-World Scenario
Imagine you regularly visit news sites or social platforms and want to confirm your blockers are preventing tracking from ad networks or trackers. With uBO Scope, you can quickly check the popup and toolbar badge to see how many distinct remote domains are contacted and whether requests were allowing or blocked.

## Essential Tool for Filter List Maintainers

Maintaining content blocking filter lists requires deep insight into network requests and outcomes. uBO Scope serves as an unbiased measurement tool that captures network connections regardless of any active content blocker, spotlighting both allowed and stealth-blocked connections.

- **What you gain:**
  - Independent verification of filter performance.
  - Granular tracking of third-party domains that slip through filters.
  - Data supporting improvements of filtering rules based on real browser behavior.

### Real-World Scenario
As a filter list maintainer, you want to validate if your filters silently allow unwanted connections or if stealth blocking is occurring. uBO Scope offers a definitive view, allowing you to fine-tune your lists and improve user privacy.

## Independent Verification for Researchers and Advocates

If you investigate or advocate for privacy online, you need a trustworthy tool that sidesteps the pitfalls of misleading block counts or synthetic test pages.

- **What you gain:**
  - Transparent, real-world network request data not influenced by extension-specific reporting tricks.
  - Ability to debunk myths about content blocker reliability.
  - Empirical data for privacy audits and assessments.

### Real-World Scenario
When assessing claims about which blocker is better, you use uBO Scope as an objective data collector. Rather than relying on opaque block counts or unreliable test websites, you see the actual number of third-party domains contacted during typical browsing.

## When to Use uBO Scope

uBO Scope is most useful in situations such as:

- **During routine browsing** to continuously monitor third-party connections.
- **When installing or comparing content blockers** to verify their real impact on blocking third parties.
- **While debugging or troubleshooting privacy concerns** caused by hidden or stealthy network requests.
- **When developing or maintaining filter lists** to gauge the effectiveness of your rules.
- **For independent audits or privacy research** that require accurate, browser-driven connection data.


## Practical Tips for Users

- Always pay attention to the toolbar badge—the number reflects the count of distinct third-party domains contacted, not simply requests made.
- Use the popup panel to explore detailed domain lists sorted by allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked outcomes.
- Combine uBO Scope insights with your content blocker’s logs to understand both observed network activity and blocking decisions.

<Info>
Remember: A lower badge count indicates fewer third-party connections and better privacy. However, some third parties such as major CDNs can be legitimate and unavoidable.
