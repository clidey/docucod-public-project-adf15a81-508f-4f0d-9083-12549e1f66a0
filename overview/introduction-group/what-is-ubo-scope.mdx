# What is uBO Scope?

Experience full transparency into the network activity of the websites you visit with **uBO Scope**—a powerful browser extension designed specifically to reveal every network request webpages make, whether those connections succeed or are blocked. It puts you in control by exposing all third-party remote servers your browser attempts to reach, helping you understand and monitor your online privacy landscape at a glance.

## The Power of Seeing All Network Requests

Unlike many tools that focus exclusively on blocking content or counting blocked requests, uBO Scope reveals the *complete picture* of network connections initiated by webpages. This means whether a network request was allowed, stealthily blocked, or outright stopped, uBO Scope captures and displays it.

### What Makes uBO Scope Unique?

- **Comprehensive Visibility:** Shows every third-party connection browsers attempt to make, not just blocked attempts.
- **Badge Counter for Distinct Connections:** The toolbar badge tells you the number of *distinct* third-party remote servers your browser connected to for the current tab, offering a concise privacy snapshot.
- **Accurate Outcome Reporting:** Differentiates between allowed, stealth-blocked, and blocked connections for clear insight.
- **Filter-List Maintainer Friendly:** Designed to assist maintainers with real-world data on connections.

### Who Should Use uBO Scope?

- Privacy-conscious users wanting to verify third-party connections transparently.
- Filter list maintainers seeking data to improve blocking lists based on actual network behavior.
- Researchers and developers analyzing the effectiveness of content blockers and measuring network request outcomes.

## What is uBO Scope?

uBO Scope is a browser extension companion to uBlock Origin that actively monitors your browser's network requests for each website tab. It collects data in real-time about third-party servers involved during page loading, then presents this information through an intuitive toolbar popup and a badge count.

### Core Purpose

Webpages can establish numerous third-party connections for ads, tracking, CDN resources, or embedded content. While content blockers prevent many of these, users rarely see the full story of what was attempted behind the scenes. uBO Scope solves this by:

- Revealing the *complete set* of connection attempts, not just those blocked.
- Showing which servers successfully connected and which were blocked stealthily or explicitly.
- Providing actionable insight so users can measure privacy impact beyond raw block counts.

### Key Differentiators

Unlike traditional content blockers or simplistic counters, uBO Scope's badge displays the number of *distinct third-party domains* your browser reached—meaning fewer and more relevant connections lead to a smaller badge count, reflecting effective privacy protection.

## How uBO Scope Works (At a Glance)

The extension hooks into your browser's `webRequest` API to monitor network requests as webpages load and interact. For each browser tab, it:

- Tracks all remote server connections, associating requests by domain and hostname.
- Categorizes outcomes into three groups:
  - **Allowed:** Connections that completed successfully.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Connections that were redirected or stealthily blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Connections explicitly blocked due to errors or filtering.
- Updates the badge count dynamically to reflect the number of *distinct allowed third-party domains*.
- Offers an easy-to-read popup listing all these connections grouped by their outcome.

While users don’t need to understand the internal workings, this system ensures reliable, transparent measurement untouched by content blockers' stealth tactics or DNS-based blocking.

## Key Features of uBO Scope

- **Toolbar Icon Badge:** Displays the count of unique third-party domains with allowed connections on the current tab. This quick visual feedback helps you instantly gauge the extent of third-party access.
- **Popup Panel:** Clicking the icon reveals a detailed breakdown—listing all connected domains split into "not blocked," "stealth-blocked," and "blocked" categories, with counts for each.
- **Real-Time Updates:** The extension collects data live as you browse, ensuring the badge and popup reflect the current tab’s state.
- **Robust Domain Parsing:** Uses a public suffix list to accurately identify registered domains from hostnames for meaningful grouping.

## Why uBO Scope Matters

Existing content blockers often focus on the number of requests blocked or allowed, but this can be misleading. uBO Scope reframes the picture by reporting on network outcomes at the domain level rather than individual requests.

This approach helps you:

- Validate the *actual* third-party servers your browser contacts, revealing potential privacy exposures.
- Debunk common misconceptions such as "more blocks means better protection" by focusing on connections *allowed* instead.
- Detect stealth blocking tactics or upstream DNS blocks that typically escape other tools.

## Real-World Example

Imagine browsing a news website. Without uBO Scope, you might only see how many individual requests were blocked but not how many third parties ultimately loaded content successfully. With uBO Scope:

- Your browser might contact 3 distinct CDNs (allowed).
- Attempt connections to 5 trackers that were blocked stealthily.
- Fail to connect to 2 additional servers that were explicitly blocked.

The toolbar badge number would be "3", reflecting those 3 connected third parties — a clear indicator of the site's third-party footprint.

## Getting Started Preview

- Upon installation, uBO Scope adds an icon with a badge to your browser toolbar.
- Browse as usual; the icon updates per tab to reflect real-time third-party connections.
- Click the icon to open a popup showing detailed domain connection statistics.
- Use the information to assess your exposure or to verify the effectiveness of your content blocker.

<Tip>
Always interpret the badge count as the number of distinct third-party domains *allowed* by the content blocker. A lower badge count means fewer external connections and generally better privacy.
</Tip>

<Note>
uBO Scope does not block any content itself; it is purely a monitoring and reporting tool complementary to content blockers like uBlock Origin.
</Note>

<Warning>
Network requests outside the browser’s `webRequest` API scope, such as those made by native apps or non-monitored browsers extensions, will not be reported.
