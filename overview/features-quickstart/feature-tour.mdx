# Feature Tour & Main Workflow

## Discovering uBO Scope: Your Window Into Browser Network Connections

When you install uBO Scope, you're equipping your browser with a powerful, real-time monitor that reveals every network connection your browser makes, including third-party servers that are allowed, stealth-blocked, or fully blocked. This page provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the main user journey to help you quickly understand how to use the extension to gain instant visibility into your browsing activity.

---

### Step 1: Install the Extension

Begin by installing uBO Scope from your preferred browser's extension store. Whether you're on Chrome, Firefox, or another supported browser, installation is straightforward:

- Visit the official extension page (e.g., [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/)).
- Click **Add to Browser** and follow prompts.

_Tip: Only install the official extension to ensure security and data accuracy._

---

### Step 2: Open a Browser Tab for Monitoring

After installation, navigate to any website you want to inspect. uBO Scope starts collecting network connection data for each tab independently and continuously in the background. This means you don't need to configure anything upfront to begin seeing your browser's connections.

---

### Step 3: Click the Toolbar Icon to Open the Popup

Click the uBO Scope icon in your browser's toolbar. This action opens the extension's popup interface, providing a clear, real-time summary of all third-party network connections observed for the active tab.

- **Toolbar Badge:** The small number displayed on the extension icon represents the total number of distinct third-party domains you've connected to on the current page.

---

### Step 4: Understand the Breakdown in the Popup

The popup breaks down observed connections into three key categories:

| Section           | Description                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not Blocked**   | Remote servers from which connections were allowed and successful. These are the third-party domains your browser communicated with openly.
| **Stealth-Blocked** | Connections that were intentionally hidden or stealth-blocked by content blockers. These requests were intercepted to prevent detection or web breakage.
| **Blocked**        | Network requests that were fully blocked and never completed, indicating stronger privacy enforcement.

Each section lists third-party domains along with the number of connection attempts observed.

### Example of Using the Popup

Suppose you open a news website and click the uBO Scope toolbar icon. Immediately, you see:

- A domain summary header showing the main site’s hostname.
- The total count of distinct third-party domains connected.
- Detailed lists showing which domains were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

This instant feedback empowers you to inspect how many and which external parties the page communicates with, helping you make informed decisions about your privacy.

### How uBO Scope Enhances Your Browsing Transparency

- **Real-Time Visibility:** See ongoing network activity as you browse.
- **Independent Insight:** Data is captured regardless of which content blocker you use, reflecting actual network behavior.
- **Easy Interpretation:** The categorized popup display lets you quickly digest complex network data.

---

## Practical Tips for Using the Main Workflow

- **Regularly Check Badge Counts:** A higher count often means more third-party sites communicating, which may impact privacy.
- **Use the Popup to Validate Content Blockers:** Compare domains listed under blocked or stealth-blocked to confirm your blockers are effective.
- **Look for Unexpected Domains:** Seeing unknown or suspicious domains can highlight privacy risks or potential tracking.

<Warning>
The popup data only reflects network requests visible through the browser's webRequest API. Requests made outside this scope (e.g., some browser internals) won’t be reported.
</Warning>
