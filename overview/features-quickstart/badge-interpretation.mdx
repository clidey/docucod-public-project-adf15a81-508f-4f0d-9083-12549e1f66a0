# Understanding the Toolbar Badge

The toolbar badge in uBO Scope is your at-a-glance indicator of third-party network activity on the active browser tab. It displays the count of unique third-party remote servers the current tab has contacted, giving you instant insight into the page’s privacy footprint without opening the detailed popup.

## What Does the Badge Count Represent?

The badge number quantifies *distinct* third-party domains your browser connected to during the lifetime of the current tab. Specifically, it counts unique third-party **remote servers** involved in network requests initiated by the webpage.

A "third-party" in this context is any remote server that is *not* the main domain (or its subdomains) of the website you're visiting. For example, if you are on `example.com` and the page loads resources or makes connections to `cdn.example.com`, that is typically considered first-party or same-party. However, `analytics.com` or `ads.net` would be third-party domains.

<u>Key Point:</u> The badge reflects only *third-party* domains contacted, not the total number of connections or requests.


## Why Lower Badge Counts Mean Stronger Privacy

A lower badge count directly correlates with fewer distinct third-party connections, which generally means tighter content blocking and less exposure to external trackers or advertisers.

- **Fewer third-party connections = stronger privacy** because your browser interacted with fewer external parties.
- **A zero or very low badge count indicates highly restricted third-party content**, effectively minimizing tracking and potential privacy risks.

However, it's essential to understand that a non-zero count is not automatically bad. Many sites legitimately rely on a small set of trusted third-party services like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), which are common and pose minimal privacy concerns.

## What the Badge Does NOT Tell You

- It does *not* count every network request — only unique third-party domains.
- It does not distinguish between malicious or benign third parties; it simply counts them.
- It does not indicate which content blockers are active or which requests were blocked or allowed.


## How Does uBO Scope Track These Connections?

Behind the scenes, the extension listens to browser network events through the `webRequest` API. This allows it to track all network requests made by the browser regardless of which content blocker is currently in use.

It classifies network requests into outcomes:

- **Allowed**: Requests that completed successfully.
- **Blocked**: Requests that were prevented from completing.
- **Stealth-blocked**: Requests that appear to have been silently interrupted or redirected.

Only the *allowed* third-party servers contribute to the toolbar badge count.


## Real-World Scenario: Interpreting the Badge

Imagine you visit a news website:

1. The main page loads from `news.example.com`.
2. It fetches images and scripts from `cdn.exampleassets.com` (a CDN).
3. The site also contacts trackers at `tracker.adsnetwork.com` and `analytics.reporter.com`.
4. Your content blocker blocks some tracker requests.

- The badge shows `2` because only the distinct allowed third-party servers (`cdn.exampleassets.com` and whichever trackers got through) are counted.
- If your content blocker improved and blocked all trackers, the badge would reflect `1`, only counting the CDN.


## Practical Tips for Users

- **Use the badge as a quick privacy indicator.** Lower is better, signifying fewer third-party connections.
- **Don’t assume a zero count means the site is tracker-free.** Some trackers could be first-party or embedded differently.
- **Recognize legitimate third parties.** Not all third-party connections are harmful—CDNs and essential services often appear.
- **Compare badge counts across sites and over time** to see how your content blocking settings impact your privacy.


## Best Practices for Effective Badge Interpretation

- Always cross-reference the badge with uBO Scope's popup for detailed lists of allowed, blocked, and stealth-blocked domains.
- Use the badge in conjunction with your content blocking tools rather than as a standalone privacy metric.
- Remember that some network requests may happen outside of the browser’s reported range and won’t be counted.


## Troubleshooting Badge Count Issues

If the badge count seems abnormally high or low, consider:

- Ensuring uBO Scope is correctly installed and has the required permissions (e.g., `webRequest`).
- Checking if other browser extensions or network settings interfere with request reporting.
- Confirming you are looking at the active tab that has loaded a webpage with network activity.
- Reloading the tab to refresh network data.

## Summary

The toolbar badge in uBO Scope distills complex network activity into a simple metric: the total distinct third-party remote servers contacted by the current tab. This empowers you to gauge the strength of your privacy defenses instantly. Understanding what the badge counts — and what it omits — enables smarter, more informed decisions about privacy and content blocking.
