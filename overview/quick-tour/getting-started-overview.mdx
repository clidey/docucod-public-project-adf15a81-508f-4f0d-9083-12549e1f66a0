## Installing uBO Scope

Before exploring the features, first install uBO Scope in your preferred browser:

- **For Chromium-based browsers** (Google Chrome, Edge, Brave):
  Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ubo-scope/bbdpgcaljkaaigfcomhidmneffjjjfgp).

- **For Firefox:**
  Install from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/).

Installation is straightforward; once added, uBO Scope integrates into your browser toolbar with an icon.

<Note>
Ensure your browser version supports manifest version 3 extensions and webRequest API as uBO Scope leverages these technologies for accurate connection monitoring.
</Note>

## Opening the Popup to See Your Network Connection Footprint

After installation, click the uBO Scope toolbar icon to reveal the popup panel. This panel is your window into all remote third-party server connections your current tab has attempted or successfully made.

### What You See Immediately

- **Badge Count:** A number displayed on the extension icon indicating how many distinct third-party domains your browser connected to on the active tab. A lower number signals fewer third-party connections, usually indicating better privacy.

- **Popup Header:** Displays the domain of the current tab, helping you verify that you are looking at the right data.

- **Domain Lists:** Three categorized sections report domains based on the network request outcomes:
  - **Not Blocked:** Domains from which connections were allowed.
  - **Stealth-Blocked:** Domains where connections were redirected or silently blocked.
  - **Blocked:** Domains where connections were explicitly blocked or failed.

Each domain entry includes the domain name and the count of attempted connections.

## Understanding the Badge Count and Domain Listings

The badge count is key to quickly assessing your browsing privacy state on the current tab:

- **Meaning:** The count equals the number of unique third-party domains your browser successfully reached.
- **Significance:** A lower value means fewer third-party remote servers accessed, which usually corresponds to a higher degree of privacy.

The domain lists break down the badge count further, showing which connections were allowed, stealth-blocked, or blocked.

<Info>
Not all third-party servers are inherently bad; some are legitimate services like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). However, spotting unexpected or numerous third-party domains is often a sign of tracking or advertising activity.
</Info>

<Warning>
The badge count is not a block count. It counts successful third-party connections, not how many requests were blocked by a content blocker.
</Warning>

## Practical Tips for First-Time Users

- Refresh your tab or navigate different websites and open the popup again to see how the badge count and domain lists change dynamically.
- Use this data to spot unusual or suspicious third-party domains that might warrant further blocking or investigation.
- Remember that the extension works independently of any content blocker you may have; it reflects actual network activity reported by the browser.

<Check>
If no data appears or the badge count is empty, verify that you have navigated to a webpage and that the extension is properly installed and enabled.
</Check>

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **No Badge Number or Empty Popup:** Could indicate the tab has no remote connections or the extension’s permissions are restricted.
- **Outdated Browser Version:** Browsers older than those supporting manifest v3 or with limited webRequest API access may not report data correctly.

For detailed troubleshooting guidance, consult [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/getting-using/troubleshooting).
